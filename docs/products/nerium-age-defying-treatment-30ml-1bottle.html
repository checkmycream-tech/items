    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and she said that my face looked great!</li>
            <li>but I can tell you that everyone I know that has used it has LOVED it!!</li>
            <li>Nerium AD is a priceless commodity and should not be sold under $100.00 USD because it is not a discounted merchandise price.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for two and my best friend</li>
            <li>and I work with a lot of Make up Artists who know what is the latestest and best product out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Awesome product will continue to get it.</li>
            <li>I do suggest taking before and after pictures because that would be a the best way to judge for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d be very happy you tried it for yourself.  </li>
            <li>she was still trying to tell me how wonderful the cream was and that I hadn&#x27;t given it a chance.  </li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>there are hundreds of brand partners on FB all of whom will give you excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>WONDERFUL RESULTS!</li>
            <li>It will take 69-90 days to see the best results.</li>
            <li>I heard someone use the word &#x27; earthy&#x27;, and that is the best way to describe the smell.</li>
            <li>This couple put on a full-court show with impressive reviews, testimonials, and photos.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and purchased a bottle, not because I was that impressed with the product</li>
            <li>I buy it online where the price is the best!</li>
            <li>Best of luck!!!</li>
            <li>That was an awesome surprise!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say that it is a wonderful product as yet.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>No, the smell would be the best thing ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in that case, you may be best off paying for high-priced laser treatments at a respected skin specialty clinic....</li>
            <li>, I have been impressed!</li>
            <li>NERIUM lovers, DO NOT message me telling me how wonderful they are and</li>
            <li>But my friends that have been using it look great!!</li>
            <li>and then my face started breaking out, so I quit using the product and have been happy ever since!</li>
            <li>lol!  </li>
            <li>I was very, very impressed with what I saw.</li>

            <li>Also I noticed throughout the day my faces keeps its beautiful glow that Nerium has given me.</li>
            <li>This may not be the perfect solution for everyone... but it for sure is for me!</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>I am SO happy I didn&#x27;t fall into the scheme of buying this product and losing just about $100.</li>
            <li>and she can&#x27;t stop raving about how great Nerium is.</li>
            <li>We have both seen great results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so happy that Nerium AD works great for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost four months and my friends and family are so happy for me.  </li>
            <li>I am happy.  </li>
            <li>I am not a sales person because I don&#x27;t even like sales people lol...</li>
            <li>What I have experienced is the improvement in texture and</li>
            <li>The texture after applying is great.</li>
            <li>One of my friends swears this product gives amazing results, but I didn&#x27;t see any drastic or impressive changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li>My mother in law is still using it and claims that it improved her skin greatly-</li>
            <li>An extremely happy Nerium partner and customer...</li>
            <li>I feel after putting it on feels great.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe how great they look now after about 3 months of using the product.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone else has seen great results.</li>
            <li>On Day 3, in the morning, I experienced dizziness and nausea.</li>
            <li>She looked so great</li>
            <li>She was happy with the results, so I guess that is all that matters.</li>
            <li>and they both look great.</li>
            <li>I am WE&#x27;LL over 50, complexion now Dewey,and smooth!!!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did not stop using this!!  </li>
            <li>this is a VERY effective product.  </li>
            <li>The results were truly amazing!  </li>
            <li>NeriumAD is an amazing product that works wonders, but it does not always happen instantaneously (what does?!).</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING and it WORKS!</li>
            <li>but if I think that another product would better suit them, even if it over the counter, I will always act in their best interest(I use Bioelement during facials).</li>
            <li>Be your own judge!  </li>
            <li>Do your own research!</li>
            <li>Most amazing product on the planet!!!!</li>
            <li>Anyone who says this product does not work is lying, every person I signed up have had remarkable results</li>
            <li>I have had excellent results and that&#x27;s why I chose to be able to offer it.  </li>
            <li>Everything makes me break out, so I have for many years used products with the best ingredients I can find.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I plan on using it till they find something better!</li>
            <li>Tried it for a week,and ended up w couple of huge pimples on my otherwise  flawless skin.</li>
            <li>A good price.</li>
            <li>I have already tried it and loved the results.</li>
            <li>Try this technique with good soap .</li>
            <li>my skin has never looked or felt so good.</li>
            <li>we are having good results, my face spots are getting lighter.</li>
            <li>My face looks really good.</li>
            <li>Heck, if everyone said motor oil was good to drink seems like people would be inclined to drinking it.</li>
            <li>good luck with that\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Good luck to all the ones who decide to invest time and money on this line.</li>
            <li>and now I get paid to share it with my loved ones.</li>
            <li>There are just as good skin care products out there that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am no stranger to spending over $120.00 on good skin care.  </li>
            <li>Loved the Smell, Loved the tingling, and the tightness.</li>
            <li>and I ruined all the good years of my skin.    </li>
            <li>AND YOU ARE KILLING OFF YOUR GOOD SKIN CELLS.    </li>
            <li>I work in the pharma industry (though biologicals), and know good research when I see it.  </li>
            <li>4 pumps on fairly damp skin.</li>
            <li>My friend gave me a bottle of Nerium and since I had not used Obagi for a good month</li>
            <li>There was a difference and all to the good.</li>
            <li>, your face feels so good in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I was told about this product from a friend and was in need of finding a good night cream, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>When I explained to her what it did, she said in fact that it is drying and that I should use a good moisturizer in the morning.  </li>
            <li>she explained to me that the &#x27;company&#x27; extracts the &#x27;good stuff&#x27; from the flower plant and that Nerium has the patent on how to extract it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would say in my experience more people get great results than don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I rarely need foundation make-up and my skin feels great!  </li>
            <li>Whatever the case may be, I think the product is great as it has \\&quot;youthed\\&quot; me :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;ve seen many improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>I love Nerium AD and will never be without it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Nerium!</li>
            <li>$100 is more than my cell phone bill  a month!  </li>
            <li>I love this cream!  </li>
            <li>TreSkinRX is made in the USA, and I have to tell you, I just love it!  </li>
            <li>in my area is outstanding!</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the product!  </li>
            <li>experience with this company has been positive and a wonderful experience I love my product!</li>
            <li>TreskinRX works beautifully with Nerium, the Purifying Cleanser, Toner (for that moist skin needed to apply Nerium) and Day Moisturizer especially work wonderfully with Nerium.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a month and have noticed amazing results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some amazing results in pictures, but, at a closer glance I noticed that some of them look photoshopped and the after pictures appear blurrier than the before pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After just 5 days I could see results and after two weeks it was really amazing the difference Nerium AD has made.  </li>
            <li>I saw the amazing results.  </li>
            <li>i ran into a friend at the grocery store who looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>Will I have amazing results?</li>
            <li>I have seen amazing results on some people</li>
            <li>I have never done multi-level marketing before but the before and after pics and testimonials at the meeting were amazing</li>
            <li>I have seen it work AMAZING on people</li>
            <li>in on the largest organ of your body at your own risk&lt;br /&gt;These reviews are by multi level marketers</li>
            <li>After two more days I started to get compliments from people that I look good.</li>
            <li>I own my own skin care salon &amp; do not \\&quot;stock\\&quot; any products for sale.</li>
            <li>After 14 days I looked in the mirror and honestly believed that I looked 25...</li>
            <li>I was drawn in by the representative&#x27;s own before and after pictures that in my opinion must have been altered or a misrepresentation.</li>
            <li>But I will honestly tell you, give this product a shot.  </li>
            <li>That kind of nonsense.</li>
            <li>I used the product and then decided to join as I am loving my results and want to share with others</li>
            <li>Kind of a mix of sunscreen and syrup.</li>
            <li>while some of my friends had good results, i felt that my skin was tighter then ever showing more wrinkles then ever.</li>
            <li>I believe skin becomes imune to a product that is used for a period of time; however, I am enjoying Nerium at the moment and have seen good results.</li>
            <li>My husband actually liked the smell of the product.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey</li>
            <li>Also, the owner of that site has her own skin care line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost a month now and have been so thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s time efficient and cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I used Nerium and really loved the results,not what I had hoped for, but made my skin look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>I am loving this anti-aging/healing cream.  </li>
            <li>john masters antiaging vitamin c antiaging serum is the best, and is refundable if you get it at whole foods.</li>
            <li>The product I was using and liked was discontinued</li>
            <li>Honestly; I did a lot of research on the company and the product</li>
            <li>Not bad for 75 LOL</li>
            <li>If its too good to be true than it is!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was told nerium was perfect for me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a very strong Oleander smell.</li>
            <li>But far out it is excellent.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help out a friend, plus I was excited about the good reviews and was eager to see results.  </li>
            <li>My own personal results and the results of my clients have also been extremely impressive.  </li>
            <li>Feel free to contact TreSkinRX for more info and please, use my name!</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>sure you take your before/after photo..</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I gave nerium a try, and can&#x27;t wait to see more results...</li>
            <li>and I continue to see more and more reduction in my wrinkles and even the redness in my face.  </li>
            <li>I guess I need to think about it some more.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>My make up was flawless as my crevices disappeared and pores got smaller.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pleased and I signed up as customer.</li>
            <li>$17000.00/mo part time (as she is also a attorney)  as a Top ranking nerium director level driving her company Lexus Bonus car.</li>
            <li>Additionally it did not make me break out like most products.  </li>
            <li>My skin was smoother, and more even toned.</li>
            <li>nerium biotechnology has been able to extract the beneficial parts of this plant and use it.</li>
            <li>For more information see this link:  </li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect any magic dust; read the label - seemed safe.</li>
            <li>I am SO GLAD I DID.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s able to hold moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found someone to give me a sample because I would have been wasting my</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I was hoping it would be more like a cream, but after putting it on it felt more like a mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure this works for some people, but I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li>good for a few months but best to quit after that</li>
            <li>When a friend gave me the Nerium AD to try I was not expecting much change since I was already using a great product</li>
            <li>I was also nervous because I tend to have allergic reactions to many moisturizers and lotions.</li>
            <li>Making sure I hit the areas that I want it to work, the eyes, pores on nose, wrinkles around the mouth and my sagging neck.  </li>
            <li>I cannot pump any more out</li>
            <li>but I am sure there is nerium at the bottom of the bottle.,</li>
            <li>you want to read more, take a look at Wikipedia.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this looks more like weight loss or liposuction that as a result of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the cream for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>and if this was a lie too, I will follow up with the better business bureau and keep you informed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both animal[20] and human[21] studies suggest that dermal application of Nerium oleander extract is safe.</li>
            <li>I am so glad-</li>
            <li>:) I have never done a review before</li>
            <li>and it could really help someone and maybe change their life if it helped them feel ok or even happy to have their picture taken again.</li>
            <li>I received better results than any of the \\&quot;Meaningful Beauty\\&quot; products.  </li>
            <li>Maybe in a couple weeks I&#x27;ll know more.</li>
            <li>If you decide to join make sure you can afford to lose it and lead yourself do not follow anybody in this industry period .&lt;br</li>
            <li>and many others lose and if you sign up as a customer make sure you get the login for your website</li>
            <li>I am sure you would know napalm was working when it ate away at your skin too</li>
            <li>Im sure the dermatology dr.&#x27;s appts would have been even more.</li>
            <li>Therefore as opposed to most men, I try these types of products as well as laser facials etc..</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use MOST products like this because they cause even more irritation / redness.</li>
            <li>Exellent love it i give 5 stars...</li>
            <li>maybe I just need more time.</li>
            <li>After eight (8) weeks of use now, let me tell you...</li>
            <li>my face has changed for the better.  </li>
            <li>I sincerely think it does do something even if minute for everyone.  </li>
            <li>Rogaine is one of the most scientifically backed products for hair loss there is on the market today.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work - It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with it</li>
            <li>Most improvement in dryness, crows feet and sun damage discoloration.  </li>
            <li>This has become my favorite product</li>
            <li>I have to say reading some of these reviews is quite interesting, but they also made me think.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting what people will do to get ahead, but I&#x27;ve done so</li>
            <li>cause what I&#x27;ve been reading is interesting.</li>
            <li>At 69 years of age, I have found that most creams do not do anything visible.  </li>
            <li>That is more than I can say for anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>i was not looking for a product that would streatch out more pores or cause more scarring from breakouts.</li>
            <li>i love Amazon but would no purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>But when it&#x27;s gone, I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li>The redness was impressive since I have a yellow tint to my skin.</li>
            <li>I was SURE nothing was happening.  </li>
            <li>Until I took an after picture 15 days into it:)  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love Creme De La Mer</li>
            <li>I have tried La Mer, La Prairie, and many others that claim they minimize pore size and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how awesome it would be to use for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>It may work for some, and I suspect mostly people that haven&#x27;t taken care of their skin before...</li>
            <li>some people LOVE the smell of AVEDA and some gag.</li>
            <li>While I can see some improvement in my wrinkles, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m all that pleased.  </li>
            <li>i have noticed my skin looks more cleaner, clearer and somewhat brighter.</li>
            <li>Im glad I did.</li>
            <li>results and don&#x27;t be influenced by the encouragement to continue because it will improve with more time.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than the prescription my doctor gave me.</li>
            <li>guarantee if you do not like the product, also if you sign up as a preferred customer you can get the product for free and also take advantage of the 3-UR-FREE program!</li>
            <li>I have used many anti aging products, and they all stop working after a while.  </li>
            <li>I really am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>is pleased with the product or the marketing techniques.</li>
            <li>OK..</li>
            <li>I think I look so much better.</li>
            <li>My crepe paper skin on my chest is almost gone and looks so healthy</li>
            <li>I bought it for breakouts as it is touted as being better than proactive.</li>
            <li>And yes I use Nerium AD and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>kudos to the person who advised everyone to stop whining. : )</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I have been killing my healthy cells</li>
            <li>You can read more about it at [...]  </li>
            <li>Interesting ...</li>
            <li>I have tried Nerium for 30 days and my skin has not become any better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like MLM marketing BUT after using it for one month and not being sure that I was seeing an improvement...</li>
            <li>If she were such an expert you would think that her products would be the best on the market...</li>
            <li>The only thing impressive about Nerium is how they are getting these housewives to be so pushy.</li>
            <li>A friend insisted this would be a product I would love.  </li>
            <li>but some wrinkles:))</li>
            <li>i have been using nerium for 5 wks and  wrinkles around my mouth are getting better.</li>
            <li>I will be using the rest of the bottle on my sun damaged chest :)</li>
            <li>Will use for one more month and if I do not see results, I will discontinue.  </li>
            <li>really LOVE this product and kinda wish they didn&#x27;t sell it through multi-level marketing.</li>
            <li>have had it smell better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After it dries my skin looks way better, but still waiting to see some permanent results.</li>
            <li>Definitely better skincare products on the market.</li>
            <li>Before bed, make sure to apply 4-5 pumps to damp skin and massage in.</li>
            <li>find it interesting people purchased this product through Nerium AD Brand partners but are complaining about it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>is an update from that NERIUM company that everybody seems to love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received FB messages from Amber Olsen who is one of the VP&#x27;s at NERIUM telling me that she will call me and make sure that everything will be taken care of.</li>
            <li>swears it is a company that cares for people and helps people become wealthy through their products.</li>
            <li>It works and the best part is it only takes one product no cleansers and toners night</li>
            <li>Sincerely Cindy Morton-Stuart</li>
            <li>Okay I have read all the reviews</li>
            <li>I love Nerium AD &amp; don&#x27;t mind to share it with friends &amp; family&#x27;s now</li>
            <li>One thing that is so appealing is it is a one step skin care product..</li>
            <li>After using it for 2 days, I started to break out and my lines on my face were more noticeable then before I started it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>will know more later, but after 1 month, I am happy!</li>
            <li>so the thicker serum can be spread evenly and the moisture makes the skin more receptive.  </li>
            <li>She keeps insisting that it is tested and proven safe, yada, yada,</li>
            <li>I would recommend Nerium AD to a friend :)</li>
            <li>Most people i approached to market this seemed turned off by the MLM/Pyramid scheme.</li>
            <li>If the product truly lived up to its claims, it would cost 10 times more.</li>
            <li>and then to top it off</li>
            <li>It gets even better after calling the Nerium phone # listed on my receipt they told me I couldn&#x27;t return the product that I had knowingly purchased because It had to be returned within 30 days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will fade out</li>
            <li>They really love it</li>
            <li>Tried it one more night, thought maybe I just had to get used to it.</li>
            <li>; I was redirected to speak with someone that &#x27;knows&#x27; more than &#x27;I&#x27; on this product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited about getting started today.</li>
            <li>my face was virtually perfect, but as the day went on it became oily, small blemishes would appear, and it just didn&#x27;t look good anymore.</li>
            <li>I also listened to the video instructions saying not to worry if I experienced tingling, claiming that was normal.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see how it looks after 90 days!</li>
            <li>I was pressured from the lady that I was working under more than I was at my full time job!</li>
            <li>It was amazing as to how quickly it worked</li>
            <li>and I think it will take 4-5 months to see the best results on their more aged skin, accoding to my friends who have been using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 3 your free program is an awesome way to get you product for only S&amp;H which is a DEAL!</li>
            <li>there is NO product in the world that is going to be perfect for every single person, that goes for skin care, hair, whatever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But to my surprise, this cream is great so far!</li>
            <li>Been using this on my body acne and in literally 10 days I saw  huge results I love this product it works so well</li>
            <li>Ruttyness is almost now smooth, Face has lots of healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Nerium is nothing more than another MLM selling a cheap snake oil cream run by the King of MLM&#x27;s, Jeff Olsen.  </li>
            <li>They look so great now and have completely stopped wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I received Free product monthly-:)</li>
            <li>But I can honestly tell whoever that is thinking about purchasing this product that it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Going forward, this is what I will be trusting.  </li>
            <li>My skin is really looking good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth, Nerium AD is a fantastic product that has been proven to be the best anti-aging product that addresses so many other issues not just the anti-aging.</li>
            <li>I was able to tell a very remarkable difference in the texture of my skin in less than 1 week.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use-1 step after you wash your face</li>
            <li>One bottle got me through two months, easy.</li>
            <li>And with that being said, I think I will go easy on the amount I use now...</li>
            <li>Our customers are able to earn their product for free, with our 3 ur free program.</li>
            <li>up...fast, easy</li>
            <li>The important thing is to take good before and after pictures so you can really see the difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oleander is a strong poison</li>
            <li>The product works as good as a decent bar of soap .  </li>
            <li>It was sticky and had a strong smell.</li>
            <li>and my face feels so soft and amazing!  </li>
            <li>It looks to me like there are a lot of proven ingredients in their natural more expansive and more effective state.</li>
            <li>My skin texture and tone is even and beautiful, my red blistered looking forehead HAS recovered and is smoother then ever!  </li>
            <li>The astounding \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; pics on the Website are REAL!</li>
            <li>This is the first time EVER that I have had these kind of results from any product...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does work on reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>(I use cetaphil) &amp; I noticed a visible reduction of fine &amp; deeper lines</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering the price and the smell, if I were *that* worried about \\&quot;fine lines and</li>
            <li>Once fine lines seemed deeper.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a decrease in my fine fines and</li>
            <li>I have issues with even tone, fine lines and pore size.</li>
            <li>I have seen the fine lines around my eyes diminish.</li>
            <li>and I was fine.  </li>
            <li>I am aging more quickly than I would like.  </li>
            <li>If you do buy it, and want to return it, be sure to ask for it Quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has changed some of my friends skin quickly &amp; they love it.</li>
            <li>How lucky am I!  </li>
            <li>I would still always get one or two huge cystic pimples one after another.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li>You can get it for a month risk free from a brand partner.</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law gave me a bottle to try for free.</li>
            <li>So, free is free , I&#x27;ll try.</li>
            <li>and they are loving it just as much as I am.</li>
            <li>saying if 3 people bought I could get mine for free.</li>
            <li>But I figured what the hell, samples are free.</li>
            <li>A bit about me: I am 32 (so I really cannot tell you how effective it is for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I dont really enjoy leaving reviews.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, I dont really enjoy leaving reviews.  </li>
            <li>this product - Try it risk free for 30 days through a brand partner website.</li>
            <li>I liked this product so much I became brand partner</li>
            <li>I have had to buy it to see no results, where I did try this product for FREE before deciding to buy it.</li>
            <li>If you do it correctly it goes on smooth as butter</li>
            <li>The representative actually wanted to stop by and take \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos showing the great improvement and to offer me discounts if I gave him a testimonial.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>She wanted to test this product before making it available to patients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, if you want to get free product - buy from a brand partner or preferred customer not through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the product and have seen results.</li>
            <li>Enjoy Nerium or whatever else</li>
            <li>I have seen great results from it especially on my chest area where I had a ton of wrinkles from sun damage.</li>
            <li>Go through a Nerium person and try the product risk free for 30 days.</li>
            <li>If you refer to three of your friends, you get yours for free, so I don&#x27;t know why someone would buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Mine has been fabulous AND Nerium rewards</li>
            <li>I received that same message from NERIUM CEO, Jeff Olsen, as well as a phone call from one of his \\&quot;assistants\\&quot; assuring me Jeff is a \\&quot;great guy\\&quot; and will take care of me.</li>
            <li>You can get it free by signing up as a preferred customer.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t getting free bottles anymore.</li>
            <li>Well ,my real estate wanted to know what i use and soon after many more ladies wanted to know.</li>
            <li>Lots of people on my Facebook sell this and kept posting about how amazing it is and putting up pictures of other people who tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try Nerium AD</li>
            <li>(Nerium Biotechnology - Plant to Plant) extraction process that combines the unique beneficial properties of the Nerium plant and the known beneficial properties of Aloe Vera  </li>
            <li>Maybe at the beginning I was excited to try the product</li>
            <li>I think reading all of the reviews is actually entertaining and funny.</li>
            <li>Was kept cool and out of the light.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll be ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my first 90 days I was able to notice a difference without having to compare pictures.</li>
            <li>best wrinkle cream, however is love as it gives you inner glow that cannot be produced with any facial product.</li>
            <li>So much that I bought another five days worth because I still needed more convincing...</li>
            <li>also used this product for four months, did not notice any significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>First of all I would like to say that I believe most of the posts on here giving this product 5 stars must be the individuals selling the product or they work for the company.  </li>
            <li>I was reluctant to agree to the auto delivery because I wanted to try the product 1st to determine if I liked it enough to order more.  </li>
            <li>However, my skin was dry and flaky for a day or two, but none of the acne like break-outs she had experienced.  </li>
            <li>HAS TO BE CLEAN FROM ALL CHEMICALS!!!!!DON\\&quot;T USE NERIUM DURING THE DAY</li>
            <li>I am on day 29 and my discoloration is gone, redness is gone, texture is super smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any acne for 29 days.  </li>
            <li>I started using it at night like it says, to me it has the smell of rice baby food with a hint of banana pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>(most of the positive ones I suspect are people who sell the product).</li>
            <li>My friend was right!  </li>
            <li>: it was post-facial smooth and calm two days ago.</li>
            <li>My face turned bright red within minutes and it stung.</li>
            <li>I find the reviews interesting because people are either loving it or absolutely, passionately hating it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it can&#x27;t be worth 80</li>
            <li>But Nerium eliminated the steps &amp; cost of using multiple products &amp; I truly loved the results.</li>
            <li>Is it really that phenomenal?</li>
            <li>Guess what , you get the same results from good soap .   </li>
            <li>She set up a website for me (against my better judgement) and when I examined their website, I saw in their documentation for how to have a \\&quot;Real Results</li>
            <li>So you get pissed off people, because you sold them the world and if they only get a good night creme</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product for 30 full days and even took before and after pictures.</li>
            <li>so I was okay to just use the bottle - too much of a hassle trying to deal with the company.</li>
            <li>Overall, I do not feel it is a good value</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a full refund after also paying to return the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this site, I can find so much here and have purchased a ton of merchandise from them.</li>
            <li>How many people really try a product then run to the internet and make a comment</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic and am now a full believer that this product works and works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a true skin care junky</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve attended the Real Result parties in my area with a friend to learn more about the product and</li>
            <li>The odor is not bad.</li>
            <li>That is when you know a product works, when other people comment on how great your skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if I had continued using it at some point I would have stopped breaking out and something wonderful may have happened, but I seriously doubt it.  </li>
            <li>So evidently they assume that I would be reading the fine print on their web site in my spare time.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer and will continue to be.</li>
            <li>Key is to use as designed and not think if you use more or leave it on longer it will work better.</li>
            <li>It has diminished my wrinkles tremendously and my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li>before you make bold statements.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li>The smell and its affect on me pass quickly after it dries.</li>
            <li>and maybe I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones, but this stuff works.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen some people developing mild rashes from the product.</li>
            <li>take it quick man take it.\\</li>
            <li>Who from what I experienced only want fast money.  </li>
            <li>, even at 57 I do not have any wrinkles, so I have never been very interested in \\&quot;age defying\\</li>
            <li>Once crows feet barely noticeable when I smiled became deeper and longer.  </li>
            <li>The product does have a distinct smell to it that is not bad after you get use to it.</li>
            <li>I had great results in less the 30 days.  </li>
            <li>I recently  had a life lift and my skin looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth the $100 dollars and the customer service wasn&#x27;t very nice.</li>
            <li>This works so fast too!!  </li>
            <li>First of all, it smells!</li>
            <li>telling you, if you do break out at first, KEEP USING IT!  </li>
            <li>I would use a face washer with hot water on my face morning and night to keep it clean and apply non oily moisturiser..</li>
            <li>I. It really reduced her age spots and fine lines around her eyes.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and after using the product for 2 months I am seeing a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I have since bought fresh bottles through my neighbor, sent straight from the company, and they were fine.  </li>
            <li>It is ecological, ethical and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>she wants me to attend or some push to try a free sample.  </li>
            <li>smoked for 16 years and started noticing smoker lines about a year ago, I also have smile lines.</li>
            <li>All I can say is it has worked great for myself 46 year old male and my my</li>
            <li>However it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for 60 days with astounding results.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old &amp; have been a licensed, reputable esthetician for 12 years &amp; am also a registered nurse.</li>
            <li>Is it worth $80?</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels in the morning.  </li>
            <li>ummm okay, I kept using it to see if my skin would clear up....</li>
            <li>It has millions of success stories around.  </li>
            <li>and proceeded to laugh at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow... I really love the results around my eyes...</li>
            <li>-- now THAT&#x27;S a product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s worth it, trust me).</li>
            <li>, my husband and my friends notice a difference, my dermatologist sees an improvement in my skin, and that makes it worth it for me.</li>
            <li>If it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Love that the product is all natural.</li>
            <li>I happen to be a big believer in Nerium and honestly, if I were you, I would stop buying it on amazon and go to a brand partner to buy it</li>
            <li>/&gt;a 100 million breaking many direct sales records.</li>
            <li>Trust me its not offensive and once the product is fully absorbed there is no odor.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about a month and was hesitant with price, however the results are worth it</li>
            <li>However the results are seriously worth it.</li>
            <li>Since I love it so much and have had 3 friends order, my next month&#x27;s bottle is FREE !  </li>
            <li>It has gotten to the point where I only hear from her when there is some kind of indoctrination meeting</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars not 5 because of the strong smell and the high price, but then again if it works</li>
            <li>It started working pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The Nerium was very strong the first 3 nights, but after that I barely smelled it.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have anything good to say about Nerium; However, I have tried other products they recommend as \\&quot;best\\&quot; and not seen the results that I have with Nerium.</li>
            <li>looks good when applied at night because it feels like glue on your face so skin is tighter, other than that no noticeable difference</li>
            <li>but you put it on right before bed</li>
            <li>I had one right under my nose, which is still there a month after stopping the cream, two on my temple, and one on my chin.  </li>
            <li>If I so choose to sell it on eBay or anywhere else, that is my right.  </li>
            <li>If you go right on their website you get auto ship for $80mo.</li>
            <li>You must apply it right..</li>
            <li>It worked right away.</li>
            <li>She told me right off to take before pic&#x27;s and after pic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My skin looks somewhat improved, but it may still be too early to give a final comment on this, as I am not yet seeing the remarkable improvements this cream is supposed to give.</li>
            <li>Some people respond more quickly than others depending upon their individual state of health, hydration and nutrition.</li>
            <li>The smell is not that pretty sweet fragrance that most people like but really not a big deal.</li>
            <li>that just because a wonderful \\&quot;new business opportunity\\&quot; tells you that it&#x27;s not MLM or NM doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>noticed the smell at first and it was kind of strong, but after using it for a little over 2 months, I no longer can smell it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many higher priced products and I have not seen this kind of results in such a short time.  </li>
            <li>I have the ability to outsell if not everybody just about everybody in the industry honestly, but I have moral standards to live by and paid back money to brand partners out of my own pocket who could not make it .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did take before pics of my chest but will give it a few more weeks to see if it gets even better.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more and think it is good but not great</li>
            <li>I continue to use a daily mild exfoliating face wash which is what I have to do as my pores get clogged easily.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, in some before and after pictures i have seen the light used to take the pictures is NOT the same so the amazing results one sees is due to the light used to take the pictures NOT to the effect of the product itself.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I notice the improvement in my skin - especially around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 45 days and can really see an improvement!</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try Nerium, and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle about a month ago for the first time.</li>
            <li>My Mom wouldn&#x27;t touch it when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible that it doesn&#x27;t work for some people nothing does.</li>
            <li>even more \\&quot;Angle and Weightman face cream sales at $10,000 a jar\\&quot; and finally, \\&quot;RéVive Intesite Voluminizing Serium at $600 oz\\&quot;</li>
            <li>A bar of good natural soap will last much longer for $5.    </li>
            <li>I have worked many mlm&#x27;s and this one is no different .  </li>
            <li>And yes, oleander is that bushy plant with the pretty flowers growing by the freeway in California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing!  </li>
            <li>indicated that on an equivalent weight basis, doses of an oleander extract with glycosides 10-times in excess of those likely to be administered therapeutically to humans are still safe and without any \\&quot;severe toxicity observed\\&quot;.[17]</li>
            <li>I told him I wasn&#x27;t interested in pyramid schemes, but he insisted I try the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much this costs - I will buy it!  </li>
            <li>which is what convinced me to do the auto ship at first.  </li>
            <li>I got all my investment back and much more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and will give it more time</li>
            <li>Remember the ones at the top make the money while it last</li>
            <li>Funny thing is when she came into my business  </li>
            <li>First of all I am not a Brand Member to this product.  </li>
            <li>Yes I am a brand Partner, but I did my homework first.</li>
            <li>From what I understand it takes at least 3 weeks to see some changes so hopefully it will be great  </li>
            <li>Been using this consistently, and as instructed for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking pretty stressed out</li>
            <li>If you are considering falling for the Nerium  Scam as I did,  read this link about their claims first.  </li>
            <li>My mom was given a bottle to try but she wanted me to try it first.</li>
            <li>First, Nerium did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>They are not as deep, however, as they were, and I am hoping with continued use, I will continue to see more improvement.</li>
            <li>Also, in testing for this product, extensive blood tests were done to make absolutely sure that no oleander was found in the bloodstream of people using this product.</li>
            <li>I actually did try the product and found that it worked even better than it claimed.</li>
            <li>rating changed from 1 to 5 (thanks for the reminder)William Dean!</li>
            <li>They force you into an auto-ship program where they are sending you more of this than you could possibly use in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>FIRST off....</li>
            <li>Am I willing to take a chance?</li>
            <li>I am still interested to see what would happen, but</li>
            <li>way I will be only out the cost of one bottle and don&#x27;t have to hassle with orders coming before I decide if I want to order more.</li>
            <li>I am 26, and starting to see the lines on my fore head getting more and more present without pulling faces.</li>
            <li>I think the only reason people are seeig results is because they are washing their faces more.  </li>
            <li>I calld the company, I was told a higher lever person would call me within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>There is more than enough to try it for over a month</li>
            <li>That only results in more sales for the company and sales person.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any visible results in my first 30 days, but then I took my after picture and compared it to my before picture</li>
            <li>I used this product exactly as instructed and saw no difference whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>all these products have directions, and some of them are pretty out there.</li>
            <li>It caused them to shed layers when I first started using it</li>
            <li>First let me say everyone deserves to make money.</li>
            <li>After the first two weeks of using it, I started getting pimples.</li>
            <li>The first time that I used it, it broke me out.  </li>
            <li>Nerium in their first year did</li>
            <li>/&gt;Virgin coconut oil is much better, for skin and hair and even internally.</li>
            <li>a personal basis, I have to agree with many of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>So if your husband wants a woman with a smelly crusty film on her face, this product is for you!</li>
            <li>I feel like it only continue to get better.</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer was Skinceuticals prior to trying Nerium.</li>
            <li>Also, Nerium gives you a 30-day money back guarantee that you get when you buy from a brand partner, so it&#x27;s much better to find your product that way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;and fax them to cancel auto monthly and don&#x27;t guarantee returns after 30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;days of first order.</li>
            <li>w/my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks - every night - and do not see as drastic difference as they indicate you would within the first week.  </li>
            <li>More than likely competitors paying bloggers to complain.</li>
            <li>guarantee I tried for the first 2 week</li>
            <li>NO, but my family and friends notice a real difference!  </li>
            <li>Felt better in the morning, but went to the doctor who could not understand the sudden dizziness and nausea.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>First and foremost, I have NEVER tried Nerium and NEVER will.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely despise MLM schemes!  </li>
            <li>For $90 - $110 a month, I had better see instant results.  </li>
            <li>Really?!?  </li>
            <li>Overall I do give Nerium AD five stars and hope you will give it a try. :)</li>
            <li>I did break out some at first.  </li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>I just married the man of everyones dreams and thinking of selling it.</li>
            <li>It wasn t a pretty sight.</li>
            <li>I laughed when I read about people having a burning rash after a few days of use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To really remove wrinkles and smooth skin, a combination of Botox injections, Prevage MD in the morning, and occasional RetinA at night is much more effective but also much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nerium is a great skincare product and definitely worth trying...at least for 1 month!  </li>
            <li>Nerium Is an amazing product I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and other parts of my body for 15 months and have had no adverse reactions</li>
            <li>that could not be farther from the truth, I think it smells great, it has a natural smell to it, maybe a little bit like melons/cucumbers).  </li>
            <li>Honestly, it works EXTREMELY well.</li>
            <li>I do however wash my face with clean and clear before i apply this cream.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t cost that much more and the effects would probably be much the same, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how much you love them because that has no bearing on their actions towards those of us who have had medical attention because of their products.</li>
            <li>I was mostly interested in improving the texture of my skin and eliminating the visibility of my large pores (as well as decreasing emerging lines).</li>
            <li>There are so many negative reviews and so many positive</li>
            <li>Support locally and help a real family building a real business put food on their table, not someone trying to take your money without working for it!!!!</li>
            <li>It came with a warning from the person who sold it that it would have a strong reaction at first, including pimples, but that would subside shortly.  </li>
            <li>The positive results are posted by those who sell it.</li>
            <li>There should be something in there that would help most anyone if they are not sensitive to plants where they would have a reaction.</li>
            <li>When the pigeons do buy the product , they usually give it up in three months because they wise up .                    </li>
            <li>I would still like to try the product to see if using the product for the full 30 days and using the complete bottle would make a difference or not.  </li>
            <li>No more acne, skin is bright and vibrant, my forehead lines...GONE!</li>
            <li>Europe we know that pregnant women should not be near this plant!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>People get easily discouraged if they don&#x27;t see instant results!</li>
            <li>and I have to be super conscious of my age / appearance.</li>
            <li>How easy would that be for someone to write a review only to send their customers or people who have asked them about the product to them?</li>
            <li>About the oleander and all of that, I was weary, as I own horses, and if they even get just the smallest taste, less than one leaf, it is over for them...</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 4 stars is the smell isn&#x27;t great and the texture of the cream is also a little too tightening feeling...almost like wearing a mask at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly be reordering if not going on the monthly plan thingy</li>
            <li>And I certainly don&#x27;t believe it lives up to what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>it made my lines look deeper in certain areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the morning, my skin is super soft and smooth,feels very hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Also I use the 4-5 pumps as recommended and my bottle runs out right after the new one arrived.  </li>
            <li>In the morning my skin felt fine, so I washed my face as instructed and applied my daytime cream( I alternate between DermaOrganics and strivectin spf 20).</li>
            <li>I purchased from a salon and used for 30 days and felt it definitely improved the fine lines and coloration.  </li>
            <li>An improvement in my appearance, fine lines and wrinkles, was noticeable after 5 days and dramatically different after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>And guess what that&#x27;s ok other Nerium Brand Partners, because there are still millions of people who can afford it and actually want it and will love it for the price!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes better sales techniques IE no pushiness and no pressure will allow people to be more objective and not expect a face transplant to pacify their uneasiness with being sold so hard in the first place.</li>
            <li>Other than the product making my skin itchy, and my eczema dry patches flaking, I experienced something like a vertigo.  </li>
            <li>Over the last week, I have notice a HUGE improvement in the redness and acne.</li>
            <li>and you aren&#x27;t getting much of a deal, plus you have no idea how you can actually get your product for free or make money sharing it when you buy from these sites.</li>
            <li>Feel free to contact me for further questions - glowonwithyourself@gmail.com thanks.</li>
            <li>She did not say much, except- try it and let me know what you think, she also gave me instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li>I was given a free bottle of Nerium AD by my building owner/designer for me to try for myself because of my experience with several product lines to see what I thought.</li>
            <li>This product actually really works.  </li>
            <li>Party\\&quot; so that others will buy, that they actually instruct you to tell people you have earned a free iPad, Lexus Car Bonus, etc.</li>
            <li>and he sent me straight to a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>and I never really had issues with wrinkles and was utilizing \\&quot;Meaningful</li>
            <li>My skin is much brighter.  </li>
            <li>I became brand partner because NeriumAD really works for me.  </li>
            <li>After reading this article and understanding how the ML&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myself and the team I built in legal shield were lied by Todd Cahill who was our leader and had told us that Nerium ad would come and go and</li>
            <li>Is that hygenic or ethical in any way.</li>
            <li>it was a sample that I never asked for or really wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a real person writing a real review.</li>
            <li>it works really</li>
            <li>Thanks Roberto for sharing...</li>
            <li>In addition to informing me of my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; your custmer service rep Elizabeth continued to tell me that your return policy has a statue of limitation of 30 days and anything beyond that you will not be responsible for.</li>
            <li>Some people, depending how much they like to spend on beauty products and how well it works for them specifically, will find it&#x27;s not for them.  </li>
            <li>People that are convinced it&#x27;s a scam are just really upset from pushy sales tactics and sometimes no results.</li>
            <li>Is the person writing the review real?</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on really well with it.</li>
            <li>I tried this cream for five days because my hairdresser was selling it and really pushing me to try it.  </li>
            <li>I also have much smoother and softer skin.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have much to start with).</li>
            <li>If it was real, doctors would be all over this.</li>
            <li>Botox and Aveda have worked very well to this point.</li>
            <li>I used it for 30 days, took before and after pictures and saw absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone who tries this product won&#x27;t demand more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a whole lot of buzz for no reason, and it&#x27;s getting to the obnoxious point.</li>
            <li>He gave me a whole bottle and asked that I use it.</li>
            <li>If you want to spend a fortune on something that works, try Creme De La Mer --you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, thanks to the blessing of Mediterranean genetics</li>
            <li>After reading reviews and seeing before and after pictures, with much excitement I bought 2 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It isnt an off smell, just unusual.</li>
            <li>and I really can see a difference.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the before and after photos!</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and my skin is very oily and prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>, REALLY?</li>
            <li>product is a botanical with a DISTINCT natural smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much money you spend on skin care products</li>
            <li>For me it really helped my neck and chest area.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely convinced that this is the answer I have been searching for.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>this product was developed by accident by a Dr at MD Anderson for burn patients, a ton of research and $$ has been poured into this product and its worth every dime to purchase it,,I</li>
            <li>I found the product very drying.  </li>
            <li>I also used the product on a raised surgical scar below my bra line and overnight the scar was much flatter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent much more than $110 on \\&quot;skin care product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference until I took the after pic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent lots of money I&#x27;ve tried many products.</li>
            <li>but just think how much do you pay for all the creams you use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells really bad.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen a change in anyone using it..</li>
            <li>If the product really worked do you think they&#x27;d have to promote their product in this way?</li>
            <li>A friend convinced me to give Nerium a REAL try.  </li>
            <li>(nasolabial folds)as well as my pores appearing smaller &amp; more clear &amp; my makeup goes on like silk.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to actually see something actually work!</li>
            <li>A good friend sent me a partial bottle to use to see if I can get results in the 2nd month, so I&#x27;ll keep trying.  </li>
            <li>I found it interesting that so many people either loved or hated Nerium, so I decided to try it for myself and did the before and after pics, as their theory that a lot of people forget what their faces look like in detail from day to day made some sense.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have many lines before, but looked in the mirror at the beginning of week 3 and saw my 24 year old self looking back at me.</li>
            <li>every month people say wow you must be getting BOTOX!!!</li>
            <li>The first shipment did not make it my new place...</li>
            <li>There are 100&#x27;s of products that you can purchase that actually  make your face feel smoother and fresh!</li>
            <li>Not sure why some people have such a chip on their shoulders about the product, but I will continue to use it because it works great for me.</li>
            <li>I am not much of a people person (I have social anxiety) and the nice lady and gentleman who gave me the bottle I am using attend lots of meetings.</li>
            <li>So I did, and for the first time in 35 years my skin is almost perfectly clear.</li>
            <li>First of all, I reviewed the \\&quot;science\\&quot;, which is complete garbage.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is already much more even, my pore size has noticably decreased and I can see a difference in the texture and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Well, I took before and after photos and noticed that my fine lines got worse and the skin on my eyelid drooped more than before.  </li>
            <li>This product has poor to non-existant scientific papers, and certainly none in peer reviewed publications (these are publications where good data are presented...</li>
            <li>While the main ingredient nerium oleander is known to be a toxic plant...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure different people have different result--</li>
            <li>These studies all indicate that administration of Nerium oleander extracts as either a parenteral or topical preparation is safe when doses anticipated for commercial products are applied.[16]</li>
            <li>if you are expecting miracles - be realistic - there is no miracle out there unless you want to go under the knife.</li>
            <li>She turned before she left and let me know that I needed to return it quickly because it was an $80 bottle of her product</li>
            <li>REALISTIC.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for one month as suggested, and the result ( 3rd week ) was puffy, scaly, red skin under my eyes-on top of my cheekbones</li>
            <li>Take a look at the main ingredient, Aloe and the Oleander plant/flower.  </li>
            <li>Well I did the trial which actually was enough for more than five days</li>
            <li>There was nothing on the receipt that indicated there was a particular time frame that the product must be returned within.  </li>
            <li>It all takes time, and at less than $100/month, it is competetive with the more high quality products out there.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>ìg/g which were in the high range of reported levels at autopsy.[13]</li>
            <li>they require a high recruitment rate to survive.</li>
            <li>With all of the promises and the high cost</li>
            <li>the shipping and handling costs are high....</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you give Nerium a try</li>
            <li>I understand the lack of knowledge of certain people, Nerium AD it is not made with  direct sap of the Nerium Oleander plant.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it cleared up my adult acne, started to fade a large sun spot</li>
            <li>The deeper the lines take a little more time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hope you do a little more research before deciding against Rogaine because of those types of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No major reactions like some have had, but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I made a connection with some irritation I had under my nose and on my top lip.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little interesting, smells like Witch-Hazel, and I almost didn&#x27;t continue using it, but now after a week I don&#x27;t notice the smell after 5 minutes of application.  </li>
            <li>I would have given the product 5 stars if it smelled a little better.  </li>
            <li>Cost of nearly $100 month is very high.</li>
            <li>Major League Rip off!!!!</li>
            <li>I am known for my flawless skin and now, I have 4 ugly bumps and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>In the morning I rinse my face off and apply my normal SPF skin protection and makeup.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines are way less, so much so that I can&#x27;t stop staring at my pictures today.  </li>
            <li>Before I bought this product, like any normal person, I was a bit ify.  </li>
            <li>She said the Nerium was exfoliating my clogged pores and the breaking out was normal and would stop soon.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure a few of you whiners either have done Botox</li>
            <li>By the time I used the product and realized I needed to decide whether to continue and receive another bottle or cancel the auto delivery...was about 15 days into using the product...which was really not enough time to determine if the results were worth investing another $100 in another bottle...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write comments normally</li>
            <li>Normally you would have to dig them out with a needle and an extractor.</li>
            <li>but definitely not least.</li>
            <li>She told me that was normal.</li>
            <li>There are soo many great, natural, less expensive products out there that won&#x27;t ruin your skin.</li>
            <li>and I have no hard feelings.</li>
            <li>Just being honest), black female.  </li>
            <li>Half the reviews are positive - especially for people who have used the product for more than a month.</li>
            <li>I was in a lot of pain as I live in Florida and</li>
            <li>:B007NQA77U NeriumAD Night Cream (30 mL)]]I initiate purchase of nerium ad ~ 4 months ago at the request of a friend who was a new brand manager.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend went away to see her mom in New York for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>my skin turned a new leaf.</li>
            <li>However,  I did have an abundance of new age spots and blotches that I did not have before.  </li>
            <li>meanwhile, I moved to another place to live.</li>
            <li>Your March has been sent to your new address.</li>
            <li>Before I could send in the notification to stop the order, a charge appeared on my credit card statement, and a new bottle arrived in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Because I don&#x27;t believe it was a new bottle</li>
            <li>and they send out your new bottle every 30 days on auto ship.</li>
            <li>This company is new and is a multilevel sales operation.  </li>
            <li>Because the 30 money back guarantee is only available through brand partner websites.  </li>
            <li>I have bought 2 bottles of Nerium on Amazon, one was old (had an older label) and one had been overheated and was rancid.  </li>
            <li>So 3 months ago a friend hands me this bottle and say just put it on your face at night,every night and be sure you use a little water!</li>
            <li>And before I close out, let me make it very clear that I am in no way a distributer of this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to Nerium by an old high school friend at my brother&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li>The first morning after I used it my wrinkles on my upper lip were GONE!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have considered carrying because it makes skin care simple</li>
            <li>Since then, under my eyes have completely smoothed out!  </li>
            <li>I bought this cream and used it every night for a month, following the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>In reviewing oleander toxicity Lanford and Boor[15] concluded that, except for children who might be at greater risk, \\&quot;the human mortality associated with oleander ingestion is generally very low, even in cases of moderate intentional consumption (suicide attempts).\\&quot;[15]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally have really clear skin, but I did want to shrink pores.</li>
            <li>I was actually advised to put a layer ofglycerin on first before using the product to improve the results.  </li>
            <li>, however I don&#x27;t have any more break outs than usual.  </li>
            <li>- that&#x27;s way more legit then getting \\&quot;bootlegs\\&quot; on amazon or other such sites.</li>
            <li>, it can and will make you break out at first, lots of products you try do that at first as your skin tightens pushing out impurities and other stuff from your pores.</li>
            <li>I am hyper aware of my skin and its current condition (fluctuates with sun exposure and Obagi usage).</li>
            <li>The Company is laid back, friendly and not pushy whatsoever in the sales approach, they have a terrific product that they want to share with the world.</li>
            <li>Maybe the naysayers just didn&#x27;t give it enough time, maybe they didn&#x27;t take and compare their pictures, but this stuff is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>Waited a week and tried again doing exactly what I did before I got the rash, got up the next morning</li>
            <li>Nerium will allow you to purchase the product use it and return an empty bottle for full credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you see nothing in your 30 days it&#x27;s not going to get much better, its just slow and steady results from there if at all.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that I actually will get auto shipped because I have never been able to use that much shampoo or coffee or whatever as other auto ships</li>
            <li>company only responds to all of the positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>only positive results it&#x27;s taken years off of my face!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have extremely sensitive skin and not had any reaction and have noticed a huge decrease in my pores size and less redness and and brown spots -skin</li>
            <li>overall more even toned and less eye and forehead wrinkles</li>
            <li>until 4 week later everyone told me that I looked bright &amp; younger, my dark spots are gone about 80% &amp; removed my double chin off too !</li>
            <li>Large pores, red and oily.  </li>
            <li>The public is smart.</li>
            <li>and I still have the crows feet, my one and only age spot and large pores.</li>
            <li>One thing I know for certain, is in the U.S., if it&#x27;s expensive, it has to be effective.  </li>
            <li>What I observed on the fifth day was that my face kind of started to look a little rough.  </li>
            <li>a writer and musician my eyes are extremely important to me and any discomfort makes it hard for me to read and besides, who wants to be on stage, in magazines and on television with a disfigured eye?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 30 days my cheeks look almost clear.</li>
            <li>but when I uploaded both pictures side by side, you can clearly see a difference in my crow&#x27;s feet.  </li>
            <li>I already had my internist prescribe an ointment to help clear up this rash.</li>
            <li>Its Clear.  </li>
            <li>I have seen them post pictures of people who clearly have plastic surgery/cosmetic work done</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this, it didn&#x27;t work, and if you see the wording, the reps all start out by saying they \\&quot;can&#x27;t guarantee results\\&quot; to clear themselves of any liability.</li>
            <li>It will clear up and your skin will start to look</li>
            <li>Finally a natural product that gives me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They are still gone and my skin is baby soft and it appears to be helping my rosacea.</li>
            <li>but I will be looking further into Nerium-it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review because the one star review I read was in a nutshell nothing more than an uneducated complaint.</li>
            <li>All the ingredients in NeriumAD are not harsh.</li>
            <li>every parent is warned not to let their kids go near this plant...</li>
            <li>I suffered from adult acne which left a lot of scarring that I was very self conscious about.</li>
            <li>I used the product for 4 days and immediately saw one of the craters near my eyebrow dissipate.</li>
            <li>Opinion - Stay as far away from Nerium and their reps as you can.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>After ~ about 2 to 3 month of using the product according to directions I developed itchy puffy eyes each morning.</li>
            <li>Before I purchased the product, I saw SO many negative reviews about how it doesnt work</li>
            <li>Having reasonable expectations about a product is key.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30s, but I have sun spots near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and my skin sucked.  </li>
            <li>And I use Lush for bath/body.</li>
            <li>I had suffered from adult acne and after it started to go away</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please protect yourselves as customers and order directly from Nerium...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for about 4-5 weeks every night as directed &amp; have not noticed any difference so far.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a month religiously, saw absolutely zero improvement.</li>
            <li>So, just a big \\&quot;EH\\&quot; review from me all-around.. product, price, customer service, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s not a warning label on the product.</li>
            <li>I am the biggest skeptic alive.  </li>
            <li>I applied product like instructed and did not even get near the eye area.</li>
            <li>and I wished I had not put it on my face (near my nose), after doing so.</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li>It sort of has, what I can only describe as a very lightweight cocoon on your face.</li>
            <li>I have to warn anyone who is sensitive to skin products to NOT use this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20s</li>
            <li>on complete garbage.</li>
            <li>well my son said it all, Wow Mom.</li>
            <li>Being a California beach girl in my early years doesn&#x27;t help or now being in Florida.  </li>
            <li>I disagree thus far</li>
            <li>It is still early but I am already noticing a difference.</li>
            <li>But if you really want to make money become a brand partner with Nerium International.</li>
            <li>I was told that I would look like a young man again.</li>
            <li>After another month-he has deep lines around his eyes, acne scars and some brown spots-I looked at his face really closely as well and couldn&#x27;t see even a minute difference-</li>
            <li>NO cream is capable of doing that, only plastic surgery can.</li>
            <li>My hubsan commented on how my cheeks look like that of a 21 yr old.</li>
            <li>The Nerium night cream has made my skin radiant, clear and soft.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on this... $100 buck for one ounce??</li>
            <li>am 67 years old</li>
            <li>I still use Nerium some of the time, but the results seemed to only give me &#x27;so much&#x27; and that was it.</li>
            <li>Now my husband uses it and my 21 year old has started as she had breakouts.</li>
            <li>The first couple of months I could see a minor difference but nothing after that.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to give this product a chance given the cult like following of this product.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to Nerium AD by an old friend of 30 years.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;It&#x27;s all natural, hypoallergenic etc.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, Rosacea, or react to face creams with a scent then proceed with caution.</li>
            <li>I used it for about 2 months with no problems and then one morning I wake up with a rash around my eyes and nearly swollen shut.</li>
            <li>and she said how old are you ?</li>
            <li>and there is absolute &#x27;ZERO&#x27; evidence to back up there claims and their pseudo science!  </li>
            <li>And that the independant clinical doctors who found a real result in Rogain are all crazy and/or paid off and everyone who uses rogaine is brainwashed by good marketing?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far more expensive than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>So, I started back with Nerium night and day cream and within a few days my skin looked and felt much better.....</li>
            <li>Maybe some of them are, but I know from my own personal experience that I had a negative reaction.</li>
            <li>I believe that Nerium International should prohibited the sale of the product in eBay and other cheap internet malls.    </li>
            <li>I like my face to feel clean and smooth before bed and this just feels uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Because I can tell you, and swear on everyone I love, that I have seen dramatic and real results.  </li>
            <li>I met a friendly lady in a department store a few days ago.</li>
            <li>The researchers concluded that PBI-05204 was \\&quot;well tolerated up to the 10.2 mg extract/day dosage\\&quot; with few significant side effectsand with evidence of tumor response.[19]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how everything looks in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Not a HUGE deal because while I wasn&#x27;t seeing significant results, my make-up was going on well</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and have faithfully moisturized my face daily since high school.  </li>
            <li>When i applied it, it felt very dry like a face mask and in the morning my skin felt even more dry with tiny wrinkles under my eyes</li>
            <li>i believe for some people the effects could be profound...</li>
            <li>I used three full bottles of this product (BTW, following the bottle&#x27;s application instructions each bottle lasted me roughly 45 days).  </li>
            <li>have to say that the ingredient list did not have anything particularly objectionable, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>The main reason I wanted it was to remove the red from my face.  </li>
            <li>months, $300.00 later it does NOT work, made me look older as it dryed and pulled my skin together</li>
            <li>She also developed a major skin irritation that hasn&#x27;t gone away</li>
            <li>In the first week I saw smoother and firmer skin, in the second week I felt that my skin was much softer, and saw a reduction in the dark spots I have on my jaw line from picking pimples in my teens and early 20s.</li>
            <li>My crows feet are improving &amp; the huge pores on my nose are getting smaller and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t care as long as they continue to offer the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can certainly tell you that I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the redness and an overall tightening of my skin (especially around my jaw line).</li>
            <li>Nerium is sold exclusively by independent brand partners so if you bought on Amazon.com you bought from someone who will lose the right to sell the product in the future and may or may not be ACTUAL Nerium AD.  </li>
            <li>My skin does get a little taut once I first apply but that is totally a normal part of using the product...</li>
            <li>From the beginning it was hard to ignore the stinky strong smell, but I wanted to give the product a chance.  </li>
            <li>It is a new container, as I never opened the second one until this week.</li>
            <li>I tried to change to new address on their site...then cancelled the 2nd shipment...</li>
            <li>At least this lesson is teaching me to do more research next time I hear of a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I bowed out after I checked this product out including the ingridients-one of which was oleander which is very toxic if taken internally and is a known skin irritant if applied externally.</li>
            <li>If you want major changes see the Plastic surgeon.  </li>
            <li>Do I have friends/ family who are not interested- absolutely, but I am not going to harass them about it!</li>
            <li>There is no other product that comes close.</li>
            <li>I used it for one more night only to wake up with three more deep, extremely painful, pimples in the strangest places.  </li>
            <li>I had used that line in my mid 30&#x27;s (the product line starts with the letter O) with great results but had not previously used Retin A with it (which I was supposed to do) because I was afraid of going through the initial phase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;ToxicityNerium oleander has historically been considered a poisonous plant based on a number of its compounds that may exhibit toxicity, especially to animals, when consumed in high amounts.</li>
            <li>Like I said before I have seen this work amazingly on some people but for some reason I could no longer use it which it made it difficult to sell.</li>
            <li>I am a 63 year old male and am amazed at the results of this product.</li>
            <li>So, I was pleasantly surprised when this product actually did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>Apparently it works for some women and not for others.  </li>
            <li>Apparently I was mistaken.</li>
            <li>Red bumps forming on my eyelids near the outer edges.</li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle of the Nerium AD and after 7 days I really didn&#x27;t see a differents, not really after 14 days, but when I got around the 21 day mark...</li>
            <li>So far I am seeing results similar to Retin-A without the irritation, peeling and redness.</li>
            <li>I am a 61 year old male using Nerium for six months.</li>
            <li>and I think I paid way too much for it to be partially used.  </li>
            <li>Please FB me as my next step is a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT to show NERIUM that they can&#x27;t just make people go away.</li>
            <li>But because I was SO skeptical about this product before I bought it, I just had to let people know that it is truly effective.  </li>
            <li>But because I was SO skeptical about this product before I bought it, I just had to let people know that it is truly effective.  </li>
            <li>It felt kind of uncomfortable on, even with water on my face before applying this, the cream is meant to be washed off by the morning, so it feels like this film on my face.</li>
            <li>This cream was drawing moisture out of the layers of my skin leaving behind more and deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a reason to not spend the money on one more product that made false promises.  </li>
            <li>Importantly, it says it is a mixture of Aloe and the other active ingredient.  </li>
            <li>The fact that some people love it or hate it is easily interpreted.</li>
            <li>Nerium AD also makes my skin feel a little dry right after application, however that feeling also goes away after 5 minutes of application and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, Nerium&#x27;s auto-order policy did not allow enough time for me to feel confident enough to order another bottle via their auto delivery system which automatically charges my charge card for another bottle before I am ready.</li>
            <li>I wonder how many of the negative blogs are really people who are unsatisfied or rather professional bloggers saying negative things?</li>
            <li>If you want to prevent wrinkles or reduce fine lines this may work for you, however, it is not effective on deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I love the product and have been using it for two months with dramatic results.</li>
            <li>My neighbor who sells Nerium said it must have been left in a hot car or something, it was dark brown and smelled rotten.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 45); it feels smoother, fine lines are less noticeable, and the dark spots on my face, hands and chest appear lighter.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin and was kind of afraid to try the product.  </li>
            <li>Will she charge the new victim $80 for this used bottle of toxic Oleander stinkfest?  </li>
            <li>While the odor is unpleasant at first, it seems to have this cumulative effect that the more you use it, the worse it smells to the point of becoming unusable.</li>
            <li>We will see what the next few months bring but right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard great reviews from several people I know and only one bad one, so I decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, other people did including two relatives who gently suggested that I try a different eye cream for my crow&#x27;s feet.  </li>
            <li>creams day creams, eye creams to buy just one simple bottle and much cheaper than all the other combinations.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it is worth it for me to have to take a Xanax to go to a meeting or, God forbid, pitch the product to a group of people.</li>
            <li>We are talking heavy makeup for the first time in my life after that ordeal and now almost no makeup.  </li>
            <li>I am getting small laugh lines</li>
            <li>I see that lots of people on here have complained about the smell, but it&#x27;s honestly not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>It feels tight on your skin when you first put it on, almost like a facial mask from years ago.  </li>
            <li>you think if Mary Kay or Avon or anyone else introduced a product that WORKED and had a particular distinctive natural smell they would be crying about it..</li>
            <li>Most people always post negative reviews and not positive ones its human nature.</li>
            <li>It was a little drying for me when I first started, so the sponsor I purchased from suggested only using 1-2 pumps vs. the recommended 4-5.</li>
            <li>had me going to several doctors in different cities over the past few months and created a lump ON my right lid as well as a lump UNDER my right lid, which is still there.</li>
            <li>The smell was not repulsive but a bit too strong for my taste and it felt a little drying, but this feeling left along with the smell in about half an hour.</li>
            <li>study in which a proprietary, concentrated extract of Nerium oleander (containing oleandrin and other cardiac glycosides) was administered orally to humans for the first time was recently concluded.[19]</li>
            <li>After first month he have seen no improvement and was told he was using it incorrectly-according to \\&quot;brand partner\\&quot; you are supposed to wet your face and apply it to the wet face(as</li>
            <li>This product might work well for naturally oily skin, but normally dry skin doesn&#x27;t benefit from this formula and is actually worsened.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is very sticky and smelly and leaves my skin feeling tight.</li>
            <li>His fine lines are decreased and softened dramatically.  </li>
            <li>Well, when I&#x27;ve tried other new products, I noticed an immediate difference in my skin the very next day.</li>
            <li>All I know is that is their business (good or bad) and</li>
            <li>However all my life i have had acne problems, skin scaring and now at late middle age i was really looking old.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> and she said that my face looked great!</li>
            <li> but I can tell you that everyone I know that has used it has LOVED it!!</li>
            <li> Nerium AD is a priceless commodity and should not be sold under $100.00 USD because it is not a discounted merchandise price.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for two and my best friend</li>
            <li> and I work with a lot of Make up Artists who know what is the latestest and best product out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Awesome product will continue to get it.</li>
            <li> I do suggest taking before and after pictures because that would be a the best way to judge for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d be very happy you tried it for yourself.  </li>
            <li> she was still trying to tell me how wonderful the cream was and that I hadn&#x27;t given it a chance.  </li>
            <li> Awesome!</li>
            <li> there are hundreds of brand partners on FB all of whom will give you excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li> WONDERFUL RESULTS!</li>
            <li> It will take 69-90 days to see the best results.</li>
            <li> I heard someone use the word &#x27; earthy&#x27;, and that is the best way to describe the smell.</li>
            <li> This couple put on a full-court show with impressive reviews, testimonials, and photos.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased a bottle, not because I was that impressed with the product</li>
            <li> I buy it online where the price is the best!</li>
            <li> Best of luck!!!</li>
            <li> That was an awesome surprise!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say that it is a wonderful product as yet.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> No, the smell would be the best thing ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in that case, you may be best off paying for high-priced laser treatments at a respected skin specialty clinic....</li>
            <li> , I have been impressed!</li>
            <li> NERIUM lovers, DO NOT message me telling me how wonderful they are and</li>
            <li> But my friends that have been using it look great!!</li>
            <li> and then my face started breaking out, so I quit using the product and have been happy ever since!</li>

            <li> Also I noticed throughout the day my faces keeps its beautiful glow that Nerium has given me.</li>
            <li> This may not be the perfect solution for everyone... but it for sure is for me!</li>
            <li> Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I am SO happy I didn&#x27;t fall into the scheme of buying this product and losing just about $100.</li>
            <li> and she can&#x27;t stop raving about how great Nerium is.</li>
            <li> We have both seen great results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so happy that Nerium AD works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost four months and my friends and family are so happy for me.  </li>
            <li> I am happy.  </li>
            <li> I am not a sales person because I don&#x27;t even like sales people lol...</li>
            <li> What I have experienced is the improvement in texture and</li>
            <li> The texture after applying is great.</li>
            <li> One of my friends swears this product gives amazing results, but I didn&#x27;t see any drastic or impressive changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li> My mother in law is still using it and claims that it improved her skin greatly-</li>
            <li> An extremely happy Nerium partner and customer...</li>
            <li> I feel after putting it on feels great.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe how great they look now after about 3 months of using the product.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone else has seen great results.</li>
            <li> On Day 3, in the morning, I experienced dizziness and nausea.</li>
            <li> She looked so great</li>
            <li> She was happy with the results, so I guess that is all that matters.</li>
            <li> and they both look great.</li>
            <li> I am WE&#x27;LL over 50, complexion now Dewey,and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did not stop using this!!  </li>
            <li> this is a VERY effective product.  </li>
            <li> The results were truly amazing!  </li>
            <li> NeriumAD is an amazing product that works wonders, but it does not always happen instantaneously (what does?!).</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING and it WORKS!</li>
            <li> but if I think that another product would better suit them, even if it over the counter, I will always act in their best interest(I use Bioelement during facials).</li>
            <li> Be your own judge!  </li>
            <li> Do your own research!</li>
            <li> Most amazing product on the planet!!!!</li>
            <li> Anyone who says this product does not work is lying, every person I signed up have had remarkable results</li>
            <li> I have had excellent results and that&#x27;s why I chose to be able to offer it.  </li>
            <li> Everything makes me break out, so I have for many years used products with the best ingredients I can find.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I plan on using it till they find something better!</li>
            <li> Tried it for a week,and ended up w couple of huge pimples on my otherwise  flawless skin.</li>
            <li> A good price.</li>
            <li> I have already tried it and loved the results.</li>
            <li> Try this technique with good soap .</li>
            <li> my skin has never looked or felt so good.</li>
            <li> we are having good results, my face spots are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> My face looks really good.</li>
            <li> Heck, if everyone said motor oil was good to drink seems like people would be inclined to drinking it.</li>
            <li> good luck with that\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Good luck to all the ones who decide to invest time and money on this line.</li>
            <li> and now I get paid to share it with my loved ones.</li>
            <li> There are just as good skin care products out there that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am no stranger to spending over $120.00 on good skin care.  </li>
            <li> Loved the Smell, Loved the tingling, and the tightness.</li>
            <li> and I ruined all the good years of my skin.    </li>
            <li> AND YOU ARE KILLING OFF YOUR GOOD SKIN CELLS.    </li>
            <li> I work in the pharma industry (though biologicals), and know good research when I see it.  </li>
            <li> 4 pumps on fairly damp skin.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me a bottle of Nerium and since I had not used Obagi for a good month</li>
            <li> There was a difference and all to the good.</li>
            <li> , your face feels so good in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I was told about this product from a friend and was in need of finding a good night cream, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> When I explained to her what it did, she said in fact that it is drying and that I should use a good moisturizer in the morning.  </li>
            <li> she explained to me that the &#x27;company&#x27; extracts the &#x27;good stuff&#x27; from the flower plant and that Nerium has the patent on how to extract it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would say in my experience more people get great results than don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I rarely need foundation make-up and my skin feels great!  </li>
            <li> Whatever the case may be, I think the product is great as it has \\&quot;youthed\\&quot; me :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;ve seen many improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Nerium AD and will never be without it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nerium!</li>
            <li> $100 is more than my cell phone bill  a month!  </li>
            <li> I love this cream!  </li>
            <li> TreSkinRX is made in the USA, and I have to tell you, I just love it!  </li>
            <li> in my area is outstanding!</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with the product!  </li>
            <li> experience with this company has been positive and a wonderful experience I love my product!</li>
            <li> TreskinRX works beautifully with Nerium, the Purifying Cleanser, Toner (for that moist skin needed to apply Nerium) and Day Moisturizer especially work wonderfully with Nerium.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and have noticed amazing results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some amazing results in pictures, but, at a closer glance I noticed that some of them look photoshopped and the after pictures appear blurrier than the before pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After just 5 days I could see results and after two weeks it was really amazing the difference Nerium AD has made.  </li>
            <li> I saw the amazing results.  </li>
            <li> i ran into a friend at the grocery store who looked amazing.  </li>
            <li> Will I have amazing results?</li>
            <li> I have seen amazing results on some people</li>
            <li> I have never done multi-level marketing before but the before and after pics and testimonials at the meeting were amazing</li>
            <li> I have seen it work AMAZING on people</li>
            <li> in on the largest organ of your body at your own risk&lt;br /&gt;These reviews are by multi level marketers</li>
            <li> After two more days I started to get compliments from people that I look good.</li>
            <li> I own my own skin care salon &amp; do not \\&quot;stock\\&quot; any products for sale.</li>
            <li> After 14 days I looked in the mirror and honestly believed that I looked 25...</li>
            <li> I was drawn in by the representative&#x27;s own before and after pictures that in my opinion must have been altered or a misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> But I will honestly tell you, give this product a shot.  </li>
            <li> That kind of nonsense.</li>
            <li> I used the product and then decided to join as I am loving my results and want to share with others</li>
            <li> Kind of a mix of sunscreen and syrup.</li>
            <li> while some of my friends had good results, i felt that my skin was tighter then ever showing more wrinkles then ever.</li>
            <li> I believe skin becomes imune to a product that is used for a period of time; however, I am enjoying Nerium at the moment and have seen good results.</li>
            <li> My husband actually liked the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey</li>
            <li> Also, the owner of that site has her own skin care line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost a month now and have been so thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s time efficient and cost effective.  </li>
            <li> I used Nerium and really loved the results,not what I had hoped for, but made my skin look and feel better.  </li>
            <li> I am loving this anti-aging/healing cream.  </li>
            <li> john masters antiaging vitamin c antiaging serum is the best, and is refundable if you get it at whole foods.</li>
            <li> The product I was using and liked was discontinued</li>
            <li> Honestly; I did a lot of research on the company and the product</li>
            <li> Not bad for 75 LOL</li>
            <li> If its too good to be true than it is!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was told nerium was perfect for me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a very strong Oleander smell.</li>
            <li> But far out it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help out a friend, plus I was excited about the good reviews and was eager to see results.  </li>
            <li> My own personal results and the results of my clients have also been extremely impressive.  </li>
            <li> Feel free to contact TreSkinRX for more info and please, use my name!</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> sure you take your before/after photo..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I gave nerium a try, and can&#x27;t wait to see more results...</li>
            <li> and I continue to see more and more reduction in my wrinkles and even the redness in my face.  </li>
            <li> I guess I need to think about it some more.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li> My make up was flawless as my crevices disappeared and pores got smaller.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pleased and I signed up as customer.</li>
            <li> $17000.00/mo part time (as she is also a attorney)  as a Top ranking nerium director level driving her company Lexus Bonus car.</li>
            <li> Additionally it did not make me break out like most products.  </li>
            <li> My skin was smoother, and more even toned.</li>
            <li> nerium biotechnology has been able to extract the beneficial parts of this plant and use it.</li>
            <li> For more information see this link:  </li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect any magic dust; read the label - seemed safe.</li>
            <li> I am SO GLAD I DID.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s able to hold moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found someone to give me a sample because I would have been wasting my</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I was hoping it would be more like a cream, but after putting it on it felt more like a mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this works for some people, but I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li> good for a few months but best to quit after that</li>
            <li> When a friend gave me the Nerium AD to try I was not expecting much change since I was already using a great product</li>
            <li> I was also nervous because I tend to have allergic reactions to many moisturizers and lotions.</li>
            <li> Making sure I hit the areas that I want it to work, the eyes, pores on nose, wrinkles around the mouth and my sagging neck.  </li>
            <li> I cannot pump any more out</li>
            <li> but I am sure there is nerium at the bottom of the bottle.,</li>
            <li> you want to read more, take a look at Wikipedia.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this looks more like weight loss or liposuction that as a result of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the cream for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> and if this was a lie too, I will follow up with the better business bureau and keep you informed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both animal[20] and human[21] studies suggest that dermal application of Nerium oleander extract is safe.</li>
            <li> I am so glad-</li>
            <li> :) I have never done a review before</li>
            <li> and it could really help someone and maybe change their life if it helped them feel ok or even happy to have their picture taken again.</li>
            <li> I received better results than any of the \\&quot;Meaningful Beauty\\&quot; products.  </li>
            <li> Maybe in a couple weeks I&#x27;ll know more.</li>
            <li> If you decide to join make sure you can afford to lose it and lead yourself do not follow anybody in this industry period .&lt;br</li>
            <li> and many others lose and if you sign up as a customer make sure you get the login for your website</li>
            <li> I am sure you would know napalm was working when it ate away at your skin too</li>
            <li> Im sure the dermatology dr.&#x27;s appts would have been even more.</li>
            <li> Therefore as opposed to most men, I try these types of products as well as laser facials etc..</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use MOST products like this because they cause even more irritation / redness.</li>
            <li> Exellent love it i give 5 stars...</li>
            <li> maybe I just need more time.</li>
            <li> After eight (8) weeks of use now, let me tell you...</li>
            <li> my face has changed for the better.  </li>
            <li> I sincerely think it does do something even if minute for everyone.  </li>
            <li> Rogaine is one of the most scientifically backed products for hair loss there is on the market today.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work - It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with it</li>
            <li> Most improvement in dryness, crows feet and sun damage discoloration.  </li>
            <li> This has become my favorite product</li>
            <li> I have to say reading some of these reviews is quite interesting, but they also made me think.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting what people will do to get ahead, but I&#x27;ve done so</li>
            <li> cause what I&#x27;ve been reading is interesting.</li>
            <li> At 69 years of age, I have found that most creams do not do anything visible.  </li>
            <li> That is more than I can say for anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> i was not looking for a product that would streatch out more pores or cause more scarring from breakouts.</li>
            <li> i love Amazon but would no purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> But when it&#x27;s gone, I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> The redness was impressive since I have a yellow tint to my skin.</li>
            <li> I was SURE nothing was happening.  </li>
            <li> Until I took an after picture 15 days into it:)  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love Creme De La Mer</li>
            <li> I have tried La Mer, La Prairie, and many others that claim they minimize pore size and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how awesome it would be to use for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> It may work for some, and I suspect mostly people that haven&#x27;t taken care of their skin before...</li>
            <li> some people LOVE the smell of AVEDA and some gag.</li>
            <li> While I can see some improvement in my wrinkles, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m all that pleased.  </li>
            <li> i have noticed my skin looks more cleaner, clearer and somewhat brighter.</li>
            <li> Im glad I did.</li>
            <li> results and don&#x27;t be influenced by the encouragement to continue because it will improve with more time.  </li>
            <li> This product works better than the prescription my doctor gave me.</li>
            <li> guarantee if you do not like the product, also if you sign up as a preferred customer you can get the product for free and also take advantage of the 3-UR-FREE program!</li>
            <li> I have used many anti aging products, and they all stop working after a while.  </li>
            <li> I really am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> is pleased with the product or the marketing techniques.</li>
            <li> OK..</li>
            <li> I think I look so much better.</li>
            <li> My crepe paper skin on my chest is almost gone and looks so healthy</li>
            <li> I bought it for breakouts as it is touted as being better than proactive.</li>
            <li> And yes I use Nerium AD and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kudos to the person who advised everyone to stop whining. : )</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have been killing my healthy cells</li>
            <li> You can read more about it at [...]  </li>
            <li> Interesting ...</li>
            <li> I have tried Nerium for 30 days and my skin has not become any better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like MLM marketing BUT after using it for one month and not being sure that I was seeing an improvement...</li>
            <li> If she were such an expert you would think that her products would be the best on the market...</li>
            <li> The only thing impressive about Nerium is how they are getting these housewives to be so pushy.</li>
            <li> A friend insisted this would be a product I would love.  </li>
            <li> but some wrinkles:))</li>
            <li> i have been using nerium for 5 wks and  wrinkles around my mouth are getting better.</li>
            <li> I will be using the rest of the bottle on my sun damaged chest :)</li>
            <li> Will use for one more month and if I do not see results, I will discontinue.  </li>
            <li> really LOVE this product and kinda wish they didn&#x27;t sell it through multi-level marketing.</li>
            <li> have had it smell better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> After it dries my skin looks way better, but still waiting to see some permanent results.</li>
            <li> Definitely better skincare products on the market.</li>
            <li> Before bed, make sure to apply 4-5 pumps to damp skin and massage in.</li>
            <li> find it interesting people purchased this product through Nerium AD Brand partners but are complaining about it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> is an update from that NERIUM company that everybody seems to love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received FB messages from Amber Olsen who is one of the VP&#x27;s at NERIUM telling me that she will call me and make sure that everything will be taken care of.</li>
            <li> swears it is a company that cares for people and helps people become wealthy through their products.</li>
            <li> It works and the best part is it only takes one product no cleansers and toners night</li>
            <li> Sincerely Cindy Morton-Stuart</li>
            <li> Okay I have read all the reviews</li>
            <li> I love Nerium AD &amp; don&#x27;t mind to share it with friends &amp; family&#x27;s now</li>
            <li> One thing that is so appealing is it is a one step skin care product..</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 days, I started to break out and my lines on my face were more noticeable then before I started it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> will know more later, but after 1 month, I am happy!</li>
            <li> so the thicker serum can be spread evenly and the moisture makes the skin more receptive.  </li>
            <li> She keeps insisting that it is tested and proven safe, yada, yada,</li>
            <li> I would recommend Nerium AD to a friend :)</li>
            <li> Most people i approached to market this seemed turned off by the MLM/Pyramid scheme.</li>
            <li> If the product truly lived up to its claims, it would cost 10 times more.</li>
            <li> and then to top it off</li>
            <li> It gets even better after calling the Nerium phone # listed on my receipt they told me I couldn&#x27;t return the product that I had knowingly purchased because It had to be returned within 30 days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will fade out</li>
            <li> They really love it</li>
            <li> Tried it one more night, thought maybe I just had to get used to it.</li>
            <li> ; I was redirected to speak with someone that &#x27;knows&#x27; more than &#x27;I&#x27; on this product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited about getting started today.</li>
            <li> my face was virtually perfect, but as the day went on it became oily, small blemishes would appear, and it just didn&#x27;t look good anymore.</li>
            <li> I also listened to the video instructions saying not to worry if I experienced tingling, claiming that was normal.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see how it looks after 90 days!</li>
            <li> I was pressured from the lady that I was working under more than I was at my full time job!</li>
            <li> It was amazing as to how quickly it worked</li>
            <li> and I think it will take 4-5 months to see the best results on their more aged skin, accoding to my friends who have been using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 3 your free program is an awesome way to get you product for only S&amp;H which is a DEAL!</li>
            <li> there is NO product in the world that is going to be perfect for every single person, that goes for skin care, hair, whatever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But to my surprise, this cream is great so far!</li>
            <li> Been using this on my body acne and in literally 10 days I saw  huge results I love this product it works so well</li>
            <li> Ruttyness is almost now smooth, Face has lots of healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> Nerium is nothing more than another MLM selling a cheap snake oil cream run by the King of MLM&#x27;s, Jeff Olsen.  </li>
            <li> They look so great now and have completely stopped wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I received Free product monthly-:)</li>
            <li> But I can honestly tell whoever that is thinking about purchasing this product that it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Going forward, this is what I will be trusting.  </li>
            <li> My skin is really looking good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, Nerium AD is a fantastic product that has been proven to be the best anti-aging product that addresses so many other issues not just the anti-aging.</li>
            <li> I was able to tell a very remarkable difference in the texture of my skin in less than 1 week.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to use-1 step after you wash your face</li>
            <li> One bottle got me through two months, easy.</li>
            <li> And with that being said, I think I will go easy on the amount I use now...</li>
            <li> Our customers are able to earn their product for free, with our 3 ur free program.</li>
            <li> up...fast, easy</li>
            <li> The important thing is to take good before and after pictures so you can really see the difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oleander is a strong poison</li>
            <li> The product works as good as a decent bar of soap .  </li>
            <li> It was sticky and had a strong smell.</li>
            <li> and my face feels so soft and amazing!  </li>
            <li> It looks to me like there are a lot of proven ingredients in their natural more expansive and more effective state.</li>
            <li> My skin texture and tone is even and beautiful, my red blistered looking forehead HAS recovered and is smoother then ever!  </li>
            <li> The astounding \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; pics on the Website are REAL!</li>
            <li> This is the first time EVER that I have had these kind of results from any product...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does work on reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> (I use cetaphil) &amp; I noticed a visible reduction of fine &amp; deeper lines</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering the price and the smell, if I were *that* worried about \\&quot;fine lines and</li>
            <li> Once fine lines seemed deeper.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a decrease in my fine fines and</li>
            <li> I have issues with even tone, fine lines and pore size.</li>
            <li> I have seen the fine lines around my eyes diminish.</li>
            <li> and I was fine.  </li>
            <li> I am aging more quickly than I would like.  </li>
            <li> If you do buy it, and want to return it, be sure to ask for it Quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has changed some of my friends skin quickly &amp; they love it.</li>
            <li> How lucky am I!  </li>
            <li> I would still always get one or two huge cystic pimples one after another.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference</li>
            <li> You can get it for a month risk free from a brand partner.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law gave me a bottle to try for free.</li>
            <li> So, free is free , I&#x27;ll try.</li>
            <li> and they are loving it just as much as I am.</li>
            <li> saying if 3 people bought I could get mine for free.</li>
            <li> But I figured what the hell, samples are free.</li>
            <li> A bit about me: I am 32 (so I really cannot tell you how effective it is for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I dont really enjoy leaving reviews.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, I dont really enjoy leaving reviews.  </li>
            <li> this product - Try it risk free for 30 days through a brand partner website.</li>
            <li> I liked this product so much I became brand partner</li>
            <li> I have had to buy it to see no results, where I did try this product for FREE before deciding to buy it.</li>
            <li> If you do it correctly it goes on smooth as butter</li>
            <li> The representative actually wanted to stop by and take \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos showing the great improvement and to offer me discounts if I gave him a testimonial.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> She wanted to test this product before making it available to patients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, if you want to get free product - buy from a brand partner or preferred customer not through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the product and have seen results.</li>
            <li> Enjoy Nerium or whatever else</li>
            <li> I have seen great results from it especially on my chest area where I had a ton of wrinkles from sun damage.</li>
            <li> Go through a Nerium person and try the product risk free for 30 days.</li>
            <li> If you refer to three of your friends, you get yours for free, so I don&#x27;t know why someone would buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Mine has been fabulous AND Nerium rewards</li>
            <li> I received that same message from NERIUM CEO, Jeff Olsen, as well as a phone call from one of his \\&quot;assistants\\&quot; assuring me Jeff is a \\&quot;great guy\\&quot; and will take care of me.</li>
            <li> You can get it free by signing up as a preferred customer.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t getting free bottles anymore.</li>
            <li> Well ,my real estate wanted to know what i use and soon after many more ladies wanted to know.</li>
            <li> Lots of people on my Facebook sell this and kept posting about how amazing it is and putting up pictures of other people who tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Nerium AD</li>
            <li> (Nerium Biotechnology - Plant to Plant) extraction process that combines the unique beneficial properties of the Nerium plant and the known beneficial properties of Aloe Vera  </li>
            <li> Maybe at the beginning I was excited to try the product</li>
            <li> I think reading all of the reviews is actually entertaining and funny.</li>
            <li> Was kept cool and out of the light.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll be ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my first 90 days I was able to notice a difference without having to compare pictures.</li>
            <li> best wrinkle cream, however is love as it gives you inner glow that cannot be produced with any facial product.</li>
            <li> So much that I bought another five days worth because I still needed more convincing...</li>
            <li> also used this product for four months, did not notice any significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say that I believe most of the posts on here giving this product 5 stars must be the individuals selling the product or they work for the company.  </li>
            <li> I was reluctant to agree to the auto delivery because I wanted to try the product 1st to determine if I liked it enough to order more.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin was dry and flaky for a day or two, but none of the acne like break-outs she had experienced.  </li>
            <li> HAS TO BE CLEAN FROM ALL CHEMICALS!!!!!DON\\&quot;T USE NERIUM DURING THE DAY</li>
            <li> I am on day 29 and my discoloration is gone, redness is gone, texture is super smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any acne for 29 days.  </li>
            <li> I started using it at night like it says, to me it has the smell of rice baby food with a hint of banana pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> (most of the positive ones I suspect are people who sell the product).</li>
            <li> My friend was right!  </li>
            <li> : it was post-facial smooth and calm two days ago.</li>
            <li> My face turned bright red within minutes and it stung.</li>
            <li> I find the reviews interesting because people are either loving it or absolutely, passionately hating it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it can&#x27;t be worth 80</li>
            <li> But Nerium eliminated the steps &amp; cost of using multiple products &amp; I truly loved the results.</li>
            <li> Is it really that phenomenal?</li>
            <li> Guess what , you get the same results from good soap .   </li>
            <li> She set up a website for me (against my better judgement) and when I examined their website, I saw in their documentation for how to have a \\&quot;Real Results</li>
            <li> So you get pissed off people, because you sold them the world and if they only get a good night creme</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product for 30 full days and even took before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> so I was okay to just use the bottle - too much of a hassle trying to deal with the company.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do not feel it is a good value</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a full refund after also paying to return the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this site, I can find so much here and have purchased a ton of merchandise from them.</li>
            <li> How many people really try a product then run to the internet and make a comment</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic and am now a full believer that this product works and works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a true skin care junky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attended the Real Result parties in my area with a friend to learn more about the product and</li>
            <li> The odor is not bad.</li>
            <li> That is when you know a product works, when other people comment on how great your skin looks.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if I had continued using it at some point I would have stopped breaking out and something wonderful may have happened, but I seriously doubt it.  </li>
            <li> So evidently they assume that I would be reading the fine print on their web site in my spare time.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer and will continue to be.</li>
            <li> Key is to use as designed and not think if you use more or leave it on longer it will work better.</li>
            <li> It has diminished my wrinkles tremendously and my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li> before you make bold statements.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li> The smell and its affect on me pass quickly after it dries.</li>
            <li> and maybe I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones, but this stuff works.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen some people developing mild rashes from the product.</li>
            <li> take it quick man take it.\\</li>
            <li> Who from what I experienced only want fast money.  </li>
            <li> , even at 57 I do not have any wrinkles, so I have never been very interested in \\&quot;age defying\\</li>
            <li> Once crows feet barely noticeable when I smiled became deeper and longer.  </li>
            <li> The product does have a distinct smell to it that is not bad after you get use to it.</li>
            <li> I had great results in less the 30 days.  </li>
            <li> I recently  had a life lift and my skin looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the $100 dollars and the customer service wasn&#x27;t very nice.</li>
            <li> This works so fast too!!  </li>
            <li> First of all, it smells!</li>
            <li> telling you, if you do break out at first, KEEP USING IT!  </li>
            <li> I would use a face washer with hot water on my face morning and night to keep it clean and apply non oily moisturiser..</li>
            <li> I. It really reduced her age spots and fine lines around her eyes.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and after using the product for 2 months I am seeing a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I have since bought fresh bottles through my neighbor, sent straight from the company, and they were fine.  </li>
            <li> It is ecological, ethical and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she wants me to attend or some push to try a free sample.  </li>
            <li> smoked for 16 years and started noticing smoker lines about a year ago, I also have smile lines.</li>
            <li> All I can say is it has worked great for myself 46 year old male and my my</li>
            <li> However it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 60 days with astounding results.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old &amp; have been a licensed, reputable esthetician for 12 years &amp; am also a registered nurse.</li>
            <li> Is it worth $80?</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels in the morning.  </li>
            <li> ummm okay, I kept using it to see if my skin would clear up....</li>
            <li> It has millions of success stories around.  </li>
            <li> and proceeded to laugh at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow... I really love the results around my eyes...</li>
            <li> -- now THAT&#x27;S a product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s worth it, trust me).</li>
            <li> , my husband and my friends notice a difference, my dermatologist sees an improvement in my skin, and that makes it worth it for me.</li>
            <li> If it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Love that the product is all natural.</li>
            <li> I happen to be a big believer in Nerium and honestly, if I were you, I would stop buying it on amazon and go to a brand partner to buy it</li>
            <li> /&gt;a 100 million breaking many direct sales records.</li>
            <li> Trust me its not offensive and once the product is fully absorbed there is no odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month and was hesitant with price, however the results are worth it</li>
            <li> However the results are seriously worth it.</li>
            <li> Since I love it so much and have had 3 friends order, my next month&#x27;s bottle is FREE !  </li>
            <li> It has gotten to the point where I only hear from her when there is some kind of indoctrination meeting</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars not 5 because of the strong smell and the high price, but then again if it works</li>
            <li> It started working pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> The Nerium was very strong the first 3 nights, but after that I barely smelled it.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have anything good to say about Nerium; However, I have tried other products they recommend as \\&quot;best\\&quot; and not seen the results that I have with Nerium.</li>
            <li> looks good when applied at night because it feels like glue on your face so skin is tighter, other than that no noticeable difference</li>
            <li> but you put it on right before bed</li>
            <li> I had one right under my nose, which is still there a month after stopping the cream, two on my temple, and one on my chin.  </li>
            <li> If I so choose to sell it on eBay or anywhere else, that is my right.  </li>
            <li> If you go right on their website you get auto ship for $80mo.</li>
            <li> You must apply it right..</li>
            <li> It worked right away.</li>
            <li> She told me right off to take before pic&#x27;s and after pic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My skin looks somewhat improved, but it may still be too early to give a final comment on this, as I am not yet seeing the remarkable improvements this cream is supposed to give.</li>
            <li> Some people respond more quickly than others depending upon their individual state of health, hydration and nutrition.</li>
            <li> The smell is not that pretty sweet fragrance that most people like but really not a big deal.</li>
            <li> that just because a wonderful \\&quot;new business opportunity\\&quot; tells you that it&#x27;s not MLM or NM doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> noticed the smell at first and it was kind of strong, but after using it for a little over 2 months, I no longer can smell it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many higher priced products and I have not seen this kind of results in such a short time.  </li>
            <li> I have the ability to outsell if not everybody just about everybody in the industry honestly, but I have moral standards to live by and paid back money to brand partners out of my own pocket who could not make it .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did take before pics of my chest but will give it a few more weeks to see if it gets even better.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more and think it is good but not great</li>
            <li> I continue to use a daily mild exfoliating face wash which is what I have to do as my pores get clogged easily.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, in some before and after pictures i have seen the light used to take the pictures is NOT the same so the amazing results one sees is due to the light used to take the pictures NOT to the effect of the product itself.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I notice the improvement in my skin - especially around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 45 days and can really see an improvement!</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try Nerium, and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle about a month ago for the first time.</li>
            <li> My Mom wouldn&#x27;t touch it when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible that it doesn&#x27;t work for some people nothing does.</li>
            <li> even more \\&quot;Angle and Weightman face cream sales at $10,000 a jar\\&quot; and finally, \\&quot;RéVive Intesite Voluminizing Serium at $600 oz\\&quot;</li>
            <li> A bar of good natural soap will last much longer for $5.    </li>
            <li> I have worked many mlm&#x27;s and this one is no different .  </li>
            <li> And yes, oleander is that bushy plant with the pretty flowers growing by the freeway in California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing!  </li>
            <li> indicated that on an equivalent weight basis, doses of an oleander extract with glycosides 10-times in excess of those likely to be administered therapeutically to humans are still safe and without any \\&quot;severe toxicity observed\\&quot;.[17]</li>
            <li> I told him I wasn&#x27;t interested in pyramid schemes, but he insisted I try the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much this costs - I will buy it!  </li>
            <li> which is what convinced me to do the auto ship at first.  </li>
            <li> I got all my investment back and much more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and will give it more time</li>
            <li> Remember the ones at the top make the money while it last</li>
            <li> Funny thing is when she came into my business  </li>
            <li> First of all I am not a Brand Member to this product.  </li>
            <li> Yes I am a brand Partner, but I did my homework first.</li>
            <li> From what I understand it takes at least 3 weeks to see some changes so hopefully it will be great  </li>
            <li> Been using this consistently, and as instructed for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking pretty stressed out</li>
            <li> If you are considering falling for the Nerium  Scam as I did,  read this link about their claims first.  </li>
            <li> My mom was given a bottle to try but she wanted me to try it first.</li>
            <li> First, Nerium did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> They are not as deep, however, as they were, and I am hoping with continued use, I will continue to see more improvement.</li>
            <li> Also, in testing for this product, extensive blood tests were done to make absolutely sure that no oleander was found in the bloodstream of people using this product.</li>
            <li> I actually did try the product and found that it worked even better than it claimed.</li>
            <li> rating changed from 1 to 5 (thanks for the reminder)William Dean!</li>
            <li> They force you into an auto-ship program where they are sending you more of this than you could possibly use in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FIRST off....</li>
            <li> Am I willing to take a chance?</li>
            <li> I am still interested to see what would happen, but</li>
            <li> way I will be only out the cost of one bottle and don&#x27;t have to hassle with orders coming before I decide if I want to order more.</li>
            <li> I am 26, and starting to see the lines on my fore head getting more and more present without pulling faces.</li>
            <li> I think the only reason people are seeig results is because they are washing their faces more.  </li>
            <li> I calld the company, I was told a higher lever person would call me within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> There is more than enough to try it for over a month</li>
            <li> That only results in more sales for the company and sales person.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any visible results in my first 30 days, but then I took my after picture and compared it to my before picture</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as instructed and saw no difference whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> all these products have directions, and some of them are pretty out there.</li>
            <li> It caused them to shed layers when I first started using it</li>
            <li> First let me say everyone deserves to make money.</li>
            <li> After the first two weeks of using it, I started getting pimples.</li>
            <li> The first time that I used it, it broke me out.  </li>
            <li> Nerium in their first year did</li>
            <li> /&gt;Virgin coconut oil is much better, for skin and hair and even internally.</li>
            <li> a personal basis, I have to agree with many of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> So if your husband wants a woman with a smelly crusty film on her face, this product is for you!</li>
            <li> I feel like it only continue to get better.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer was Skinceuticals prior to trying Nerium.</li>
            <li> Also, Nerium gives you a 30-day money back guarantee that you get when you buy from a brand partner, so it&#x27;s much better to find your product that way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;and fax them to cancel auto monthly and don&#x27;t guarantee returns after 30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;days of first order.</li>
            <li> w/my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks - every night - and do not see as drastic difference as they indicate you would within the first week.  </li>
            <li> More than likely competitors paying bloggers to complain.</li>
            <li> guarantee I tried for the first 2 week</li>
            <li> NO, but my family and friends notice a real difference!  </li>
            <li> Felt better in the morning, but went to the doctor who could not understand the sudden dizziness and nausea.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> First and foremost, I have NEVER tried Nerium and NEVER will.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely despise MLM schemes!  </li>
            <li> For $90 - $110 a month, I had better see instant results.  </li>
            <li> Really?!?  </li>
            <li> Overall I do give Nerium AD five stars and hope you will give it a try. :)</li>
            <li> I did break out some at first.  </li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> I just married the man of everyones dreams and thinking of selling it.</li>
            <li> It wasn t a pretty sight.</li>
            <li> I laughed when I read about people having a burning rash after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To really remove wrinkles and smooth skin, a combination of Botox injections, Prevage MD in the morning, and occasional RetinA at night is much more effective but also much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nerium is a great skincare product and definitely worth trying...at least for 1 month!  </li>
            <li> Nerium Is an amazing product I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and other parts of my body for 15 months and have had no adverse reactions</li>
            <li> that could not be farther from the truth, I think it smells great, it has a natural smell to it, maybe a little bit like melons/cucumbers).  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it works EXTREMELY well.</li>
            <li> I do however wash my face with clean and clear before i apply this cream.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t cost that much more and the effects would probably be much the same, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how much you love them because that has no bearing on their actions towards those of us who have had medical attention because of their products.</li>
            <li> I was mostly interested in improving the texture of my skin and eliminating the visibility of my large pores (as well as decreasing emerging lines).</li>
            <li> There are so many negative reviews and so many positive</li>
            <li> Support locally and help a real family building a real business put food on their table, not someone trying to take your money without working for it!!!!</li>
            <li> It came with a warning from the person who sold it that it would have a strong reaction at first, including pimples, but that would subside shortly.  </li>
            <li> The positive results are posted by those who sell it.</li>
            <li> There should be something in there that would help most anyone if they are not sensitive to plants where they would have a reaction.</li>
            <li> When the pigeons do buy the product , they usually give it up in three months because they wise up .                    </li>
            <li> I would still like to try the product to see if using the product for the full 30 days and using the complete bottle would make a difference or not.  </li>
            <li> No more acne, skin is bright and vibrant, my forehead lines...GONE!</li>
            <li> Europe we know that pregnant women should not be near this plant!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> People get easily discouraged if they don&#x27;t see instant results!</li>
            <li> and I have to be super conscious of my age / appearance.</li>
            <li> How easy would that be for someone to write a review only to send their customers or people who have asked them about the product to them?</li>
            <li> About the oleander and all of that, I was weary, as I own horses, and if they even get just the smallest taste, less than one leaf, it is over for them...</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars is the smell isn&#x27;t great and the texture of the cream is also a little too tightening feeling...almost like wearing a mask at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly be reordering if not going on the monthly plan thingy</li>
            <li> And I certainly don&#x27;t believe it lives up to what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> it made my lines look deeper in certain areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the morning, my skin is super soft and smooth,feels very hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Also I use the 4-5 pumps as recommended and my bottle runs out right after the new one arrived.  </li>
            <li> In the morning my skin felt fine, so I washed my face as instructed and applied my daytime cream( I alternate between DermaOrganics and strivectin spf 20).</li>
            <li> I purchased from a salon and used for 30 days and felt it definitely improved the fine lines and coloration.  </li>
            <li> An improvement in my appearance, fine lines and wrinkles, was noticeable after 5 days and dramatically different after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> And guess what that&#x27;s ok other Nerium Brand Partners, because there are still millions of people who can afford it and actually want it and will love it for the price!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes better sales techniques IE no pushiness and no pressure will allow people to be more objective and not expect a face transplant to pacify their uneasiness with being sold so hard in the first place.</li>
            <li> Other than the product making my skin itchy, and my eczema dry patches flaking, I experienced something like a vertigo.  </li>
            <li> Over the last week, I have notice a HUGE improvement in the redness and acne.</li>
            <li> and you aren&#x27;t getting much of a deal, plus you have no idea how you can actually get your product for free or make money sharing it when you buy from these sites.</li>
            <li> Feel free to contact me for further questions - glowonwithyourself@gmail.com thanks.</li>
            <li> She did not say much, except- try it and let me know what you think, she also gave me instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> I was given a free bottle of Nerium AD by my building owner/designer for me to try for myself because of my experience with several product lines to see what I thought.</li>
            <li> This product actually really works.  </li>
            <li> Party\\&quot; so that others will buy, that they actually instruct you to tell people you have earned a free iPad, Lexus Car Bonus, etc.</li>
            <li> and he sent me straight to a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> and I never really had issues with wrinkles and was utilizing \\&quot;Meaningful</li>
            <li> My skin is much brighter.  </li>
            <li> I became brand partner because NeriumAD really works for me.  </li>
            <li> After reading this article and understanding how the ML&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myself and the team I built in legal shield were lied by Todd Cahill who was our leader and had told us that Nerium ad would come and go and</li>
            <li> Is that hygenic or ethical in any way.</li>
            <li> it was a sample that I never asked for or really wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a real person writing a real review.</li>
            <li> it works really</li>
            <li> Thanks Roberto for sharing...</li>
            <li> In addition to informing me of my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; your custmer service rep Elizabeth continued to tell me that your return policy has a statue of limitation of 30 days and anything beyond that you will not be responsible for.</li>
            <li> Some people, depending how much they like to spend on beauty products and how well it works for them specifically, will find it&#x27;s not for them.  </li>
            <li> People that are convinced it&#x27;s a scam are just really upset from pushy sales tactics and sometimes no results.</li>
            <li> Is the person writing the review real?</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on really well with it.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream for five days because my hairdresser was selling it and really pushing me to try it.  </li>
            <li> I also have much smoother and softer skin.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have much to start with).</li>
            <li> If it was real, doctors would be all over this.</li>
            <li> Botox and Aveda have worked very well to this point.</li>
            <li> I used it for 30 days, took before and after pictures and saw absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone who tries this product won&#x27;t demand more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a whole lot of buzz for no reason, and it&#x27;s getting to the obnoxious point.</li>
            <li> He gave me a whole bottle and asked that I use it.</li>
            <li> If you want to spend a fortune on something that works, try Creme De La Mer --you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, thanks to the blessing of Mediterranean genetics</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and seeing before and after pictures, with much excitement I bought 2 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It isnt an off smell, just unusual.</li>
            <li> and I really can see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the before and after photos!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and my skin is very oily and prone to break outs.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> , REALLY?</li>
            <li> product is a botanical with a DISTINCT natural smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much money you spend on skin care products</li>
            <li> For me it really helped my neck and chest area.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely convinced that this is the answer I have been searching for.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> this product was developed by accident by a Dr at MD Anderson for burn patients, a ton of research and $$ has been poured into this product and its worth every dime to purchase it,,I</li>
            <li> I found the product very drying.  </li>
            <li> I also used the product on a raised surgical scar below my bra line and overnight the scar was much flatter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent much more than $110 on \\&quot;skin care product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference until I took the after pic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of money I&#x27;ve tried many products.</li>
            <li> but just think how much do you pay for all the creams you use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells really bad.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen a change in anyone using it..</li>
            <li> If the product really worked do you think they&#x27;d have to promote their product in this way?</li>
            <li> A friend convinced me to give Nerium a REAL try.  </li>
            <li> (nasolabial folds)as well as my pores appearing smaller &amp; more clear &amp; my makeup goes on like silk.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to actually see something actually work!</li>
            <li> A good friend sent me a partial bottle to use to see if I can get results in the 2nd month, so I&#x27;ll keep trying.  </li>
            <li> I found it interesting that so many people either loved or hated Nerium, so I decided to try it for myself and did the before and after pics, as their theory that a lot of people forget what their faces look like in detail from day to day made some sense.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have many lines before, but looked in the mirror at the beginning of week 3 and saw my 24 year old self looking back at me.</li>
            <li> every month people say wow you must be getting BOTOX!!!</li>
            <li> The first shipment did not make it my new place...</li>
            <li> There are 100&#x27;s of products that you can purchase that actually  make your face feel smoother and fresh!</li>
            <li> Not sure why some people have such a chip on their shoulders about the product, but I will continue to use it because it works great for me.</li>
            <li> I am not much of a people person (I have social anxiety) and the nice lady and gentleman who gave me the bottle I am using attend lots of meetings.</li>
            <li> So I did, and for the first time in 35 years my skin is almost perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> First of all, I reviewed the \\&quot;science\\&quot;, which is complete garbage.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is already much more even, my pore size has noticably decreased and I can see a difference in the texture and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Well, I took before and after photos and noticed that my fine lines got worse and the skin on my eyelid drooped more than before.  </li>
            <li> This product has poor to non-existant scientific papers, and certainly none in peer reviewed publications (these are publications where good data are presented...</li>
            <li> While the main ingredient nerium oleander is known to be a toxic plant...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure different people have different result--</li>
            <li> These studies all indicate that administration of Nerium oleander extracts as either a parenteral or topical preparation is safe when doses anticipated for commercial products are applied.[16]</li>
            <li> if you are expecting miracles - be realistic - there is no miracle out there unless you want to go under the knife.</li>
            <li> She turned before she left and let me know that I needed to return it quickly because it was an $80 bottle of her product</li>
            <li> REALISTIC.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for one month as suggested, and the result ( 3rd week ) was puffy, scaly, red skin under my eyes-on top of my cheekbones</li>
            <li> Take a look at the main ingredient, Aloe and the Oleander plant/flower.  </li>
            <li> Well I did the trial which actually was enough for more than five days</li>
            <li> There was nothing on the receipt that indicated there was a particular time frame that the product must be returned within.  </li>
            <li> It all takes time, and at less than $100/month, it is competetive with the more high quality products out there.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> ìg/g which were in the high range of reported levels at autopsy.[13]</li>
            <li> they require a high recruitment rate to survive.</li>
            <li> With all of the promises and the high cost</li>
            <li> the shipping and handling costs are high....</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you give Nerium a try</li>
            <li> I understand the lack of knowledge of certain people, Nerium AD it is not made with  direct sap of the Nerium Oleander plant.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it cleared up my adult acne, started to fade a large sun spot</li>
            <li> The deeper the lines take a little more time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hope you do a little more research before deciding against Rogaine because of those types of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No major reactions like some have had, but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I made a connection with some irritation I had under my nose and on my top lip.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little interesting, smells like Witch-Hazel, and I almost didn&#x27;t continue using it, but now after a week I don&#x27;t notice the smell after 5 minutes of application.  </li>
            <li> I would have given the product 5 stars if it smelled a little better.  </li>
            <li> Cost of nearly $100 month is very high.</li>
            <li> Major League Rip off!!!!</li>
            <li> I am known for my flawless skin and now, I have 4 ugly bumps and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> In the morning I rinse my face off and apply my normal SPF skin protection and makeup.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines are way less, so much so that I can&#x27;t stop staring at my pictures today.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, like any normal person, I was a bit ify.  </li>
            <li> She said the Nerium was exfoliating my clogged pores and the breaking out was normal and would stop soon.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure a few of you whiners either have done Botox</li>
            <li> By the time I used the product and realized I needed to decide whether to continue and receive another bottle or cancel the auto delivery...was about 15 days into using the product...which was really not enough time to determine if the results were worth investing another $100 in another bottle...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write comments normally</li>
            <li> Normally you would have to dig them out with a needle and an extractor.</li>
            <li> but definitely not least.</li>
            <li> She told me that was normal.</li>
            <li> There are soo many great, natural, less expensive products out there that won&#x27;t ruin your skin.</li>
            <li> and I have no hard feelings.</li>
            <li> Just being honest), black female.  </li>
            <li> Half the reviews are positive - especially for people who have used the product for more than a month.</li>
            <li> I was in a lot of pain as I live in Florida and</li>
            <li> :B007NQA77U NeriumAD Night Cream (30 mL)]]I initiate purchase of nerium ad ~ 4 months ago at the request of a friend who was a new brand manager.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend went away to see her mom in New York for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> my skin turned a new leaf.</li>
            <li> However,  I did have an abundance of new age spots and blotches that I did not have before.  </li>
            <li> meanwhile, I moved to another place to live.</li>
            <li> Your March has been sent to your new address.</li>
            <li> Before I could send in the notification to stop the order, a charge appeared on my credit card statement, and a new bottle arrived in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t believe it was a new bottle</li>
            <li> and they send out your new bottle every 30 days on auto ship.</li>
            <li> This company is new and is a multilevel sales operation.  </li>
            <li> Because the 30 money back guarantee is only available through brand partner websites.  </li>
            <li> I have bought 2 bottles of Nerium on Amazon, one was old (had an older label) and one had been overheated and was rancid.  </li>
            <li> So 3 months ago a friend hands me this bottle and say just put it on your face at night,every night and be sure you use a little water!</li>
            <li> And before I close out, let me make it very clear that I am in no way a distributer of this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Nerium by an old high school friend at my brother&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li> The first morning after I used it my wrinkles on my upper lip were GONE!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have considered carrying because it makes skin care simple</li>
            <li> Since then, under my eyes have completely smoothed out!  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream and used it every night for a month, following the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> In reviewing oleander toxicity Lanford and Boor[15] concluded that, except for children who might be at greater risk, \\&quot;the human mortality associated with oleander ingestion is generally very low, even in cases of moderate intentional consumption (suicide attempts).\\&quot;[15]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally have really clear skin, but I did want to shrink pores.</li>
            <li> I was actually advised to put a layer ofglycerin on first before using the product to improve the results.  </li>
            <li> , however I don&#x27;t have any more break outs than usual.  </li>
            <li> - that&#x27;s way more legit then getting \\&quot;bootlegs\\&quot; on amazon or other such sites.</li>
            <li> , it can and will make you break out at first, lots of products you try do that at first as your skin tightens pushing out impurities and other stuff from your pores.</li>
            <li> I am hyper aware of my skin and its current condition (fluctuates with sun exposure and Obagi usage).</li>
            <li> The Company is laid back, friendly and not pushy whatsoever in the sales approach, they have a terrific product that they want to share with the world.</li>
            <li> Maybe the naysayers just didn&#x27;t give it enough time, maybe they didn&#x27;t take and compare their pictures, but this stuff is the real deal!  </li>
            <li> Waited a week and tried again doing exactly what I did before I got the rash, got up the next morning</li>
            <li> Nerium will allow you to purchase the product use it and return an empty bottle for full credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you see nothing in your 30 days it&#x27;s not going to get much better, its just slow and steady results from there if at all.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that I actually will get auto shipped because I have never been able to use that much shampoo or coffee or whatever as other auto ships</li>
            <li> company only responds to all of the positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> only positive results it&#x27;s taken years off of my face!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have extremely sensitive skin and not had any reaction and have noticed a huge decrease in my pores size and less redness and and brown spots -skin</li>
            <li> overall more even toned and less eye and forehead wrinkles</li>
            <li> until 4 week later everyone told me that I looked bright &amp; younger, my dark spots are gone about 80% &amp; removed my double chin off too !</li>
            <li> Large pores, red and oily.  </li>
            <li> The public is smart.</li>
            <li> and I still have the crows feet, my one and only age spot and large pores.</li>
            <li> One thing I know for certain, is in the U.S., if it&#x27;s expensive, it has to be effective.  </li>
            <li> What I observed on the fifth day was that my face kind of started to look a little rough.  </li>
            <li> a writer and musician my eyes are extremely important to me and any discomfort makes it hard for me to read and besides, who wants to be on stage, in magazines and on television with a disfigured eye?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 30 days my cheeks look almost clear.</li>
            <li> but when I uploaded both pictures side by side, you can clearly see a difference in my crow&#x27;s feet.  </li>
            <li> I already had my internist prescribe an ointment to help clear up this rash.</li>
            <li> Its Clear.  </li>
            <li> I have seen them post pictures of people who clearly have plastic surgery/cosmetic work done</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this, it didn&#x27;t work, and if you see the wording, the reps all start out by saying they \\&quot;can&#x27;t guarantee results\\&quot; to clear themselves of any liability.</li>
            <li> It will clear up and your skin will start to look</li>
            <li> Finally a natural product that gives me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> They are still gone and my skin is baby soft and it appears to be helping my rosacea.</li>
            <li> but I will be looking further into Nerium-it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because the one star review I read was in a nutshell nothing more than an uneducated complaint.</li>
            <li> All the ingredients in NeriumAD are not harsh.</li>
            <li> every parent is warned not to let their kids go near this plant...</li>
            <li> I suffered from adult acne which left a lot of scarring that I was very self conscious about.</li>
            <li> I used the product for 4 days and immediately saw one of the craters near my eyebrow dissipate.</li>
            <li> Opinion - Stay as far away from Nerium and their reps as you can.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> After ~ about 2 to 3 month of using the product according to directions I developed itchy puffy eyes each morning.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased the product, I saw SO many negative reviews about how it doesnt work</li>
            <li> Having reasonable expectations about a product is key.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s, but I have sun spots near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and my skin sucked.  </li>
            <li> And I use Lush for bath/body.</li>
            <li> I had suffered from adult acne and after it started to go away</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please protect yourselves as customers and order directly from Nerium...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for about 4-5 weeks every night as directed &amp; have not noticed any difference so far.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a month religiously, saw absolutely zero improvement.</li>
            <li> So, just a big \\&quot;EH\\&quot; review from me all-around.. product, price, customer service, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s not a warning label on the product.</li>
            <li> I am the biggest skeptic alive.  </li>
            <li> I applied product like instructed and did not even get near the eye area.</li>
            <li> and I wished I had not put it on my face (near my nose), after doing so.</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li> It sort of has, what I can only describe as a very lightweight cocoon on your face.</li>
            <li> I have to warn anyone who is sensitive to skin products to NOT use this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s</li>
            <li> on complete garbage.</li>
            <li> well my son said it all, Wow Mom.</li>
            <li> Being a California beach girl in my early years doesn&#x27;t help or now being in Florida.  </li>
            <li> I disagree thus far</li>
            <li> It is still early but I am already noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> But if you really want to make money become a brand partner with Nerium International.</li>
            <li> I was told that I would look like a young man again.</li>
            <li> After another month-he has deep lines around his eyes, acne scars and some brown spots-I looked at his face really closely as well and couldn&#x27;t see even a minute difference-</li>
            <li> NO cream is capable of doing that, only plastic surgery can.</li>
            <li> My hubsan commented on how my cheeks look like that of a 21 yr old.</li>
            <li> The Nerium night cream has made my skin radiant, clear and soft.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this... $100 buck for one ounce??</li>
            <li> am 67 years old</li>
            <li> I still use Nerium some of the time, but the results seemed to only give me &#x27;so much&#x27; and that was it.</li>
            <li> Now my husband uses it and my 21 year old has started as she had breakouts.</li>
            <li> The first couple of months I could see a minor difference but nothing after that.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this product a chance given the cult like following of this product.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Nerium AD by an old friend of 30 years.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;It&#x27;s all natural, hypoallergenic etc.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, Rosacea, or react to face creams with a scent then proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 2 months with no problems and then one morning I wake up with a rash around my eyes and nearly swollen shut.</li>
            <li> and she said how old are you ?</li>
            <li> and there is absolute &#x27;ZERO&#x27; evidence to back up there claims and their pseudo science!  </li>
            <li> And that the independant clinical doctors who found a real result in Rogain are all crazy and/or paid off and everyone who uses rogaine is brainwashed by good marketing?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far more expensive than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> So, I started back with Nerium night and day cream and within a few days my skin looked and felt much better.....</li>
            <li> Maybe some of them are, but I know from my own personal experience that I had a negative reaction.</li>
            <li> I believe that Nerium International should prohibited the sale of the product in eBay and other cheap internet malls.    </li>
            <li> I like my face to feel clean and smooth before bed and this just feels uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Because I can tell you, and swear on everyone I love, that I have seen dramatic and real results.  </li>
            <li> I met a friendly lady in a department store a few days ago.</li>
            <li> The researchers concluded that PBI-05204 was \\&quot;well tolerated up to the 10.2 mg extract/day dosage\\&quot; with few significant side effectsand with evidence of tumor response.[19]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how everything looks in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not a HUGE deal because while I wasn&#x27;t seeing significant results, my make-up was going on well</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and have faithfully moisturized my face daily since high school.  </li>
            <li> When i applied it, it felt very dry like a face mask and in the morning my skin felt even more dry with tiny wrinkles under my eyes</li>
            <li> i believe for some people the effects could be profound...</li>
            <li> I used three full bottles of this product (BTW, following the bottle&#x27;s application instructions each bottle lasted me roughly 45 days).  </li>
            <li> have to say that the ingredient list did not have anything particularly objectionable, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> The main reason I wanted it was to remove the red from my face.  </li>
            <li> months, $300.00 later it does NOT work, made me look older as it dryed and pulled my skin together</li>
            <li> She also developed a major skin irritation that hasn&#x27;t gone away</li>
            <li> In the first week I saw smoother and firmer skin, in the second week I felt that my skin was much softer, and saw a reduction in the dark spots I have on my jaw line from picking pimples in my teens and early 20s.</li>
            <li> My crows feet are improving &amp; the huge pores on my nose are getting smaller and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t care as long as they continue to offer the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can certainly tell you that I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the redness and an overall tightening of my skin (especially around my jaw line).</li>
            <li> Nerium is sold exclusively by independent brand partners so if you bought on Amazon.com you bought from someone who will lose the right to sell the product in the future and may or may not be ACTUAL Nerium AD.  </li>
            <li> My skin does get a little taut once I first apply but that is totally a normal part of using the product...</li>
            <li> From the beginning it was hard to ignore the stinky strong smell, but I wanted to give the product a chance.  </li>
            <li> It is a new container, as I never opened the second one until this week.</li>
            <li> I tried to change to new address on their site...then cancelled the 2nd shipment...</li>
            <li> At least this lesson is teaching me to do more research next time I hear of a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I bowed out after I checked this product out including the ingridients-one of which was oleander which is very toxic if taken internally and is a known skin irritant if applied externally.</li>
            <li> If you want major changes see the Plastic surgeon.  </li>
            <li> Do I have friends/ family who are not interested- absolutely, but I am not going to harass them about it!</li>
            <li> There is no other product that comes close.</li>
            <li> I used it for one more night only to wake up with three more deep, extremely painful, pimples in the strangest places.  </li>
            <li> I had used that line in my mid 30&#x27;s (the product line starts with the letter O) with great results but had not previously used Retin A with it (which I was supposed to do) because I was afraid of going through the initial phase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;ToxicityNerium oleander has historically been considered a poisonous plant based on a number of its compounds that may exhibit toxicity, especially to animals, when consumed in high amounts.</li>
            <li> Like I said before I have seen this work amazingly on some people but for some reason I could no longer use it which it made it difficult to sell.</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old male and am amazed at the results of this product.</li>
            <li> So, I was pleasantly surprised when this product actually did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> Apparently it works for some women and not for others.  </li>
            <li> Apparently I was mistaken.</li>
            <li> Red bumps forming on my eyelids near the outer edges.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle of the Nerium AD and after 7 days I really didn&#x27;t see a differents, not really after 14 days, but when I got around the 21 day mark...</li>
            <li> So far I am seeing results similar to Retin-A without the irritation, peeling and redness.</li>
            <li> I am a 61 year old male using Nerium for six months.</li>
            <li> and I think I paid way too much for it to be partially used.  </li>
            <li> Please FB me as my next step is a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT to show NERIUM that they can&#x27;t just make people go away.</li>
            <li> But because I was SO skeptical about this product before I bought it, I just had to let people know that it is truly effective.  </li>
            <li> But because I was SO skeptical about this product before I bought it, I just had to let people know that it is truly effective.  </li>
            <li> It felt kind of uncomfortable on, even with water on my face before applying this, the cream is meant to be washed off by the morning, so it feels like this film on my face.</li>
            <li> This cream was drawing moisture out of the layers of my skin leaving behind more and deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a reason to not spend the money on one more product that made false promises.  </li>
            <li> Importantly, it says it is a mixture of Aloe and the other active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> The fact that some people love it or hate it is easily interpreted.</li>
            <li> Nerium AD also makes my skin feel a little dry right after application, however that feeling also goes away after 5 minutes of application and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Nerium&#x27;s auto-order policy did not allow enough time for me to feel confident enough to order another bottle via their auto delivery system which automatically charges my charge card for another bottle before I am ready.</li>
            <li> I wonder how many of the negative blogs are really people who are unsatisfied or rather professional bloggers saying negative things?</li>
            <li> If you want to prevent wrinkles or reduce fine lines this may work for you, however, it is not effective on deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have been using it for two months with dramatic results.</li>
            <li> My neighbor who sells Nerium said it must have been left in a hot car or something, it was dark brown and smelled rotten.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 45); it feels smoother, fine lines are less noticeable, and the dark spots on my face, hands and chest appear lighter.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and was kind of afraid to try the product.  </li>
            <li> Will she charge the new victim $80 for this used bottle of toxic Oleander stinkfest?  </li>
            <li> While the odor is unpleasant at first, it seems to have this cumulative effect that the more you use it, the worse it smells to the point of becoming unusable.</li>
            <li> We will see what the next few months bring but right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard great reviews from several people I know and only one bad one, so I decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, other people did including two relatives who gently suggested that I try a different eye cream for my crow&#x27;s feet.  </li>
            <li> creams day creams, eye creams to buy just one simple bottle and much cheaper than all the other combinations.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it is worth it for me to have to take a Xanax to go to a meeting or, God forbid, pitch the product to a group of people.</li>
            <li> We are talking heavy makeup for the first time in my life after that ordeal and now almost no makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am getting small laugh lines</li>
            <li> I see that lots of people on here have complained about the smell, but it&#x27;s honestly not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> It feels tight on your skin when you first put it on, almost like a facial mask from years ago.  </li>
            <li> you think if Mary Kay or Avon or anyone else introduced a product that WORKED and had a particular distinctive natural smell they would be crying about it..</li>
            <li> Most people always post negative reviews and not positive ones its human nature.</li>
            <li> It was a little drying for me when I first started, so the sponsor I purchased from suggested only using 1-2 pumps vs. the recommended 4-5.</li>
            <li> had me going to several doctors in different cities over the past few months and created a lump ON my right lid as well as a lump UNDER my right lid, which is still there.</li>
            <li> The smell was not repulsive but a bit too strong for my taste and it felt a little drying, but this feeling left along with the smell in about half an hour.</li>
            <li> study in which a proprietary, concentrated extract of Nerium oleander (containing oleandrin and other cardiac glycosides) was administered orally to humans for the first time was recently concluded.[19]</li>
            <li> After first month he have seen no improvement and was told he was using it incorrectly-according to \\&quot;brand partner\\&quot; you are supposed to wet your face and apply it to the wet face(as</li>
            <li> This product might work well for naturally oily skin, but normally dry skin doesn&#x27;t benefit from this formula and is actually worsened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is very sticky and smelly and leaves my skin feeling tight.</li>
            <li> His fine lines are decreased and softened dramatically.  </li>
            <li> Well, when I&#x27;ve tried other new products, I noticed an immediate difference in my skin the very next day.</li>
            <li> All I know is that is their business (good or bad) and</li>
            <li> However all my life i have had acne problems, skin scaring and now at late middle age i was really looking old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a slight reduction in pore size and the smell is not pleasant but its not horrible.  </li>
            <li> In pictures in the past you could really see the red marks from my ordeal even if it wasn&#x27;t too obvious</li>
            <li> The product is all natural and any forms of reaction aren&#x27;t due to the product, but chemically based product that people are using on their skin(I even asked a dermatologist).</li>
            <li> However, I do have minor skin flaws especially in the last 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other mammals, however, such as dogs and humans, are relatively sensitive to the effects of cardiac glycosides and the clinical manifestations of \\&quot;glycoside intoxication\\&quot;.[8][9][10]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has been dry  for the last several years</li>
            <li> The product smells old and looks darker than the previous product of the same name that I&#x27;ve used.i had paid the 1 day shipping because I was leaving town and needed to get in to take on my trip.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I kept seeing everyone talking about this amazing skincare called Nerium.  </li>
            <li> It sucks loosing money on something that didnt work, but I\\&quot;m sure all of you have lost alot more on stupid money decisions....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to see any difference.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from very minor redness as I am part Irish.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has said a negative comment about this product obviously hasn&#x27;t really tried Nerium AD.</li>
            <li> The photos looked fake to me - and that&#x27;s easy to do.  </li>
            <li> Now, in less than one month my neck has improved according to the young people around me.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with breakout or rash (however my skin is not very sensitive).</li>
            <li> Do your homework and don&#x27;t be unrealistic and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> My blood pressure was fine, I did not have a stroke, it was just weird.  </li>
            <li> I found that the high pressure approach to signing up people and very little product knowledge was a turn off.  </li>
            <li> Spouting a lot of smoke and mirrors, shifting terms that have negative connotations, and hyping people up is necessary to maintain a high recruitment rate.</li>
            <li> I also had a few dark places from too much sun</li>
            <li> In four human studies[21][22][22][23] in which a Nerium oleander extract was applied to the skin of people with different dermal conditions, sensitive mass spectrometry based blood analyses were not able to detect the presence of cardio glycosides such as oleandrin, indicating that these compounds are not readily absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but you really just need like two pumps and you apply it to a slightly wet face and neck and rub it in.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of my hard-earned money and time.  </li>
            <li> as long as I can have it shipped to me</li>
            <li> They went to their skin doctor and he stated it was from long term use with the Oleander seed extract</li>
            <li> Nerium has not done that so far and produced some results just in a few days.</li>
            <li> (My girlfriend, who is 22 and looks like an angel, gets a minor result and temporary minor rashes in the morning from the product.</li>
            <li> How long did it take you to get all of your wrinkles?</li>
            <li> For $100 a bottle this is a complete waste.</li>
            <li> Or go get some filler injections (in the long run, cheaper than Nerium</li>
            <li> /&gt;YT - Long Beach, CA</li>
            <li> that is about how long it takes to kick in.</li>
            <li> To those naysayers, I say that it is working, but not fast enough for you, and you really do not know if it is working underneath the initial layer of your skin.</li>
            <li> I can say out of this long review, is try it.</li>
            <li> We can not help you because you took to long to contact us.</li>
            <li> Not near as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I know, strange, huh??</li>
            <li> I spent plenty of money  at Nordstroms on tiny bottles of stuff from Este Lauder and Lancome and didn&#x27;t see a thing.</li>
            <li> She only showed a photograph of herself from the nose down that focused on the reduction of the size of a second chin.</li>
            <li> some more expensive, some less.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t leave you alone till u get mean and set them straight.</li>
            <li> I still have some product left, but I am not interested in using it.</li>
            <li> I had actually used Retin A for acne in the past and went through the peeling and initial breakout but after several months my acne improved.  </li>
            <li> It is the same with this, and any other product.</li>
            <li> I have read some of the other reviews and all I have to say is that they were not educated properly about</li>
            <li> Another thing about it is that it lasts very long.  </li>
            <li> My eyes continued to swell up and felt dry in the mornings</li>
            <li> Wash face thoroughly ,  dry face , apply Nerium and leave it on overnight .                   </li>
            <li> I also did have some dry patches but that could be a change from seasons.</li>
            <li> Pimples all the time from either oily skin in the hotter months and dry skin in the colder months...</li>
            <li> If dry skin is what you are after, then by all means BUY NERIUM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and have only a few wrinkles but big pores and some bumps and crevices.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to perhaps prevent wrinkles coming back after my life lift or maybe smoothing out the few tiny ones that remained after my life lift.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, even though the science is fake, enough people like the product that I thought it was worth a try, so I took my before picture and used the product for 2 months, as directed.  </li>
            <li> and then the last thing I do after putting it on my face and neck is put a few drops of water in my hands and rub the tops of my hands with the left over.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this product for a few days now and I am African American.  </li>
            <li> It CANT work for every single person.</li>
            <li> However, most of the reviews 3 stars and less include complaints of allergic reactions, dryness, problems around the eyes, or other uncomfortable results.</li>
            <li> I finally agreed to try it for five days, although I told her I would probably not be signing up to buy it because I really couldn&#x27;t afford such an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> I noticed 2 days ago that my chest feels smoother and dark spots are actually fading.</li>
            <li> I ordered it the first time to cancel because I assumed it would be just another unnecessary stockpiling plan-</li>
            <li> I went back to using my other face creams!</li>
            <li> and the wrinkles on my husband face are looking less deep.</li>
            <li> But it actually is much less than I was paying for multiple products as I had started to use products to try to fade the scars and sun spots.  </li>
            <li> That slight tingling turned into a red burn and rash  over my lip/under my nose.</li>
            <li> I switched back to my previous moisturizers (and added an eye cream to the mix) and no one&#x27;s said anything since.</li>
            <li> I can definitely get past the smell considering the results I have attained in a relatively short period of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nerium returns are less than 1% so the smell and all else likely are not an issue.</li>
            <li> I am not pregnant and ate the same breakfast I had have for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> STOCKPILING AND MASS MARKET INTERNET SALES Completion of this product order certifies that you have sold or used at least 70% of all prior orders and that none of this product will be promoted or sold on ANY mass market websites such as eBay, Amazon, national retail sites or other similar</li>
            <li> Also, their scientific advisor is a fraud without a single legitimate publication!  </li>
            <li> Took before/after photos and not one single improvement!</li>
            <li> Since MLM&#x27;s have a high failure rate, (97% failure rate according to the Direct Selling Association and the research of Robert Fitzpatrick of FalseProfits.com)</li>
            <li> Despite what I read in a negative review, it doesn&#x27;t smell so great and the consistency is weird, but WHO CARES!!  </li>
            <li> It feels a little tightening on the skin as it dries, but thats the only recommendation I give.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing some sagging along my jawline/smile area and now, due to firming of the skin, they are starting to be much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I often get told I look like I&#x27;m in my late 20s or early 30s.</li>
            <li> At least I wasn&#x27;t the only one with a red face</li>
            <li> but I was still not really expecting a lot of results from a night cream.  </li>
            <li> By the time you realize it is not going to work, you have spent $300 to $500.</li>
            <li> I read through the poor reviews and think that people may just be expecting too much.  </li>
            <li> This is toxic in a deadly way See the link below from the American Cancer Society.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The money spent on this product could have went towards Botox or a filler.</li>
            <li> A partially used bottle.</li>
            <li> and I see absolutely no benefit whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of $ on my skin</li>
            <li> I am one of those who saw absolutely not difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> However...it is NOT legal for anyone to be selling on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I agreed really not expecting any results.</li>
            <li> I carefully followed directions for Nerium.</li>
            <li> Suddenly I was charge for December and received the product a few days afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Nerium is not all I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> There really is no inbetween.</li>
            <li> , read the return policy carefully.  </li>
            <li> Now I have spent $200.</li>
            <li> Your skin has to be wet when you put Nerium on it.</li>
            <li> I was refunded for the Nerium bottles minus 10% re-stocking fee (what a scam) but they&#x27;re not refunding for the materials because they said they were used.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> That part of Nerium makes it HARDER to recommend to my friends because they are suspect once they hear it is multi-level marketing.</li>
            <li> your face must be wet plus your hands must be wet 4 pumps rub your hands together and apply.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my dark spots under my eyes, HOWEVER, I had a strange reaction.  </li>
            <li> When applying, the skin should be wet</li>
            <li> Very strange experience!!</li>
            <li> I find it strong smelling and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> His blood indicated a total blood concentration of cardiac glycosides of approximately 20 ìg/L which is well above the reported fatal level.</li>
            <li> At this point,  I did a little more research on the company and found their research claims very questionable.  </li>
            <li> This is my normal routine, so it may be that my skincare routine is already optimized such that I was unable to see the benefits of the Nerium.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel tight and dry while it is on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is not evident to me if the 1 star reviewer used this product</li>
            <li> Among these compounds are oleandrin and oleandrigenin, known as \\&quot;cardiac glycosides\\&quot; which are known to have a narrow therapeutic index and can be toxic when ingested.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One cited death was apparently due to the ingestion of oleander leaves by a diabetic man.[12]</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but tried it anyway.  </li>
            <li> and the other was faded a lot.</li>
            <li> Then try some other products because there is one out there that has the value and result</li>
            <li> I am NOT interested in the MLM aspects of this product (I am not a fan of multi level marketing at all), I will continue to use it and sell it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, this product is yet another Multilevel Marketing program that requires you to \\&quot;buy in\\&quot; to a distributorship and you only get a small percentage of profit from each sale.</li>
            <li> Perhaps one of the other reviewers can provide this information.  </li>
            <li> not sure when the product actually arrived.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Yesterday I also started using this cream on my breasts due to stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> So for 80.00 a month I get one thing, and it does what all these other&#x27;s claim to do..</li>
            <li> I decided to stop using it and did tons of research and started using other products....</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed and have seen better results with drug store</li>
            <li> I posted a comment the other day after seeing the video they posted with couple of scientists who are endorsing the product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure at this point though if I would spend another $100 for a second bottle.</li>
            <li> More like it was clogging my pores, and it stinks!</li>
            <li> My customers cancelled for 2 reasons, one because they were not seeing the results promised and the other is that the bottle of product lasts about 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I was not using any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I only wrote because of all the reviews/replies I&#x27;ve read that are telling people who wrote that they have reactions/rashes that they were not believable or were lying or were working for another company.</li>
            <li> i had several injections from the dermatologist and while they were improved, they were still very present, ugly, and that particular one was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a real make-up oriented person</li>
            <li> Some of these people have loose skin in before photos and totally tight skin after-</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little surprised at the negative comments I see.  </li>
            <li> I have to be very careful with any product or makeup that promises \\&quot;pore minimizer\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So I was not happy to here of something new.</li>
            <li> and frankly I&#x27;d have to agree with them that paying $600 for minor results and 6 months of a nightly routine is just plain a rip</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that within just a few minutes after applying my skin feels dry as dust.  </li>
            <li> While a lot of people on these reviews have said it has a terrible odor, I find the scent to be pleasant.  </li>
            <li> cells\\&quot; how can it be called anti-aging &amp; what other cells does it \\&quot;kill\\&quot; on the way down?  </li>
            <li> I spend less on this one product than I did on the combination of all of the other 4 combined.</li>
            <li> My skin did look slightly smoother in the morning after using the product at night, but I think that was just a temporary tightening effect due to the consistency of the product, since that went away as soon as I washed my face.  </li>
            <li> Based on the way they have handled my situation, they are a company that is built on greed and shady ethics because a company built on honesty takes responsibility for the good and the bad and does not ignore serious complaints but grows from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and  they look at least 10 years younger too.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am very nervous to try anything</li>
            <li> The dark circle under my eyes improves noticeably.  </li>
            <li> and he also said I would stop immediately and even in small amounts with long term use you canhave side effects .&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> I tried Nerium for 4 days and noticed one of my dark sun spots on my face was almost gone</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not worth the effort or the money.</li>
            <li> My husband started using it as well and had improvement in sun damage - dark spots on forehead drastically reduced and disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Seriously not worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty shocked actually!</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> for me, this product is not worth $110.00 or</li>
            <li> Then the dark circles under my eyes went away.</li>
            <li> If you have redness before using product I would really consider not using it because it made my redness worse!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product is not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> The smell was awful too, but I could have tolerated that if the cream was actually good.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love it, but don&#x27;t absolutely hate it</li>
            <li> Soo have been trying a few products here and there with not much luck.</li>
            <li> Waste of money with absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> Imagine someone selling a Bentley in a manner that you sell an old broken down jalopy.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t put the price down..</li>
            <li> I went down the acutane road years ago, off and on antibiotics all these years and even now at 50</li>
            <li> and she said what do you use write it down for me .</li>
            <li> I REALLY do NOT Like this cream!!</li>
            <li> As the owner of Cornerstone Wellness Center in Monterey, CA for the past 18 years, I am extremely picky when it comes to the products I use in my practice.  </li>
            <li> Few other details were provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not have any of the dryness or flaking of skin mentioned in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Also the scent is a bit odd</li>
            <li> She raved about the product but said she could care less if, after one week, I didn&#x27;t want to buy it.</li>
            <li> This treatment didn&#x27;t make me break out, minimized my pores, no breakouts, less redness...</li>
            <li> My suggestion to users would be to put it on damp skin before bed, you can use less serum and it seems to hold the moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make any difference, but I was using less product.</li>
            <li> I have less breakouts and less redness.</li>
            <li> and my forehead wrinkles are slightly diminished, this isn&#x27;t the fountain of youth everyone else claims.</li>
            <li> but none the less my comment was removed.</li>
            <li> The scent may be slightly off-putting to some, it smells a bit musky/plant-like.</li>
            <li> Nerium worked for me after less than 30 days use...amazing how it softened my skin and eased the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I have high sales resistence and frankly, am skeptical (aren&#x27;t we all?)  </li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> Went to the dermatologist to get medicine this time,we tried a few more things and with no luck my eyes always looked horrible the next day.</li>
            <li> There were definitely changes, but they were not good ones.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It felt tight when I put it on and in the morning my chin was dry&lt;</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel tight and sticky.</li>
            <li> This entire process stinks of \\&quot;pyramid scheme.\\&quot; Since the \\&quot;gathering\\&quot; I have spoken with several other attendees and not one of them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a month</li>
            <li> If even a little worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little line around eyes are gone...</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted a little over a month.</li>
            <li> and I have not needed the extremely toxic harsh prescription cream!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> Although I was a little dizzy, I decided to try Nerium again on Day 4.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell does take a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of 80.00.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> But I have gone from wearing heavy heavy concealer and makeup to wearing almost no make up and NO</li>
            <li> Results can be seen in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I plan to keep using it and take another picture in another few weeks and see what difference I see again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you can have a piss poor sales techniquedoom the customer experience before the customer even has a chance to make an objective decision.  </li>
            <li> For a few weeks I felt that my skin was a bit smoother, then no improvement beyond that.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a few days and voila... rash disappeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not cheap -- if a product works, I&#x27;ll spend the money.</li>
            <li> dead horse in the morning.</li>
            <li> I did not wash it off, but the thought crossed my mind a few</li>
            <li> It dried the heck out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> but it was a few hours of discomfort in the evening</li>
            <li> but one size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> The only reason it gives the appearance of \\&quot;reduced wrinkles\\&quot; is from the edema (swelling) caused by the irritating ingredient Oleander.  </li>
            <li> Some people can see the results in few days ,some in few weeks,but you will see it!DON\\&quot;T USE NERIUM</li>
            <li> I have read that there has been some trials for oleander being used for skin cancer to destroy cancerous cells.</li>
            <li> and I personally stand behind the product as well.  </li>
            <li> Someone needs to understandthat everyone doesn&#x27;t roll over and play dead because they get the runarounds from companies.</li>
            <li> I quit selling a few months ago because I didn&#x27;t believe in the product anymore and all of my \\&quot;preferred customers\\&quot; cancelled their accounts</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product at first.  </li>
            <li> Nerium dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Although I have seen dramatic decreases in friends&#x27; deep lines.</li>
            <li> Hey, everyone&#x27;s skin is different so for some people to see dramatic results within a week-</li>
            <li> I expected at LEAST A SMALL CHANGE for the $100 price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore if you google it and reasearch the info about the company-their \\&quot;research\\&quot; is highly suspect and their claims are absolutely crazy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sheishido for the past 10years cost me over 400$ a set , a few month ago my friends refered to Nerium AD 30days</li>
            <li> if you try to post any negative comment or any comment that asks for proof of their claims,  your post will be taken down.</li>
            <li> I had little bumps all over my skin!</li>
            <li> I am also very sensitive to smells and have stopped using products because all artificial ingredient smells make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> Thought as soon as I try it, it will be no good and will have to sell the other</li>
            <li> But since I do see a little difference I will at least keep using it until the bottle is out.  </li>
            <li> People who feel compelled to post bad/negitive posts are usually haters with lots of spare time ...</li>
            <li> [I&#x27;m not exactly sure how that makes me trustworthy but for some reason in my mind it seemed to when I typed it.]  </li>
            <li> I finally called (8 minutes on the phone) and was told I sent it to the wrong e-mail address.</li>
            <li> She had used it for 5 to 7 days, not sure, but I could see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical but tried it anyway.  </li>
            <li> where I used to break out monthly (ahem), that has not happened the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> Folks, I want you to know I was skeptical, as the review below would indicate, but after actually using the product, I have done a 180 on my opinion of it.  </li>
            <li> Chocolate is poision for dogs, but it isnt stopping me from eating it everyday!</li>
            <li> But considering the price, not sure I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Overall just not impressed.</li>
            <li> applied on my damp face and neck every night and rinsed off in the morning before applying usual moisturizer and&lt;br /&gt;make</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a small percentage of people that have allergic reactions to products on the market</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s unfortunate that those that do decide to personally attack the company.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This plant is deadly and toxic!  </li>
            <li> It made my skin so dry I couldn&#x27;t stand it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard for me to believe because of the dramatic results I see in myself, but still other people I know have little or no result</li>
            <li> I had to try it though because it was less expensive than other name brands.  </li>
            <li> In person, the rep (who I will call Joanie - not her real name) actually has one of the worst cases of bags I&#x27;ve seen on a woman</li>
            <li> You wasted the $30 extra a month because of your stupidity, not the company.&lt;br /&gt;SEVENTH...</li>
            <li> Nerium has no cleanser, toner or day moisturizer, so in my search for a product that was compatible with Nerium, I discovered TreSkinRX, which uses the very same Medical grade Aloe Vera as a base, and was formulated by a Board Certified Plastic/Cosmetic Surgeon.</li>
            <li> youth\\&quot; society, so I think that anyone who would spend $100 on any face goop is pretty stupid.  </li>
            <li> I was in the Marines for four (4) years and after recruit training and drilling in the sun long days, my face failed to have an even tone for YEARS.  </li>
            <li> Can I tell you exactly how much I HATE this product?</li>
            <li> , however, my skin has a noticeable evenness to it that I have never experienced with any other product, and I have bought them all!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, despite the common \\&quot;poisonous\\&quot; designation of this plant, very few toxic events in humans have been reported.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very pleasant going to bed, smelling of rotten bananas.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to decide who&#x27;s telling the truth.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;another miracle serum\\&quot; you might save you hard earned dollars for something else.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> and I could hardly wait to apply renutrive to soften up my skin.  </li>
            <li> review was written pursuant to an Amazon Verified Purchase and&lt;br /&gt;all of the 5 star reviews did not make a verified amazon purchase.&lt;br /&gt;That is telling to me (for an otherwise hard to find product).</li>
            <li> I tried so hard NOT to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding products\\&quot;, I warned.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel a little nauseated when I apply it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to look like an adult with bad acne for $80 a bottle and automatic renewal.</li>
            <li> She felt really bad and now warns people if they have sensitive skin to proceed with caution, but she still sells it and believes in it.</li>
            <li> At least 30 days!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> How do they get the suckers to think the product is working ?    </li>
            <li> As a cancer drug (Anvrizil), it&#x27;s produced negligible results and caused at least two known deaths.  </li>
            <li> I am a beauty product sucker, so I agreed to try it.</li>
            <li> I have read the negative posts and have to say -</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with the negative reviews</li>
            <li> She also told me to go to your website to file a complaint .There</li>
            <li> Rating should be NO stars, but this sight made me pick at least one star......</li>
            <li> BUT, for some people, Rogaine has no noticeable effect or even a negative effect.  </li>
            <li> I used it for at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> If you are that sucks, but it&#x27;s not the companys fault.</li>
            <li> .. yes, it sucks that you tried a product that didnt work for you and lost some money.</li>
            <li> Well it turns out it had Formaldehyde levels totally off the charts and was extremly dangerous for stylists to be using.</li>
            <li> least I have been faithful about washing my face every night.</li>
            <li> Then I ran into someone who told me that they had a friend who had actually written negative blogs to support the skin company they were working for, as Nerium is cheaper than their company&#x27;s product and it was cutting into the profit margin.</li>
            <li> All the negative reviews astound me.</li>
            <li> otherwise, as I said at least twice before, get a facelift.</li>
            <li> All the receipt stated was that at least 70% of the product must be used before it could be returned.  </li>
            <li> quits working after a few months your face looks worse if it&#x27;s winter and no moisture in the air..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still is thinning slowly, but I just notice that it falls out faster if I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;FOURTH...if you werent educated about how to apply to product correctly or didnt go on youtube and watch, dont whine about it being thick and goopy.</li>
            <li> It isnt thick on your skin, oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> I went back to the salon and gave the remainder of the bottle back to my hairdresser and told her I would not be purchasing this stuff, that I had had a very bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> Just because you dont care for it doesnt mean the product sucks.</li>
            <li> and it did absolutely nothing except make my eyes swell and, due to the horrific odor,</li>
            <li> I have an eye condition that requires conscious care and can be painful and serious if I don&#x27;t pay attention, so I&#x27;m grateful for the \\&quot;warning labels\\&quot; posted here.</li>
            <li> No more bags or wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> but that doesnt mean I am going to continue to apply it.</li>
            <li> Does that mean they should run all over the internet and try to convince people that it doesn&#x27;t work?  </li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t waste money!!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results!</li>
            <li> Dont believe everything you see on TV and just because its not on TV doesnt mean its not legit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not OK to use people in this manner in the name of the almighty dollar!</li>
            <li> I give the pyramid 2 stars because it is very difficult to find enough pigeons to pay the $100 .   </li>
            <li> I used the product as instructed and although the flaky appearance stopped, my wrinkles seemed to get worse, not better.  </li>
            <li> VERY EXPENSIVE five part daily routine.</li>
            <li> Well when I used the prescribed Retin A as directed with the medical spa&#x27;s product line it caused terrible acne and deep sores on my face.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> the proponents of Nerium that have a serious problem with people posting it doesn&#x27;t work for them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Turgor is the tense condition of the cells and capillaries found in the layers of your skin.  </li>
            <li> the adverse reaction was told that it was too bad that I had a problem that because it was beyond the initial 30 day trial period that they could no longer do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Its not flowers, but its not that bad and totally goes away once it dries...</li>
            <li> definitely not a good investment.</li>
            <li> Will never use this harsh, expensive product again.</li>
            <li> Also I have used Nerium on my eczema breakouts and let me tell you, I was shocked by the next morning results.</li>
            <li> I discontinued use and still have painful bumps now, over a week later.  </li>
            <li> , I started getting woken up in the middle of the night from feeling sick to my stomach from the stench.</li>
            <li> Small solace but the rash it also left under my eyebrow is not as awful as it was a few  weeks</li>
            <li> It is NOT a pleasant smell at all</li>
            <li> If it is not applied properly, it is not as remarkable as one would like.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t work on wrinkles, but it smells odd and there must be something in it that does not agree with me, because every time I apply it, I become SAD!</li>
            <li> I have never had a bad complexion, but of course at my age expected to start getting some wrinkles.</li>
            <li> In spite of bad smell and funky consistency, I started to use the product and noticed no real benefits but continued to use it because I had it and wanted to give it a chance I  receiving monthly shipments @</li>
            <li> but when i got all my products out and counted what I had spent, I was shocked.</li>
            <li> This product broke me out horribly, and in a way I&#x27;ve never broken out before either.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of the toxic effect of nerium using it in this product as I would if I ate it.</li>
            <li> cause me to wake up nauseated at night.</li>
            <li> Not for the life of me, if these people who said these things arent dermatologists who are upset because no one will buy their expensive products or just negative people, I dont know.  </li>
            <li> I hate that I fell for a product that can only sell through MLM.</li>
            <li> After speaking with another user,  I found that this is not uncommon.    </li>
            <li> Theres much worse smells out</li>
            <li> so it was a bit worse before the transformation took place.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES YOU LOOK WORSE</li>
            <li> - am a bit suspicious of the pyramid-marketing structure behind Nerium.</li>
            <li> lines\\&quot;  where you have to have 3 -5 jars of \\&quot;STUFF\\&quot; in order for the company to stand behind their products.  </li>
            <li> Sad to see negative comments about Nerium.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, if some of you had a negative dealing with your Nerium rep.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> , I asked her what was her \\&quot;secret</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t look as tired as I had been.  </li>
            <li> just like all scams do but just remember their unethical business practice and buyer beware the product it poor</li>
            <li> this product is false and misleading.</li>
            <li> but all of the claims are false.</li>
            <li> First impression, in stinks, &amp; I hated the consistency.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, the texture was like concrete, &amp; the cost was outrageous.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, I was hoping for less wrinkles, but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for 2 months and have seen dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I never leave bad reviews but this product is waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I also had 4 small milia (google it if unsure of what this is) that were very difficult to get out of my skin.</li>
            <li> but I hated the \\&quot;Howdy-Doody\\&quot;  facial lines and my turkey waddle neck</li>
            <li> Would rather use other products than this $80-$100 bottle a month of crap.</li>
            <li> Sagging of aging skin is a difficult issue that creams and serums are not going to have a dramatic effect on....</li>
            <li> He was SO rude, insulting, condescending and extremely unprofessional.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use bad language or was rude in any way</li>
            <li> But, call me skeptical....</li>
            <li> Not only did nerium do nothing for my pores, it made me break out horribly!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t, it got worse!</li>
            <li> Somehow it triggered a horrible reaction that continued for several weeks even after I stopped using the product.  </li>
            <li> It is way too expensive for me to even join their program.  </li>
            <li> It is way too expensive for me to even join their program.  </li>
            <li> Weird to me</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for people that have been sucked in.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it just did do one thing for me.</li>
            <li> The consistency is similar to clay and it smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;We are sorry for your loss of funds in regards to your Jan &amp; Feb shipments.</li>
            <li> It is completely illegal to be purchasing online</li>
            <li> It is expensive and does not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I did.</li>
            <li> $ don&#x27;t try it, something is wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> So sorry it didn&#x27;t work out for some of you.</li>
            <li> NERIUM believes I am going away, they are sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> so EVERYONE can see that there is the possibility for a reaction before someone ends up going blind, or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Every time I would go get my hair done, it was like sitting through an hour long infomercial about this stupid cream!!  </li>
            <li> I must say that I am very disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t work for me because I had spent months thinking about it.</li>
            <li> U don&#x27;t make that if the product were bad or company were not great.</li>
            <li> I am 43 and 3 years ago had a horrible reaction to a medical spa&#x27;s very expensive product line.  </li>
            <li> Not a great way of doing business and preventing bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I hated the pulling tight feeling on my skin!</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;friend\\&quot; who relentlessly pushes this crap on me, in spite of my repeatedly telling her I have a serious allergy to Oleander.  </li>
            <li> but since I had been through such a horrible ordeal I wanted anyone who may have had acne or a bad experience to not be afraid to try it</li>
            <li> It deserves negative stars!!!</li>
            <li> The serum  feels terrible on your skin; the company makes promises that are not true.</li>
            <li> So it smells bad, does not work, and its too expensive.  </li>
            <li> and i was weary and hesitant to try it but desperate for a remedy that was w/o burning my face yet again.</li>
            <li> Im afraid to quit now</li>
            <li> Is she stone cold deaf or just plain stupid?!  </li>
            <li> my skin looked worse!!</li>
            <li> They were wrong!</li>
            <li> it is the worst of the worst when it comes to a direct sales organization.</li>
            <li> I started on this product and was very skeptical after trying everything that said it would reduce wrinkles, age spots, and sun spots.</li>
            <li> &quot;  Even if a $400,000 car is staring you in the face for $200 you&#x27;d be convinced there was something very wrong with it if it were being sold that way.</li>
            <li> A VERY expensive experience.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical so a friend gave me a bottle...</li>
            <li> complaint is it smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously!!!</li>
            <li> When I told him about it, he said \\&quot; its pulling all the bad stuff out of your skin\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li> I found the product to smell bad and sting my face.</li>
            <li> Bad product, Bad customer service, Scam.</li>
            <li> I used it like I was supposed to (and by the way, some reviews said it smells bad...</li>
            <li> Bad as it was close to three weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> My face still stings but the redness is not as bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce any bad results though.</li>
            <li> OMG this sh*t is bad, itchjy as hell, and for three days</li>
            <li> one else EVER had a reaction\\&quot; which, as you will see in FB, others have had some bad reactions and NERIUM blew them off as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i however returned it...because the smell was so horrific it made me sick to my stomach, worse my pores were being clogged creating blackheads and breakouts</li>
            <li> I am so sick to my stomach from the smell alone</li>
            <li> Soooooooop disappointed.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s what I get for being so vain.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Nerium was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> If you paying a $110 everymonth you didnt do your research and are stupid for complaining about cost.</li>
            <li> I usually hate putting creams on my face because it makes me break out.  </li>
            <li> NO, its all the crap getting out of my face and it will pass...</li>
            <li> However, after a week my face broke out, all over, in terrible painful acne.  </li>
            <li> and I was shocked to see the results!  </li>
            <li> and I hated it.</li>
            <li> I have very very bad sun damaged.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in the results.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It made my nose stuffy and smells awful.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t the heart to tell her this stuff is terrible.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this lotion is just terrible!  </li>
            <li> I heaved and then realized that this awful smell smells like Nerium!  </li>
            <li> MLM is a ruthless business with Liars and cheat&#x27;s !!</li>
            <li> and  that the smell is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Well, after three days of using it my skin erupted in the worst case of acne I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> People talking about how horrific the smell is??</li>
            <li> Worst smelling product ever!!</li>
            <li> I find this absolutely horrible customer service.  </li>
            <li> There are some chemicals, but not that are terribly toxic.  </li>
            <li> I have the worst combination skin EVER!</li>
            <li> CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL.</li>
            <li> These are not my blogs, but they helped me understand why my skin is so BAD!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible, horrible way of doing business.</li>
            <li> Terrible!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used it once &amp; had a horrible allergic reaction that shut my eyes,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s insulting &amp; it&#x27;s a lie!</li>
            <li> and my eyes looked horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I luckily only used the 7 day trial for Nerium.  This product broke me out horribly, and in a way I&#x27;ve never broken out before either.  I got red blemishes all over my nose (never had this happen before) and larger pimples around my mouth.  I am SO happy I didn&#x27;t fall into the scheme of buying this product and losing just about $100.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and my face broke out in a horrendous rash&lt;br /&gt;It felt tight when I put it on and in the morning my chin was dry&lt;br /&gt;It cracked and is oozing&lt;br /&gt;Oleander is a strong poison&lt;br /&gt;Put in on the largest organ of your body at your own risk&lt;br /&gt;These reviews are by multi level marketers&lt;br /&gt;They want you to buy and convince 4 friends&lt;br /&gt;It is not FDA approved and not approved at all in Canada BE WARE!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I notice the improvement in my skin - especially around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I am in the sun a lot so even with 50 block I am aging more quickly than I would like.  This stuff works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 45 days and can really see an improvement! I was experiencing some sagging along my jawline/smile area and now, due to firming of the skin, they are starting to be much less noticeable. I saw my dermatologist this week and she said that my face looked great! I am excited to see how it looks after 90 days!</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try Nerium, and so glad I did. I purchased a bottle about a month ago for the first time. I apply it at night on damp skin, rinse off in morning, and then apply my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I smoked for 16 years and started noticing smoker lines about a year ago, I also have smile lines. The wrinkles have not disappeared but have reduced significantly.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you take your before/after photo.. You will see a differnce....&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I gave nerium a try, and can&#x27;t wait to see more results...&lt;br /&gt;The smell does take a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li> There are so many negative reviews and so many positive it&#x27;s hard to decide who&#x27;s telling the truth. All I can say is it has worked great for myself 46 year old male and my my who&#x27;s over 80. My Mom wouldn&#x27;t touch it when I first got it. I had her try on one arm and hand. 1 week later she tried on her face and neck. It&#x27;s been a little over a month and she can&#x27;t stop raving about how great Nerium is. We have both seen great results.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible that it doesn&#x27;t work for some people nothing does. However it is definitely worth a try. You can get it for a month risk free from a brand partner. Give it a try and see for your self.  Most people always post negative reviews and not positive ones its human nature.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Nerium AD but I was still not really expecting a lot of results from a night cream.  I had to try it though because it was less expensive than other name brands.  I used it for 7 days every night and I was shocked to see the results!  I have tried many higher priced products and I have not seen this kind of results in such a short time.  I have now been using it for 24 days and I continue to see more and more reduction in my wrinkles and even the redness in my face.  I am sold on Nerium AD.  Finally a natural product that gives me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> If you go to Paula&#x27;s website and read what is in this yet \\&quot;another miracle serum\\&quot; you might save you hard earned dollars for something else.&lt;br /&gt;In Europe we know that pregnant women should not be near this plant!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a couple of weeks. I am too vain to do before and after pictures. The first morning after I used it my wrinkles on my upper lip were GONE! They are still gone and my skin is baby soft and it appears to be helping my rosacea. I did not have any of the dryness or flaking of skin mentioned in previous reviews. I am still debating on whether or not to start selling it. I am not much of a people person (I have social anxiety) and the nice lady and gentleman who gave me the bottle I am using attend lots of meetings. I am not sure it is worth it for me to have to take a Xanax to go to a meeting or, God forbid, pitch the product to a group of people. I am also debating on whether to use my husband as my guinea pig for the before and after pics. I guess I need to think about it some more.</li>
            <li> A good price. I am stocking up on this product. Thank you. I have already tried it and loved the results. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old male and am amazed at the results of this product. I&#x27;ve only used it for 60 days with astounding results. I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  It is Way Overpriced. Company promises results that are Deceiving. Customer Service lacks \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; and if you want to talk with someone on the phone, be prepared to hold for 20 minutes. The serum  feels terrible on your skin; the company makes promises that are not true. You will be tempted to keep receiving shipments, believing that it will eventually show results.  By the time you realize it is not going to work, you have spent $300 to $500. If you do buy it, and want to return it, be sure to ask for it Quickly.  Because, They Will Reject all requests for returns if you don&#x27;t get it back to them in their time frame. They will not give you your money back.  I have one shipment that I never opened and they will not take it back.&lt;br /&gt;I regret ever hearing of this product.  it is a rip off. definitely not a good investment. I am going to report them to the BBB and contact my credit card company to dispute the charges. When I told them this, they did not care.</li>
            <li> I started on this product and was very skeptical after trying everything that said it would reduce wrinkles, age spots, and sun spots. So, I was pleasantly surprised when this product actually did what it said it would do. I am a loyal customer and will continue to be. I spend less on this one product than I did on the combination of all of the other 4 combined. You have to follow the instructions and use it continually.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law gave me a bottle to try for free. So, free is free , I&#x27;ll try. I&#x27;m 52 and have only a few wrinkles but big pores and some bumps and crevices. She did not say much, except- try it and let me know what you think, she also gave me instructions on how to use it. That evening I tried it. The smell was not repulsive but a bit too strong for my taste and it felt a little drying, but this feeling left along with the smell in about half an hour.In the morning my skin felt fine, so I washed my face as instructed and applied my daytime cream( I alternate between DermaOrganics and strivectin spf 20). My pores around nose seemed to be smaller but I wasn&#x27;t sure. After two more days I started to get compliments from people that I look good. My make up was flawless as my crevices disappeared and pores got smaller.So I&#x27;m pleased and I signed up as customer. I&#x27;m not a big fan of multi level marketing but the product worked for me. I gave it 4 stars not 5 because of the strong smell and the high price, but then again if it works I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> A friend of my convinced me to try the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed puffiness around the eyes.  I did not discontinue use.  ( My friend was pressuring me to continue.)  I continue to use it. Then, not only did I wake up with Red puffy eyes,but, now there was Puss oozing from my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does work on reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  But,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out for Allergic Reactions!</li>
            <li> Have known 3 people who have been using Nerium Ad for over 6months. I nor any of them can ever phathom not using it.  I would go without electricity before I go without this!&lt;br /&gt;Also the girl that signed me up on the \\&quot;auto prefered customer $80/mo plan\\&quot;  is making $17000.00/mo part time (as she is also a attorney)  as a Top ranking nerium director level driving her company Lexus Bonus car. U don&#x27;t make that if the product were bad or company were not great. People who feel compelled to post bad/negitive posts are usually haters with lots of spare time ...</li>
            <li> I purchased from a salon and used for 30 days and felt it definitely improved the fine lines and coloration.  Additionally it did not make me break out like most products.  I read through the poor reviews and think that people may just be expecting too much.  If you want major changes see the Plastic surgeon.  Others may be allergic.  I have researched the ingredients and not everyone can tolerate it.  I definitely noticed a difference each morning.  Key is to use as designed and not think if you use more or leave it on longer it will work better. Just my thoughts.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old &amp; have been a licensed, reputable esthetician for 12 years &amp; am also a registered nurse. I own my own skin care salon &amp; do not \\&quot;stock\\&quot; any products for sale. My business has grown because of client satisfaction, trust &amp; referrals. I am NOT currently a Nerium customer or brand partner. I was given a free bottle of Nerium AD by my building owner/designer for me to try for myself because of my experience with several product lines to see what I thought. I am very low pressure sales-if a customer asks for a skin care line after a facial, I tell them what I use but if I think that another product would better suit them, even if it over the counter, I will always act in their best interest(I use Bioelement during facials). I also realize that some products aren&#x27;t for everyone. I do have to say that I was wowed by Nerium. It lasted 38 days using 4 pumps a day. It was so easy to use-1 step after you wash your face (I use cetaphil) &amp; I noticed a visible reduction of fine &amp; deeper lines (nasolabial folds)as well as my pores appearing smaller &amp; more clear &amp; my makeup goes on like silk. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with breakout or rash (however my skin is not very sensitive). This is the first product that I have considered carrying because it makes skin care simple &amp; I saw proven results. The only drawbacks I saw were the way it is marketed since I am not a big \\&quot;sales\\&quot; girl &amp; I think people may wince a bit at $95 monthly. Also the scent is a bit odd but you put it on right before bed so it was not bothersome. But Nerium eliminated the steps &amp; cost of using multiple products &amp; I truly loved the results. I haven&#x27;t decided if I will become a brand partner or just a customer but I will be looking further into Nerium-it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because the one star review I read was in a nutshell nothing more than an uneducated complaint. I have been using this product for over a month and have noticed amazing results. An improvement in my appearance, fine lines and wrinkles, was noticeable after 5 days and dramatically different after 4 weeks. My skin was smoother, and more even toned. After 14 days I looked in the mirror and honestly believed that I looked 25...I am 35 as of now. All the ingredients in NeriumAD are not harsh. NeriumAD has not been tested on animals. And while this product has only been on the market since 2011 it has been in research for years. I did my research through the company. There are no parabens...the &#x27;parfum&#x27; on the bottle is derived from cucumbers. While the main ingredient nerium oleander is known to be a toxic plant...every parent is warned not to let their kids go near this plant...nerium biotechnology has been able to extract the beneficial parts of this plant and use it. It is not toxic. I have not experienced any of the toxic effect of nerium using it in this product as I would if I ate it. I&#x27;m telling you this product works. It is not evident to me if the 1 star reviewer used this product but I can tell you that everyone I know that has used it has LOVED it!! Just be sure to take your before pic!!!</li>
            <li> I understand the lack of knowledge of certain people, Nerium AD it is not made with  direct sap of the Nerium Oleander plant. The scientist of Nerium Biotechnology are utilizing a breakthrough patent-pending technology NBio-PL² (tm) (Nerium Biotechnology - Plant to Plant) extraction process that combines the unique beneficial properties of the Nerium plant and the known beneficial properties of Aloe Vera  For more information see this link:  [...]    Nerium AD is a priceless commodity and should not be sold under $100.00 USD because it is not a discounted merchandise price.  Compare to \\&quot;La Praire sold at $3000 a jar\\&quot; or even more \\&quot;Angle and Weightman face cream sales at $10,000 a jar\\&quot; and finally, \\&quot;RéVive Intesite Voluminizing Serium at $600 oz\\&quot; THEY PROVIDE THE SAME RESULTS AS OUR NERIUM AD. I believe that Nerium International should prohibited the sale of the product in eBay and other cheap internet malls.    MrG. Arcadia California</li>
            <li> I suffered from adult acne which left a lot of scarring that I was very self conscious about. I tried peels and retinol, glycolic acid to no avail. I used the product for 4 days and immediately saw one of the craters near my eyebrow dissipate. After 30 days my cheeks look almost clear. I can&#x27;t believe it! Even my grandmother who is an aesthetician is amazed.</li>
            <li> I met a friendly lady in a department store a few days ago. She raved about the product but said she could care less if, after one week, I didn&#x27;t want to buy it. I&#x27;ve always taken care of my skin and folks tell me I look younger than my 65 years, including this woman. One week? Sure. Didn&#x27;t expect any magic dust; read the label - seemed safe. But, call me skeptical.... Is it worth $80? Is it really that phenomenal? So, I looked up the reviews and clinical info. I am SO GLAD I DID. I noticed a pattern. Half the reviews are positive - especially for people who have used the product for more than a month. However, most of the reviews 3 stars and less include complaints of allergic reactions, dryness, problems around the eyes, or other uncomfortable results. This can&#x27;t be anomalous. I have an eye condition that requires conscious care and can be painful and serious if I don&#x27;t pay attention, so I&#x27;m grateful for the \\&quot;warning labels\\&quot; posted here. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was truly amazed at the results I saw in the reductions of my wrinkles and red on my face and neck. Anyone who has said a negative comment about this product obviously hasn&#x27;t really tried Nerium AD. I have gotten my mom and two friends on Nerium AD and they are loving it just as much as I am. I just apply it on a damp face after I have washed my face every night.  In the morning I rinse my face off and apply my normal SPF skin protection and makeup.  I love how soft my skin feels in the morning.  Thank you Nerium for giving me my youthful skin back.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. Thank you for two and my best friend she&#x27;s been getting Botox My skin has been dry  for the last several years but now it&#x27;s able to hold moisture. Used it on  my hands and  they look at least 10 years younger too. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I must say that I am very disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t work for me because I had spent months thinking about it. Lots of people on my Facebook sell this and kept posting about how amazing it is and putting up pictures of other people who tried it and loved it. I came on here and read a lot of mixed reviews (most of the positive ones I suspect are people who sell the product). I didn&#x27;t want to purchase this product and be one of the people it doesn&#x27;t work for. I&#x27;m so glad I found someone to give me a sample because I would have been wasting my money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I was hoping it would be more like a cream, but after putting it on it felt more like a mask. It made my skin feel tight and sticky. And the next morning I woke up to swollen eyes and no change in my face. Still, I wanted to give it time to work so I continued to use it. Night after night, and no results. My eyes continued to swell up and felt dry in the mornings so I discontinued use after 5 days. I still have some product left, but I am not interested in using it. Even if I had seen some results, I don&#x27;t think I would have continued with it. I like my face to feel clean and smooth before bed and this just feels uncomfortable. And all I was looking for was reduction in pore size. (I&#x27;m 25) Didn&#x27;t happen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some amazing results in pictures, but, at a closer glance I noticed that some of them look photoshopped and the after pictures appear blurrier than the before pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this works for some people, but I&#x27;m not one of them. I would definitely recommend trying a sample before you dish up the dough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I know the Nerium people will say \\&quot;But you have to give it time!!! At least 30 days!!\\&quot; Well, when I&#x27;ve tried other new products, I noticed an immediate difference in my skin the very next day. Not anything drastic, but SOMETHING. With Nerium, nothing. If even a little worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> quits working after a few months your face looks worse if it&#x27;s winter and no moisture in the air.. good for a few months but best to quit after that</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and have faithfully moisturized my face daily since high school.  I have never had a bad complexion, but of course at my age expected to start getting some wrinkles. When a friend gave me the Nerium AD to try I was not expecting much change since I was already using a great product or so I thought. I was also nervous because I tend to have allergic reactions to many moisturizers and lotions. After just 5 days I could see results and after two weeks it was really amazing the difference Nerium AD has made.  It has diminished my wrinkles tremendously and my skin feels smoother. I also had a few dark places from too much sun and they are also going away. I have had no adverse skin reactions whatsoever.  I love Nerium AD and will never be without it! I&#x27;m sure different people have different result--I&#x27;m just so happy that Nerium AD works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium night cream for about 2 months.  This product actually really works.  I have skipped a night here or there but that doesn&#x27;t matter.  I apply to my face at night all over and the decloté.  Making sure I hit the areas that I want it to work, the eyes, pores on nose, wrinkles around the mouth and my sagging neck.  Since then, under my eyes have completely smoothed out!  No more bags or wrinkles!  Despite what I read in a negative review, it doesn&#x27;t smell so great and the consistency is weird, but WHO CARES!!  IT WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;Just turning 50, I&#x27;m all about finding what works.  I&#x27;m a celebrity Hairstylist in Los Angeles and I work with a lot of Make up Artists who know what is the latestest and best product out there.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product for the rest of my life.  Just give it time.  The deeper the lines take a little more time.  Be patient and watch your wrinkles disappear!</li>
            <li> I am 74 and have been using Estee Lauder renutrive since I was 25.  I recently  had a life lift and my skin looks pretty good.  I wanted something to perhaps prevent wrinkles coming back after my life lift or maybe smoothing out the few tiny ones that remained after my life lift.  Nerium was very disappointing.  When i applied it, it felt very dry like a face mask and in the morning my skin felt even more dry with tiny wrinkles under my eyes and I could hardly wait to apply renutrive to soften up my skin.  I used it for 30 days and saw not even the slightest improvement..  Apparently it works for some women and not for others.  Thank goodness they offer a 30 day trial.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would suggest to the nerium manufacturers, is change the bottle to a plastic tube.  I cannot pump any more out but I am sure there is nerium at the bottom of the bottle.,</li>
            <li> I didnt like it at all. I didnt see any difference in my skin and i didnt like the smell. It made my skin feel tight and dry.  It was a waste of 80.00. And i cant det my money back. I was required to do a star rating so i checked one star. In all honesty i would give this product no stars.</li>
            <li> The product works as good as a decent bar of soap .  It tightens and cleans the skin .  A bar of good natural soap will last much longer for $5.    I have worked many mlm&#x27;s and this one is no different .  I give the pyramid 2 stars because it is very difficult to find enough pigeons to pay the $100 .   The product gets 1 star because it is basically a scam .     When the pigeons do buy the product , they usually give it up in three months because they wise up .                    How do they get the suckers to think the product is working ?    It&#x27;s all about the technique of the application .                Wash face thoroughly ,  dry face , apply Nerium and leave it on overnight .                   Guess what , you get the same results from good soap .   Don&#x27;t believe me ?  Try this technique with good soap .</li>
            <li> A friend of mine became a brand manager.  Being open to beauty products, I went to her party. It made my nose stuffy and smells awful.  I had to leave the room to get air.  I haven&#x27;t the heart to tell her this stuff is terrible.  The photos looked fake to me - and that&#x27;s easy to do.  Then I did the research on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made using an extract from a toxic plant called Nerium Oleander.  This is toxic in a deadly way See the link below from the American Cancer Society. I can&#x27;t recommend the product and I would never use it.  Oleander sap is a known skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who sell it say that it&#x27;s FDA approved, but that&#x27;s only as a cancer drug. The FDA doesn&#x27;t regulate beauty products(YET).  As a cancer drug (Anvrizil), it&#x27;s produced negligible results and caused at least two known deaths.  And yes, oleander is that bushy plant with the pretty flowers growing by the freeway in California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to read more, take a look at Wikipedia.  And just so you know, if you look at a website called Nerium Biotech, that&#x27;s the company that makes this stuff, so consider the source.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nerium! I&#x27;ve been using it for months and it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s ever worked on my acne scars on my face! I&#x27;ve tried Dermalogica, Philosophy, Dior, prescriptions... Nothing worked like Nerium has! People&#x27;s comments are incorrect in my eyes. If you want instant results, go get a face lift/botox. People get easily discouraged if they don&#x27;t see instant results! Even my husband who is African American uses and it&#x27;s dramatically improved his skin! Go Nerium!</li>
            <li> If it were up to me, I would give this product zero stars. I was drawn in by the representative&#x27;s own before and after pictures that in my opinion must have been altered or a misrepresentation. Additionally she promised it would do wonders for bags around the eyes. In person, the rep (who I will call Joanie - not her real name) actually has one of the worst cases of bags I&#x27;ve seen on a woman her age (47). Her before and after pictures didn&#x27;t show her eyes at all and my guess is because there was no improvement to show. She only showed a photograph of herself from the nose down that focused on the reduction of the size of a second chin. In my opinion, this looks more like weight loss or liposuction that as a result of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the cream for about 2 weeks and it did absolutely nothing except make my eyes swell and, due to the horrific odor, cause me to wake up nauseated at night. While the odor is unpleasant at first, it seems to have this cumulative effect that the more you use it, the worse it smells to the point of becoming unusable. Maybe at the beginning I was excited to try the product so I ignored the odor but using it night after night, I started getting woken up in the middle of the night from feeling sick to my stomach from the stench. Once I stopped using it, the nausea and the morning swelling of my eyes stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanie tried to convince me to become a preferred customer so I would go on auto ship and receive the product for $80 a month instead of $110 or $120 - I forget. She also tried to get me to recruit others to buy Nerium AD saying if 3 people bought I could get mine for free.She set up a website for me (against my better judgement) and when I examined their website, I saw in their documentation for how to have a \\&quot;Real Results Party\\&quot; so that others will buy, that they actually instruct you to tell people you have earned a free iPad, Lexus Car Bonus, etc. and they tell you not to worry if you haven&#x27;t earned these yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, everything about this company and this product is false and misleading. They promise a 30 day money back guaranty. I&#x27;m in the process of trying to get mine now and if this was a lie too, I will follow up with the better business bureau and keep you informed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Opinion - Stay as far away from Nerium and their reps as you can. it is the worst of the worst when it comes to a direct sales organization.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product...my skin has never looked or felt so good. Awesome product will continue to get it.</li>
            <li> we are having good results, my face spots are getting lighter. and the wrinkles on my husband face are looking less deep.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream and used it every night for a month, following the directions exactly.  I expected at LEAST A SMALL CHANGE for the $100 price.  Absolutely nothing!  It was a complete waste of my hard-earned money and time.  Don&#x27;t make my mistake, please.</li>
            <li> As you will see the plant is toxic when eaten, but not toxic if the extracts are used topically....RESEARCH!! before you make bold statements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ToxicityNerium oleander has historically been considered a poisonous plant based on a number of its compounds that may exhibit toxicity, especially to animals, when consumed in high amounts. Among these compounds are oleandrin and oleandrigenin, known as \\&quot;cardiac glycosides\\&quot; which are known to have a narrow therapeutic index and can be toxic when ingested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toxicity studies of animals administered oleander extract concluded that the rodent and avian species were observed to be relatively insensitive to oleander \\&quot;cardioactive glycosides\\&quot;.[8] Other mammals, however, such as dogs and humans, are relatively sensitive to the effects of cardiac glycosides and the clinical manifestations of \\&quot;glycoside intoxication\\&quot;.[8][9][10]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, despite the common \\&quot;poisonous\\&quot; designation of this plant, very few toxic events in humans have been reported. According to the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) in 2002 there were 847 human exposures to oleander reported to poison centers in the United States.[11] Despite this exposure level, from 1985 through 2005, only three deaths were reported. One cited death was apparently due to the ingestion of oleander leaves by a diabetic man.[12] His blood indicated a total blood concentration of cardiac glycosides of approximately 20 ìg/L which is well above the reported fatal level. Another study reported on the death of a woman who self-administered \\&quot;an undefined oleander extract\\&quot; both orally and rectally and her oleandrin tissue levels were 10 to 39 ìg/g which were in the high range of reported levels at autopsy.[13] And, finally, one study reported the death of a woman who ingested oleander &#x27;tea&#x27;.[14] Few other details were provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast to consumption of these undefined oleander derived materials, there is no toxicity or deaths reported fromtopical administration or contact with Nerium oleander or specific products derived from them. In reviewing oleander toxicity Lanford and Boor[15] concluded that, except for children who might be at greater risk, \\&quot;the human mortality associated with oleander ingestion is generally very low, even in cases of moderate intentional consumption (suicide attempts).\\&quot;[15]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety of parenterally and topically administered Nerium oleander extract and its glycoside constituents, intended for therapeutic application, has been studied in animals and humans. These studies all indicate that administration of Nerium oleander extracts as either a parenteral or topical preparation is safe when doses anticipated for commercial products are applied.[16] Toxicity studies that have been conducted in dogs and rodents administered oleander extracts by intramuscular (IM) injection indicated that on an equivalent weight basis, doses of an oleander extract with glycosides 10-times in excess of those likely to be administered therapeutically to humans are still safe and without any \\&quot;severe toxicity observed\\&quot;.[17] These pre-clinical studies, which also include oral dosing of oleandrin, were conducted in preparation for an investigational drug submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow for administration of the oleander extract to patients with cancer.[18]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A study in which a proprietary, concentrated extract of Nerium oleander (containing oleandrin and other cardiac glycosides) was administered orally to humans for the first time was recently concluded.[19] A concentrated oleander extract (PBI-05204) was formulated for oral consumption was given to 46 cancer patients where doses explored included those from 0.2 mg to 10.2 mg extract/day. These doses were administered daily in cycles consisting of 21 out of every 28 days. The researchers concluded that PBI-05204 was \\&quot;well tolerated up to the 10.2 mg extract/day dosage\\&quot; with few significant side effectsand with evidence of tumor response.[19]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There does not appear to be any toxicity associated with exposure of a Nerium oleander extract to the skin. Both animal[20] and human[21] studies suggest that dermal application of Nerium oleander extract is safe. In four human studies[21][22][22][23] in which a Nerium oleander extract was applied to the skin of people with different dermal conditions, sensitive mass spectrometry based blood analyses were not able to detect the presence of cardio glycosides such as oleandrin, indicating that these compounds are not readily absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s friend was a brand partner &amp; was trying to recruit me ( because I am a stay at home mom). I told him I wasn&#x27;t interested in pyramid schemes, but he insisted I try the product. I am a beauty product sucker, so I agreed to try it. I saw all the before &amp; after pics &amp; figured it must work. First impression, in stinks, &amp; I hated the consistency. I hated the pulling tight feeling on my skin! I normally have really clear skin, but I did want to shrink pores. Not only did nerium do nothing for my pores, it made me break out horribly! I had little bumps all over my skin! When I told him about it, he said \\&quot; its pulling all the bad stuff out of your skin\\&quot;.....ummm okay, I kept using it to see if my skin would clear up....it didn&#x27;t, it got worse! There are soo many great, natural, less expensive products out there that won&#x27;t ruin your skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I saw the video and pictures and decided to buy it.  I am so glad- I saw results within three days.  This product has helped me tremendously.  I am 43 and 3 years ago had a horrible reaction to a medical spa&#x27;s very expensive product line.  I had used that line in my mid 30&#x27;s (the product line starts with the letter O) with great results but had not previously used Retin A with it (which I was supposed to do) because I was afraid of going through the initial phase.  I had actually used Retin A for acne in the past and went through the peeling and initial breakout but after several months my acne improved.  Well when I used the prescribed Retin A as directed with the medical spa&#x27;s product line it caused terrible acne and deep sores on my face.  I contined to use it thinking this is the initial phase.  After 3 weeks of agony I went to the dr and he sent me straight to a dermatologist.  It took 18 months to get my acne under control.  Somehow it triggered a horrible reaction that continued for several weeks even after I stopped using the product.  People would stare at me in public.  I was in a lot of pain as I live in Florida and any sweat made the sores burn. Needless to say I am very nervous to try anything and I will NEVER use anything that says there may be an &#x27;\\&quot;initial adjustment\\&quot; to the product.  Let me tell you, there is NO initial adjustment with Nerium.  This product is fading away the red spots and discoloration from my ordeal plus reducing wrinkles.  I have to be very careful with any product or makeup that promises \\&quot;pore minimizer\\&quot; because that can cause break outs sometimes but this has not done that at all.  My  pores are smaller.  I continue to use a daily mild exfoliating face wash which is what I have to do as my pores get clogged easily.  But I have gone from wearing heavy heavy concealer and makeup to wearing almost no make up and NO concealer.  We are talking heavy makeup for the first time in my life after that ordeal and now almost no makeup.  I have been using it for almost four months and my friends and family are so happy for me.  In pictures in the past you could really see the red marks from my ordeal even if it wasn&#x27;t too obvious (maybe the flash?) but now in pictures it is practically gone!  I don&#x27;t care how much this costs - I will buy it!  But it actually is much less than I was paying for multiple products as I had started to use products to try to fade the scars and sun spots.  This works so fast too!!  I see on here some people say its a pyramid thing.  One, I don&#x27;t care because it WORKS.  Two, why should I care if my friend makes some money because of my monthly order.  Three, if you think about it however they get paid its like a commission and I know realtors and even the grocery store does that.  They all either pay a portion of their commission to their boss who pays a portion or some fee to use the realtor company logo or like the grocery store.  The company that makes the Mac and cheese makes a profit and the guy&lt;br /&gt;who sold them the flour got his profit before that, etc and then the grocery gets a profit.  All I know is that is their business (good or bad) and as long as I can have it shipped to me I am happy.  Also I use the 4-5 pumps as recommended and my bottle runs out right after the new one arrived.  This is the ONLY product that I actually will get auto shipped because I have never been able to use that much shampoo or coffee or whatever as other auto ships and I have always regretted it (especially when I would forget to cancel).  You can cancel this which is what convinced me to do the auto ship at first.  It is cheaper but I had put it on my calendar the night I ordered it the first time to cancel because I assumed it would be just another unnecessary stockpiling plan- it wasn&#x27;t! :) I have never done a review before but since I had been through such a horrible ordeal I wanted anyone who may have had acne or a bad experience to not be afraid to try it and it could really help someone and maybe change their life if it helped them feel ok or even happy to have their picture taken again.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and I never really had issues with wrinkles and was utilizing \\&quot;Meaningful Beauty\\&quot; for my skincare needs.  A friend suggested I try Nerium and I have been using it for two months.  I received better results than any of the \\&quot;Meaningful Beauty\\&quot; products.  This product does what it claims.  However, it is not a miracle skincare item and you will not see results in a couple of weeks - but you will see results.  I have read the negative posts and have to say - if you are expecting miracles - be realistic - there is no miracle out there unless you want to go under the knife.</li>
            <li> Did not find results suggested that would happen  Do not care to use it again.  Also discolored pillow cases.  Did not like the smell</li>
            <li> A friend at church gave me this product to try for 5 days.  I was skeptical at first but tried it anyway.  I saw the amazing results.  The dark circle under my eyes improves noticeably.  My skin is much brighter.  I became brand partner because NeriumAD really works for me.  I invested $1,000.  I got all my investment back and much more.  Its not a scam like some people put it.  My only advice is try the product for yourself.  Be your own judge!  God bless!!!  Visit my website:  [...]</li>
            <li> I have not seen it do what they say the product does, diminish wrinkles, etc....Furthermore, in some before and after pictures i have seen the light used to take the pictures is NOT the same so the amazing results one sees is due to the light used to take the pictures NOT to the effect of the product itself.  Not cool.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to see any difference.  Maybe in a couple weeks I&#x27;ll know more.</li>
            <li> This product is very sticky and smelly and leaves my skin feeling tight. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and will give it more time but it&#x27;s not very pleasant going to bed, smelling of rotten bananas.</li>
            <li> I have seen no changes. My pores, winkles, acne scars .&lt;br /&gt;The money spent on this product could have went towards Botox or a filler.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine got sucked into the pyramid scheme.  Had me try a bottle for 6 days.  Told me to take before and after pictures to see results. Didn&#x27;t see a change in the wrinkles around my eyes.  Tried it for 2 months.  No change.  The scent of this lotion is just terrible!  Had to spray perfume on my face to try to mask the smell.  I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it until I cleaned out my fruit bin in my refrigerator.  I had a melon that was starting to decay.  I heaved and then realized that this awful smell smells like Nerium!  So it smells bad, does not work, and its too expensive.  $100 is more than my cell phone bill  a month!  Cancelled online.  All hype!  I&#x27;d rather get botox or have my doctor prescribe Retin A.</li>
            <li> I was a brand partner . I have the ability to outsell if not everybody just about everybody in the industry honestly, but I have moral standards to live by and paid back money to brand partners out of my own pocket who could not make it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; MLM is a ruthless business with Liars and cheat&#x27;s !! If you decide to join make sure you can afford to lose it and lead yourself do not follow anybody in this industry period .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keep in mind that just because a wonderful \\&quot;new business opportunity\\&quot; tells you that it&#x27;s not MLM or NM doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not. The key is in how they OPERATE, not what they say. It&#x27;s the same concept in principle as the saying \\&quot;actions speak louder than words\\&quot;. Since MLM&#x27;s have a high failure rate, (97% failure rate according to the Direct Selling Association and the research of Robert Fitzpatrick of FalseProfits.com) they require a high recruitment rate to survive. Spouting a lot of smoke and mirrors, shifting terms that have negative connotations, and hyping people up is necessary to maintain a high recruitment rate. After reading this article and understanding how the ML&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myself and the team I built in legal shield were lied by Todd Cahill who was our leader and had told us that Nerium ad would come and go and not last meanwhile he and others had been signed up with nerium a year earlier! Remember the ones at the top make the money while it last&#x27;s and many others lose and if you sign up as a customer make sure you get the login for your website and then you can log in and stop the autoship if needed without calling the company . I also had two customers who started developing rashes on their face and neck after 6 to 8 months of use !!. They went to their skin doctor and he stated it was from long term use with the Oleander seed extract .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to visit him about this because my mom has used it for over a year and he also said I would stop immediately and even in small amounts with long term use you canhave side effects .&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> I tried Nerium for 4 days and noticed one of my dark sun spots on my face was almost gone and the other was faded a lot. I&#x27;m psyched.</li>
            <li> My co worker and I were given 1fl oz bottles of NeriumAD as \\&quot;samples\\&quot;. I found the product to smell bad and sting my face. The \\&quot;rep\\&quot; said that was the way you knew it was working. I am sure you would know napalm was working when it ate away at your skin too but that doesnt mean I am going to continue to apply it. When the \\&quot;rep\\&quot; came by to check the progress I told her that it did not work with my skin and she said she needed her product returned. It was not what she said that was so offensive it was the way she demanded her product back as if I wanted to keep her flesh eating \\&quot;skin Serum\\&quot; for some secretive ulterior motive. I let her know I would try and remember to bring it.  She then tried to say she would come by my house and pick it up. I guess she imagined that I was going to try and sell it to my next door neighbor that is a furniture refinisher as a paint solvent or something. I have no idea. She turned before she left and let me know that I needed to return it quickly because it was an $80 bottle of her product and she had she had someone else she would give the bottle to. A partially used bottle.Seriously? Is that hygenic or ethical in any way. Will she charge the new victim $80 for this used bottle of toxic Oleander stinkfest?  Funny thing is when she came into my business  it was a sample that I never asked for or really wanted. But I figured what the hell, samples are free. Apparently I was mistaken. Samples are $80 and had I continued to use it Im sure the dermatology dr.&#x27;s appts would have been even more. Bad product, Bad customer service, Scam. I wonder who used this bottle of skin decimating product before me?</li>
            <li> I am a musican / performer in my mid 40s and I have to be super conscious of my age / appearance. Therefore as opposed to most men, I try these types of products as well as laser facials etc.. I suffer from very minor redness as I am part Irish. I often get told I look like I&#x27;m in my late 20s or early 30s. However, I do have minor skin flaws especially in the last 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for several days now and I can certainly tell you that I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the redness and an overall tightening of my skin (especially around my jaw line). I&#x27;ll certainly be reordering if not going on the monthly plan thingy they offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use MOST products like this because they cause even more irritation / redness. Nerium has not done that so far and produced some results just in a few days. I&#x27;m excited to see how everything looks in a few weeks.  I do suggest taking before and after pictures because that would be a the best way to judge for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with the negative reviews.. competition perhaps or whatever but I really don&#x27;t care as long as they continue to offer the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a real person writing a real review. So, I&#x27;d say this product, for me.. has been a winner.. so far.</li>
            <li> Exellent love it i give 5 stars...it works really i keep using this treatment forever try you not lose nothing</li>
            <li> Love it...finally found something that works!!! I would recommend this highly!&lt;br /&gt;Will probably use this forever! Thanks Roberto for sharing...</li>
            <li> Results can be seen in a few days.  I don&#x27;t care for the odor, though.  I find it strong smelling and unpleasant.  It makes me feel a little nauseated when I apply it.  The smell and its affect on me pass quickly after it dries.</li>
            <li> I would give no stars if I could&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007NQA77U NeriumAD Night Cream (30 mL)]]I initiate purchase of nerium ad ~ 4 months ago at the request of a friend who was a new brand manager. In spite of bad smell and funky consistency, I started to use the product and noticed no real benefits but continued to use it because I had it and wanted to give it a chance I  receiving monthly shipments @ 110$ faster then I could use it. I finally called to cancel my shipments. After ~ about 2 to 3 month of using the product according to directions I developed itchy puffy eyes each morning. With medical consultation , conclusion was made to discontinue nerium as it was causing the adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Upon learning this I contact Nerium to report the adverse reaction was told that it was too bad that I had a problem that because it was beyond the initial 30 day trial period that they could no longer do anything for me. \\&quot;No one else experiences adverse skin reactions\\&quot; therefore I had the problem.&lt;br /&gt;this is what I posted on their facebook page&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Dear Ms Higdon: \\&quot;This product has given me an allergic reaction. I have discontinued use, but after calling your customer service, I was informed that it is my problem I am having an allergic reaction to the product and I will receive no refund for the 3 months supply I am in receipt of.... For the record that&#x27;s 300+ dollars I am out, on a product that I can no longer use and had to spend money on a derm visit to discover the origin of the allergy. In addition to informing me of my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; your custmer service rep Elizabeth continued to tell me that your return policy has a statue of limitation of 30 days and anything beyond that you will not be responsible for. She also told me to go to your website to file a complaint .There is no avenue for that on your website. So all I have now is 3 bottles of your smelly product and 300 dollars poorer because as your customer service representative informed me: It&#x27;s my problem that I have an allergic reaction and not all people who use the product have an allergic reaction. some customer service you have\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;They have since censored my statements removing it from the page and blocked me from any commentary on their public forum.&lt;br /&gt;This company only responds to all of the positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;They reward their Brand Partners with big compensation like Lexus and ipads but will not refund a consumer money for an adverse skin reaction.</li>
            <li> This stuff is garbage.  I have bought 2 bottles and used for 3 months..No results. The positive results are posted by those who sell it. Dont believe it.</li>
            <li> First of all I am not a Brand Member to this product.  My friend is a Brand Member and she kept trying to get me to buy a bottle.  I have high sales resistence and frankly, am skeptical (aren&#x27;t we all?)  So for months she kept asking me to just try it.  Finally, I decided to give it a go.  She said take a before picture when you start using the product.  I did.  I used it like I was supposed to (and by the way, some reviews said it smells bad... that could not be farther from the truth, I think it smells great, it has a natural smell to it, maybe a little bit like melons/cucumbers).  Today is the 10th day I&#x27;ve been using the product and I decided for the heck of it to take another picture.  Same spot on my face, my crow&#x27;s feet.  Now keep in mind I am not a sales person because I don&#x27;t even like sales people lol... but when I uploaded both pictures side by side, you can clearly see a difference in my crow&#x27;s feet.  The fine lines are way less, so much so that I can&#x27;t stop staring at my pictures today.  So I decided to google Nerium&#x27;s reviews and I&#x27;m a little surprised at the negative comments I see.  I understand everyone&#x27;s different and maybe I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones, but this stuff works. I plan to keep using it and take another picture in another few weeks and see what difference I see again.</li>
            <li> Rating should be NO stars, but this sight made me pick at least one star......&lt;br /&gt;This product is a scam....does not work.....its a cult like Amway.....don&#x27;t get suckered in.....Major League Rip off!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and I see absolutely no benefit whatsoever. With all of the promises and the high cost it&#x27;s just not worth the effort or the money. It just does not deliver what it promises.</li>
            <li> I have been using  the treatment now for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet.  It makes my skin feel tight and dry while it is on my skin.  maybe I just need more time.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  After having a series of chemical peels fry my face and leaving my forehead looking like rosacia which 2 dermatologists disagreed on.  I was told to get rid if it there was another peel for me to do.  I was approached to try Nerium and i was weary and hesitant to try it but desperate for a remedy that was w/o burning my face yet again. The results were truly amazing!  My skin texture and tone is even and beautiful, my red blistered looking forehead HAS recovered and is smoother then ever!  My crows feet are improving &amp; the huge pores on my nose are getting smaller and less noticeable.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks now and will probably forever!  I&#x27;ve spent lots of $ on my skin it&#x27;s nice to actually see something actually work!</li>
            <li> I tried this for one week and I hated it. It felt like my face had a facial mask on it 24/7. It made my skin so dry I couldn&#x27;t stand it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, like any normal person, I was a bit ify.  I did my research and found mixed reviews on Amazon.  One thing I know for certain, is in the U.S., if it&#x27;s expensive, it has to be effective.  After eight (8) weeks of use now, let me tell you...my face has changed for the better.  I took the time to write this review because I personally used this and saw what it did for me.  A bit about me: I am 32 (so I really cannot tell you how effective it is for wrinkles. Just being honest), black female.  I was in the Marines for four (4) years and after recruit training and drilling in the sun long days, my face failed to have an even tone for YEARS.  I tried everything; all the toners by these companies...you know, the ones you pay like $8-$16&gt; for.  But I will honestly tell you, give this product a shot.  Another thing about it is that it lasts very long.  The bottle is small, but you really just need like two pumps and you apply it to a slightly wet face and neck and rub it in.  Before I purchased the product, I saw SO many negative reviews about how it doesnt work and  that the smell is horrible.  Not for the life of me, if these people who said these things arent dermatologists who are upset because no one will buy their expensive products or just negative people, I dont know.  But I can honestly tell whoever that is thinking about purchasing this product that it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Going forward, this is what I will be trusting.  My face looks really good. After three weeks, you start to see noticeable results.  I dont know about five days.  What I observed on the fifth day was that my face kind of started to look a little rough.  Nothing noticeable by people, but I think it was just my skin and pores doing their thing and getting used to the product.  No kidding, after week three...I saw results.  Now at two months, forget it....this is a VERY effective product.  And before I close out, let me make it very clear that I am in no way a distributer of this product.  It is way too expensive for me to even join their program.  I rather just be a customer.  Trust me, I dont really enjoy leaving reviews.  But because I was SO skeptical about this product before I bought it, I just had to let people know that it is truly effective.  Nerium delivers.f this product.  It is way too expensive for me to even join their program.  I rather just be a customer.  Trust me, I dont really enjoy leaving reviews.

            <li> I used it on my face for all my acne scars and age spots. I saw no difference after a month</li>
            <li> Some people here think this product is a scam.  It&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m a photographer who shoots celebrities for a living. [I&#x27;m not exactly sure how that makes me trustworthy but for some reason in my mind it seemed to when I typed it.]  I use it and it works on me. It&#x27;s working dramatically on my dad and my sister.  We have a friend who tried it and nothing happened to her. I can&#x27;t vouch for her results because she tried it in months when I didn&#x27;t see her but I trust her. It&#x27;s sometimes hard for me to believe because of the dramatic results I see in myself, but still other people I know have little or no result so I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say in my experience more people get great results than don&#x27;t.  Some people, depending how much they like to spend on beauty products and how well it works for them specifically, will find it&#x27;s not for them.  People that are convinced it&#x27;s a scam are just really upset from pushy sales tactics and sometimes no results. Because I can tell you, and swear on everyone I love, that I have seen dramatic and real results.  My girlfriend went away to see her mom in New York for 3 weeks.  I started using the product and on the 8th day of starting to use it she came back and asked \\&quot;why are you glowing?\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve seen a ratio of about 75% it works for and 25% it doesn&#x27;t work for and I&#x27;ve seen some people developing mild rashes from the product. (My girlfriend, who is 22 and looks like an angel, gets a minor result and temporary minor rashes in the morning from the product. She also can&#x27;t afford it so its just not for her! And guess what that&#x27;s ok other Nerium Brand Partners, because there are still millions of people who can afford it and actually want it and will love it for the price!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes better sales techniques IE no pushiness and no pressure will allow people to be more objective and not expect a face transplant to pacify their uneasiness with being sold so hard in the first place. Sometimes you can have a piss poor sales techniquedoom the customer experience before the customer even has a chance to make an objective decision.  Imagine someone selling a Bentley in a manner that you sell an old broken down jalopy.  Ya know, \\&quot;meet me in the back alley give me $200 for it I just had the brakes changed, hurry take it quick man take it.\\&quot;  Even if a $400,000 car is staring you in the face for $200 you&#x27;d be convinced there was something very wrong with it if it were being sold that way. Some Brand partners sell this that way.  \\&quot;Try it! It works! You&#x27;re going to be 30 years younger after just 5 days. It&#x27;s scientifically proven to work on everyone!\\&quot;  That kind of nonsense. So you get pissed off people, because you sold them the world and if they only get a good night creme it&#x27;s not what they were told they were gonna get so its worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the proponents of Nerium that have a serious problem with people posting it doesn&#x27;t work for them. It&#x27;s true it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  I sincerely think it does do something even if minute for everyone.  But some people don&#x27;t want to pay and frankly I&#x27;d have to agree with them that paying $600 for minor results and 6 months of a nightly routine is just plain a rip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the recommendation is; do not buy it on Amazon unless you already have tried it and know you like it and don&#x27;t want to pay retail ($110).  Because the 30 money back guarantee is only available through brand partner websites.  You can contact me through amazon if you&#x27;d like to know how to get a 30 money back guarantee on your purchase.  But if you see nothing in your 30 days it&#x27;s not going to get much better, its just slow and steady results from there if at all. Also the price for autoship is only $80 so you&#x27;re not getting a deal here if you want to use on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take Rogaine for my hair. It&#x27;s still is thinning slowly, but I just notice that it falls out faster if I don&#x27;t use it.  If I hadn&#x27;t used it for the last 10 years I&#x27;m convinced I&#x27;d have atotal bald spot back there. I spend about $20 a month and have a day and night routine for the Rogain and the results don&#x27;t happen for 3 months after you start using it.  Rogaine is one of the most scientifically backed products for hair loss there is on the market today. It has millions of success stories around.  You can ask around and find people who use it and have verifiable results.  BUT, for some people, Rogaine has no noticeable effect or even a negative effect.  Does that mean they should run all over the internet and try to convince people that it doesn&#x27;t work?  And that the independant clinical doctors who found a real result in Rogain are all crazy and/or paid off and everyone who uses rogaine is brainwashed by good marketing?  Some people go online and say just that.  I&#x27;d hope you do a little more research before deciding against Rogaine because of those types of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this product - Try it risk free for 30 days through a brand partner website. If it doesn&#x27;t work - It&#x27;s ok. Just return it.  If it works as well for you as it does for me and you can afford it you&#x27;d be very happy you tried it for yourself.  If you aren&#x27;t satisfied with it in anyway don&#x27;t let someone tell you to keep going, make those decisions for yourself, but my advice is to return it before the 30 day trial is up. Then try some other products because there is one out there that has the value and result you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy night cream hunting.</li>
            <li> i ran into a friend at the grocery store who looked amazing.  I asked her what she was doing and she gave me a bottle of Nerium to try.  I had great results in less the 30 days.  Most improvement in dryness, crows feet and sun damage discoloration.  My husband started using it as well and had improvement in sun damage - dark spots on forehead drastically reduced and disappeared.  His fine lines are decreased and softened dramatically.  This has become my favorite product and I would not go without it.</li>
            <li> I do not sell it.I have to say reading some of these reviews is quite interesting, but they also made me think. Is the person writing the review real? Is it someone just messing around trying to publicity? Is it someone who sells skincare products and concerned that they&#x27;ll lose business? How easy would that be for someone to write a review only to send their customers or people who have asked them about the product to them? It&#x27;s interesting what people will do to get ahead, but I&#x27;ve done so research(NeriumBiotech.com&amp;NeriumSkincare.com myself. According to what I found the product is Patented, which isn&#x27;t the case from everything else out there. The product is all natural and any forms of reaction aren&#x27;t due to the product, but chemically based product that people are using on their skin(I even asked a dermatologist). Do your own research! cause what I&#x27;ve been reading is interesting. Heck, if everyone said motor oil was good to drink seems like people would be inclined to drinking it.</li>
            <li> so my hairdresser recommended I try this cream for a week and I do notice a difference in my skin.. My aesthetician at the spa I go to said my face felt smoother, softer and that my pores were smaller. My makeup goes on really well with it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the smell isn&#x27;t great and the texture of the cream is also a little too tightening feeling...almost like wearing a mask at first. I am 33 and feeling the glow of Nerium. I also did have some dry patches but that could be a change from seasons.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream for five days because my hairdresser was selling it and really pushing me to try it.  Every time I would go get my hair done, it was like sitting through an hour long infomercial about this stupid cream!!  I finally agreed to try it for five days, although I told her I would probably not be signing up to buy it because I really couldn&#x27;t afford such an expensive product.  Well, after three days of using it my skin erupted in the worst case of acne I have ever had.  I stopped using the cream on the third day because I didn&#x27;t want to break out further, but my hairdresser called me to find out how it was working for me and talked me into continuing to use it.  She said the Nerium was exfoliating my clogged pores and the breaking out was normal and would stop soon.  I used it for one more night only to wake up with three more deep, extremely painful, pimples in the strangest places.  I had one right under my nose, which is still there a month after stopping the cream, two on my temple, and one on my chin.  I even got pimples on my neck from this stuff.  In fact, I continued breaking out for several days after stopping the cream.  I went back to the salon and gave the remainder of the bottle back to my hairdresser and told her I would not be purchasing this stuff, that I had had a very bad reaction.  The smell was awful too, but I could have tolerated that if the cream was actually good.  Even after I gave the cream back she was still trying to tell me how wonderful the cream was and that I hadn&#x27;t given it a chance.  Maybe if I had continued using it at some point I would have stopped breaking out and something wonderful may have happened, but I seriously doubt it.  I regret even trying it because now I am left with red spots that are still present a month after stopping the cream.</li>
            <li> I think reading all of the reviews is actually entertaining and funny. Yes I am a brand Partner, but I did my homework first. I used the product and then decided to join as I am loving my results and want to share with others and hey, why not make some money in the process. I have large pores and after using the product for 2 months I am seeing a HUGE difference. I am 30 so no, I do not have lots of wrinkles- Although I have seen dramatic decreases in friends&#x27; deep lines. I also have much smoother and softer skin. Nerium is plant based, so no added fruity smell. People talking about how horrific the smell is?? Weird to me but whatever, their opinion. Having reasonable expectations about a product is key. How long did it take you to get all of your wrinkles? Probably years..... and some people expect them to disappear in a week? A month? Hey, everyone&#x27;s skin is different so for some people to see dramatic results within a week- Awesome! For others, takes longer. REALISTIC. If you don&#x27;t like the product, don&#x27;t buy it. Do I have friends/ family who are not interested- absolutely, but I am not going to harass them about it! There is a 30 day, money back guarantee so what do you have to lose. Do your homework and don&#x27;t be unrealistic and you will be fine. Not sure why some people have such a chip on their shoulders about the product, but I will continue to use it because it works great for me.</li>
            <li> I am one of those who saw absolutely not difference in my skin tone.  I used it for at least 3 months.  I am in my 30s, but I have sun spots near my eyes.  I don&#x27;t see any evening of skin tone or fewer lines (I don&#x27;t have much to start with). My sun spots did not fade at all.  It felt kind of uncomfortable on, even with water on my face before applying this, the cream is meant to be washed off by the morning, so it feels like this film on my face.</li>
            <li> At 69 years of age, I have found that most creams do not do anything visible.  This is not a miracle cream, but it has tightened my skin somewhat.  That is more than I can say for anything else I have tried.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I just received the Nerium yesterday so I tried it last night and took a picture.  From what I understand it takes at least 3 weeks to see some changes so hopefully it will be great  I know of another person who is trying it and she said and u can see some changes.....</li>
            <li> Been using this consistently, and as instructed for about 3 weeks. My skin looks somewhat improved, but it may still be too early to give a final comment on this, as I am not yet seeing the remarkable improvements this cream is supposed to give.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month.  I am 54 years old and my skin sucked.  Large pores, red and oily.  My skin is really looking good.  I usually hate putting creams on my face because it makes me break out.  This treatment didn&#x27;t make me break out, minimized my pores, no breakouts, less redness...I&#x27;m continuing to use it.  I look younger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen A Bessette</li>
            <li> Worst smelling product ever!! Pushed my hubs away even at night.  Such a scheme!! Not FDA approved and ingredients are not on bottle correctly. What&#x27;s the percentages?? Aloe?? Seriously not worth it don&#x27;t waste money!! I feel sorry for people that have been sucked in. Bc I almost was! Just like freaking car salesman. They won&#x27;t leave you alone till u get mean and set them straight. Be careful. You have been warned.</li>
            <li> After sending an e-mail trying to cancel mt auto-ship, I received...yet..another bottle. I finally called (8 minutes on the phone) and was told I sent it to the wrong e-mail address. He was SO rude, insulting, condescending and extremely unprofessional. I refused this last shipment (my card was charged, again) and was told I will be charged $15.00 for refusing the shipment. I will disputing with my bank and the rep said, Yeah...good luck with that\\&quot; and proceeded to laugh at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope others read this.</li>
            <li> The product smells old and looks darker than the previous product of the same name that I&#x27;ve used.i had paid the 1 day shipping because I was leaving town and needed to get in to take on my trip.</li>
            <li> Soooooooop disappointed. Beyond belief. I hate that I fell for a product that can only sell through MLM. If it was real, doctors would be all over this. So embarrassed.</li>
            <li> What is all the hype about this product? I gave it a chance for 3 months. Unfortunately it just did do one thing for me. Good luck to all the ones who decide to invest time and money on this line.</li>
            <li> Wow... I really love the results around my eyes... I&#x27;m on my second bottle and 60+ days of use.  Little line around eyes are gone... Working on my neck as well.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for one month as suggested, and the result ( 3rd week ) was puffy, scaly, red skin under my eyes-on top of my cheekbones (I have fair/medium skin) and what appeared to be pulled, wrinkled skin under my eyes. I stopped. This was around February 2013. I have just given another attempt, 2nd day here, and I can see the same thing beginning to happen. Red bumps forming on my eyelids near the outer edges. My skin is looking pretty stressed out: it was post-facial smooth and calm two days ago. It is a new container, as I never opened the second one until this week. Was kept cool and out of the light. Will never use this harsh, expensive product again. Botox and Aveda have worked very well to this point. My aesthetician recommends Environ, I like it too. And I use Lush for bath/body.</li>
            <li> There is so my hype created over nerium that you have to try it but all of the claims are false. I used it for 30 days, took before and after pictures and saw absolutely nothing. For $100 a bottle this is a complete waste.</li>
            <li> All I can say in reading the reviews of this product is that every&lt;br /&gt;poor review was written pursuant to an Amazon Verified Purchase and&lt;br /&gt;all of the 5 star reviews did not make a verified amazon purchase.&lt;br /&gt;That is telling to me (for an otherwise hard to find product).</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for almost 2 months now... I  starting seeing results in 5 days. I had suffered from adult acne and after it started to go away I would still always get one or two huge cystic pimples one after another. After I started using Nerium my skin turned a new leaf. No more acne, skin is bright and vibrant, my forehead lines...GONE! I love, love, love this product. I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know and just wait for the phone call to hear them say \\&quot;Where the heck did you find this stuff?!\\&quot; My suggestion to users would be to put it on damp skin before bed, you can use less serum and it seems to hold the moisture in your skin. I liked this product so much I became brand partner and now I get paid to share it with my loved ones. Sharing is caring. #Benjaminbutton  nataliem.nerium.com</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month, I saw no difference in wrinkles or texture of my face.  However,  I did have an abundance of new age spots and blotches that I did not have before.  After speaking with another user,  I found that this is not uncommon.    At this point,  I did a little more research on the company and found their research claims very questionable.  If you are considering falling for the Nerium  Scam as I did,  read this link about their claims first.  [...]</li>
            <li> IT IS AGAINST NERIUM POLICY FOR ANY BRAND PARTNER TO SELL NERIUM ON AMAZON OR EBAY....AND THIS GUY HAS BEEN REPORTED TO JEFF OLSON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;NERIUM INTERNATIONAL PROHIBITS STOCKPILING AND MASS MARKET INTERNET SALES Completion of this product order certifies that you have sold or used at least 70% of all prior orders and that none of this product will be promoted or sold on ANY mass market websites such as eBay, Amazon, national retail sites or other similar sites.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please protect yourselves as customers and order directly from Nerium...there are hundreds of brand partners on FB all of whom will give you excellent customer service.

            <li> I tried this product for 30 full days and even took before and after pictures. Did not notice even a miniscule change. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results! The astounding \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; pics on the Website are REAL! I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone who tries this product won&#x27;t demand more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 6 weeks. WONDERFUL RESULTS! However...it is NOT legal for anyone to be selling on Amazon.com and I have reported this seller to Nerium International. Some of you say that, for the price, you should see immediate results...no. You will not see immediate results. It takes time. This is not a concealer. This is a HEALING cream. It will take 69-90 days to see the best results. What is the matter with people that they think everything has to happen all at once? I am 56, have tried all kinds of products...some more expensive, some less. This works. That is all I care about. But please... STOP SELLING ON AMAZON.COM!!!</li>
            <li> My mom was given a bottle to try but she wanted me to try it first. I agreed really not expecting any results. I read the mixed reviews! I&#x27;m 47 and have a lot of sun damage on my chest. So I started using it 10 days ago but skipped about 4 days in between because I simply forgot about it. I noticed 2 days ago that my chest feels smoother and dark spots are actually fading. My husband noticed tonight as well. I&#x27;m pretty shocked actually! I did take before pics of my chest but will give it a few more weeks to see if it gets even better. I may post these to show the difference. I never post like this on any website but felt I should let others know that for me, Nerium AD is working!</li>
            <li> i believe for some people the effects could be profound...i did see some smoothing of the skin in a week...i however returned it...because the smell was so horrific it made me sick to my stomach, worse my pores were being clogged creating blackheads and breakouts i was not looking for a product that would streatch out more pores or cause more scarring from breakouts. i love Amazon but would no purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> For a few weeks I felt that my skin was a bit smoother, then no improvement beyond that.  But it didn&#x27;t do what my friend told me it would: lighten sun damaged areas. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I carefully followed directions for Nerium. Three to five pumps applied to damp skin.  I also listened to the video instructions saying not to worry if I experienced tingling, claiming that was normal. Boy do I wish I had not  listened to that video  now. I only used the product for eight days.  That slight tingling turned into a red burn and rash  over my lip/under my nose. Almost three weeks after stopping use of the product that rash is still there. I already had my internist prescribe an ointment to help clear up this rash. No luck. Upon my internist&#x27;s recommendation,  I am going to see a dermatologist  to see what else  I can do to soothe my skin. Small solace but the rash it also left under my eyebrow is not as awful as it was a few  weeks ago-- but you can still see it. The area above my lip? Bad as it was close to three weeks ago.  Can I tell you exactly how much I HATE this product?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nerium for about 4-5 weeks every night as directed &amp; have not noticed any difference so far.  A good friend sent me a partial bottle to use to see if I can get results in the 2nd month, so I&#x27;ll keep trying.  Wish me luck!  It has changed some of my friends skin quickly &amp; they love it.</li>
            <li> Unimpressive. It&#x27;s as simple as that. I used it for a month religiously, saw absolutely zero improvement. It&#x27;s a whole lot of buzz for no reason, and it&#x27;s getting to the obnoxious point. Don&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s far more expensive than it&#x27;s worth. There are just as good skin care products out there that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> .\\&quot; No offer for discounted product, no asking why I was cancelling, no interest in keeping my business. Problem was, it didn&#x27;t even get to me within those ten days and they wouldn&#x27;t honor the return. Not a HUGE deal because while I wasn&#x27;t seeing significant results, my make-up was going on well and I think it has evened out my skin tone a bit, so I was okay to just use the bottle - too much of a hassle trying to deal with the company. It was a little drying for me when I first started, so the sponsor I purchased from suggested only using 1-2 pumps vs. the recommended 4-5. Didn&#x27;t make any difference, but I was using less product. so I&#x27;ve stuck with 1-2 pumps. One bottle got me through two months, easy. No major reactions like some have had, but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I made a connection with some irritation I had under my nose and on my top lip. I stopped using it for a few days and voila... rash disappeared. Started using it again and HELLO RASH. I&#x27;m going to finish this bottle (being cautious not to get it on the skin under my nose) because by golly, I paid a butt load for it! But when it&#x27;s gone, I won&#x27;t be buying more. So, just a big \\&quot;EH\\&quot; review from me all-around.. product, price, customer service, etc. Don&#x27;t love it, but don&#x27;t absolutely hate it either.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  It does smell.  Kind of a mix of sunscreen and syrup.</li>
            <li> I laughed when I read about people having a burning rash after a few days of use. I followed the instructions and used only one pump of the day cream. My face turned bright red within minutes and it stung. The redness was impressive since I have a yellow tint to my skin. It&#x27;s been about an hour and I have washed my face. My face still stings but the redness is not as bad. I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s not a warning label on the product.</li>
            <li> Anyone that uses this and is not convinced that it works, did not take a before picture and then compare it 2 or 3 or 4 weeks later.  If you don&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;s like watching your child grow.  You don&#x27;t notice it day by day, but it still happens.  I am the biggest skeptic alive.  I was SURE nothing was happening.  Until I took an after picture 15 days into it:)  There it was.  Unreal.</li>
            <li> First, Nerium did nothing for me.  I used it for over 3 months and saw no noticeable change at all.  I cancelled my membership in October.  November I did not receive product and was not charged.  Suddenly I was charge for December and received the product a few days afterwards.  I called Nerium support and told them I wanted the charge reversed because I had cancelled my membership in October.  They refused.  They said I had product.  I had not received the product yet.  I told them, if the product arrived, I would send it back immediately.  They told me that they would then credit me within 10 days after they received it.  They said I did not cancel my membership.  I told them I had the cell phone record to prove that I had.  They still refused to reverse the December charge.  I received the product today.  Sent it back to them certified, return receipt mail.  It cost me $11.50.  The charge is still on my bank account.  I find this absolutely horrible customer service.  They didn&#x27;t even care if I had my cell phone records to prove that I had, in fact, cancelled my membership.  I will never recommend this product or company to anyone.</li>
            <li> since i have been using the product i have seen absolutley no difference in my skin as they show in their product pictures.you can go look abd it shows 2 weeks after and before but let me tell you it doesnt do any of this.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful this product would work. After all who doesn&#x27;t desire younger looking skin? After 6 days of using as directed, I will be returning this product . I have woke each morning to puffy, itching eyes &amp; I avoided my eye area. I did see some improvement in the lines around my mouth but it&#x27;s not worth the adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> My closest friend got caught up in the Nerium craze and joined to become a seller. He gave me a whole bottle and asked that I use it. The bottle lasted a little over a month. I saw no results. This guy is stubborn -- he has now given me a total of three bottles.  I see NO RESULTS at all.  While a lot of people on these reviews have said it has a terrible odor, I find the scent to be pleasant.  What I don&#x27;t like is that within just a few minutes after applying my skin feels dry as dust.  Maybe it works for some people, but for me it has done nothing. No reduction in wrinkles, no lessening of brown spots. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine actually paying over $100 for a bottle of this stuff.  I&#x27;m not cheap -- if a product works, I&#x27;ll spend the money. I&#x27;ve used Obagi for years. Love it.  I love Creme De La Mer -- now THAT&#x27;S a product that is worth the money. You almost see an immediate difference in your skin and it feels heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nerium? No, after over three months of use, I can&#x27;t recommend it. If you want to spend a fortune on something that works, try Creme De La Mer --you&#x27;ll be much happier. Or get a prescription of Retin-A and suffer through the weeks of peeling skin (it&#x27;s worth it, trust me). Or go get some filler injections (in the long run, cheaper than Nerium and you&#x27;ll actually see results).</li>
            <li> I used three full bottles of this product (BTW, following the bottle&#x27;s application instructions each bottle lasted me roughly 45 days).  The net result was that I saw no change in my skin.  Sadly, other people did including two relatives who gently suggested that I try a different eye cream for my crow&#x27;s feet.  I have never in my life had anyone comment on my wrinkles until then.  After close inspection I realized that I had some deep lines around my eyes.  I think the Nerium only served to dehydrate my skin!  I switched back to my previous moisturizers (and added an eye cream to the mix) and no one&#x27;s said anything since.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out and my eyes were swolen and itchy. I applied product like instructed and did not even get near the eye area. But it still made my eyes water and swell up. Not a fan at all.</li>
            <li> I acutally I started using this product after seeing a picture of a friend of neck results.  She had used it for 5 to 7 days, not sure, but I could see a difference.  I have bought $1,000&#x27;s of product to try to help my skin.  I have very very bad sun damaged.  I even bought a Quasar MD from Neiman Marcus in hopes it would help... nothing, not one bit of change.  I ordered a bottle of the Nerium AD and after 7 days I really didn&#x27;t see a differents, not really after 14 days, but when I got around the 21 day mark... oh my gosh, it is unbeliveable!!! It is not perfect skin, but it is soooo much better than what it was and I have people tell me all the time they can see the differents.  That is when you know a product works, when other people comment on how great your skin looks.  I will go without food before I will go without my Nerium AD... Seriously!!!</li>
            <li> Smells like wood Glue and looks like wood glue!  I only used it 3 nights and my skin had red bumps all over my face.  I could a before picture and a after picture on day 3.  I will not be buying this product.</li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical but tried it anyway.  I couldn&#x27;t see any change after 3 weeks and thought of giving up until one of my clients I had not seen in over a month asked me if I had a facelift!!  OMG! Then the next day the same thing happened.  This stuff works and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YT - Long Beach, CA</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nerium for 2 months now, and I know others who do use it. I find the reviews interesting because people are either loving it or absolutely, passionately hating it. There is no in between. This product is supposed to work on wrinkles, pigmentation, and sun damage. I am giving the product 5 stars because is is working on some of those issues, and some that are not even listed. With regard to deeper wrinkles, (I am 43 and I have been a sun lover at California beaches all of my life) it has not made them disappear, which I believe people want to see. They are not as deep, however, as they were, and I am hoping with continued use, I will continue to see more improvement. What I have experienced is the improvement in texture and where I used to break out monthly (ahem), that has not happened the past 2 months. My dermatologist said my skin has a definite improvement in texture, as well. This was noticeable after 3 weeks...that is about how long it takes to kick in. I have white hyperpigmentation and I do not see a difference in that, however, my skin has a noticeable evenness to it that I have never experienced with any other product, and I have bought them all! From inexpensive brands at Target to lines such as TNS, where the serum is $250 at the dermatologist ($150 or so here on Amazon). I have tried La Mer, La Prairie, and many others that claim they minimize pore size and wrinkles. I have had to buy it to see no results, where I did try this product for FREE before deciding to buy it. It is necessary to take a before picture to see the results because you are not necessarily going to see them on the mirror. It is like seeing your children every day, and you don&#x27;t notice their growth, but seeing them in pictures, you do notice their growth. It is the same with this, and any other product. As for the smell, it will affect people differently just as the product affects people differently. I smell plant, it is not offensive, and wears off after 20 minutes or so. Some people I know have commented on it, but they do get over it. Try the TNS...it smells like stinky feet- and that is a quote from my dermatologist. That is offensive. About the oleander and all of that, I was weary, as I own horses, and if they even get just the smallest taste, less than one leaf, it is over for them...dead horse in the morning. I get that, but in my research, it is a molecule in the oleander that is extracted, not the poisonous part. See here for info, which, by the way, does state that Nerium is associated with M.D. Anderson. You are going to have to google Nerium biotech. Also, in testing for this product, extensive blood tests were done to make absolutely sure that no oleander was found in the bloodstream of people using this product. The bottom line is that the product does work to different degrees because everyone is different. Is it a miracle? Some may say yes, some may say it does not work at all. To those naysayers, I say that it is working, but not fast enough for you, and you really do not know if it is working underneath the initial layer of your skin. It all takes time, and at less than $100/month, it is competetive with the more high quality products out there. Murad, DDF, I have tried them all with NO improvement in anything! No, I do not see a miracle, but I do notice a difference, my husband and my friends notice a difference, my dermatologist sees an improvement in my skin, and that makes it worth it for me.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I actually did try the product and found that it worked even better than it claimed. I can definitely get past the smell considering the results I have attained in a relatively short period of time. Folks, I want you to know I was skeptical, as the review below would indicate, but after actually using the product, I have done a 180 on my opinion of it.  Honestly, it works EXTREMELY well. I was able to tell a very remarkable difference in the texture of my skin in less than 1 week. I can only imagine how awesome it would be to use for an extended period of time.  I am going to sign up *and* sell the product at my place of business. I am NOT interested in the MLM aspects of this product (I am not a fan of multi level marketing at all), I will continue to use it and sell it retail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************************&lt;br /&gt;I was actually given a bottle of this to TRY in the hopes that I would \\&quot;sign up\\&quot; to sell it at my place of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, thanks to the blessing of Mediterranean genetics, even at 57 I do not have any wrinkles, so I have never been very interested in \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; anything. Moreover, I am not a player in the \\&quot;worship of youth\\&quot; society, so I think that anyone who would spend $100 on any face goop is pretty stupid.  But that is just my opinion.  Besides, it was given to me, so I though I would check it out to be courteous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the ingredient list did not have anything particularly objectionable, which is a big plus. There are some chemicals, but not that are terribly toxic.  Score one for Nerium.  But GOD the smell is enough to knock you off your chair.  All I can think of is my compost pile at home.  It is NOT a pleasant smell at all and I wished I had not put it on my face (near my nose), after doing so. I did not wash it off, but the thought crossed my mind a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price and the smell, if I were *that* worried about \\&quot;fine lines and wrinkles\\&quot;, I&#x27;d just go to an spa and get a glycolic or hylauronic acid peel. It wouldn&#x27;t cost that much more and the effects would probably be much the same, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this product is yet another Multilevel Marketing program that requires you to \\&quot;buy in\\&quot; to a distributorship and you only get a small percentage of profit from each sale. As a business owner I can purchase a million products out there that will do (essentially) the same thing and make a 100% profit.  Why would I put my time and effort toward selling something that I make only a fraction of that on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not intend to use this to find out what the long-term results are.  Perhaps one of the other reviewers can provide this information.  Overall, I do not feel it is a good value and I would not buy it, nor participate in the marketing program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Star rating changed from 1 to 5 (thanks for the reminder)William Dean!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try for five days.  I gave it back on the fourth day.  It dried the heck out of my skin.  In the morning, my skin did feel terrific but it was a few hours of discomfort in the evening and yes, I followed the instructions and applied to damp skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a slight reduction in pore size and the smell is not pleasant but its not horrible.  My biggest problem with this product is the focus on the pyramid rather than the product itself...that and the cost.  They force you into an auto-ship program where they are sending you more of this than you could possibly use in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no stranger to spending over $120.00 on good skin care.  If it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  It may work for some, and I suspect mostly people that haven&#x27;t taken care of their skin before...for me, this product is not worth $110.00 or even $80.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my opinion and review.  Also, once I&#x27;ve purchased something, it belongs to me.  If I so choose to sell it on eBay or anywhere else, that is my right.  They need to stop trying to intimidate people about that.</li>
            <li> FIRST off....it&#x27;s plant based! Everyone has a chance of being allergic to it. How do you find out? you try it!!! If you are that sucks, but it&#x27;s not the companys fault. If your allergic to Peanut Butter do you write all over Skippys website that peanuts are POISION dont eat!!! NO.&lt;br /&gt;SECOND.. yes, it sucks that you tried a product that didnt work for you and lost some money. there is NO product in the world that is going to be perfect for every single person, that goes for skin care, hair, whatever. It CANT work for every single person. It sucks loosing money on something that didnt work, but I\\&quot;m sure all of you have lost alot more on stupid money decisions....hey honey lets buy a house...in 2006...and then move states in 2010...woops. ITS LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;THIRD...everytime I get a facial my face breaks out. Its part of the process. Do I blame my esthetician? NO, its all the crap getting out of my face and it will pass...you have a chance of breaking out with this stuff, if you do chose to stick it out and it will go away..or quit...but dont whine.&lt;br /&gt;FOURTH...if you werent educated about how to apply to product correctly or didnt go on youtube and watch, dont whine about it being thick and goopy. If you do it correctly it goes on smooth as butter and there is no issue.&lt;br /&gt;FIFTH..Not everyones sence of smell is the same....some people LOVE the smell of AVEDA and some gag. Just because you dont care for it doesnt mean the product sucks. Its not flowers, but its not that bad and totally goes away once it dries...you whiners obviously dont have pre-teen boys. Theres much worse smells out there!&lt;br /&gt;SIXTH....If you paying a $110 everymonth you didnt do your research and are stupid for complaining about cost. If you go right on their website you get auto ship for $80mo. You wasted the $30 extra a month because of your stupidity, not the company.&lt;br /&gt;SEVENTH...Yes, Oleander can be poisionus in some situations. But so is BOTULISM!!! And I&#x27;m sure a few of you whiners either have done Botox or though about it. Chocolate is poision for dogs, but it isnt stopping me from eating it everyday! Dont eat the bottle and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll be ok.&lt;br /&gt;EIGTH.... NO I am not a brand partner...I have only used the stuff for 3 days. Will I have amazing results? Dont have a clue. Am I willing to take a chance? Why, not. Everything in life is a gamble. I have seen amazing results on some people I know AND I have seen 2 people not like it at all. Not a clue which group I&#x27;m going into, but either way I wont WHINE about it!&lt;br /&gt;ps...Brazilian Blowout was ALL over TV for awhile. Most amazing product on the planet!!!! Well it turns out it had Formaldehyde levels totally off the charts and was extremly dangerous for stylists to be using. Dont believe everything you see on TV and just because its not on TV doesnt mean its not legit.</li>
            <li> Signed up for auto delivery with a Nerium Brand partner.  She said I can&#x27;t just buy one bottle without signing up for auto delivery which meant I had to produce a credit card number and the Nerium Co. would automatically send me another bottle in 30 days from date of 1st purchase.  I was reluctant to agree to the auto delivery because I wanted to try the product 1st to determine if I liked it enough to order more.  She said if I decided I didn&#x27;t like the product, I could cancel the auto-delivery within 10 days of the auto-delivery and I would be given a refund of the purchase price (not including shipping and handling charges).  Several problems for me.  1) the shipping and handling costs are high....close to $17...which brought up the cost of the product to approx. $100 per bottle. 2) The time-frame for return begins when the co. SHIPS the product from their site...which takes several days.  I have a private mail box and go to my mailbox about 1 time per week, so I&lt;br /&gt;was not sure when the product actually arrived.  By the time I used the product and realized I needed to decide whether to continue and receive another bottle or cancel the auto delivery...was about 15 days into using the product...which was really not enough time to determine if the results were worth investing another $100 in another bottle...so I decided to cancel the order.  I would still like to try the product to see if using the product for the full 30 days and using the complete bottle would make a difference or not.  I am still interested to see what would happen, but&lt;br /&gt;definitely do not want to commit to \\&quot;auto delivery\\&quot; at this time.  So, I do plan to order a bottle of Nerium from the net...probably Amazon.com and see if the product lives up to the claims.&lt;br /&gt;That way I will be only out the cost of one bottle and don&#x27;t have to hassle with orders coming before I decide if I want to order more. The way I found out about the product was from a male friend of mine who told me the woman selling Nerium as a Brand partner looked 10 years younger than the last time he saw her.  He said she told him she was using Nerium and he recommended I try it for myself.  He had nothing to gain by telling me this, as he is not using the product or selling it.  I hear some men use Nerium?  Anyway, based on my friend&#x27;s recommendation, I wanted to find out for myself.  Unfortunately, Nerium&#x27;s auto-order policy did not allow enough time for me to feel confident enough to order another bottle via their auto delivery system which automatically charges my charge card for another bottle before I am ready.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to test for one week. I asked for a longer period but the sales rep explained that she needed to pass it on to another client. Realistically, one week is not enough time to obtain any measurable results. I have deep wrinkles around my eys (crowsfeet) and on my forehead. I applied it as directed. A tingling sensation can be felt after application and then a tightening sensation after it dries. This product did not improve the appearance of my wrinkles. If you want to prevent wrinkles or reduce fine lines this may work for you, however, it is not effective on deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> While I can see some improvement in my wrinkles, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m all that pleased.  Of course, I&#x27;m 68 years old so don&#x27;t expect them to disappear.  I&#x27;ve been using Nerium almost three months now and will continue a while longer.</li>
            <li> Nerium is not all I expected it to be.  I was hoping for more and think it is good but not great</li>
            <li> I thought I would leave a review, after reading reviews to begin with before buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Soo.... I am one of those women that try try try aaalll products in a hope to find THE ONE...that meets my requirements.&lt;br /&gt; I am 26, and starting to see the lines on my fore head getting more and more present without pulling faces. Frown. Soo have been trying a few products here and there with not much luck. I have the worst combination skin EVER! Pimples all the time from either oily skin in the hotter months and dry skin in the colder months... There really is no inbetween. I would use a face washer with hot water on my face morning and night to keep it clean and apply non oily moisturiser.. Once again, I have tried all kinds! And pimples would some how still do a surprise attack on me the day before a big night out.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. After reading reviews and seeing before and after pictures, with much excitement I bought 2 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Then to my horror, I found reviews saying that people leaving the reviews are selling the product themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well....that was it for me. Thought as soon as I try it, it will be no good and will have to sell the other bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to my surprise, this cream is great so far! It has only been a week. But far out it is excellent. The smell is the only flaw, and even still you get used to it. It isnt an off smell, just unusual. I heard someone use the word &#x27; earthy&#x27;, and that is the best way to describe the smell. The texture after applying is great. It isnt thick on your skin, oily or sticky. It sort of has, what I can only describe as a very lightweight cocoon on your face. And because of this, I can see why your to use it at night ..when your face is relaxed. So use at night like it says.&lt;br /&gt;One week of using this on my face and neck....i have noticed my skin looks more cleaner, clearer and somewhat brighter. I do however wash my face with clean and clear before i apply this cream. And believe it or not the wrinkles are actually smoothing out. Ive been pulling faces trying to notice any change, and there definately is.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I also started using this cream on my breasts due to stretchmarks. And only one day has made visual improvements! One day!&lt;br /&gt;All I can say out of this long review, is try it. Yes it is pricey. And with that being said, I think I will go easy on the amount I use now...But judge for yourself. Im glad I did.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine asked me to try this, since she is thinking about selling it.  I am a professor who used to do dermatology research and a women approaching 40, so she wanted my opinion on this product.  First of all, I reviewed the \\&quot;science\\&quot;, which is complete garbage. There is not one actual scientific article published on this product, or on the miracle component.  Also, their scientific advisor is a fraud without a single legitimate publication!  I spoke to a friend who is a well known physician and cancer researcher at MD Anderson who said that Robert Newman has no actual affiliation with the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even though the science is fake, enough people like the product that I thought it was worth a try, so I took my before picture and used the product for 2 months, as directed.  The consistency is similar to clay and it smells terrible.  My skin did look slightly smoother in the morning after using the product at night, but I think that was just a temporary tightening effect due to the consistency of the product, since that went away as soon as I washed my face.  I did not have any adverse effects, but did not see any change in my skin either, so have stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To really remove wrinkles and smooth skin, a combination of Botox injections, Prevage MD in the morning, and occasional RetinA at night is much more effective but also much more expensive.  This is my normal routine, so it may be that my skincare routine is already optimized such that I was unable to see the benefits of the Nerium.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a scam.  I think the only reason people are seeig results is because they are washing their faces more.  I tried this and I broke out.  But I kept giving it a chance...meanwhile, I moved to another place to live. The first shipment did not make it my new place...2nd the same...(now 2 charges on my bank.) I tried to change to new address on their site...then cancelled the 2nd shipment...But they still shipped. I knew it was shipped because I was charged, again.  I calld the company, I was told a higher lever person would call me within 24 hours. Three weeks later, YES, THREE weeks, I finally talked to a sales person. He did get back to me with this from his manager. \\&quot;We are sorry for your loss of funds in regards to your Jan &amp; Feb shipments.We can and will not refund you or re-ship.  Your March has been sent to your new address. (Of course the 3rd charge, now a loss of almost $300.) We can not help you because you took to long to contact us. (oh wait, I went online and changed my info, plus I called and never was returned a reply until I demanded to speak to someone THREE WEEKS LATER) He also told me that I could return the third bottle but there would be a $30 return shipping fee.  So people beware DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL. I hope I have helped someone who was on the fence about this stuff. It is a multi-level company. Who from what I experienced only want fast money.  Well, they have mine!  So now I sit with $300.00 of face cream that I will not let touch my face again!!!</li>
            <li> Used Nerium for three weeks faithfully. Took before/after photos and not one single improvement! It feels a little tightening on the skin as it dries, but thats the only recommendation I give. Would rather use other products than this $80-$100 bottle a month of crap.</li>
            <li> I have to warn anyone who is sensitive to skin products to NOT use this product.  It came with a warning from the person who sold it that it would have a strong reaction at first, including pimples, but that would subside shortly.  And it did.  However, my skin was dry and flaky for a day or two, but none of the acne like break-outs she had experienced.  I used the product as instructed and although the flaky appearance stopped, my wrinkles seemed to get worse, not better.  Once fine lines seemed deeper.  Once crows feet barely noticeable when I smiled became deeper and longer.  The turgor of my skin became thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turgor is the tense condition of the cells and capillaries found in the layers of your skin.  Pinch your forearm and see if you can actually grip the uppermost layer of you skin or if it is plump.  If you can pull up that upper layer alone, you have lost turgor in your capillaries which allows the outer layer of skin (epidermis) deflate into wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you I am well hydrated with water throughout the day and evening, so that is not the problem.  This cream was drawing moisture out of the layers of my skin leaving behind more and deeper wrinkles.  This product might work well for naturally oily skin, but normally dry skin doesn&#x27;t benefit from this formula and is actually worsened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, read the return policy carefully.  You can return unused product within 30 days after calling to get a Return Authorization #.  Don&#x27;t expect a full refund after also paying to return the product.  If you are thinking of buying, don&#x27;t sign up for the monthly shipments until you know it will work for you. There is more than enough to try it for over a month so you have time to decide if it works for you.  Listen and look at you results and don&#x27;t be influenced by the encouragement to continue because it will improve with more time.  That only results in more sales for the company and sales person.  I was actually advised to put a layer ofglycerin on first before using the product to improve the results.  Try this without their product and you might see the desired improvement at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Love that the product is all natural. but one size does not fit all. while some of my friends had good results, i felt that my skin was tighter then ever showing more wrinkles then ever. my skin kept breaking out and i stopped finally after a month. wonder what happens if you use this 10 years every night on your skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any visible results in my first 30 days, but then I took my after picture and compared it to my before picture and I noticed a difference. It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference but it was a difference nonetheless. My skin appeared softer and I saw that my enlarged pores were closing up I&#x27;m in my early 20s so I wasn&#x27;t looking for the product to reduce wrinkles. I was mostly interested in improving the texture of my skin and eliminating the visibility of my large pores (as well as decreasing emerging lines). In my first 90 days I was able to notice a difference without having to compare pictures. Also I noticed throughout the day my faces keeps its beautiful glow that Nerium has given me. Before I started using Nerium when I woke up in the morning my face was virtually perfect, but as the day went on it became oily, small blemishes would appear, and it just didn&#x27;t look good anymore. My face now keeps its \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; look ALL day! Also I have used Nerium on my eczema breakouts and let me tell you, I was shocked by the next morning results. This product works better than the prescription my doctor gave me. IF you buy from a brand partner via their Nerium page you will get the benefits of a 30 day money back guarantee if you do not like the product, also if you sign up as a preferred customer you can get the product for free and also take advantage of the 3-UR-FREE program!</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I have noticed a decrease in my fine fines and a brown spot on my face is gone.  I have used many anti aging products, and they all stop working after a while.  I was using Lameir before I started using Nerium.  In my opinion all of these products stop working after a period of time.  I believe skin becomes imune to a product that is used for a period of time; however, I am enjoying Nerium at the moment and have seen good results.</li>
            <li> I really am pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it since February 2013. I am getting small laugh lines and I really can see a difference.  Not near as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell or texture.  One of my friends swears this product gives amazing results, but I didn&#x27;t see any drastic or impressive changes in my skin.  I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> It smells and keeps me awake at night.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to quit.  Makes me wish I had bought it from a &#x27;marketing partner&#x27; or whatever they are called, so then I could get my money back.  sigh.</li>
            <li> I was invited to a gathering at a friend&#x27;s home several weeks ago.  Upon arrival I found this \\&quot;gathering\\&quot; was an introduction to Nerium. This couple put on a full-court show with impressive reviews, testimonials, and photos. I went ahead and purchased a bottle, not because I was that impressed with the product but because I felt compelled to do so. I used this product exactly as instructed and saw no difference whatsoever.  It was sticky and had a strong smell. Before I could send in the notification to stop the order, a charge appeared on my credit card statement, and a new bottle arrived in the mail.  Now I have spent $200. on complete garbage. This entire process stinks of \\&quot;pyramid scheme.\\&quot; Since the \\&quot;gathering\\&quot; I have spoken with several other attendees and not one of them is pleased with the product or the marketing techniques. The representative actually wanted to stop by and take \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos showing the great improvement and to offer me discounts if I gave him a testimonial.  NO WAY!</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;  I must say that I have tried everything out there..Avon..Dermygist...Cindy Crawford..You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. So I was not happy to here of something new. But I rec&#x27;d a sample..Loved the Smell, Loved the tingling, and the tightness. Oh yes and Dr PERRICONE..VERY EXPENSIVE five part daily routine. Did nothing..  Nerium has reduced my pores, Sun Spots on myface in 3 weeks..Almost gone..Redness on my noise and cheeks. So some people do not like it&#x27;s affects..I do not like Mary Kay. Gave me a rash immediatley, So everyone&#x27;s skin is different..But for myself, it has been terrific. You must apply it right..Some people put it on without water. So they don&#x27;t like it. all these products have directions, and some of them are pretty out there. So for 80.00 a month I get one thing, and it does what all these other&#x27;s claim to do..That&#x27;s cheap. Avon alone I was spending 120.00 + a month..Doesn&#x27;t seem like it, but when i got all my products out and counted what I had spent, I was shocked. It&#x27;s those weekly order&#x27;s..adds up.. So don&#x27;t put the price down..It&#x27;s one item, not 5.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this was helpful.. P.S. And the wrinkles around my eye&#x27;s. well my son said it all, Wow Mom. Your wrinkles are gone!</li>
            <li> So I am a business owner and would have no time to market this product so please rule the MLM factor out.  However all my life i have had acne problems, skin scaring and now at late middle age i was really looking old.  I went down the acutane road years ago, off and on antibiotics all these years and even now at 50+.  Being a California beach girl in my early years doesn&#x27;t help or now being in Florida.  So 3 months ago a friend hands me this bottle and say just put it on your face at night,every night and be sure you use a little water! OK.. So I did, and for the first time in 35 years my skin is almost perfectly clear. I went through about 3 weeks of some clearing however of the skin so it was a bit worse before the transformation took place.  I think I look so much better. Ruttyness is almost now smooth, Face has lots of healthy glow.  My crepe paper skin on my chest is almost gone and looks so healthy and then the last thing I do after putting it on my face and neck is put a few drops of water in my hands and rub the tops of my hands with the left over.  Just that, took all but one sun spot away and improved the age my hands... I buy it online where the price is the best! I don&#x27;t write comments normally but if your in a merry-go-round like I was, Just do it every night for 60 days because I think it will help a lot of people. Best of luck!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for 2 months and have seen dramatic results.  I was given a sample to try by a brand partner and she did not inform me that it gets rid of brown spots from sun damage!  That was an awesome surprise!  I have lived on the east coast all of my life and spent most of my time outside and at the beach, and my brown spots got worse every year - now they are almost non-existent!  Another plus for me was the effect it had on some pre-cancerous spots my dermatologist had given me a prescription cream to treat.  It caused them to shed layers when I first started using it and I have not needed the extremely toxic harsh prescription cream! It has also reduced the depth of the crows feet at the corners of my eyes.  I rarely need foundation make-up and my skin feels great!  I highly recommend the before and after photos!</li>
            <li> Meh :-/&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say that it is a wonderful product as yet. It doesn&#x27;t produce any bad results though. I bought it for breakouts as it is touted as being better than proactive. I disagree thus far, however I don&#x27;t have any more break outs than usual.  But considering the price, not sure I will continue to use. Looking for some scar improvement as well, nothing to brag about yet. I think I will try an aloe vera plant for 3-4 weeks to see if the results are the same, I think it will work and be the cheaper route!!</li>
            <li> I am a medical assistant for a dermatologist. She wanted to test this product before making it available to patients. I have been using it for 1 week now. It is still early but I am already noticing a difference. I have rosacea and my skin is very oily and prone to break outs. Over the last week, I have notice a HUGE improvement in the redness and acne. I have less breakouts and less redness. I also had 4 small milia (google it if unsure of what this is) that were very difficult to get out of my skin. Normally you would have to dig them out with a needle and an extractor. After 3 days of application, these milia came out. So far I am seeing results similar to Retin-A without the irritation, peeling and redness. We will see what the next few months bring but right now. I am very happy with the results. I don&#x27;t sell the product or stand to make a profit off of it. This is just my opinion from using it!</li>
            <li> First let me say everyone deserves to make money. But if you really want to make money become a brand partner with Nerium International. However, when you become a Brand Partner or a preferred customer and sell \\&quot;anywhere\\&quot; else except by personal sharing you are not in compliance with the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is only one, 1 oz, bottle of Nerium AD. The cream is all inclusive. When you have Nerium AD you don&#x27;t need to purchase anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, if you want to get free product - buy from a brand partner or preferred customer not through Amazon. My apologies to Amazon I love this site, I can find so much here and have purchased a ton of merchandise from them. This is not about Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, Nerium AD is a fantastic product that has been proven to be the best anti-aging product that addresses so many other issues not just the anti-aging. There is no other product that comes close. And yes I use Nerium AD and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but definitely not least. There is money to made with Nerium International.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say thank you to Amazon for allowing me to make my comment.&lt;br /&gt;And kudos to the person who advised everyone to stop whining. : )</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for a little over a month and my forehead wrinkles are slightly diminished, this isn&#x27;t the fountain of youth everyone else claims. I will keep using it every night until I run out but then will move on to something else probably a retinol cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I have been faithful about washing my face every night. My husband actually liked the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because someone told me it works. After the first two weeks of using it, I started getting pimples. I stopped using it and my skin cleared up. I thought it was me, so I continued to use it and now I have 4 deep set pimples under my skin. I am known for my flawless skin and now, I have 4 ugly bumps and blemishes.  I did some research and found that this product is made of  Nerium oleander. If you look up this plant, it&#x27;s poisonous. It kills cells. I can&#x27;t believe I have been killing my healthy cells and I ruined all the good years of my skin.    PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  DON&#x27;T BELIEVE THEIR LIES ABOUT MAKING YOU LOOK YOUNGER. IT MAKES YOU LOOK WORSE AND YOU ARE KILLING OFF YOUR GOOD SKIN CELLS.    You can read more about it at [...]  and[...]. These are not my blogs, but they helped me understand why my skin is so BAD!!! I wish I had never heard of Nerium AD.  At least this lesson is teaching me to do more research next time I hear of a miracle product.</li>
            <li> NeriumAD is an amazing product that works wonders, but it does not always happen instantaneously (what does?!). It is completely illegal to be purchasing online and you aren&#x27;t getting much of a deal, plus you have no idea how you can actually get your product for free or make money sharing it when you buy from these sites. I happen to be a big believer in Nerium and honestly, if I were you, I would stop buying it on amazon and go to a brand partner to buy it - it is really simple, there are lots of perks and if you don&#x27;t like it you get a 30 day $ back guarantee - that&#x27;s way more legit then getting \\&quot;bootlegs\\&quot; on amazon or other such sites. Feel free to contact me for further questions - glowonwithyourself@gmail.com thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband and I tried Nerium for 5 days and took pictures before and after. No difference at all. The smell is offensive, there is no way I would withstand that odor every night. If anything my skin was drier after use. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I found it interesting that so many people either loved or hated Nerium, so I decided to try it for myself and did the before and after pics, as their theory that a lot of people forget what their faces look like in detail from day to day made some sense. It was amazing as to how quickly it worked and I ended up ordering it. Then I ran into someone who told me that they had a friend who had actually written negative blogs to support the skin company they were working for, as Nerium is cheaper than their company&#x27;s product and it was cutting into the profit margin. Interesting ... I wonder how many of the negative blogs are really people who are unsatisfied or rather professional bloggers saying negative things? Whatever the case may be, I think the product is great as it has \\&quot;youthed\\&quot; me :)</li>
            <li> If this product did 1/2 of what it claims to do, it would revolutionize the Skin Care Industry.  It does NOT.  The only people hyped about this product are those hyping &amp; distributing it.  The only reason it gives the appearance of \\&quot;reduced wrinkles\\&quot; is from the edema (swelling) caused by the irritating ingredient Oleander.  If an ingredient \\&quot;kills cancer cells\\&quot; how can it be called anti-aging &amp; what other cells does it \\&quot;kill\\&quot; on the way down?  Nerium is nothing more than another MLM selling a cheap snake oil cream run by the King of MLM&#x27;s, Jeff Olsen.  Save your $.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard great reviews from several people I know and only one bad one, so I decided to give this product a try.  The main reason I wanted it was to remove the red from my face.  The first time that I used it, it broke me out.  How lucky am I!  Now, I look like a freak and it only cost me $100.  Thanks Nerium!  I guess that&#x27;s what I get for being so vain.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Been using for only a month, have seen definite improvement !!! I am WE&#x27;LL over 50, complexion now Dewey,and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> I am a 61 year old male using Nerium for six months. I do enjoy the product and have seen results. Those results are proven with a picture taken before and after a number of days. Its Clear.  The fact that some people love it or hate it is easily interpreted. The industry is 80 billion in the US. Mary Kay and Avon do 20 Billion of it. Nerium in their first year did&lt;br /&gt;a 100 million breaking many direct sales records.Why? Cause the product works. The fact that the product does work is causing obvious concern by the folks that control the market. How many people really try a product then run to the internet and make a comment, REALLY? Not many.&lt;br /&gt;If the product works you continue its use, and if it does not work, find something else that provides you with the results you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The product is a botanical with a DISTINCT natural smell. Trust me its not offensive and once the product is fully absorbed there is no odor. I happen to like it.&lt;br /&gt;Do you think if Mary Kay or Avon or anyone else introduced a product that WORKED and had a particular distinctive natural smell they would be crying about it.. No, the smell would be the best thing ever.&lt;br /&gt;By the way I am a representative.. Nerium is here. Nerium works.Nerium will allow you to purchase the product use it and return an empty bottle for full credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nerium returns are less than 1% so the smell and all else likely are not an issue. Our customers are able to earn their product for free, with our 3 ur free program. This also is putting pressure on the market competitors as they give you nothing. The public is smart. They don&#x27;t get fooled often. Enjoy Nerium or whatever else it is you think is working for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried Nerium for 30 days and my skin has not become any better. I see no change none whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - am a bit suspicious of the pyramid-marketing structure behind Nerium. It is expensive and does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virgin coconut oil is much better, for skin and hair and even internally. It is ecological, ethical and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best wrinkle cream, however is love as it gives you inner glow that cannot be produced with any facial product.</li>
            <li> I was told that I would look like a young man again. I have been using the product for about 4 months and can see some results but I just don&#x27;t know if this is the fountain of youth.  Kind of pricey</li>
            <li> I am allergic to any creams i put on my skin.When i tried Nerium i was surprised!Before using this skin night treatment you have to wash your skin with the water not some chemical removers. If you use makeup remover then after that you have to wash the skin with water,so no chemicals stays on your skin.Your skin has to be wet when you put Nerium on it.After that you go to bed and in the morning wash your face.It&#x27;s DONE!No allergic reaction what so ever!Just remember -take the close picture of your face(your skin where you want to put that cream)before using Nerium.On that picture  you can see your wrinkles and discoloration.After using Nerium for 1-2-3 weeks take  the same picture like you took before using that cream.Some people can see the results in few days ,some in few weeks,but you will see it!DON\\&quot;T USE NERIUM IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICATIONS OR CREAMS FROM DERMATOLOGIST!!!!!YOUR SKIN HAS TO BE CLEAN FROM ALL CHEMICALS!!!!!DON\\&quot;T USE NERIUM DURING THE DAY_ IT IS ONLY NIGHT SKIN TREATMENT AND HAS TO BE WASHED IN THE MORNING!!!!! I tried and it is working for me and my family.There is a lot of people and companies whose  selling cosmetics ,creams and they don&#x27;t want you to buy Nerium,because if you try Nerium you never come back to others creams.</li>
            <li> Take a look at the main ingredient, Aloe and the Oleander plant/flower.  Then look up Aloe and see what it is supposed to do.  Folks, I think this is just \\&quot;hyped\\&quot; aloe.  Importantly, it says it is a mixture of Aloe and the other active ingredient.  It doesn&#x27;t tell what percentage of the Oleander is in the aloe!  This is why they call it a \\&quot;mixture\\&quot;.  It may be that the Oleander comprises only 1% of the combination.  You&#x27;ll never know because they won&#x27;t tell you.  Personally, I think this is all hype with no science, and I am a biochemist (not a dermatologist, so this is out of my area).  I work in the pharma industry (though biologicals), and know good research when I see it.  This product has poor to non-existant scientific papers, and certainly none in peer reviewed publications (these are publications where good data are presented...the data are reviewed by experts before they can be published).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a personal basis, I have to agree with many of the reviews.  I tried it for a month, smelled, didn&#x27;t see any results (no line reduction), and saw \\&quot;pimples\\&quot; (I&#x27;m 64).  The last time I had pimples, I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I became a brand partner to help out a networking contact. I&#x27;m sorry I did. Waste of money with absolutely no results. I sent back two bottles of Nerium along with the brand partner materials. I was refunded for the Nerium bottles minus 10% re-stocking fee (what a scam) but they&#x27;re not refunding for the materials because they said they were used. I never opened the materials so how could they be used?!!!!! I&#x27;ve asked to speak with a supervisor and if it doesn&#x27;t get resolved to my satisfaction they are going to have a fight on their hands. Not a great way of doing business and preventing bad reviews. Horrible, horrible, horrible way of doing business.</li>
            <li> All the negative reviews astound me. People want a miracle that isn&#x27;t going to happen with any product. I don&#x27;t sell Nerium...yet...thinking about it. I don&#x27;t like MLM marketing BUT after using it for one month and not being sure that I was seeing an improvement...saw some in minimized neck lines..I decided to stop using it and did tons of research and started using other products....my skin looked worse!! So, I started back with Nerium night and day cream and within a few days my skin looked and felt much better.....this product was recommended to me by a plastic surgeon/skin spa doctor, BTW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use cosmeticcop.com to research products and it doesn&#x27;t have anything good to say about Nerium; However, I have tried other products they recommend as \\&quot;best\\&quot; and not seen the results that I have with Nerium. Also, the owner of that site has her own skin care line. If she were such an expert you would think that her products would be the best on the market...they aren&#x27;t...I was extremely disappointed and have seen better results with drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different skin types and problems, so any one product may not work for everyone. Again, if you want a miracle, then have a facelift....I don&#x27;t care how much money you spend on skin care products there is nothing out there that is going to produce the effects that people are seeming to expect.  If you want to repair and prevent sun damage, you may want to use a topical vitamin C with vitamin E product or a retinol product (but don&#x27;t expect miracles here either). Sagging of aging skin is a difficult issue that creams and serums are not going to have a dramatic effect on....in that case, you may be best off paying for high-priced laser treatments at a respected skin specialty clinic....otherwise, as I said at least twice before, get a facelift.</li>
            <li> Been using this on my body acne and in literally 10 days I saw  huge results I love this product it works so well</li>
            <li> I know several people who are distributing this product including my mother in law. She wanted both me and my husband to try it. I bowed out after I checked this product out including the ingridients-one of which was oleander which is very toxic if taken internally and is a known skin irritant if applied externally. No thanks. My mother in law is still using it and claims that it improved her skin greatly-she is in her seventies and I have asked to closely look at her face so I could see whether there were any differences-I couldnt see any. She still had her lines, wrinkles and all the age spots she had before. She also developed a major skin irritation that hasn&#x27;t gone away but then she was told by whoever sold it to her that irritation is because \\&quot;impurities are being drawn out from her skin\\&quot; which is total nonsense so she continued using it.&lt;br /&gt; My husband used it for the last 2 months. After first month he have seen no improvement and was told he was using it incorrectly-according to \\&quot;brand partner\\&quot; you are supposed to wet your face and apply it to the wet face(as my british friends would say-complete bullocks). After another month-he has deep lines around his eyes, acne scars and some brown spots-I looked at his face really closely as well and couldn&#x27;t see even a minute difference-all the lines were still there and there has been no improvement. He said he face felt smoother but if you use moisturizer you can get simular results.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore if you google it and reasearch the info about the company-their \\&quot;research\\&quot; is highly suspect and their claims are absolutely crazy. I have seen them post pictures of people who clearly have plastic surgery/cosmetic work done but Nerium claims that it was all from their cream. Some of these people have loose skin in before photos and totally tight skin after-if you believe that any skin cream can tighten your skin like that, I have a bridge to sell you. NO cream is capable of doing that, only plastic surgery can. Do yourself a favor and investigate this before applying this to your face. I have read that there has been some trials for oleander being used for skin cancer to destroy cancerous cells. If that&#x27;s the case, how can it renew skin cells and reverse aging if its supposed to do just the opposite?&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Nerium has a Facebook page-if you try to post any negative comment or any comment that asks for proof of their claims,  your post will be taken down. I posted a comment the other day after seeing the video they posted with couple of scientists who are endorsing the product. I said that if they have been paid by Nerium to endorse it, thats not an unbiased opinion. I didn&#x27;t use bad language or was rude in any way but none the less my comment was removed. Just like several people I know posted comments saying they didn&#x27;t like the product and their comments were removed as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a favor for a friend. First of all, it smells! Secondly, it forms a crusty mask on your face as it dries. So if your husband wants a woman with a smelly crusty film on her face, this product is for you! I canceled my subscription after 30 days. There are 100&#x27;s of products that you can purchase that actually  make your face feel smoother and fresh!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now. I have seen great results from it especially on my chest area where I had a ton of wrinkles from sun damage. I have read some of the other reviews and all I have to say is that they were not educated properly about the product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it can and will make you break out at first, lots of products you try do that at first as your skin tightens pushing out impurities and other stuff from your pores. I know, I am an esthetician!&lt;br /&gt;If you are not seeing any results anywhere then you are not using the product correctly. 4 pumps on fairly damp skin. Also I noticed that the results have varied between my friends and I. It really reduced her age spots and fine lines around her eyes. For me it really helped my neck and chest area. This is a great product and I plan on using it till they find something better!</li>
            <li> The only thing impressive about Nerium is how they are getting these housewives to be so pushy. Look at the reviews, the \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; reviews are from non-Amazon verified people. Also, why isn&#x27;t it sold by dermatologists? Could it be because it&#x27;s a scam?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this, it didn&#x27;t work, and if you see the wording, the reps all start out by saying they \\&quot;can&#x27;t guarantee results\\&quot; to clear themselves of any liability. Multi Level Marketing like this is getting out of control. Don&#x27;t fall for it!</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t believe it was a new bottle and I think I paid way too much for it to be partially used.  And I certainly don&#x27;t believe it lives up to what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING and it WORKS! It&#x27;s proven to work by third party clinical trials! HOWEVER! It is against policy of Nerium to have this product on AMAZON! With that being said, your face is FOREVER you wouldn&#x27;t put something on your face that was sold at a garage sale would you?  The products sold on Amazon are coming from people selling compromised products that have been exposed to heat and even some are USED!  When purchasing through Amazon there is NO company guarantee! You can not an will not get your money back in 30 days.  Please do your homework and go back to the person that told you about it.  Support locally and help a real family building a real business put food on their table, not someone trying to take your money without working for it!!!!</li>
            <li> I REALLY do NOT Like this cream!! It&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t work on wrinkles, but it smells odd and there must be something in it that does not agree with me, because every time I apply it, I become SAD! I know, strange, huh?? I hope it works for you, but I had to throw it out. A VERY expensive experience. Too bad, I was hoping for less wrinkles, but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I started using this about 2 weeks ago.  A friend insisted this would be a product I would love.  I have issues with even tone, fine lines and pore size. I have used everything including Murad &amp; Obagi. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!  This is the first time EVER that I have had these kind of results from any product... EVER! My skin tone is already much more even, my pore size has noticably decreased and I can see a difference in the texture and fine lines.  This stuff is unbelievable. The smell is not that pretty sweet fragrance that most people like but really not a big deal. My skin does get a little taut once I first apply but that is totally a normal part of using the product... Google it!  In the morning, my skin is super soft and smooth,feels very hydrated.  I am absolutely convinced that this is the answer I have been searching for.  Everyone has different skin and sensitivities. This may not be the perfect solution for everyone... but it for sure is for me! I also don&#x27;t sell the product at all... but I can see why someone would start to. This stuff sells itself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost a month now and have been so thrilled with the results.  I have sensitive combination skin and was kind of afraid to try the product.  In the first week I saw smoother and firmer skin, in the second week I felt that my skin was much softer, and saw a reduction in the dark spots I have on my jaw line from picking pimples in my teens and early 20s. I was a skeptic and am now a full believer that this product works and works well. I didn&#x27;t have many lines before, but looked in the mirror at the beginning of week 3 and saw my 24 year old self looking back at me. Absolutely amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the skeptics out there - DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON, EBAY, OR FROM ANY 3RD PARTY VENDOR.  Go through a Nerium person and try the product risk free for 30 days. You literally have nothing to lose. If you buy from here, you&#x27;re out of luck if you don&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical so a friend gave me a bottle...after 6 weeks the lines in my forehead are almost GONE!!! I immediately signed up and have about 8 people under me, am making $$ and every month people say wow you must be getting BOTOX!!! NOT!! Anyone who says this product does not work is lying, every person I signed up have had remarkable results and I got the pictures to prove it...now you may have a reaction to the Plant the product is made from but that&#x27;s it....this product was developed by accident by a Dr at MD Anderson for burn patients, a ton of research and $$ has been poured into this product and its worth every dime to purchase it,,I say try it, what have you got to lose but some wrinkles:))) An extremely happy Nerium partner and customer... Sandy Butler---Houston Texas</li>
            <li> i have been using nerium for 5 wks and  wrinkles around my mouth are getting better. My hubsan commented on how my cheeks look like that of a 21 yr old. I feel like it only continue to get better. It took a month before i noticed results so dont give up. I am looking forward to the next month of using it. I dont find the smell offensive, to me it smeels like a smelly flower.  oh im at 54.</li>
            <li> Nerium is sold exclusively by independent brand partners so if you bought on Amazon.com you bought from someone who will lose the right to sell the product in the future and may or may not be ACTUAL Nerium AD.  You can purchase Nerium AD via independent brand partners like me and I personally stand behind the product as well.  I have had excellent results and that&#x27;s why I chose to be able to offer it.  Hopefully you took advantage of the money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 4 nights. It worked right away. Wrinkles diminished and skin texture evened out.  I am a skin care junkie - Obagi, etc. I am hyper aware of my skin and its current condition (fluctuates with sun exposure and Obagi usage). My friend gave me a bottle of Nerium and since I had not used Obagi for a good month or so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the third night I noticed my eyes looked irritated - I kept using the Nerium as I was seeing results. I never (throughout the test) applied it around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth night - eyes looking irritated but I used the Nerium without thinking. Woke up on the fifth day with RED racoon circles around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a true skin care junky I will be using the rest of the bottle on my sun damaged chest :) Never again on my face.</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the smell! Terrible!!!!!! If its too good to be true than it is! Just another MLM. Oil of Olay for me!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 30 days, and saw NO results. For $80 a bottle, in 3 months I could have saved enough for botox, for the one line on my forehead, I was focused on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw images of people, with very deep lines on their faces, that miraculously disappeared in 10 days.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  My line was much smaller, and NONE of it was gone in a month.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed in the results.  I have used this product for two months and have not noticed any difference in my skin.  Was told it would diminish brown spots, tighten skin, and improve skin texture.  Will use for one more month and if I do not see results, I will discontinue.  Cost of nearly $100 month is very high.</li>
            <li> I am so sick to my stomach from the smell alone I am pretty sure it can&#x27;t be worth 80$ don&#x27;t try it, something is wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I never leave bad reviews but this product is waste of money.  Tried it for a week,and ended up w couple of huge pimples on my otherwise  flawless skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. Everything makes me break out, so I have for many years used products with the best ingredients I can find. My favorite moisturizer was Skinceuticals prior to trying Nerium. The Nerium night cream has made my skin radiant, clear and soft. I had to stop using my day cream and only use sunscreen now because my skin is retaining the moisture from the Nerium. I have seen the fine lines around my eyes diminish. The crepe-like texture of my neck has also diminished. I am 42 and have taken very good care of my skin. My parents are both trying Nerium and I think it will take 4-5 months to see the best results on their more aged skin, accoding to my friends who have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very strong Oleander smell. I am also very sensitive to smells and have stopped using products because all artificial ingredient smells make me sneeze. The Nerium was very strong the first 3 nights, but after that I barely smelled it. Now, after 6 weeks, I cannot smell it at all. I no longer have the \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; feeling on my face, either, after 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really LOVE this product and kinda wish they didn&#x27;t sell it through multi-level marketing. That part of Nerium makes it HARDER to recommend to my friends because they are suspect once they hear it is multi-level marketing.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month and was hesitant with price, however the results are worth it and I have extremely sensitive skin and not had any reaction and have noticed a huge decrease in my pores size and less redness and and brown spots -skin overall more even toned and less eye and forehead wrinkles, I have been impressed!</li>
            <li> I love the product and have been using it for two months with dramatic results. I got it from a friend of mine, and the company gives you a website that you can use to refer your friends to. If you refer to three of your friends, you get yours for free, so I don&#x27;t know why someone would buy it on Amazon. Also, Nerium gives you a 30-day money back guarantee that you get when you buy from a brand partner, so it&#x27;s much better to find your product that way. Once you try it, you will not want to stop!!</li>
            <li> I used it but had no results and the product bothered my eyes and made them red.I found no extra results from the cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help out a friend, plus I was excited about the good reviews and was eager to see results.  However, after a week my face broke out, all over, in terrible painful acne.  I discontinued use and still have painful bumps now, over a week later.  DO NOT waste your money on this... $100 buck for one ounce?? Come on, it&#x27;s a marketing scam.</li>
            <li> I used this product of a month.  I could see no improvement in my&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;skin - Esthetitian (facial) said she saw clogged pores where there were&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;none the month before.  I found the product very drying.  My&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;main complaint is it smells terrible.  Don&#x27;t know why they&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t have had it smell better.  They also make you print forms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and fax them to cancel auto monthly and don&#x27;t guarantee returns after 30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;days of first order.</li>
            <li> I tried Nerium with abbbsolutely no expectations that anything had improved/changed.  After one week, a male client asked whether or not I&#x27;d just had a facial  (no) or maybe a peel  (no).  The only change was that i could think of was the night cream.&lt;br /&gt; I also used the product on a raised surgical scar below my bra line and overnight the scar was much flatter.  Mind you i had several injections from the dermatologist and while they were improved, they were still very present, ugly, and that particular one was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a real make-up oriented person but I hated the \\&quot;Howdy-Doody\\&quot;  facial lines and my turkey waddle neck so I had been fantasizing about a \\&quot;face-lift\\&quot;.  Now, in less than one month my neck has improved according to the young people around me.  My facial lines are not as deep.  I also like that it&#x27;s only one product so it&#x27;s time efficient and cost effective.  I&#x27;ve spent much more than $110 on \\&quot;skin care product lines\\&quot;  where you have to have 3 -5 jars of \\&quot;STUFF\\&quot; in order for the company to stand behind their products.  Just check any product line in the department stores.&lt;br /&gt;I am 67 years old and I&#x27;m totally bought in.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was highly recommended.  I just started using it.  It feels tight on your skin when you first put it on, almost like a facial mask from years ago.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement yet, but only have used it 4 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a month.  I don&#x27;t know why people are so bothered by the smell.  Maybe they are just used to product with a lot of perfume in it.  After it dries my skin looks way better, but still waiting to see some permanent results.</li>
            <li> I used Nerium and really loved the results,not what I had hoped for, but made my skin look and feel better.  I became a BP, and went to a couple of meetings etc. etc.  I found that the high pressure approach to signing up people and very little product knowledge was a turn off.  I am a cosmetologist by trade, and have had extensive training in skin Care.  Nerium has no cleanser, toner or day moisturizer, so in my search for a product that was compatible with Nerium, I discovered TreSkinRX, which uses the very same Medical grade Aloe Vera as a base, and was formulated by a Board Certified Plastic/Cosmetic Surgeon. TreskinRX works beautifully with Nerium, the Purifying Cleanser, Toner (for that moist skin needed to apply Nerium) and Day Moisturizer especially work wonderfully with Nerium.  The Company is laid back, friendly and not pushy whatsoever in the sales approach, they have a terrific product that they want to share with the world. TreSkinRX is made in the USA, and I have to tell you, I just love it!  I still use Nerium some of the time, but the results seemed to only give me &#x27;so much&#x27; and that was it. Feel free to contact TreSkinRX for more info and please, use my name! And, like Nerium, TreSkinRX is made in the USA!!!</li>
            <li> No results, feels gross on my skin and smells like an alley.  I only gave it one star because I had to.  It deserves negative stars!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost finished w/my first bottle.  It works as described. There&#x27;s a noticeable difference in my skin tone. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I have used this product and have not noticed any difference in my skin at all,  just in case i took pictures before and after every week for 3 weeks and no difference at all... I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought the results would be a lot quicker based on the on-line promotions and the cost of the product. However, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks - every night - and do not see as drastic difference as they indicate you would within the first week.  But since I do see a little difference I will at least keep using it until the bottle is out.  I am not sure at this point though if I would spend another $100 for a second bottle.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, it broke me out and it&#x27;s very expensive. Definitely better skincare products on the market. I also feel like the people selling it are too pushy. Overall just not impressed. I&#x27;ll stick with my regular skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium for 2 months and my skin is softer, my pores are smaller, my crows feet are GONE!  Even my friends and co-workers have been commenting on my face.  The 3 your free program is an awesome way to get you product for only S&amp;H which is a DEAL!</li>
            <li> looks good when applied at night because it feels like glue on your face so skin is tighter, other than that no noticeable difference</li>
            <li> ..but you have to know how to use it. Before bed, make sure to apply 4-5 pumps to damp skin and massage in. Then rinse off in the morning. Five days later, my lines had visibly softened!! You MUST take before and after pictures to truly see the benefit in such a short period of time. I&#x27;ve been using it this way for two months and have never seen a product work the way this one does. The scent may be slightly off-putting to some, it smells a bit musky/plant-like. However the results are seriously worth it. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Sad to see negative comments about Nerium.  I am loving this anti-aging/healing cream.  The odor is not bad. Has a wet woodsy odor and the tightening action I feel after putting it on feels great.  I am on day 29 and my discoloration is gone, redness is gone, texture is super smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any acne for 29 days.  I&#x27;m measuring the wrinkle result between my eyebrows.  Took a pic after 20 days and 1 of the 5 lines is gone.  The others are softening.  Sorry, if some of you had a negative dealing with your Nerium rep.  Mine has been fabulous AND Nerium rewards it&#x27;s customers.  Since I love it so much and have had 3 friends order, my next month&#x27;s bottle is FREE !  I&#x27;ve attended the Real Result parties in my area with a friend to learn more about the product and there have been NO pressures at all.  My dealings with Nerium and the reps in my area is outstanding!</li>
            <li> I am 58 and Nerium made my skin tone look 20 years younger. Then the dark circles under my eyes went away. At 6 months, the wrinkly frown lines are almost gone between my eyes. Now my husband uses it and my 21 year old has started as she had breakouts. I don&#x27;t understand why people have been critical. I spent plenty of money  at Nordstroms on tiny bottles of stuff from Este Lauder and Lancome and didn&#x27;t see a thing. And FYI, that Aloe Vera smell is gone as soon as it dries, in about 3 minutes. So sorry it didn&#x27;t work out for some of you. Fab for me!</li>
            <li> OMG this sh*t is bad, itchjy as hell, and for three days and i stopped using it 3 days ago.  john masters antiaging vitamin c antiaging serum is the best, and is refundable if you get it at whole foods.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nerium Ad for three weeks.  The texture of my skin has transformed.  My skin is also firmer.  The tone is also changing.  I have rosacea and the redness is diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;I find it interesting people purchased this product through Nerium AD Brand partners but are complaining about it on Amazon.  More than likely competitors paying bloggers to complain.</li>
            <li> Status Update&lt;br /&gt;By Rhayne Thomas&lt;br /&gt;Here is an update from that NERIUM company that everybody seems to love. Some of you remember that back in Sept 2012 I used it once &amp; had a horrible allergic reaction that shut my eyes, had me going to several doctors in different cities over the past few months and created a lump ON my right lid as well as a lump UNDER my right lid, which is still there. Last Friday I had the outside lump surgically removed and I still have the one under my lid. My reaction also led to blood in my sinuses as well as swelling in my nose and throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NERIUM did EVERYTHING in their power to try and accuse me of misuse as well as saying that \\&quot;no one else EVER had a reaction\\&quot; which, as you will see in FB, others have had some bad reactions and NERIUM blew them off as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received FB messages from Amber Olsen who is one of the VP&#x27;s at NERIUM telling me that she will call me and make sure that everything will be taken care of. I received that same message from NERIUM CEO, Jeff Olsen, as well as a phone call from one of his \\&quot;assistants\\&quot; assuring me Jeff is a \\&quot;great guy\\&quot; and will take care of me. Now it is April 2013, SEVEN (7) months after the incident and even though I have been aggressively pursuing them, I still haven&#x27;t heard from either Amber or Jeff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a writer and musician my eyes are extremely important to me and any discomfort makes it hard for me to read and besides, who wants to be on stage, in magazines and on television with a disfigured eye?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NERIUM swears it is a company that cares for people and helps people become wealthy through their products. Based on the way they have handled my situation, they are a company that is built on greed and shady ethics because a company built on honesty takes responsibility for the good and the bad and does not ignore serious complaints but grows from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If NERIUM believes I am going away, they are sadly mistaken. Someone needs to understandthat everyone doesn&#x27;t roll over and play dead because they get the runarounds from companies. I will use my voice as an international writer and performer to tell everyone I know, everywhere I interview and everyone I meet about NERIUM&#x27;s lack of ethics AND I will post pictures of my eye on FB so EVERYONE can see that there is the possibility for a reaction before someone ends up going blind, or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of you have sent me a message on FB telling me about your adverse reactions and how NERIUM either blamed you, belittled you or just ignore you. Please FB me as my next step is a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT to show NERIUM that they can&#x27;t just make people go away. If NERIUM can \\&quot;create\\&quot; millionaires with their products then they can create peace among complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: NERIUM lovers, DO NOT message me telling me how wonderful they are and how much you love them because that has no bearing on their actions towards those of us who have had medical attention because of their products.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me a sample bottle to try. She told me right off to take before pic&#x27;s and after pic&#x27;s. I started using it at night like it says, to me it has the smell of rice baby food with a hint of banana pleasant enough. Here&#x27;s the deal after 6 nights I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference until I took the after pic&#x27;s. Proof is always in the pictures\\&quot; Pictures don&#x27;t lie. There was a difference and all to the good. I will now become a distributer of this product, Why because I believe in it. It works and the best part is it only takes one product no cleansers and toners night creams day creams, eye creams to buy just one simple bottle and much cheaper than all the other combinations. I&#x27;ve spent lots of money I&#x27;ve tried many products. This is the one and only one for me. I&#x27;m very excited about getting started today. Sincerely Cindy Morton-Stuart</li>
            <li> Okay I have read all the reviews and I know this product works. I am on it now and have been for 4 days so I don&#x27;t count. But my friends that have been using it look great!! They have all been in the sun because they either play volleyball or watch their kids play so lots of sun damage. They look so great now and have completely stopped wearing makeup. I could not believe how great they look now after about 3 months of using the product. Radiant would be a word I would use. I would say try it and see what it does for you. $80 Plus tax but just think how much do you pay for all the creams you use, this is just one thing that goes on at night and your face must be wet plus your hands must be wet 4 pumps rub your hands together and apply. Plus I don&#x27;t think it smells at all, your face feels so good in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sheishido for the past 10years cost me over 400$ a set , a few month ago my friends refered to Nerium AD 30days money back guarantee I tried for the first 2 week I felt something different but can&#x27;t tell what.. until 4 week later everyone told me that I looked bright &amp; younger, my dark spots are gone about 80% &amp; removed my double chin off too ! I love Nerium AD &amp; don&#x27;t mind to share it with friends &amp; family&#x27;s now I received Free product monthly-:)</li>
            <li> Nerium worked for me after less than 30 days use...amazing how it softened my skin and eased the wrinkles.  I am \\&quot;old\\&quot; and would not have even tried the product had it not been a gift from&lt;br /&gt;my daughter.  One thing that is so appealing is it is a one step skin care product..applied on my damp face and neck every night and rinsed off in the morning before applying usual moisturizer and&lt;br /&gt;make up...fast, easy and it has definitely improved my skin!  Will I ever look 40 again...NO, but my family and friends notice a real difference!  Enough said!</li>
            <li> This product is scientifically proven to give results of %30 improvement in 30 days! enough said it works! You can get it free by signing up as a preferred customer.</li>
            <li> I had this product as a \\&quot;trial\\&quot; for 5 days. After using it for 2 days, I started to break out and my lines on my face were more noticeable then before I started it. I went back to using my other face creams! No product should make you break out and you be told \\&quot;because it&#x27;s bringing your impurities to the surface\\&quot;. More like it was clogging my pores, and it stinks! I don&#x27;t need to look like an adult with bad acne for $80 a bottle and automatic renewal. I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 bottles of Nerium on Amazon, one was old (had an older label) and one had been overheated and was rancid.  My neighbor who sells Nerium said it must have been left in a hot car or something, it was dark brown and smelled rotten.  I have since bought fresh bottles through my neighbor, sent straight from the company, and they were fine.  It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;ve seen many improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> I signed up as a brand partner last year and started using the product immediately. I have never done multi-level marketing before but the before and after pics and testimonials at the meeting were amazing so I made a $500 investment. The first couple of months I could see a minor difference but nothing after that. I have now been using it for almost 8 months and I still have the crows feet, my one and only age spot and large pores. I quit selling a few months ago because I didn&#x27;t believe in the product anymore and all of my \\&quot;preferred customers\\&quot; cancelled their accounts so I wasn&#x27;t getting free bottles anymore. My customers cancelled for 2 reasons, one because they were not seeing the results promised and the other is that the bottle of product lasts about 6 weeks and they send out your new bottle every 30 days on auto ship. Another thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the overly aggressive sales approach. I was pressured from the lady that I was working under more than I was at my full time job! Just my experience. Maybe someone else has seen great results. Not for me though!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was told nerium was perfect for me! They were wrong! My skin immediately turned red and began to itch. I only used one pump and plenty of water. I only used it for two days. It&#x27;s not worth the $100 dollars and the customer service wasn&#x27;t very nice. If you have redness before using product I would really consider not using it because it made my redness worse!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for a few days now and I am African American.  It cleared up my dark spots under my eyes, HOWEVER, I had a strange reaction.  Other than the product making my skin itchy, and my eczema dry patches flaking, I experienced something like a vertigo.  On Day 1 and 2, I applied the cream and it was of course, smelly and  felt like a mask.  I got over it and I was fine.  On Day 3, in the morning, I experienced dizziness and nausea. I am not pregnant and ate the same breakfast I had have for over 15 years.  So I decided to stop using the product on the night of Day 3.  Felt better in the morning, but went to the doctor who could not understand the sudden dizziness and nausea.  My blood pressure was fine, I did not have a stroke, it was just weird.  Although I was a little dizzy, I decided to try Nerium again on Day 4.  I applied the cream on damp skin.  I felt the dizziness coming on again and my face was itchy.  So I washed the product off and am not using it anymore.  Very strange experience!!</li>
            <li> From the beginning it was hard to ignore the stinky strong smell, but I wanted to give the product a chance.  I used it faithfully for 3.5 weeks and then my face started breaking out, so I quit using the product and have been happy ever since!</li>
            <li> I LOVE NeriumAD. I am addicted to this stuff. I was introduced to Nerium by an old high school friend at my brother&#x27;s wedding.  She looked so great, I asked her what was her \\&quot;secret sauce.\\&quot;  She shared with me that she had been using Nerium, and suggested I try it.  Since it is offered by Brand Partners, which she was one, I signed up to be a preferred customer.  I tried so hard NOT to like this product.  I wanted a reason to not spend the money on one more product that made false promises.  After 1 week, I said, \\&quot;fooey\\&quot; this stuff doesn&#x27;t work, when my husband politely told me that my skin looked brighter and I didn&#x27;t look as tired as I had been.  So, I kept on for two weeks. I took the before and after pictures, and after three weeks I put my pictures side by side on my computer and was amazed at the difference in my skin.  The wrinkles had smoothed out, my skin looked moisturized and had a brightness (glow).  Maybe the naysayers just didn&#x27;t give it enough time, maybe they didn&#x27;t take and compare their pictures, but this stuff is the real deal!  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only $80.</li>
            <li> It is picking up the area that looked like my face was sliding off.&lt;br /&gt;I will know more later, but after 1 month, I am happy!</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews about what a scam Nerium can be.  If it is not applied properly, it is not as remarkable as one would like.  When applying, the skin should be wet so the thicker serum can be spread evenly and the moisture makes the skin more receptive.  I made this error once, posed the observation and learned that the moisture on the complexion is the key.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I kept seeing everyone talking about this amazing skincare called Nerium.  So when a girl on my FB page asked women if they wanted to do a five day trial, I figured what the heck! I see that lots of people on here have complained about the smell, but it&#x27;s honestly not bad at all.  I think some people just look for a reason to complain.;)  Well I did the trial which actually was enough for more than five days and I fell in love with the product!  So much that I bought another five days worth because I still needed more convincing...lol!  It started working pretty quickly.  I had recently gotten a chemical peel and it literally healed my face from the peel!  Not to mention it cleared up my adult acne, started to fade a large sun spot and my face feels so soft and amazing!  I highly recommend you give Nerium a try and no, I do not do the business!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I have NEVER tried Nerium and NEVER will.  My beef is with the pushy marketing.  I absolutely despise MLM schemes!  I have a \\&quot;friend\\&quot; who relentlessly pushes this crap on me, in spite of my repeatedly telling her I have a serious allergy to Oleander.  I can&#x27;t even walk by an Oleander bush without an allergic reaction.  Why, in the name of all that is holy, would I put it on my face?!?!?  This just doesn&#x27;t sink in with her.  She keeps insisting that it is tested and proven safe, yada, yada, yada.....Is she stone cold deaf or just plain stupid?!  It has gotten to the point where I only hear from her when there is some kind of indoctrination meeting she wants me to attend or some push to try a free sample.  I don&#x27;t like what MLM schemes do to friendships.  It&#x27;s not OK to use people in this manner in the name of the almighty dollar!</li>
            <li> I was told about this product from a friend and was in need of finding a good night cream, so I gave it a try.  It&#x27;s been 1 week now and I am seeing and feeling a difference in my skin (I&#x27;m 45); it feels smoother, fine lines are less noticeable, and the dark spots on my face, hands and chest appear lighter.  The smell is a little interesting, smells like Witch-Hazel, and I almost didn&#x27;t continue using it, but now after a week I don&#x27;t notice the smell after 5 minutes of application.  Nerium AD also makes my skin feel a little dry right after application, however that feeling also goes away after 5 minutes of application and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels very soft and hydrated. I would have given the product 5 stars if it smelled a little better.  I would recommend Nerium AD to a friend :)</li>
            <li> For $90 - $110 a month, I had better see instant results.  I saw some lines soften while the product was on my face, but not overall.  I did not see any blending of skin tone, and actually had some breakouts after I started using it.  I&#x27;m thinking this is the only month I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, the texture was like concrete, &amp; the cost was outrageous.  And, for all of you out there who have been led to believe that MD Anderson had anything to do with this...they didn&#x27;t!  Really?!?  Do you think MD Anderson is worried about helping people get rid of wrinkles when they are trying to cure cancer?  That&#x27;s insulting &amp; it&#x27;s a lie!</li>
            <li> My wife used this and I noticed an improvement. Her sister used the same product and it looked to me like she was having an allergic reaction. Which does not surprise me because she is allergic to peanuts. She was happy with the results, so I guess that is all that matters. It looks to me like there are a lot of proven ingredients in their natural more expansive and more effective state. There should be something in there that would help most anyone if they are not sensitive to plants where they would have a reaction.</li>
            <li> Became a Brand Partner of this product on the persistent prodding by another Brand Partner.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this product for four months, did not notice any significant improvement in my skin. I really wanted to give this product a chance given the cult like following of this product. At $100.00 a bottle, i found this product not living up to the hype. Most people i approached to market this seemed turned off by the MLM/Pyramid scheme. If the product truly lived up to its claims, it would cost 10 times more. Also i found that people could buy this product at a cheaper price on the internet. In my opinion, this product is not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> I used Nerium for 3 months as my manager said \\&quot;give it time to work\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;3 months, $300.00 later it does NOT work, made me look older as it dryed and pulled my skin together it made my lines look deeper in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;Smells really bad.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen a change in anyone using it..in person!&lt;br /&gt;Even my manager looks the same, but she keeps saying she sees a gradual difference in her face...sorry don\\&quot;t see it!&lt;br /&gt;The way this company is set up reminds me of a pyramid scheme!&lt;br /&gt;My advise \\&quot;RIP OFF\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> As the owner of Cornerstone Wellness Center in Monterey, CA for the past 18 years, I am extremely picky when it comes to the products I use in my practice.  I was introduced to Nerium AD by an old friend of 30 years.  I took a look at the product when she showed me her before and after pictures.  She was considering a face lift because she was developing some deep jowls when her sister recommended that she try Nerium AD instead.  Well I have to say that after 90 days using the product her jowls are gone!!!  I was very, very impressed with what I saw. My own personal results and the results of my clients have also been extremely impressive.  The important thing is to take good before and after pictures so you can really see the difference.  Some people respond more quickly than others depending upon their individual state of health, hydration and nutrition. Overall I do give Nerium AD five stars and hope you will give it a try. :)</li>
            <li> What a joke,  it is a scam.  It did nothing for my wrinkles, they are all still there and then to top it off I unknowingly receive and additional bottle that was billed to my credit card. I would NEVER knowingly agree to this.! It gets even better after calling the Nerium phone # listed on my receipt they told me I couldn&#x27;t return the product that I had knowingly purchased because It had to be returned within 30 days and I had the product for 34 days.  There was nothing on the receipt that indicated there was a particular time frame that the product must be returned within.  All the receipt stated was that at least 70% of the product must be used before it could be returned.  They told me it was all stated on their web site.  So evidently they assume that I would be reading the fine print on their web site in my spare time.  I&#x27;m sure they will fade out just like all scams do but just remember their unethical business practice and buyer beware the product it poor and they are both unethical and unprofessional. If the product really worked do you think they&#x27;d have to promote their product in this way?</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product at first.  A friend convinced me to give Nerium a REAL try.  I did break out some at first.  I told my friend about it and she said to keep using it as it is taking out the impurities.  I kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;Now my skin is beautiful!!  I am so glad that I did not stop using this!!  My friend was right!  NeriumAD IS the best!  I will never use anything else!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin no longer breaks out!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you, if you do break out at first, KEEP USING IT!  It will clear up and your skin will start to look better!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the smell at first and it was kind of strong, but after using it for a little over 2 months, I no longer can smell it.  I guess I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Nerium is a great skincare product and definitely worth trying...at least for 1 month!  The results will vary from person to person!  Some will notice improvement sooner than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++ for NeriumAD!!</li>
            <li> I tried Nerium for 3 days. I have 2 friends who are brand partners, one of whom earned a Lexus. They really love it and they both look great. The product I was using and liked was discontinued so I decided to try it. \\&quot;I have sensitive skin. I have a hard time finding products\\&quot;, I warned. \\&quot;It&#x27;s all natural, hypoallergenic etc. You have nothing to worry about\\&quot;, I was assured. \\&quot;No one I know has had a reaction to it\\&quot;, I was told. 1st night, felt tingling. Called my friend the next day and told her. She told me that was normal. The next night - burning. Next morning - rash. Called and told her. Her response, \\&quot;It must be something else, what else are you using?\\&quot; Answer, \\&quot;Nothing!\\&quot; I don&#x27;t wear make up. I was not using any other moisturizer. I wash my face with Neutrogena. Which I haven&#x27;t reacted too. Tried it one more night, thought maybe I just had to get used to it. Itching woke me up, washed my face, haven&#x27;t used it since. Saw my friend the next day and she had to admit I wasn&#x27;t exaggerating. At least I wasn&#x27;t the only one with a red face ;). She felt really bad and now warns people if they have sensitive skin to proceed with caution, but she still sells it and believes in it. So Nerium wasn&#x27;t for me and I have no hard feelings. I only wrote because of all the reviews/replies I&#x27;ve read that are telling people who wrote that they have reactions/rashes that they were not believable or were lying or were working for another company. Maybe some of them are, but I know from my own personal experience that I had a negative reaction. If you have sensitive skin, Rosacea, or react to face creams with a scent then proceed with caution. Don&#x27;t jump into the auto reorder. Take advantage of they trial before you buy it.</li>
            <li> Nerium Is an amazing product I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and other parts of my body for 15 months and have had no adverse reactions only positive results it&#x27;s taken years off of my face!&lt;br /&gt;There are a small percentage of people that have allergic reactions to products on the market and it&#x27;s unfortunate that those that do decide to personally attack the company.&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this company has been positive and a wonderful experience I love my product!</li>
            <li> I have to start of by saying that I was a Brand Partner until recently. The product does have a distinct smell to it that is not bad after you get use to it. I have seen it work AMAZING on people that I personally know however I have also seen people that have had allergic reactions to it including me. I used it for about 2 months with no problems and then one morning I wake up with a rash around my eyes and nearly swollen shut. Thought it might have been the soap I used the night before. Waited a week and tried again doing exactly what I did before I got the rash, got up the next morning and my eyes looked horrible. Went to the dermatologist to get medicine this time,we tried a few more things and with no luck my eyes always looked horrible the next day. Like I said before I have seen this work amazingly on some people but for some reason I could no longer use it which it made it difficult to sell.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me what was left in a bottle in march .I took my picture and tried it faithfully.Bought my second bottle . Well ,my real estate wanted to know what i use and soon after many more ladies wanted to know. Im afraid to quit now I might go poof. I just married the man of everyones dreams and thinking of selling it. Oh yes I just went to the Dr and she said how old are you ? I told her and she said what do you use write it down for me . You look 40 ! Not bad for 75 LOL Thank you Nerium Im buying it ahead 6/21/13  oh I looked at pics I too at started It wasn t a pretty sight.</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say that I believe most of the posts on here giving this product 5 stars must be the individuals selling the product or they work for the company.  This company is new and is a multilevel sales operation.  So, I tried the product because a friend that I know and trust introduced me to Nerium.  She told me to use the product for 1 week and note the changes.  There were definitely changes, but they were not good ones.  Nerium dried out my skin.  When I explained to her what it did, she said in fact that it is drying and that I should use a good moisturizer in the morning.  Well, I took before and after photos and noticed that my fine lines got worse and the skin on my eyelid drooped more than before.  In addition; I later found out that this Nerium is manufactured using Oleander.  OLEANDER?!!!! This plant is deadly and toxic!  Of course when I told her that this is what I found out she explained to me that the &#x27;company&#x27; extracts the &#x27;good stuff&#x27; from the flower plant and that Nerium has the patent on how to extract it.  Honestly; I did a lot of research on the company and the product and there is absolute &#x27;ZERO&#x27; evidence to back up there claims and their pseudo science!  PLEASE DO YOUR HOMEWORK lest you be out $120 for nothing.  If dry skin is what you are after, then by all means BUY NERIUM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition; I was redirected to speak with someone that &#x27;knows&#x27; more than &#x27;I&#x27; on this product...of course they wanted to speak to someone that is &#x27;knowledgeable&#x27; of course they WORK for NERIUM...do the math!</li>
