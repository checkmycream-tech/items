            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I used this and really liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I had never considered using one of these before, but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to handle!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I think gives it more power than a battery powered one.</li>

            <li>Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>They are also many typos on the box, which makes me suspicious of the quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is faster and is safer than most because it has no metal scrapers or blades that can cut the skin, and cause injury, or infection.</li>

            <li>got here fast  and good product</li>
            <li>so I was excited to not have to do that any more.</li>
            <li>I like the mobility of being cordless, and having the recharging system instead of batteries is a huge plus for me since my kids tend to use up any and all batteries in my home.</li>
            <li>I just pressed it lightly against my skin on my heel and foot.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more powerful than it claims to be.</li>
            <li>But trust me, the only thing you&#x27;ll be feeling is relief, excitement, and pure joy at how easy and fun this is to use!  </li>

            <li>It was easy to hold and wasn&#x27;t too loud once you had it on your foot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt funny at first but was quite relaxing.</li>
            <li>and my feet are smooth and soft.  </li>

            <li>used this on my own feet a few times now and at first, I was scared because I have never used one of these before.</li>
            <li>After my shower I gave both feet the once over and the calluses are much smoother as are the heels.  </li>
            <li>It works well, but runs out of battery surprisingly fast.</li>
            <li>I have used the product, and it is much easier than the manual foot &amp;#34;file&amp;#34;, and quicker which I like too.</li>
            <li>no batteries needed just charge it up and it ready to go...</li>
            <li>This item was my only compensation and the above experiences and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique in the fact that the roller spins 360Â° at 40 times per second!</li>
            <li>I was excited to recieve this because I literally wear flip flops all year long except when I leave the house in the winter of course!</li>
            <li>, do not use this on anything other than your feet and do not use on a certain area for more than 2 to 3 seconds at a time or on skin that is red, inflamed or irritated.</li>
            <li>I was looking at the  Amope tool that&#x27;s new out there &amp; saw this.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at just how well this worked.  </li>
            <li>I am a busy person, and don&#x27;t always take care of myself the way I know</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also waterproof and be used wet or dry, even right out of the bath or shower.</li>
            <li>Because of this little handheld piece of heaven, my feet are officially ready for summer!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have never used one of these till now, I&#x27;m amazed how well it cleans up my calluses and with little effort. Excellent gift for my mom. I love it.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I used this and really liked it. The fact that it is rechargeable is a plus and I think gives it more power than a battery powered one. This is a must have for flip flop season.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased one of these but wish I had seen this one with the the optional plug. This is a MUST HAVE for the summer! Love mine....</li>
            <li> Excellent product...my feet are way softer</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews of this callus remover as well as the more expensive ones and decided to go with the #1 and I&#x27;m glad I did.  My feet were a mess with calluses, so the minute I received mine I charged it up and got to work.  Use this lightly and don&#x27;t press down too hard since the abrasive roller will slow down (after all, you want to remove the calluses, not skin down to the bone).  I was surprised at just how well this worked.  After my shower I gave both feet the once over and the calluses are much smoother as are the heels.  I&#x27;ve used a pumice stone in the past, but this works better and leaves no little bristly bits of callus behind.  Well done, Auto Step!</li>
            <li> AWESOME!  I&#x27;ve been needing something like this electronic pedicure for callouses on the big toe and this works wonderfully.  Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  So glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> It works well, but runs out of battery surprisingly fast. They are also many typos on the box, which makes me suspicious of the quality.</li>
            <li> excellent!  It actually works!  Best tool I have found! I walk about 6 miles a day and get thrashed.....this tool makes them feel wonderful again!</li>
            <li> I loved it. Its lightweight, sleek, and fully functional. It&#x27;s rechargeable, so you can take it with you or use it where you want, like in front of the tv at night. It&#x27;s also waterproof and be used wet or dry, even right out of the bath or shower. It&#x27;s unique in the fact that the roller spins 360Â° at 40 times per second! That&#x27;s fast.&lt;br /&gt;It is faster and is safer than most because it has no metal scrapers or blades that can cut the skin, and cause injury, or infection. Which I like because that means no pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my own feet a few times now and at first, I was scared because I have never used one of these before. I didn&#x27;t know what it would feel like and thought it was going to hurt or tickle my feet and both options sounded awful. BUT, I did try it and it did not, I repeat, it Did Not hurt! Or tickle.&lt;br /&gt;It felt funny at first but was quite relaxing. It was easy to hold and wasn&#x27;t too loud once you had it on your foot. Just sounded like a tiny motor. I just pressed it lightly against my skin on my heel and foot. You don&#x27;t want to press hard or the roller will stop, which I found out a couple times, but that is typical and it even said that in the information pamphlet that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;I charged mine for a while, even though it was working when I got it, and I highly recommend you do as well. Once fully charged, it can be operated for a half hour! That&#x27;s a long time. I also loved the pretty blue color too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I had never considered using one of these before, but I am glad I did. After a couple uses, my skin is feeling softer and smoother and prettier. Because of this little handheld piece of heaven, my feet are officially ready for summer! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit includes:&lt;br /&gt;âªCallus Remover&lt;br /&gt;âªCharger Adaptor&lt;br /&gt;âªGrinding Head and Replacement&lt;br /&gt;âªProtective Cover for Grinding Head&lt;br /&gt;âªCleaning Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, do not use this on anything other than your feet and do not use on a certain area for more than 2 to 3 seconds at a time or on skin that is red, inflamed or irritated.

            <li> This was A gift for My Husband I bought it for His bad caluses He loves it  works really great</li>
            <li> I am a busy person, and don&#x27;t always take care of myself the way I know I should. I purchased the autopedi in hopes that I would take a few minutes here and there to take care of me for once. I have used the product, and it is much easier than the manual foot &amp;#34;file&amp;#34;, and quicker which I like too. I like the mobility of being cordless, and having the recharging system instead of batteries is a huge plus for me since my kids tend to use up any and all batteries in my home.</li>
            <li> does what it is suppose.  i would buy it again</li>
            <li> got here fast  and good product</li>
            <li> I was looking at the  Amope tool that&#x27;s new out there &amp; saw this. No Batteries needed! Used it on my husbands calloused feet &amp; it worked great.I tried it next , &amp; love it! Thanks for a great product that does what it says.âº</li>
            <li> After seeing commercials for the more expensive one I found this and decided to try it. My husband and I both use it and it has done wonders for us!</li>
            <li> I was doubtful when I received this product because I&#x27;m embarrassed to say I have horrible callouses on my feet.  As soon as I started using Auto Pedi, I saw a big difference.  I&#x27;ve used it several times now and my feet are smooth and soft.  I was a skeptic but now I&#x27;m a believer---highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Works great and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was excited to recieve this because I literally wear flip flops all year long except when I leave the house in the winter of course! I was using a foot file in the shower twice a week so I was excited to not have to do that any more. I charged my pedi file when I got it and tried it the next day. Although it works, I would have to spend more time using it than my manual foot file in the shower. Plus the dust from filing is awful. I wish it was more powerful than it claims to be. I&#x27;m just ok with this product. I&#x27;m not wowed.</li>
            <li> Can not believe how Amazingly it works! I used it on my fiancÃ© severly dry feet! Mind you...(He wont go to any foot spa) and WOW can you smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!;)) he likes it and I love it! Very light and easy to handle! no batteries needed just charge it up and it ready to go...&lt;br /&gt;Kathya:))</li>
