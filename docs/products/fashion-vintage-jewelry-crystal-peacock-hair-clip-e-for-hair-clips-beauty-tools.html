            <li>it looks better when u actually see it so cute</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan to order more, will make great Christmas present.</li>
            <li>heavy ornament but its beautiful</li>
            <li>my entire life I have loved peacocks and this necklace is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others.</li>
            <li>However, unless someone is looking close at it (which is rare), it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s def worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
            <li>It really looks good under bright lights, and has a clip which seems strong enough to hold my thick hair.</li>
            <li>This clip is large enough to hold my hair in place and it is stunning, so much better than the pic and much more than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>it looks very pretty, and it didn&#x27;t cost that much.</li>
            <li>Colors are super vibrant.</li>
            <li>It is actually pretty gig, almost the size of a barette.</li>
            <li>Still pretty</li>
            <li>It is even at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Easily dresses up a simple pony tail</li>
            <li>My initial order did not arrive and when I contacted Sodio, they were very quick in responding to my query as well as sending out a replacement.</li>
            <li>This product it&#x27;s beautiful but too big and heavy to wear.  </li>
            <li>This is a very classy looking product, looks really great in thick hair</li>
            <li>A little larger than anticipated but still great for a bun or updo.</li>
            <li>Anytime I see peacock jewelry at a reasonable price I buy it.</li>
            <li>The gems are very well attached.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real eye catcher.</li>
            <li>The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
            <li>I love this and the other clips like it that I got.</li>
            <li>and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait</li>
            <li>was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted.</li>
            <li>So overall I like the hair clip and will hopefully order more different designs like it!</li>
            <li>Holds onto my short but thick hair great.</li>
            <li>It is so pretty and actually made really well.</li>
            <li>i bought a few more</li>
            <li>very well worth the price for long hair.......</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the photo, and is large and colorful but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>; But other than that, it is very pretty!</li>
            <li>Really pretty and especially useful if you have extremely thick, curly hair that normal american clips won&#x27;t contain.&lt;br /&gt;Clip</li>
            <li>I LIVE THESE HAIR PINS.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very colorful, very pretty a little big</li>
            <li>This is also beautiful, and well made, BUT...it is also too heavy to wear in your hair, unless your hair is super long &amp; thick.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty accessory</li>
            <li>and I see the price double on them all not good or fair.</li>
            <li>I will use stones from one to make a complete one.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is very pretty.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the beauty and quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could be better is for it to curve a little with your head instead of being so flat.</li>
            <li>I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty item despite one of the jewels on mine being a little off center.</li>
            <li>It is also rather heavy (and large) (for a hair clip), which I would equate with it being durable.</li>
            <li>These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>

            <li> Gorgeous. Looks exactly like the photo, and is large and colorful but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2.  I wanted to give one as a gift.  Both arrived with stones missing.  The company has of today agreed to refund me half of my money.  I will use stones from one to make a complete one.  Other than that it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> I got so many commpliment about this item. I is made with heavy weight gold tone metal. and is approxiamatly 6 inches across.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty accessory but it takes about a month to arrive. If you can wait, then it&#x27;s quite a lovely piece.</li>
            <li> This hair clip was even prettier than the picture.  I gave it as a Christmas gift and my friend loved it.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and am yet getting praise for it! The recipient was delighted and wears it proudly.</li>
            <li> my entire life I have loved peacocks and this necklace is so pretty.  I keep it on the hook so I can see it when I want.  Anytime I see peacock jewelry at a reasonable price I buy it.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed, the stones are plastic. but, the colors are awesome and i can easily put it in my hair after braiding and it looks wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product it&#x27;s beautiful but too big and heavy to wear.  Other than it&#x27;s really beautiful and the ringstone are very bright.</li>
            <li> Lovely head piece I get so many compliments with it.</li>
            <li> I just got this peacock hair peace today, I will show it off to my friends and see what they think, but I think it&#x27;s very nice!</li>
            <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
            <li> It took around 2wks to arrive but when it did, it took my breath away! It goes all the way across the back of the head and looks awesome above a bun! Its light weight and does not tug at the hair. The gems are very well attached. I have received several compliments on it!</li>
            <li> I love this and the other clips like it that I got. I get so many compliments on it. It is so pretty and actually made really well. The only thing that could be better is for it to curve a little with your head instead of being so flat.</li>
            <li> I love this unique design.  Easily dresses up a simple pony tail</li>
            <li> Really pretty and especially useful if you have extremely thick, curly hair that normal american clips won&#x27;t contain.&lt;br /&gt;Clip clamps tight and does not come loose.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very beautiful. The colors are stunning. I will be ordering more of these to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Go Wrong in buying these, but after buying it I wanted to purchase more and I see the price double on them all not good or fair. The price should not go up any more. I will write the same review for them all because they are beautiful and the sellers are pretty good too, they will contact you almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted. thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented. i recommend. and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait i bought a few more so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others. i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece of hair jewelry, would not work well with very thin hair as it is a little heavy,  I have long hair and it stays in place beautifully.......very well worth the price for long hair.......</li>
            <li> The eye of the peacock is missing! :-&amp;#60; But other than that, it is very pretty! Just as described in the description and image shown. It is also rather heavy (and large) (for a hair clip), which I would equate with it being durable. So overall I like the hair clip and will hopefully order more different designs like it!</li>
            <li> Nice clip all the stones were there. look is nice. I&#x27;ll recommend if someone like peacock clip. Just Little heavy..</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!! I JUST RECEIVED THIS ORDER. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE LONG AGO...HOWEVER, GOOD THINGS ARE WORTH THE WAIT!  I LIVE THESE HAIR PINS.  MADE FOR SOMEOME WITH A LOT OF LONG HAIR.  I KNOW MY NIECES ARE GOING TO LOVE THESE HAIR PINS. ABOUT 3.5&amp;#34; LONG AND HEAVY.</li>
            <li> There were stones missing</li>
            <li> I love this peice.  It is art for the hair.  This is so beautiful.  It shipped quicklyand met my expectations.  It was something I thought about gifting, but its so pretty, I think I will keep it and order more for gifts.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty item despite one of the jewels on mine being a little off center. However, unless someone is looking close at it (which is rare), it&#x27;s not noticeable. I was surprised by the beauty and quality for the price. I would definitely buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and well constructed.  This is a substantial piece, not a small little barrette.  Receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in great condition and on time.  The piece is beautiful.  Wore it to work and got compliments on how pretty and unique it was!</li>
            <li> heavy ornament but its beautiful</li>
            <li> This is also beautiful, and well made, BUT...it is also too heavy to wear in your hair, unless your hair is super long &amp; thick.</li>
            <li> heavy and somewhat clumsy</li>
            <li> Gotten so many compliments from this piece. It will take up few weeks to arrive but for the price it&#x27;s def worth waiting for. For sure does not look like the amount you paid for. :)</li>
            <li> Just Beautiful! This is another winner! Large and expensive looking. Holds onto my short but thick hair great.</li>
            <li> Colors are super vibrant. All jewels were in tact. A little larger than anticipated but still great for a bun or updo.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is well made, and it it big enough to hold thick hair. I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This clip is just as gorgeous as it looks here.  And it is well made.  I wish it held all if my hair but I have to use thus clip for only part of my hair when I twist it up.</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous. It is actually pretty gig, almost the size of a barette.</li>
            <li> This piece is magnificent the stones and the rhinestones complement each other wonderfully. It&#x27;s a real eye catcher. Get it</li>
            <li> This clip has a spring hinge, not a closure that stays closed. Still pretty but I have to wear it over another clip to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very colorful, very pretty a little big that&#x27;s y I gave it 4 stars. But it&#x27;s very pretty. I have gotten allot of compliments on thus clip.</li>
            <li> It is cute. Unfortunately, it was completely broken when it arrived.</li>

            <li> I have now purchased several of these bejeweled &amp;#34;peacock&amp;#34; hair clips, and I just love them all!! They are very attractive, pretty, and very sturdy!!!</li>
            <li> When I received this item it was broken already</li>
            <li> This is beautiful. However it is much bigger than appears, as about 5&amp;#34; across. But a great way to dress up your hair for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> I got this hair clip through the mail today,and it is even more beautiful in person. I love these type of hair clips. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it! It is even at a reasonable price! Prices for these at the mall are outrageous!</li>
            <li> It is perfect just like the picture it is a little heavy but it is so beautiful best thing ever</li>
            <li> This is awesomely&lt;br /&gt;Cute. Great color it looks better when u actually see it so cute</li>
            <li> This is a very classy looking product, looks really great in thick hair and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. With the free shipping it&#x27;s well worth the price.  I bought extra ones for gifts.</li>
            <li> this clip is lovely, an excellent touch for the hair. My daughter and I both use it, it&#x27;s very light. item took a while to arrive, I was in no rush to get so it worked perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, it is also an attractive piece just hanging out on my dresser!</li>
            <li> My initial order did not arrive and when I contacted Sodio, they were very quick in responding to my query as well as sending out a replacement. I am very pleased with the product and will order again soon!</li>
            <li> So cute and it looks exactly like advertise.</li>
            <li> This clip is large enough to hold my hair in place and it is stunning, so much better than the pic and much more than I ever expected. Have seen products like this in the malls selling for $30. I definitely plan to order more, will make great Christmas present.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is a good size, perhaps about 5&amp;#34; and I was surprised by how sparkly it is. It really looks good under bright lights, and has a clip which seems strong enough to hold my thick hair. Prettier and more sparkly than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
            <li> Great clip, nice and sturdy and very unique! I haven&#x27;t seen this clips in any local store. My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> what is your phone number</li>
            <li> Nice quality. Great construction. Holds up well. No problems with this item. I get compliments on this every time I wear it.</li>
