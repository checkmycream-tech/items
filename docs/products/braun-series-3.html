            <li>&quot; just doesn&#x27;t fly.</li>
            <li>It also looks great, sitting in the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>It feels great in hand and the shaving part of the body groomer is well designed.</li>
            <li>This is a great device although I use it to shave my bald head.  </li>
            <li>It works great for his sideburns and mustache.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The blades without the peripherals are great if you want a close shave.</li>
            <li>It works great for me.</li>
            <li>It is great</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The replaceable blade is a great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I thought separately they worked great.</li>
            <li>Great product, would recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li>great product for the price</li>
            <li>I never used this product but the person that did said it was great</li>
            <li>Braun Cruzer 5 is a very effective answer to this problem.</li>
            <li>I use this device to shave all my chest hair, but what I like best about this product is that I am able to adjust it</li>
            <li>this is the best love it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did a good</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not so good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s painless and it cuts surprisingly close for an electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; this does a good job.</li>
            <li>the electric trimmer was of good quality I could have forgiven the product.</li>
            <li>Also, shaving in the shower just isn&#x27;t as practical unless you have a good mirror</li>
            <li>so i wanted to get something that has a good battery life and options..</li>
            <li>I asked a friend to see if he thought it was a good idea</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good but for anything else you have to make like 20 passes over and arm to do anything noticeable...</li>
            <li>Good shaving device.</li>
            <li>It did do a good job on my lower region which was a bonus.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is excellent, and the shaver is smooth and painless everywhere you use it.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s all good</li>
            <li>and I think my body deserves a good treatment every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the electric trimmer: it&#x27;s painless!  </li>
            <li>It is much better priced on Amazon than in the stores!</li>
            <li>Ideal for those quick shaves when in a rush.</li>
            <li>All of the things it can perform produce amazing results.  </li>
            <li>This shaver also features a rechargeable battery, which is a nice touch, although one replicated by some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works nice w/o knicks or tugging on:chest,legs,arms,back,booty,and \\&quot;speshall</li>
            <li>When I got this product I honestly thought it would work rather well as a combination.</li>
            <li>This product was nice while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>have found this to be very easy to use, very effective and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This is an easy to use groomer that produces good results.</li>
            <li>one thing I will note is that the Cruzer 5 feels fairly flimsy in its design if not downright cheap.  </li>
            <li>the device, fits well in the hand for a good grip to make those precise movements.</li>
            <li>Braun did a great job of making the razor easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, my husband has a very light beard, but he still said it didn&#x27;t work even for him.</li>
            <li>by turning the shaver over, you have access to the very smooth razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am giving it three stars, since I only plan to use \\&quot;half\\&quot; of the item, but - I think that part of it IS excellent.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it takes more trial and error but for he likes using two</li>
            <li>And getting a separate razor blade stick gives you more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it in the shower or out.  </li>
            <li>This item is ok</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great</li>
            <li>I did and it worked ok</li>
            <li>and it takes more work having to use shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>sure how this question comes up</li>
            <li>and I look 100% better.</li>
            <li>probably isn&#x27;t the product for you if you have the chest hair of Burt Reynolds and your looking to go with a more en vogue look.  </li>
            <li>Great, it was gift for a very grizzley buddy.</li>
            <li>I used a razor before, but now that I got this body shaver I love it.</li>
            <li>Every day, more women (and men, as well...) like a man that knows how to manscape.</li>
            <li>Love this thing</li>
            <li>Gladly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Its an ok appliance but the Norelco body groomer has so much more to offer and is more powerful!!</li>
            <li>Upon opening the packaging, I felt a strong, quality built product that looked sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li>the most part, it does work and its easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but I wish that it had more flexibility with regards to the length of cuts available for hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver because I can use it in the shower and it delivers a close and smooth shave and trim.</li>
            <li>My wife and I are very pleased with how easy it is to keep my shoulders and back looking good with the Braun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the product under the shower is effective - with the right shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to hold in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>over\\&quot; fairly easily and well.</li>
            <li>(is that a word?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the Braun Cruzer does get a thumbs up for its easy use and does what it was made for,</li>
            <li>I would also like to say that manscaping is a HEALTHY habit, since it keeps areas cleaner and easier to clean, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, charge and store.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think I would love this kind of product, but I am a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Braun makes good shavers but mainly for the face.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really quite useful and a nice thing to have in the bathroom for use when needed!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really quite useful and a nice thing to have in the bathroom for use when needed!  </li>
            <li>Everything just worked fine.</li>
            <li>and You can use this thing in the shower, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Lest you think I&#x27;m being paid by Braun, I&#x27;d like to say here that as a rule, I despise electric razors and have never had one which I felt justified the expense --</li>
            <li>I use it on the back of my neck and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to say that it is cheap, just that it feels cheap</li>
            <li>Electric shavers is easy and convenient (no shaving cream and lets you rid of hair in any direction), but doesn&#x27;t give you as clean of a shave.</li>
            <li>It is solidly built and works great.</li>
            <li>I prefer not to smooth shave but use the clipper predominantly as my tool of choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will be important depending on where on your body you&#x27;ve shaved - again because the hair textures are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my smooth, hairless beer belly.</li>
            <li>The charge life is fantastic, I use this in the shower, to shave body hair.</li>
            <li>, if you are a guy with a hairy chest or have a hairy man-bush or one who just wants to keep things looking clean and not hairy, the Braun Cruzer is definitely for you!ade for, quite perfectly.      </li>
            <li>Use a good shaving gel (try to avoid cream just because it&#x27;s less useful in the show) and you should have good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It so easy to use and so quick.</li>
            <li>This is by far best personal trimmer I have seen..</li>
            <li>Its construction is solid and I liked being able to hop into the shower with it.  </li>
            <li>I love my new Braun Cruzer 5 Body Shaver which is easy to use and versatile even the shower.  </li>
            <li>It is waterproof, so that&#x27;s cool too.  </li>
            <li>If you have a need for shaving other parts of your body than what I&#x27;ve mentioned here, this will probably be a great tool for you (you sly dog).</li>
            <li>this one is adequate, inexpensive, and brand-named.</li>
            <li>that is, until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Brauns are not cheap, I feel that in this product they have created something lightweight, versatile and easy to use, which will come in great handy to furry people and to athletes of such sports as swimming, cycling, wrestling and MMA, where looking like Larry from \\&quot;Three&#x27;s Company\\</li>
            <li>have also noticed that it&#x27;s not so good with long hair.  </li>
            <li>If you are only going to trim be sure to remove the razor, which is a quick and easy removal.  </li>
            <li>For the basics, it&#x27;s as good or better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, so I couldn&#x27;t make a good argument for giving it less than four stars (half star subtractions for not powering the razor and for being targeted at body parts I don&#x27;t trim or shave).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>the plus side, the trimmer worked fairly well, and the unit as a whole feels solid and good in the hand, not cheap and easily breakable like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The attachments for this device make it very flexible and safe, even allowing for a little experimentation with different lengths to see what suits you best.</li>
            <li>&quot; Welcome to early middle age.</li>
            <li>It uses a combination of a vibrating coarse level trimmer, along with a nice set of quality Gilette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>Not so great on the face but sensitive enough for the rest of yhe body</li>
            <li>Its small size makes it easy to handle, and I like the charging device that doesn&#x27;t have any metal connectors or openings, allowing the trimmer to be used in the shower (possibly its best feature).</li>
            <li>but like one who wants to make their trees look right by pruning and their bushes on their yard to look even, I do believe that manscaping is important in keeping the peace and also enhancing the err...</li>
            <li>when I put this in my hands I immediately felt handcuffed and it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to use it for</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be for shaving and trimming below the neck, and let me say right out, I don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>Finally, it is cordless, which is a great convenience, and the charging stand is small and stores the razor upright for maximum storage efficiency, which makes it easy to tuck away on a shelf in your bathroom, and also easy to set up in hotels or when you are traveling.</li>
            <li>(In fact, I took the blades off and put them in my battery powered Fusion razor; worked great as usual.)</li>
            <li>My husband tried out this shaver and likes it very much.</li>
            <li>I will not be using it very much.</li>
            <li>I rather see him groom the extra hair safely.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m not evolved enough :-)</li>
            <li>the gentle nature of the product is useful.</li>
            <li>I first saw the \\&quot;Braun Cruzer Body\\&quot;, the package made me think....</li>
            <li>Maybe $29-$39 for the device but for $49 or higher</li>
            <li>Maybe $29-$39 for the device but for $49 or higher</li>
            <li>Although the box was labeled new, nothing pointed to this being true.</li>
            <li>this product will do both at the same time just make sure you don&#x27;t move too fast across your face or it can pull and</li>
            <li>Everywhere else I pretty much just neaten</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works pretty much as described, trimming hair \\&quot;all</li>
            <li>I still think that the razor haphazardly slapped on the top is a major design mistake, but the trimmer is very good</li>
            <li>the setting and you can trim and shave at the same time - this is very useful for those days when you realize you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while and don&#x27;t want to go through a two-step process of first trimming then shaving...</li>
            <li>Good quality but the medium attachment is incredibly short and the large attachment is very long.  </li>
            <li>Works really well for that purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is those blades that make all the difference in the ability of this shaver to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>given that caveat, it&#x27;s a very find body shaver.</li>
            <li>The whole point of an electric trimmer is to get out of the \\&quot;razor and blades business model\\&quot; look up \\&quot;freebie marketing\\&quot; on wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really want to be using blades...</li>
            <li>and he couldn&#x27;t even figure out how you&#x27;d hold and angle it in order to use the \\&quot;combi mode to trim and shave in one stroke for fast and convenient results.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It has an integrated safety razor for getting really close to your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the straight razor doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li>I really just use it as my razor for legs.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s part of modern civilization where in conversation, with guy friends and even girlfriends, the question does come up,</li>
            <li>my life has become much easier</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to that option.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a luxury, but as someone who likes the old school, deeper, cleaner, and smoother shave, I could just switch back and forth between the trimmer and shaving blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want better control to trim near your nether-region, you have various settings for extending the blade.  </li>
            <li>The battery died pretty quickly whenever I used it for trimming tasks (such as sideburns).  </li>
            <li>So, if you are a guy with a hairy chest or have a hairy man-bush or one who just wants to keep things looking clean and not hairy, the Braun Cruzer is definitely for you!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though the price is still a little steep, the Braun Body Cruzor successfully provides one with the capability to choose from either shaving blade, trimmer (comes with three sizes of combs), or both at the same time, while also usuable in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it gets a 3 only because I don&#x27;t find it all that unique.</li>
            <li>used many other braun devices over the years and none just &#x27;died&#x27;.</li>
            <li>this body shaver work better that other one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>You can use it without any combs for long hair, and the 3 combs are for progressively shorter or more sensitive hair.  </li>
            <li>would have liked it a lot if not for the fact that it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It is unique in the way that it has a normal razor shaver attached next to the clippers so you get the power of both types of shaves.</li>
            <li>My husband liked that this product has small trimming teeth which reduces the chance of skin getting clipped with hair.  </li>
            <li>If they&#x27;d just included a longer handle (possibly as a detachable option), I&#x27;d give this the full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun&#x27;s new Cruzer Body Shaver</li>
            <li>Many guys are used to using blades or scissors but for $49.99 or higher, that&#x27;s a hard price to really bite on.  </li>
            <li>Many guys are used to using blades or scissors but for $49.99 or higher, that&#x27;s a hard price to really bite on.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!s thing dies.  </li>
            <li>And so far, it has not blunted with age and use like most of the clippers I have owned, including other types of Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a little bit more money on something that is not junk.</li>
            <li>and I found it extremely convenient and easy to use, but at times it seemed somewhat under-powered.  </li>
            <li>It makes me laugh because it&#x27;s similar to those bush extending cutters that you may use for your lawn.  </li>
            <li>If your going to be doing a lot of heavy trimming often, then step up to a more robust product.</li>
            <li>My husband is always on the hunt for a product that will give him a good shave/trim without irritating his skin.</li>
            <li>it might sound odd, but if you&#x27;re a modern guy, you know</li>
            <li>this one is adequate, inexpensive, and brand-named.ust one minor feature.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been using this Braun body groomer for about two weeks, using it two or three times a week, mainly for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fact, I&#x27;d be willing to give this shaver 5 stars except for one thing: The handle is fairly short.</li>
            <li>You started smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and halfway down the road, you end up looking like sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>other thing I am not too thrilled about is the expensive cartridge replacements that seem to cost more than the device itself.  </li>
            <li>There are some several grips on the sides to give a little more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, it has not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;But what really sets this shaver apart is how well it actually shaves.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very picky about razors that do trimming and shaving either at the same time (as this product) or in combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Braun electric razor has been very dependable but it&#x27;s meant to shave the short stubble of a days beard growth,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>He loves it and has no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>i have got so far</li>
            <li>Braun products are always reliable and always deliver as far as my experiences go.</li>
            <li>recommend this completely to all men that would like a change in their appearance.</li>
            <li>This body cruzer has two main parts, the sensitive body shaving part and the multi-edge facial shaving part (fusion shaver).  </li>
            <li>First off, the reason I use these body shavers is to do the occasional back shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the blades seem to cut very well and its not a very loud cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much so that it irritates your skin having to drag this thing back and forth so much.  </li>
            <li>but keep in mind that the hair texture of certain body zones is different than the face, so your mileage may vary depending upon your personal hair</li>
            <li>Another big improvement is the ergonomic design of the shaver itself; it easily moves across the diverse contours of my... areas of interest when I shave without any missed spots or shady areas.  </li>
            <li>But to shave the back of your body you really need a long, extended handle.</li>
            <li>That said, it didn&#x27;t work as well in the shower as other cordless groomers I&#x27;ve used, and the whole \\&quot;razor and trimmer in one!\\</li>
            <li>A disposable razor, what I normally use for facial hair, is not ideal for those fine hairs that crop up in places like on the ears.  </li>
            <li>This is for those who have a hairy chest and the other was hmm... for those who like to keep things clean down there...</li>
            <li>I know people use these for other, more delicate areas.</li>
            <li>personally don&#x27;t like a completely bare look, and with the different, adjustable lengths this body shaver helped me achieve the look I wanted in every part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This makes it easier to perforn fine shaving in the shower and leave behind nothing but skin.</li>
            <li>in all, the Cruzer 5 is hard to justify given the cost of upkeep but is worth if it budget isn&#x27;t an issue.  </li>

            <li> &quot; just doesn&#x27;t fly.</li>
            <li> It also looks great, sitting in the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> It feels great in hand and the shaving part of the body groomer is well designed.</li>
            <li> This is a great device although I use it to shave my bald head.  </li>
            <li> It works great for his sideburns and mustache.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The blades without the peripherals are great if you want a close shave.</li>
            <li> It works great for me.</li>
            <li> It is great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The replaceable blade is a great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I thought separately they worked great.</li>
            <li> Great product, would recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> great product for the price</li>
            <li> I never used this product but the person that did said it was great</li>
            <li> Braun Cruzer 5 is a very effective answer to this problem.</li>
            <li> I use this device to shave all my chest hair, but what I like best about this product is that I am able to adjust it</li>
            <li> this is the best love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did a good</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not so good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painless and it cuts surprisingly close for an electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; this does a good job.</li>
            <li> the electric trimmer was of good quality I could have forgiven the product.</li>
            <li> Also, shaving in the shower just isn&#x27;t as practical unless you have a good mirror</li>
            <li> so i wanted to get something that has a good battery life and options..</li>
            <li> I asked a friend to see if he thought it was a good idea</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good but for anything else you have to make like 20 passes over and arm to do anything noticeable...</li>
            <li> Good shaving device.</li>
            <li> It did do a good job on my lower region which was a bonus.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is excellent, and the shaver is smooth and painless everywhere you use it.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s all good</li>
            <li> and I think my body deserves a good treatment every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the electric trimmer: it&#x27;s painless!  </li>
            <li> It is much better priced on Amazon than in the stores!</li>
            <li> Ideal for those quick shaves when in a rush.</li>
            <li> All of the things it can perform produce amazing results.  </li>
            <li> This shaver also features a rechargeable battery, which is a nice touch, although one replicated by some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works nice w/o knicks or tugging on:chest,legs,arms,back,booty,and \\&quot;speshall</li>
            <li> When I got this product I honestly thought it would work rather well as a combination.</li>
            <li> This product was nice while it lasted.  </li>
            <li> have found this to be very easy to use, very effective and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This is an easy to use groomer that produces good results.</li>
            <li> one thing I will note is that the Cruzer 5 feels fairly flimsy in its design if not downright cheap.  </li>
            <li> the device, fits well in the hand for a good grip to make those precise movements.</li>
            <li> Braun did a great job of making the razor easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my husband has a very light beard, but he still said it didn&#x27;t work even for him.</li>
            <li> by turning the shaver over, you have access to the very smooth razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am giving it three stars, since I only plan to use \\&quot;half\\&quot; of the item, but - I think that part of it IS excellent.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it takes more trial and error but for he likes using two</li>
            <li> And getting a separate razor blade stick gives you more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it in the shower or out.  </li>
            <li> This item is ok</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great</li>
            <li> I did and it worked ok</li>
            <li> and it takes more work having to use shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> sure how this question comes up</li>
            <li> and I look 100% better.</li>
            <li> probably isn&#x27;t the product for you if you have the chest hair of Burt Reynolds and your looking to go with a more en vogue look.  </li>
            <li> Great, it was gift for a very grizzley buddy.</li>
            <li> I used a razor before, but now that I got this body shaver I love it.</li>
            <li> Every day, more women (and men, as well...) like a man that knows how to manscape.</li>
            <li> Love this thing</li>
            <li> Gladly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its an ok appliance but the Norelco body groomer has so much more to offer and is more powerful!!</li>
            <li> Upon opening the packaging, I felt a strong, quality built product that looked sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li> the most part, it does work and its easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but I wish that it had more flexibility with regards to the length of cuts available for hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver because I can use it in the shower and it delivers a close and smooth shave and trim.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are very pleased with how easy it is to keep my shoulders and back looking good with the Braun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the product under the shower is effective - with the right shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to hold in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> over\\&quot; fairly easily and well.</li>
            <li> (is that a word?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the Braun Cruzer does get a thumbs up for its easy use and does what it was made for,</li>
            <li> I would also like to say that manscaping is a HEALTHY habit, since it keeps areas cleaner and easier to clean, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, charge and store.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I would love this kind of product, but I am a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun makes good shavers but mainly for the face.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really quite useful and a nice thing to have in the bathroom for use when needed!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really quite useful and a nice thing to have in the bathroom for use when needed!  </li>
            <li> Everything just worked fine.</li>
            <li> and You can use this thing in the shower, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Lest you think I&#x27;m being paid by Braun, I&#x27;d like to say here that as a rule, I despise electric razors and have never had one which I felt justified the expense --</li>
            <li> I use it on the back of my neck and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to say that it is cheap, just that it feels cheap</li>
            <li> Electric shavers is easy and convenient (no shaving cream and lets you rid of hair in any direction), but doesn&#x27;t give you as clean of a shave.</li>
            <li> It is solidly built and works great.</li>
            <li> I prefer not to smooth shave but use the clipper predominantly as my tool of choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will be important depending on where on your body you&#x27;ve shaved - again because the hair textures are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my smooth, hairless beer belly.</li>
            <li> The charge life is fantastic, I use this in the shower, to shave body hair.</li>
            <li> , if you are a guy with a hairy chest or have a hairy man-bush or one who just wants to keep things looking clean and not hairy, the Braun Cruzer is definitely for you!ade for, quite perfectly.      </li>
            <li> Use a good shaving gel (try to avoid cream just because it&#x27;s less useful in the show) and you should have good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It so easy to use and so quick.</li>
            <li> This is by far best personal trimmer I have seen..</li>
            <li> Its construction is solid and I liked being able to hop into the shower with it.  </li>
            <li> I love my new Braun Cruzer 5 Body Shaver which is easy to use and versatile even the shower.  </li>
            <li> It is waterproof, so that&#x27;s cool too.  </li>
            <li> If you have a need for shaving other parts of your body than what I&#x27;ve mentioned here, this will probably be a great tool for you (you sly dog).</li>
            <li> this one is adequate, inexpensive, and brand-named.</li>
            <li> that is, until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Brauns are not cheap, I feel that in this product they have created something lightweight, versatile and easy to use, which will come in great handy to furry people and to athletes of such sports as swimming, cycling, wrestling and MMA, where looking like Larry from \\&quot;Three&#x27;s Company\\</li>
            <li> have also noticed that it&#x27;s not so good with long hair.  </li>
            <li> If you are only going to trim be sure to remove the razor, which is a quick and easy removal.  </li>
            <li> For the basics, it&#x27;s as good or better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, so I couldn&#x27;t make a good argument for giving it less than four stars (half star subtractions for not powering the razor and for being targeted at body parts I don&#x27;t trim or shave).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> the plus side, the trimmer worked fairly well, and the unit as a whole feels solid and good in the hand, not cheap and easily breakable like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The attachments for this device make it very flexible and safe, even allowing for a little experimentation with different lengths to see what suits you best.</li>
            <li> &quot; Welcome to early middle age.</li>
            <li> It uses a combination of a vibrating coarse level trimmer, along with a nice set of quality Gilette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> Not so great on the face but sensitive enough for the rest of yhe body</li>
            <li> Its small size makes it easy to handle, and I like the charging device that doesn&#x27;t have any metal connectors or openings, allowing the trimmer to be used in the shower (possibly its best feature).</li>
            <li> but like one who wants to make their trees look right by pruning and their bushes on their yard to look even, I do believe that manscaping is important in keeping the peace and also enhancing the err...</li>
            <li> when I put this in my hands I immediately felt handcuffed and it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to use it for</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be for shaving and trimming below the neck, and let me say right out, I don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Finally, it is cordless, which is a great convenience, and the charging stand is small and stores the razor upright for maximum storage efficiency, which makes it easy to tuck away on a shelf in your bathroom, and also easy to set up in hotels or when you are traveling.</li>
            <li> (In fact, I took the blades off and put them in my battery powered Fusion razor; worked great as usual.)</li>
            <li> My husband tried out this shaver and likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I will not be using it very much.</li>
            <li> I rather see him groom the extra hair safely.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m not evolved enough :-)</li>
            <li> the gentle nature of the product is useful.</li>
            <li> I first saw the \\&quot;Braun Cruzer Body\\&quot;, the package made me think....</li>
            <li> Maybe $29-$39 for the device but for $49 or higher</li>
            <li> Maybe $29-$39 for the device but for $49 or higher</li>
            <li> Although the box was labeled new, nothing pointed to this being true.</li>
            <li> this product will do both at the same time just make sure you don&#x27;t move too fast across your face or it can pull and</li>
            <li> Everywhere else I pretty much just neaten</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works pretty much as described, trimming hair \\&quot;all</li>
            <li> I still think that the razor haphazardly slapped on the top is a major design mistake, but the trimmer is very good</li>
            <li> the setting and you can trim and shave at the same time - this is very useful for those days when you realize you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while and don&#x27;t want to go through a two-step process of first trimming then shaving...</li>
            <li> Good quality but the medium attachment is incredibly short and the large attachment is very long.  </li>
            <li> Works really well for that purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is those blades that make all the difference in the ability of this shaver to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> given that caveat, it&#x27;s a very find body shaver.</li>
            <li> The whole point of an electric trimmer is to get out of the \\&quot;razor and blades business model\\&quot; look up \\&quot;freebie marketing\\&quot; on wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really want to be using blades...</li>
            <li> and he couldn&#x27;t even figure out how you&#x27;d hold and angle it in order to use the \\&quot;combi mode to trim and shave in one stroke for fast and convenient results.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> It has an integrated safety razor for getting really close to your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the straight razor doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> I really just use it as my razor for legs.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s part of modern civilization where in conversation, with guy friends and even girlfriends, the question does come up,</li>
            <li> my life has become much easier</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to that option.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a luxury, but as someone who likes the old school, deeper, cleaner, and smoother shave, I could just switch back and forth between the trimmer and shaving blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want better control to trim near your nether-region, you have various settings for extending the blade.  </li>
            <li> The battery died pretty quickly whenever I used it for trimming tasks (such as sideburns).  </li>
            <li> So, if you are a guy with a hairy chest or have a hairy man-bush or one who just wants to keep things looking clean and not hairy, the Braun Cruzer is definitely for you!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though the price is still a little steep, the Braun Body Cruzor successfully provides one with the capability to choose from either shaving blade, trimmer (comes with three sizes of combs), or both at the same time, while also usuable in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it gets a 3 only because I don&#x27;t find it all that unique.</li>
            <li> used many other braun devices over the years and none just &#x27;died&#x27;.</li>
            <li> this body shaver work better that other one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> You can use it without any combs for long hair, and the 3 combs are for progressively shorter or more sensitive hair.  </li>
            <li> would have liked it a lot if not for the fact that it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It is unique in the way that it has a normal razor shaver attached next to the clippers so you get the power of both types of shaves.</li>
            <li> My husband liked that this product has small trimming teeth which reduces the chance of skin getting clipped with hair.  </li>
            <li> If they&#x27;d just included a longer handle (possibly as a detachable option), I&#x27;d give this the full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun&#x27;s new Cruzer Body Shaver</li>
            <li> Many guys are used to using blades or scissors but for $49.99 or higher, that&#x27;s a hard price to really bite on.  </li>
            <li> Many guys are used to using blades or scissors but for $49.99 or higher, that&#x27;s a hard price to really bite on.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!s thing dies.  </li>
            <li> And so far, it has not blunted with age and use like most of the clippers I have owned, including other types of Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a little bit more money on something that is not junk.</li>
            <li> and I found it extremely convenient and easy to use, but at times it seemed somewhat under-powered.  </li>
            <li> It makes me laugh because it&#x27;s similar to those bush extending cutters that you may use for your lawn.  </li>
            <li> If your going to be doing a lot of heavy trimming often, then step up to a more robust product.</li>
            <li> My husband is always on the hunt for a product that will give him a good shave/trim without irritating his skin.</li>
            <li> it might sound odd, but if you&#x27;re a modern guy, you know</li>
            <li> this one is adequate, inexpensive, and brand-named.ust one minor feature.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been using this Braun body groomer for about two weeks, using it two or three times a week, mainly for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fact, I&#x27;d be willing to give this shaver 5 stars except for one thing: The handle is fairly short.</li>
            <li> You started smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and halfway down the road, you end up looking like sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other thing I am not too thrilled about is the expensive cartridge replacements that seem to cost more than the device itself.  </li>
            <li> There are some several grips on the sides to give a little more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, it has not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;But what really sets this shaver apart is how well it actually shaves.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very picky about razors that do trimming and shaving either at the same time (as this product) or in combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun electric razor has been very dependable but it&#x27;s meant to shave the short stubble of a days beard growth,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> He loves it and has no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> i have got so far</li>
            <li> Braun products are always reliable and always deliver as far as my experiences go.</li>
            <li> recommend this completely to all men that would like a change in their appearance.</li>
            <li> This body cruzer has two main parts, the sensitive body shaving part and the multi-edge facial shaving part (fusion shaver).  </li>
            <li> First off, the reason I use these body shavers is to do the occasional back shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the blades seem to cut very well and its not a very loud cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much so that it irritates your skin having to drag this thing back and forth so much.  </li>
            <li> but keep in mind that the hair texture of certain body zones is different than the face, so your mileage may vary depending upon your personal hair</li>
            <li> Another big improvement is the ergonomic design of the shaver itself; it easily moves across the diverse contours of my... areas of interest when I shave without any missed spots or shady areas.  </li>
            <li> But to shave the back of your body you really need a long, extended handle.</li>
            <li> That said, it didn&#x27;t work as well in the shower as other cordless groomers I&#x27;ve used, and the whole \\&quot;razor and trimmer in one!\\</li>
            <li> A disposable razor, what I normally use for facial hair, is not ideal for those fine hairs that crop up in places like on the ears.  </li>
            <li> This is for those who have a hairy chest and the other was hmm... for those who like to keep things clean down there...</li>
            <li> I know people use these for other, more delicate areas.</li>
            <li> personally don&#x27;t like a completely bare look, and with the different, adjustable lengths this body shaver helped me achieve the look I wanted in every part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This makes it easier to perforn fine shaving in the shower and leave behind nothing but skin.</li>
            <li> in all, the Cruzer 5 is hard to justify given the cost of upkeep but is worth if it budget isn&#x27;t an issue.  </li>
            <li> packaging and marketing is a bit odd too; sexy almost-naked guy on the front of the box, but odd little cartoon inside, to demonstrate areas where you could use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a long time Braun customer (from toasters to electric razors to tea kettles) makes me sad to see such an innovative company be reduced by Proctor and Gamble to making junk.</li>
            <li> I have a big hair trimmer that has a bunch of attachments and it trims long hair in a snap.  </li>
            <li> Yes it can trim and shave at the same time, but that&#x27;s just one minor feature.</li>
            <li> still haven&#x27;t bought the Gillete replacements, but they are indeed a little bit on the expensive side, but again, these are more thick and durable blades made specially for body shaving.</li>
            <li> A much cheaper Remington (and I hate myself for saying this) is much better.</li>
            <li> I used the body shaver for a limited time, until it simply stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is really mean for real close work of short hair.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised, however, that although it uses \\&quot;Gillette Fusion technology\\&quot;, they didn&#x27;t bother to electrify the razor to get the closer, easier cut that the vibrating razor gives.</li>
            <li> I was turned off by Gillette a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I only drag it out once this thing dies.  </li>
            <li> It also travels well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> The electric razor can&#x27;t shave wet skin so you are just using the regular razor instead.  </li>
            <li> This shaver shaves my back hair way closer--and with fewer passes--than any of the other body shavers</li>
            <li> dry clippering</li>
            <li> The only downfall I&#x27;ve noticed is that because the teeth are so tiny, it gets clogged up after a few passes.  </li>
            <li> both options was that I had to dismantle the razor in order to trim (if I didn&#x27;t want to shave at the same time) because the razor kept catching on my skin when I was focused on the trimmer and was annoying.  </li>
            <li> It takes a TON of passes to finally trim down any long hair.  </li>
            <li> It can be used wet or dry and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the combo when you can just buy a normal razor for less money.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about its effectiveness, after a week or two of demoing it I will admit that it performed somewhat better than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> accessories were loose and rattling around throughout the box.  </li>
            <li> should mention that the razor can slide up and down on the trimmer in order to allow for different angles at which you want to use it.  </li>
            <li> The big down side to me is that for the razor part I get no benefit.</li>
            <li> The extra hair just washes down the sink.</li>
            <li> 1 dropped in toilet, one dropped on floor, other fell off a shelf.</li>
            <li> It makes it very hard to continue utilizing the Cruzer 5 when it costs as much as it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You dont go up, down, left and right, however, with a trimmer I am guilty of this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took care of ear hair and my eyebrows, and I trimmed above and around the ears when I was a little shaggy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bad electric trimmer attached to a manual razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;One is better off get 2 separate products.</li>
            <li> No worries using it on wet skin or rinsing it off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are only a few places on my body where I trim my hair - even my face doesn&#x27;t get a razor against it because I wind up bleeding everywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the product for me is a challenge when wet.</li>
            <li> also is designed to work while wet.</li>
            <li> We received two of the same trimmer attachments and were still missing one.</li>
            <li> I have actually not used it on my nether regions, instead using it to shape my beard and tame some of my unruly body hair, tasks which it performs admirably.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s really no reason for an all-in-one razor and trimmer; it makes it feel awkward and doesn&#x27;t let you get the job done unless you&#x27;re brave (and/or crazy).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, that being said I also dont shave much other than my face.  </li>
            <li> this device does, it does for those that DO shave other areas.  </li>
            <li> Also, you can use the razor and trimmer separate from each other if you wish.</li>
            <li> I use this for other parts that I want a close trim.</li>
            <li> this works just as well as any other clipper I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> other areas of the body</li>
            <li> Frankly, if you need a picture showing where your chest, torso and \\&quot;bits\\&quot; are, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be using sharp object.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the other shaving options.  </li>
            <li> When used properly the trim shave function is a slick idea and worked well.  </li>
            <li> When dry I can use a clipper brush to get all the little hairs out</li>
            <li> In fact, I actually avoided certain areas because I was worried about cutting while trimming, or snagging while shaving...  </li>
            <li> My husband has used it very minimally, probably less than 15 times, and the motor doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> anywhere - I use this several times a week at LEAST.  </li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s still looking for something that is less irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used the \\&quot;long\\&quot; attachement to trim down some hair</li>
            <li> down there...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;do you shave down</li>
            <li> Granted, if you are a hairy beast, you may want to use a scissor and cut/trim it down before using the Braun Cruzer.  </li>
            <li> In the summer time I need to tone down the hair that grows like kudzu all around my body.</li>
            <li> What I mean is, with a razor you go in short strokes in one direction.  </li>
            <li> With the Cruzer 5 as in previous models they did not put an option in to use the razor in power mode.</li>
            <li> Overall, this package looked as though it was carelessly pieced together, thrown into a box, &amp; shipped without giving it a second look.</li>
            <li> recharger base and the lack of external contacts are a huge selling point (the base is small and easy to keep out of the way and there aren&#x27;t any contacts to corrode or gunk up).  </li>
            <li> When a prouct tries to do two things at once it usually ends up doing both poorly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun Cruzer is water-resistant so I can take it into the shower with me and not have to worry about making a mess in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> so a little hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost frustrating enough to make bikini wax seem tempting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that this product is so expensive when it&#x27;s really just a glorified Gillette fusion razor.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for a maintenance tool for someone that is looking for a shaver for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> electric trimmer and plain razor in one.</li>
            <li> ultimate disappointment is when it stopped working -- now I&#x27;m left with a crapy expensive big razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t want to leave a bad review on it because it does exactly what it says its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have used a few body shavers in the past: no name, Philips, and Panasonic.</li>
            <li> And also, the large has a hard time cutting anyway.  </li>
            <li> It neatly and efficiently trims body hair of all consistencies and thicknesses with very little effort, leaving you as sleek as you wish to be.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of having the hybrid combination of the Gilette Fusion Proglide blades and the small teeth trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is small and ergonomically designed.</li>
            <li> Basically annoyed I spent 5x the $ for a product I already had at home.</li>
            <li> We both agreed that rather than fast and convenient, this \\&quot;development\\&quot; was just stupid and impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, for me it feels a bit awkward having a standard shaving razor on one side and a electric trimmer on the other.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> (The fact that they don&#x27;t have a no-animal testing policy in this day and age is ridiculous to me.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> The small teeth trimmer isn&#x27;t very tough on the skin.</li>
            <li> Some have poor battery life, inadequate shaver performance, or are not quite as shower-proof as they claim.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any cutting or anything out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be inconvenient at the least.</li>
            <li> trimmer itself works well as a shaver, but quite useless with the guards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I minused one star because he says the instructions are difficult to understand.</li>
            <li> or maybe I hang out with weird people that are upfront about their hygiene</li>
            <li> Once I got this crazy looking device out of its packaging, I was frankly too scared to use it for a while.</li>
            <li> None of those was a wet/dry shaver, so all had to be used either standing awkwardly in the tub with no water, or else in front of the mirror with hair dropping all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost impossible to get nicked.</li>
            <li> I get bad ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> refuse to use the blade on this thing, because I had a bad experience with the Gillette vibrating face razor thing.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> so I keep the charging base in the cabinet.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t care for this thing.  However, I don&#x27;t want to leave a bad review on it because it does exactly what it says its supposed to do. And it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for me it feels a bit awkward having a standard shaving razor on one side and a electric trimmer on the other.&lt;br /&gt;With a trimmer I have always moved in different ways than I do with my razor.  What I mean is, with a razor you go in short strokes in one direction.  You dont go up, down, left and right, however, with a trimmer I am guilty of this.&lt;br /&gt;So when I put this in my hands I immediately felt handcuffed and it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to use it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that being said I also dont shave much other than my face.  Everywhere else I pretty much just neaten up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this device does, it does for those that DO shave other areas.  The trimmer itself gets rid of the bulk of the hair while the razor comes in and finishes it off.&lt;br /&gt;This makes it so you dont need to rinse the razor as often, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that the razor can slide up and down on the trimmer in order to allow for different angles at which you want to use it.  Also, you can use the razor and trimmer separate from each other if you wish.</li>
            <li> Do you remember the scene in CITY SLICKERS when Billy Crystal&#x27;s character says, \\&quot;I&#x27;m losing hair where I want hair and I&#x27;m growing hair where I had no hair before!\\&quot; Welcome to early middle age. You started smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and halfway down the road, you end up looking like sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Cruzer 5 is a very effective answer to this problem. It neatly and efficiently trims body hair of all consistencies and thicknesses with very little effort, leaving you as sleek as you wish to be. And so far, it has not blunted with age and use like most of the clippers I have owned, including other types of Brauns.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, it packs a slide-out blade razor for those like myself, who don&#x27;t trust their facial stubble to an electric razor (sadly, there is not an electric razor in creation that can cut my beard). Finally, it is cordless, which is a great convenience, and the charging stand is small and stores the razor upright for maximum storage efficiency, which makes it easy to tuck away on a shelf in your bathroom, and also easy to set up in hotels or when you are traveling. Lest you think I&#x27;m being paid by Braun, I&#x27;d like to say here that as a rule, I despise electric razors and have never had one which I felt justified the expense -- that is, until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Brauns are not cheap, I feel that in this product they have created something lightweight, versatile and easy to use, which will come in great handy to furry people and to athletes of such sports as swimming, cycling, wrestling and MMA, where looking like Larry from \\&quot;Three&#x27;s Company\\&quot; just doesn&#x27;t fly.</li>
            <li> Once I got this crazy looking device out of its packaging, I was frankly too scared to use it for a while. But it works quite well. I have actually not used it on my nether regions, instead using it to shape my beard and tame some of my unruly body hair, tasks which it performs admirably. I still think that the razor haphazardly slapped on the top is a major design mistake, but the trimmer is very good indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I get bad ingrown hairs.  What can I say?  So I&#x27;m not about to use the blade/razor part of this unit, unless it&#x27;s my face.  And even then, for my face, I use the Schick Hydro. I was turned off by Gillette a long time ago.  But I digress.  Let&#x27;s talk about this thing!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a neat idea: electric trimmer and plain razor in one. My favorite part is the electric trimmer: it&#x27;s painless!  I use it on the back of my neck and it works great.  No pain, no cord to get in the way. The only downfall I&#x27;ve noticed is that because the teeth are so tiny, it gets clogged up after a few passes.  You have to continually wipe/rinse it out.  It is waterproof, so that&#x27;s cool too.  No worries using it on wet skin or rinsing it off.&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to use the blade on this thing, because I had a bad experience with the Gillette vibrating face razor thing.  I don&#x27;t think it did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that it&#x27;s not so good with long hair.  I used the \\&quot;long\\&quot; attachement to trim down some hair and it&#x27;s not so good.  It takes a TON of passes to finally trim down any long hair.  So much so that it irritates your skin having to drag this thing back and forth so much.  The tiny teeth just aren&#x27;t meant to be used for that.  I have a big hair trimmer that has a bunch of attachments and it trims long hair in a snap.  This thing is really mean for real close work of short hair.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it three stars, since I only plan to use \\&quot;half\\&quot; of the item, but - I think that part of it IS excellent.  It&#x27;s painless and it cuts surprisingly close for an electric trimmer.  I use it all the time - errant hairs on head, hair on neck, etc.  Works really well for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bumping this up a star because I use it ALL the time!!!  Errant hairs on my neck or side of my head or sideburns or anywhere - I use this several times a week at LEAST.  And I don&#x27;t have to charge it often at all.  I don&#x27;t like clutter, so I keep the charging base in the cabinet.  I only drag it out once this thing dies.  But I have to tell you, it&#x27;s really quite useful and a nice thing to have in the bathroom for use when needed!  Highly recommended!!!s thing dies.  But I have to tell you, it&#x27;s really quite useful and a nice thing to have in the bathroom for use when needed!  Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used body trimmers before with mixed results.  Some have poor battery life, inadequate shaver performance, or are not quite as shower-proof as they claim.  It&#x27;s almost frustrating enough to make bikini wax seem tempting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had the opportunity to try out the Braun Cruzer 5 I was very skeptical about its effectiveness, after a week or two of demoing it I will admit that it performed somewhat better than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cruzer 5 is, indeed, shower proof.  It has yet to malfunction in the moist environment and still maintains its battery life so that&#x27;s a plus.  Another big improvement is the ergonomic design of the shaver itself; it easily moves across the diverse contours of my... areas of interest when I shave without any missed spots or shady areas.  This is especially helpful when it comes time to help the... uh... carpet to match the drapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I will note is that the Cruzer 5 feels fairly flimsy in its design if not downright cheap.  It&#x27;s not to say that it is cheap, just that it feels cheap and I&#x27;m just waiting for it to break.  So far, it has not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I am not too thrilled about is the expensive cartridge replacements that seem to cost more than the device itself.  It makes it very hard to continue utilizing the Cruzer 5 when it costs as much as it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Cruzer 5 is hard to justify given the cost of upkeep but is worth if it budget isn&#x27;t an issue.  It performs well, but my budget isn&#x27;t as infinite as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the packaging, I felt a strong, quality built product that looked sleek and stylish. It also looks great, sitting in the bathroom sink. So far, I&#x27;ve been using this Braun body groomer for about two weeks, using it two or three times a week, mainly for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It feels great in hand and the shaving part of the body groomer is well designed. There are some several grips on the sides to give a little more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The small teeth trimmer isn&#x27;t very tough on the skin. Trimmer my parts like the face, chest, and arms are painless. Well designed trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I like the convenience of having the hybrid combination of the Gilette Fusion Proglide blades and the small teeth trimmer.  Electric shavers is easy and convenient (no shaving cream and lets you rid of hair in any direction), but doesn&#x27;t give you as clean of a shave. Here, the Body Cruzor gives you a convenience to either have a deep shave (when you have time) or touch up on any parts of your body. It&#x27;s more of a luxury, but as someone who likes the old school, deeper, cleaner, and smoother shave, I could just switch back and forth between the trimmer and shaving blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the price is still a little steep, the Braun Body Cruzor successfully provides one with the capability to choose from either shaving blade, trimmer (comes with three sizes of combs), or both at the same time, while also usuable in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a great device although I use it to shave my bald head.  It has both an adjustable electronic shaving part as well as a traditional razor built in with replacement head options that lets you finish off the job with a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a rechargable docking station.  It is solidly built and works great.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; this does a good job. You do have to remove the razor head to use it as a trimmer. If you don&#x27;t, the razor head is always snagging hairs you don&#x27;t want trimmed closely. I have found that I just don&#x27;t use the razor head for the close shave. I simply use the razor I have always used. This didn&#x27;t work out to be the all in one device I had hoped it would be. When I use the razor, the device is just too bulky. It&#x27;s easier to just use any reusable or disposable razor. I use this for other parts that I want a close trim. If your looking for something to go \\&quot;hairless\\&quot; this probably isn&#x27;t the device for you.</li>
            <li> My husband liked that this product has small trimming teeth which reduces the chance of skin getting clipped with hair.  He prefers to use this tool instead of a set of clippers like he had been using. It&#x27;s also easy to hold in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you can use the shaver for a closer trim too.  He has a mixed opinion on the convenience of this.  Maybe it takes more trial and error but for he likes using two separate devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall he likes it and speaking from a female perspective...I rather see him groom the extra hair safely.</li>
            <li> First off, the reason I use these body shavers is to do the occasional back shave. I know people use these for other, more delicate areas. I guess I&#x27;m not evolved enough :-) But I think my experiences with the back, in terms of shaving efficacy, are transferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, about this body shaver. I have used a few body shavers in the past: no name, Philips, and Panasonic. None of those was a wet/dry shaver, so all had to be used either standing awkwardly in the tub with no water, or else in front of the mirror with hair dropping all over the bathroom. This shaver, by contrast, works in water. Score one for the Bruan shaver. This shaver also features a rechargeable battery, which is a nice touch, although one replicated by some of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what really sets this shaver apart is how well it actually shaves. It uses a combination of a vibrating coarse level trimmer, along with a nice set of quality Gilette Fusion blades. It is those blades that make all the difference in the ability of this shaver to get a really close shave. This shaver shaves my back hair way closer--and with fewer passes--than any of the other body shavers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I&#x27;d be willing to give this shaver 5 stars except for one thing: The handle is fairly short. That&#x27;s not an issue for shaving the front of your body. But to shave the back of your body you really need a long, extended handle. This shaver doesn&#x27;t offer that. So you can do contortions and get 90% of your back (with effort), but there&#x27;s gonna be 10% or whatever you simply can&#x27;t do by yourself. Too bad. If they&#x27;d just included a longer handle (possibly as a detachable option), I&#x27;d give this the full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But given that caveat, it&#x27;s a very find body shaver.</li>
            <li> I used the body shaver for a limited time, until it simply stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is cumbersome and awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself works well as a shaver, but quite useless with the guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate disappointment is when it stopped working -- now I&#x27;m left with a crapy expensive big razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bad electric trimmer attached to a manual razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;One is better off get 2 separate products. The whole point of an electric trimmer is to get out of the \\&quot;razor and blades business model\\&quot; look up \\&quot;freebie marketing\\&quot; on wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;If the electric trimmer was of good quality I could have forgiven the product. A much cheaper Remington (and I hate myself for saying this) is much better. And getting a separate razor blade stick gives you more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a long time Braun customer (from toasters to electric razors to tea kettles) makes me sad to see such an innovative company be reduced by Proctor and Gamble to making junk.</li>
            <li> My husband tried out this shaver and likes it very much. I minused one star because he says the instructions are difficult to understand. You need to go over them several times before you get what they&#x27;re trying to convey. The shaver, as stated, is not for facial hair. However, my husband has a very light beard, but he still said it didn&#x27;t work even for him. It works great for his sideburns and mustache. The shaver is lightweight and easy to handle. The fact that it works in the shower is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> This body cruzer has two main parts, the sensitive body shaving part and the multi-edge facial shaving part (fusion shaver).  You can detach the fusion element if you want.  I did that to get it out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body shaver (unit without the fusion attachment) comes with 3 trimming combs.  You can use it without any combs for long hair, and the 3 combs are for progressively shorter or more sensitive hair.  I used it for areas with miscellaneous hair like the edge of the ears and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this shaver works well for the areas in which I tested it.  A disposable razor, what I normally use for facial hair, is not ideal for those fine hairs that crop up in places like on the ears.  This body cruzer worked perfectly for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked it a lot if not for the fact that it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use groomer that produces good results. My wife and I are very pleased with how easy it is to keep my shoulders and back looking good with the Braun. It can be used wet or dry and the charge lasts a long time. The big down side to me is that for the razor part I get no benefit. That is because there is no option to use the razor as the Gillette power fusion razor. I have used some version of the Gillete power fusion for years. With the Cruzer 5 as in previous models they did not put an option in to use the razor in power mode. If they did, this would be the only hair grooming product I would need.</li>
            <li> There are only a few places on my body where I trim my hair - even my face doesn&#x27;t get a razor against it because I wind up bleeding everywhere. So I&#x27;m very picky about razors that do trimming and shaving either at the same time (as this product) or in combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product under the shower is effective - with the right shaving cream. With just water I found that it skids across my face and I get out to see stubble in various places. Also, shaving in the shower just isn&#x27;t as practical unless you have a good mirror so you can see everywhere you&#x27;re shaving. Use a good shaving gel (try to avoid cream just because it&#x27;s less useful in the show) and you should have good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flip the setting and you can trim and shave at the same time - this is very useful for those days when you realize you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while and don&#x27;t want to go through a two-step process of first trimming then shaving...this product will do both at the same time just make sure you don&#x27;t move too fast across your face or it can pull and you&#x27;ll scream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dry clippering this works just as well as any other clipper I&#x27;ve used. I prefer not to smooth shave but use the clipper predominantly as my tool of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For other areas of the body the gentle nature of the product is useful. You don&#x27;t really want to be using blades...down there...but keep in mind that the hair texture of certain body zones is different than the face, so your mileage may vary depending upon your personal hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the product for me is a challenge when wet. The hair sticks and can get under the blades, even under water. When dry I can use a clipper brush to get all the little hairs out and they don&#x27;t stick. This will be important depending on where on your body you&#x27;ve shaved - again because the hair textures are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it gets a 3 only because I don&#x27;t find it all that unique. Yes it can trim and shave at the same time, but that&#x27;s just one minor feature. There are plenty of manscaping tools/techniques/products out there...this one is adequate, inexpensive, and brand-named.ust one minor feature.

            <li> This is supposed to be for shaving and trimming below the neck, and let me say right out, I don&#x27;t do that. Nonetheless, I got a lot of use out of this. It took care of ear hair and my eyebrows, and I trimmed above and around the ears when I was a little shaggy. I definitely like the extendable razor, which you can use by itself or in tandem with the trimmer. I was a little surprised, however, that although it uses \\&quot;Gillette Fusion technology\\&quot;, they didn&#x27;t bother to electrify the razor to get the closer, easier cut that the vibrating razor gives. (In fact, I took the blades off and put them in my battery powered Fusion razor; worked great as usual.) The attachments for this device make it very flexible and safe, even allowing for a little experimentation with different lengths to see what suits you best. Its small size makes it easy to handle, and I like the charging device that doesn&#x27;t have any metal connectors or openings, allowing the trimmer to be used in the shower (possibly its best feature). It is small and ergonomically designed. Everything just worked fine. If you have a need for shaving other parts of your body than what I&#x27;ve mentioned here, this will probably be a great tool for you (you sly dog). For the basics, it&#x27;s as good or better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, so I couldn&#x27;t make a good argument for giving it less than four stars (half star subtractions for not powering the razor and for being targeted at body parts I don&#x27;t trim or shave).</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;.  I love that you can use it in the shower or out.  There are three attachments for the trimmer portion, so you can control the length you want to trim to, but keep everything uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just by turning the shaver over, you have access to the very smooth razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this to be very easy to use, very effective and comfortable.  I really didn&#x27;t think I would love this kind of product, but I am a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> When a prouct tries to do two things at once it usually ends up doing both poorly.&lt;br /&gt;As was the case with this trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li> so i wanted to get something that has a good battery life and options.. and i found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like the braun name. used many other braun devices over the years and none just &#x27;died&#x27;. 1 dropped in toilet, one dropped on floor, other fell off a shelf. none have just DIED for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the blades seem to cut very well and its not a very loud cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the one for me.</li>
            <li> read the directions:don&#x27;t use it on your face cuz it&#x27;s meant for body hair. works nice w/o knicks or tugging on:chest,legs,arms,back,booty,and \\&quot;speshall area\\&quot;!woo! great product that works in the shower!even comes with shower-hanging loop!</li>
            <li> Its an ok appliance but the Norelco body groomer has so much more to offer and is more powerful!! Braun makes good shavers but mainly for the face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was made by (or in partnership with) Gillette or I wouldn&#x27;t have requested it. (The fact that they don&#x27;t have a no-animal testing policy in this day and age is ridiculous to me.) Since I used it, however, I thought I&#x27;d share:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty much as described, trimming hair \\&quot;all over\\&quot; fairly easily and well. That said, it didn&#x27;t work as well in the shower as other cordless groomers I&#x27;ve used, and the whole \\&quot;razor and trimmer in one!\\&quot; aspect of it is a bit beyond me.  In fact, I actually avoided certain areas because I was worried about cutting while trimming, or snagging while shaving...  it might sound odd, but if you&#x27;re a modern guy, you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s really no reason for an all-in-one razor and trimmer; it makes it feel awkward and doesn&#x27;t let you get the job done unless you&#x27;re brave (and/or crazy). I asked a friend to see if he thought it was a good idea and he couldn&#x27;t even figure out how you&#x27;d hold and angle it in order to use the \\&quot;combi mode to trim and shave in one stroke for fast and convenient results.\\&quot;  We both agreed that rather than fast and convenient, this \\&quot;development\\&quot; was just stupid and impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and marketing is a bit odd too; sexy almost-naked guy on the front of the box, but odd little cartoon inside, to demonstrate areas where you could use it.  Frankly, if you need a picture showing where your chest, torso and \\&quot;bits\\&quot; are, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be using sharp object. (Just a thought.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the trimmer worked fairly well, and the unit as a whole feels solid and good in the hand, not cheap and easily breakable like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it in a store? No. I&#x27;d get a trimmer and use a regular razor.</li>
            <li> My husband is always on the hunt for a product that will give him a good shave/trim without irritating his skin. He said this is a passable attempt but he&#x27;s still looking for something that is less irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I admit it... I&#x27;m a hairy guy. But I still want to keep a neat appearance.&lt;br /&gt;My Braun electric razor has been very dependable but it&#x27;s meant to shave the short stubble of a days beard growth,&lt;br /&gt;This body trimmer has the same Braun quality, but is meant to get into smaller places and trim longer whiskers or hairs. It has an integrated safety razor for getting really close to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It also is designed to work while wet. This makes it easier to perforn fine shaving in the shower and leave behind nothing but skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that this product is so expensive when it&#x27;s really just a glorified Gillette fusion razor. It vibrates like one and the straight razor doesn&#x27;t work well at all. I really just use it as my razor for legs. Basically annoyed I spent 5x the $ for a product I already had at home.</li>
            <li> The 5 body shaver for men was every thing I hoped it would be.  It was perfect for grooming the groin area.  With using the different length protection guards it&#x27;s almost impossible to get nicked.</li>
            <li> Good quality but the medium attachment is incredibly short and the large attachment is very long.  Needs to be something in between the two.  And also, the large has a hard time cutting anyway.  For my beard it&#x27;s good but for anything else you have to make like 20 passes over and arm to do anything noticeable...</li>
            <li> Excelent shaver. I keep it at work and use it all the time. It also travels well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works. Long battery life.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the idea of leaving it in the shower and he can shave his face and body in one shot</li>
            <li> Good shaving device. It is unique in the way that it has a normal razor shaver attached next to the clippers so you get the power of both types of shaves. It did do a good job on my lower region which was a bonus.</li>
            <li> The blades without the peripherals are great if you want a close shave. I am bald and use it on my head in the shower. It works great for me.</li>
            <li> I love my new Braun Cruzer 5 Body Shaver which is easy to use and versatile even the shower.  It is great</li>
            <li> This item is ok but I wish that it had more flexibility with regards to the length of cuts available for hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far best personal trimmer I have seen..The trimmer is excellent, and the shaver is smooth and painless everywhere you use it.  Replaceable shaver blades is awesome idea..  Fast shipping and great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for arms, chest and anywhere else..  Not for your face per manufacturer</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it and has no complaints so far. It is much better priced on Amazon than in the stores!</li>
            <li> I got this to try the shaving part of its functions.  It said you could get a close shave in 1 stroke. The instructions said to use shaving cream. I did and it worked ok but in my opinion didn&#x27;t get any closer than my norelco shaver does and it takes more work having to use shaving cream.  That is why the 3 star rating.  I have not tried the other shaving options.  It is worth at least 3 to 4 starts because of all it can do.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s part of modern civilization where in conversation, with guy friends and even girlfriends, the question does come up, \\&quot;do you shave down there?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how this question comes up but the topic just springs up or maybe I hang out with weird people that are upfront about their hygiene but it does come up with the \\&quot;do you shave your nose hairs?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s one thing to trim nose hairs because hairs just coming out of the nose and visible is gross but for the nether-region, I don&#x27;t wear speedos to the pool but like one who wants to make their trees look right by pruning and their bushes on their yard to look even, I do believe that manscaping is important in keeping the peace and also enhancing the err...piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw the \\&quot;Braun Cruzer Body\\&quot;, the package made me think....a) This is for those who have a hairy chest and the other was hmm... for those who like to keep things clean down there... would this be the ultimate in manscape shaving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterall, you can use this device in the shower, it is cordless and you do have multiple lengths of shaving  (Sensitive-0.6mm, Medium-3mm, Long-8mm), I can see this as useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardware comes with a recharging stand, a Gillette Fusion blade and the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, it does work and its easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t experience any cutting or anything out of the ordinary.  Granted, if you are a hairy beast, you may want to use a scissor and cut/trim it down before using the Braun Cruzer.  The blade is big but it&#x27;s not that big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the device, fits well in the hand for a good grip to make those precise movements. If you want better control to trim near your nether-region, you have various settings for extending the blade.  It makes me laugh because it&#x27;s similar to those bush extending cutters that you may use for your lawn.  Well, same type of concept for your man-bush (is that a word?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the Braun Cruzer does get a thumbs up for its easy use and does what it was made for, quite perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... I do have an issue with the price.  Many guys are used to using blades or scissors but for $49.99 or higher, that&#x27;s a hard price to really bite on.  Maybe $29-$39 for the device but for $49 or higher, I don&#x27;t know...that&#x27;s pushing it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are a guy with a hairy chest or have a hairy man-bush or one who just wants to keep things looking clean and not hairy, the Braun Cruzer is definitely for you!ade for, quite perfectly.      BUT... I do have an issue with the price.  Many guys are used to using blades or scissors but for $49.99 or higher, that&#x27;s a hard price to really bite on.  Maybe $29-$39 for the device but for $49 or higher, I don&#x27;t know...that&#x27;s pushing it a bit.      So, if you are a guy with a hairy chest or have a hairy man-bush or one who just wants to keep things looking clean and not hairy, the Braun Cruzer is definitely for you!</li>
            <li> As a Greek-American man, I know a thing or two about superfluous body hair. It&#x27;s not good. Thanks to Braun&#x27;s new Cruzer Body Shaver my life has become much easier and I look 100% better. I use this device to shave all my chest hair, but what I like best about this product is that I am able to adjust it so a little hair remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Cruzer is water-resistant so I can take it into the shower with me and not have to worry about making a mess in my bathroom. The extra hair just washes down the sink. This shaver came just in the nick of time, I might add, because summer in the Pacific Northwest involves lots of swimming in lakes and pool parties. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking like Sasquatch. I can focus on trying to lose my beer belly...my smooth, hairless beer belly. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver and I found it extremely convenient and easy to use, but at times it seemed somewhat under-powered.  Its construction is solid and I liked being able to hop into the shower with it.  The battery died pretty quickly whenever I used it for trimming tasks (such as sideburns).  I would caution against using the shaver on areas where hair is thicker (such as facial hair) as it tends to pinch.  The replaceable blade is a great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recharger base and the lack of external contacts are a huge selling point (the base is small and easy to keep out of the way and there aren&#x27;t any contacts to corrode or gunk up).  Braun did a great job of making the razor easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This probably isn&#x27;t the product for you if you have the chest hair of Burt Reynolds and your looking to go with a more en vogue look.  I would recommend it for a maintenance tool for someone that is looking for a shaver for everyday use.  If your going to be doing a lot of heavy trimming often, then step up to a more robust product.</li>
            <li> Great, it was gift for a very grizzley buddy.</li>
            <li> This item came in a generic white box (not a sealed Braun box) and the plastic wrap sealing the internal items was torn open. The trimmer and all it&#x27;s accessories were loose and rattling around throughout the box.  Although the box was labeled new, nothing pointed to this being true. We received two of the same trimmer attachments and were still missing one. Overall, this package looked as though it was carelessly pieced together, thrown into a box, &amp; shipped without giving it a second look.</li>
            <li> this body shaver work better that other one&#x27;s i have got so far and You can use this thing in the shower, which is a huge plus. this is the best love it</li>
            <li> I used a razor before, but now that I got this body shaver I love it. It so easy to use and so quick. Should have done this years ago</li>
            <li> When I got this product I honestly thought it would work rather well as a combination. That hasn&#x27;t happened. I found it to be inconvenient at the least. The replacement blades are a bit more expensive than I cared for. I thought separately they worked great. I basically just use the trimmer, and quite often, and use the a razor separately. Just didn&#x27;t work for me combined.</li>
            <li> Braun products are always reliable and always deliver as far as my experiences go. I love this shaver because I can use it in the shower and it delivers a close and smooth shave and trim. In the summer time I need to tone down the hair that grows like kudzu all around my body. This is the bomb this razor!</li>
            <li> For a razor I found it passable.  It did the job and it was convenient to use.  When used properly the trim shave function is a slick idea and worked well.  What I didn&#x27;t like about having both options was that I had to dismantle the razor in order to trim (if I didn&#x27;t want to shave at the same time) because the razor kept catching on my skin when I was focused on the trimmer and was annoying.  If you are only going to trim be sure to remove the razor, which is a quick and easy removal.  Otherwise the Braun Cruzer does a passable job.  I don&#x27;t shave in the shower, so I can&#x27;t really speak to that option.</li>
            <li> This product was nice while it lasted.  My husband has used it very minimally, probably less than 15 times, and the motor doesn&#x27;t work.  I would recommend spending a little bit more money on something that is not junk.</li>
            <li> Great product, would recommend to anyone else. Ideal for those quick shaves when in a rush. great product for the price</li>
            <li> Being latino, I know what body hair truly looks like. I&#x27;ve always cared for the way I look and I&#x27;ve been always keen to find something that truly worked to help me shave my body hair and let me tell you, THIS WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t like a completely bare look, and with the different, adjustable lengths this body shaver helped me achieve the look I wanted in every part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this completely to all men that would like a change in their appearance. Every day, more women (and men, as well...) like a man that knows how to manscape. I would also like to say that manscaping is a HEALTHY habit, since it keeps areas cleaner and easier to clean, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t bought the Gillete replacements, but they are indeed a little bit on the expensive side, but again, these are more thick and durable blades made specially for body shaving. So it&#x27;s all good and I think my body deserves a good treatment every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still thinking about buying this body shaver, don&#x27;t think any longer and just buy it now.</li>
            <li> The water resistant shaver doesn&#x27;t shave well in the shower.  The electric razor can&#x27;t shave wet skin so you are just using the regular razor instead.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the combo when you can just buy a normal razor for less money.</li>
            <li> This is the best body shaver i have ever had. Not so great on the face but sensitive enough for the rest of yhe body</li>
            <li> The charge life is fantastic, I use this in the shower, to shave body hair. I have never been cut or nicked by this.</li>
            <li> Awesome &amp; fully satisfied ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! xxxxx xx</li>
            <li> I never used this product but the person that did said it was great and it has lasted a while to.</li>
            <li> Love this thing it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> Braun Cruzer is everything they say it is.  Easy to use, charge and store. All of the things it can perform produce amazing results.  Gladly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This does not do what I thought it would do. I will not be using it very much. It is a waste of money. I do not recommend purchasing this.</li>
