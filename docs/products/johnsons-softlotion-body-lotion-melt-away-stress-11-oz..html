            <li>so thanks the price seems fair</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and was really excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong; yet, it as described, it has a calming effect...</li>
            <li>She loves the smell as well as the creamy, light texture</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and soothing.  </li>
            <li>just this one has the lavander fragrance but it just leaves my skin smooth all day.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase and product and will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers the two pack which I think is a good value.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous, soft, like a warm blanket.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>Good lotion, but wish the bottle was bigger for the price.</li>
            <li>WORK ON TENSE MUSCLES BUT GREAT FOR STRESS!</li>
            <li>i stock up every 4 to 5 months in a bulk load to make sure i dont run out its good stuff na a waste of money at all &amp;lt;33333</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy, but moisturizes the skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It is my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly why I purchased it...to settle me down around bed time, but I am finding myself using it more and more throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>little higher then paid before, but nice to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing lotion with a subtle scent that truly soothes.  </li>
            <li>so I tried Amazon and sure enough</li>
            <li>Absorbs very nicely without being greasy and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>its the only stuff that actually smelt sooo good and really did make me wanna fall asleep</li>
            <li>i go thru so much of it.</li>
            <li>it is so soft and velvety and just makes me feel so calm and relaxed for the evening.</li>
            <li>but both bottles from the shipment contained a &amp;#34;Grit&amp;#34; within the lotion which was very displeasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She fell in love with it and looked high and low to find it in stores in New York and Maryland, AND I looked for it here in Los Angeles.  </li>
            <li>The aroma lasts for most of the day on me and will also seep into your clothing, which can be good or bad.  </li>
            <li>this is not the exact one I was looking for but similar</li>
            <li>I want the old Johnson baby lotion!</li>
            <li>It is priced right and much cheaper than the bigger aromatherapy products that offer the same advantages.  </li>
            <li>I generally can find weird, semi-obscure things on Amazon and that makes me happy.  </li>
            <li>My hands &amp; body feel so soft when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, J &amp; J will change their mind &amp; bring back the whole line.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft, as well.</li>
            <li>This is not typical for this product.</li>
            <li>other posters have stated, there is no oily feeling to this lotion and the scent seems to last awhile, making it feel like I am getting my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>

            <li> You can usually buy this at some big drugstores or big box stores but sometimes they are out for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer buying the small bottles over this gritty lotion.</li>

            <li> its not greasy like alot of other lotions you get</li>
            <li> Now we all know where to get it next time because it is apparently VERY HARD TO FIND.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and this shipment was not up to par.  </li>
            <li> Girlfriend searched for this everywhere after she had a small travel sized one.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!  </li>
            <li> Not sure what it was exposed to</li>
            <li> She was frustrated because she came up completely empty-handed</li>
            <li> and unfortunately so did I.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> So pre baby I was sad that this was discontinued</li>
            <li> I hate that I don&#x27;t see it in stores anymore</li>
            <li> Judging by the outrageous price on Amazon, I think it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>

            <li> My niece smelled this when a roommate of hers was using some.  She fell in love with it and looked high and low to find it in stores in New York and Maryland, AND I looked for it here in Los Angeles.  She was frustrated because she came up completely empty-handed and unfortunately so did I.  It was on her &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; list so I tried Amazon and sure enough, I found it through Johnson and Johnson.  She loves the smell as well as the creamy, light texture and she is so glad I found it for her!  I generally can find weird, semi-obscure things on Amazon and that makes me happy.  Now we all know where to get it next time because it is apparently VERY HARD TO FIND.  Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and feels great on your skin. Long-lasting fragrance and softness. Glad to find it here. I can never find it in stores.</li>

            <li> theres alot of lotions out there that Claim to be for relaxation and alll that and i have tried them but they dont compare to this stuff! its the only stuff that actually smelt sooo good and really did make me wanna fall asleep litrally rite after i put it on lol i love this soo much i stock up every 4 to 5 months in a bulk load to make sure i dont run out its good stuff na a waste of money at all &amp;lt;33333 ittttt</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lotion.  It smell heavenly!  I used to buy purse size at my local target for one dollar but now can&#x27;t find it anywhere in any size.. Judging by the outrageous price on Amazon, I think it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This lotion melts into your skin.  My hands &amp; body feel so soft when I use it.  The smell......so wonderful.  I cannot describe how amazing this lotion is.  Unfortunately, it has been discontinued.  I&#x27;m not sure why buy I&#x27;m very upset!  I purchased 4 bottles recently but I know it&#x27;s not enough.  Hopefully, J &amp; J will change their mind &amp; bring back the whole line.  Fingers Crossed!!!</li>
            <li> Love it and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around here!&lt;br /&gt;A little higher then paid before, but nice to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is yet another product that disappeared from local stores.  The fragrance is light and soothing.  Absorbs very nicely without being greasy and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this on Amazon. It&#x27;s a great lotion and I use it every night. It smells heavenly and leaves the skin feelin non-greasy. Keeps my skin soft, as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion of all time in Hawaii on Oahu it can&#x27;t be found no where now so I had ro pay big to get this.</li>
            <li> Good lotion, but wish the bottle was bigger for the price. I think  $21.97 is a little to high for a 11oz bottle. It was a Christmas present for someone, but I will not get it again.</li>
            <li> So pre baby I was sad that this was discontinued, then after someone got me the Nighttime baby lotion set for my son I realized its THE SAME THING, just in a different package...and 1/4 of the price of buying the &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; version on line.  Just an FYI ladies who love this scent like I do.  Now I just share with the baby.  : )  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion which I can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore..so thanks the price seems fair and I hope you continue to carry it..</li>

            <li> I hate that I don&#x27;t see it in stores anymore like I used to but I love this lotion. When I wear this lotion, guys would inhale the lotion when hugging me. I love it and so do they!</li>
            <li> AS SOON AS I RUB WITH IT I FEEL INSTANT RELIEF!&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T WORK ON TENSE MUSCLES BUT GREAT FOR STRESS!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Smells fabulous, soft, like a warm blanket. I use this after I shower and before bedtime. I bought myself two more bottles!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and this shipment was not up to par.

            <li> This is a nice lotion to have in the house.  The scent is not too strong; yet, it as described, it has a calming effect...stress reducer!

            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I cant seem to find this in stores anywhere. the fragrance is heavenly. I even had someone ask me what I was wearing because she used to work in perfume industry and knows quality scents! It is a MILD pleasant lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion so relaxing and feel of this lotion its not greasy like alot of other lotions you get</li>
