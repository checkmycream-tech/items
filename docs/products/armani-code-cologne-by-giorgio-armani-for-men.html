            <li>It wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting; it is a very nice smelling deodorant however it is not an anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>Although the scent is very nice, it sticks to your clothes and can&#x27;t be washed out.</li>

            <li>I do like it alcohol free good smell,I would recommend this deodorant to everybody Giorgio Armani Armani,Armani Cod by Giorgio</li>
            <li>Nice scent and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>As a cologne, I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love this smell on my husband and</li>
            <li>Get the Deodorant Spray, it does a better job imo.</li>
            <li>Like it smell good keeps you fresh for 24 hours</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my son&#x27;s favorite for years.</li>
            <li>I love the smell...</li>
            <li>overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Armani Code Alchhol Free Deoderant has a nice scent &amp; lasts for a day.</li>
            <li>I use it every time I go to the gym, which is 3 days a week &amp; it lasts for many, many months.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves Armani Code cologne and the deodorant stick that comes in the gift sets, but he goes through the deo quicker than the cologne, so we were very happy that Amazon was selling individual sticks.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the container is appropriate.</li>
            <li>Not a deo for sure</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love this and want to buy more.</li>
            <li>very good aroma and lasts the entire day</li>
            <li>Always buy this through perfumania.com but glad that they also sell through amazon with free ship.  </li>
            <li>feel so glad for purchase this product full all my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li>So, on a per-use cost basis, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon, especially compared to the department stores.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an alcohol free cologne, try this.</li>
            <li>Smells great obviously, but the $15 price tag may seem a lot for deodorant.</li>
            <li>seems the right guard is better....</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry and enhances the already great cologne when you use it in conjunction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly the same and it is so far working great!</li>
            <li>It got to him quickly and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Very nice smell and last the whole day.</li>
            <li>And after 1.5 months of liberal daily use, about 70-80% of the stick still remains, I&#x27;m so glad to be done with those cheap mass market deodorants filled with alcohol that run out in a week or two.</li>
            <li>Armani Code (original, not the &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; version) is a beautiful, gentle scent that drifts down like snowflakes and doesn&#x27;t overpower the room.</li>
            <li>love it long lasting and great smell</li>
            <li>bought for friend, a nice one last really long and smell good</li>
            <li>Fragrance is really nice, not super strong.</li>
            <li>It costs a little more, but it was sure worth it.</li>
            <li>And this has the same smell as the old spice products good Ole Giorgio is trying to do you</li>
            <li>Glad I am getting paid back!  </li>
            <li>the product&#x27;s high cost would cause me to choose a lesser priced good that offers both benefits.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin friendly</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t pair it with the cologne, the deodorant gives you a clean masculine smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry most of the time.</li>
            <li>its strong, but smells doesnt last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda of sticky and doesn&#x27;t feel much like Code</li>
            <li>He just really likes this brand.  </li>
            <li>I at least hoped that it would smell good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and now I just stock up on this one.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t last a full day.</li>
            <li>I love this item, this is the 3rd time I purchase the same</li>
            <li>Using the deodorant stick allows me to place just a few drops on the wrist and neck to create a nice, soft, signature.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and product arrived exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the extra money?</li>
            <li>Prevents any kind of bad odor and most importantly, keeps me dry.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would last all day and smell as good as the cologne or at least get close.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have rated something this low</li>
            <li>It stays on for a long period of time, and smells nice, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I would buy from them again and recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant along with the Armani Code cologne for several years and really like it as do the ladies around the office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin</li>
            <li>or probably they sent me old one...</li>
            <li>I bought this as an early Christmas gift for my boyfriend who loves Armani Code cologne.</li>
            <li>this one is far from the Armani Code I know.</li>
            <li>wish it was on constant reorder every few months :)</li>
            <li>It leaves a bit of a sticky sensation on the armpits, and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last longer than up to 2 hrs, even when not heavily exerting yourself.  </li>
            <li>You should switch up your deodorant/soap/shampoo occasionally, and this is my &amp;#34;shirt and tie&amp;#34; to my Old Spice &amp;#34;jeans and a t-shirt&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I just spent the extra for the real thing.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t,  and was actually the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>the only kind of deodorant ill ever use, doesn&#x27;t burn, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what the outcome will be on this product but so far it seems to be what I am looking for in the way of not irritating my armpits.</li>

            <li> the only kind of deodorant ill ever use, doesn&#x27;t burn, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the outcome will be on this product but so far it seems to be what I am looking for in the way of not irritating my armpits.</li>
            <li> Subtle, and not as harsh as most deodorants.</li>
            <li> but it leaves a sticky mess in the armpit area especially in very warm weather which is very uncomfortable and while it does it&#x27;s job of masking or stopping BO</li>
            <li> You can rely on it lasting for long 12 + hour days.</li>
            <li> it is the Armani and not cheap comparing with normal deodorants.</li>
            <li> But as a deodorant, it is widely inferior to the standard store-bought deodorants.  </li>
            <li> The biggest plus is it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it didnt smell any different than any other aramni that i have purchase</li>
            <li> it does not keep my armpits feeling dry.</li>
            <li> When I received the deodorant it was dirty on the outside and looked liked it had been stored for years (not a good sign).</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 5 stars because of how long a stick lasts &amp; for the price, which way less than at a department store.</li>
            <li> This thing actually sucks ,I&#x27;ve been using the same deodrant for years , this thing does not keep you dry and does not have any scent</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was expensive, but --</li>
            <li> and here&#x27;s the reason for my review -- it lasts several times longer than ordinary grocery-store stick deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Those other ones shrink with time -- perhaps there&#x27;s alcohol in them that evaporates?  </li>
            <li> On days when I am not at the gym, I use other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other sticks, but none that measure up to this one.</li>
            <li> The smell is not even close to the cologne smell and it actually smelled like an old fake deodorant.</li>
            <li> The average person needs an antiperspirant (which this does not have), in ADDITION to a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> but the aroma is a little fu-fu for guys in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not sure...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing actually sucks ,I&#x27;ve been using the same deodrant for years , this thing does not keep you dry and does not have any scent</li>
            <li> The armani code is my all time favourite, be it cologne or deodorant stick. The smell makes my wife weak in the knees !</li>
            <li> While I sometimes use Armani Code cologne (and my girl-friend loves it!) I ALWAYS use Armani Code stick deodorant.  At first, I thought it was expensive, but -- and here&#x27;s the reason for my review -- it lasts several times longer than ordinary grocery-store stick deodorants.  Those other ones shrink with time -- perhaps there&#x27;s alcohol in them that evaporates?  The Armani Code stick deodorant performs well and one stick lasts literally for years (daily use).  So, on a per-use cost basis, it&#x27;s cheap. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I love this item, this is the 3rd time I purchase the same</li>
            <li> Nice smelling, lasts forever.</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling deoderent, i also recomend the colonge to so you can complete the unsamble meow meow</li>
            <li> As a cologne, I love this scent. But as a deodorant, it is widely inferior to the standard store-bought deodorants.  It leaves a bit of a sticky sensation on the armpits, and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last longer than up to 2 hrs, even when not heavily exerting yourself.  I finally gave in and decided to buy this product, but would not buy this deodorant again. The average person needs an antiperspirant (which this does not have), in ADDITION to a deodorant.  I will stick with the Armani Code cologne though.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant ever for me, it keeps me dry all day and the fragrance is the bomb this is a great product as well as the cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. Prevents any kind of bad odor and most importantly, keeps me dry. The scent is good but would be nicer if it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of comments on this and on the cologne.  Great price on Amazon, especially compared to the department stores.  Works well as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I just spent the extra for the real thing. It&#x27;s kinda of sticky and doesn&#x27;t feel much like Code and it doesn&#x27;t last a full day.</li>
            <li> the only kind of deodorant ill ever use, doesn&#x27;t burn, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me. This is my second one. Very nice smell and last the whole day.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant. I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and am extremely pleased with it. Fragrance is really nice, not super strong. The biggest plus is it lasts for a long time. You can rely on it lasting for long 12 + hour days. I have even used it before going to the gym and have no complaints. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Unlike the walmart versions, it is a great product. Keeps you dry most of the time. Is it worth the extra money? Not sure...</li>
            <li> These guys are amazing and have some of the best service out there! This product is also amazing because it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it, and that reduces the stains created on undershirts!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting; it is a very nice smelling deodorant however it is not an anti-perspirant.  Combine this fact with the product&#x27;s high cost would cause me to choose a lesser priced good that offers both benefits.</li>
            <li> Always buy this through perfumania.com but glad that they also sell through amazon with free ship.  I love this smell on my husband and it last all day according to him.</li>
            <li> My wife loves when I wear this.</li>
            <li> got this product on time ......open it and it didnt smell any different than any other aramni that i have purchase</li>
            <li> Very good deodorant , my husband loves at !</li>
            <li> doesnt stick to the clothes, no signs, etc...&lt;br /&gt;great smell either, people usually compliments on it...&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot from this deodorant. I was hoping that it would last all day and smell as good as the cologne or at least get close. When I received the deodorant it was dirty on the outside and looked liked it had been stored for years (not a good sign). I at least hoped that it would smell good but it didn&#x27;t,  and was actually the complete opposite. The smell is not even close to the cologne smell and it actually smelled like an old fake deodorant. This is the first time I have rated something this low and I wish I could go lower. The worst thing is that I can&#x27;t even return it. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Nice odour but it leaves a sticky mess in the armpit area especially in very warm weather which is very uncomfortable and while it does it&#x27;s job of masking or stopping BO it does not keep my armpits feeling dry. Get the Deodorant Spray, it does a better job imo.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Armani it smells nice. my only issue here when i got this product it wasn&#x27;t sealed. i don&#x27;t know if it was opened before or not. so i am not using it now....</li>
            <li> I do like it alcohol free good smell,I would recommend this deodorant to everybody Giorgio Armani Armani,Armani Cod by Giorgio</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for 5+ years and refuse to try anything else. Why fix something if it&#x27;s not broken, right!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, does not stain or become sticky! Lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was on constant reorder every few months :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to yourself: Shaving armpit hair helps!</li>
            <li> This smells so good. And after 1.5 months of liberal daily use, about 70-80% of the stick still remains, I&#x27;m so glad to be done with those cheap mass market deodorants filled with alcohol that run out in a week or two.</li>
            <li> Like it smell good keeps you fresh for 24 hours</li>
            <li> My husband is quite taken with this deodorant stick (he does not like the spray). It stays on for a long period of time, and smells nice, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. It&#x27;s been my son&#x27;s favorite for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf n I love the smell...unfortunately he didnt...so if your man sweat alot this is def not recommended</li>
            <li> It is RICO, AND I JUST STAYED FOR ME, THAT LIKE FRAGRANCE AND MUST NOW TO SEE IF&#x27;ll prove AS EFFECTIVE DEODORANT</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and product arrived exactly as described and expected. I would buy from them again and recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant along with the Armani Code cologne for several years and really like it as do the ladies around the office.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the outcome will be on this product but so far it seems to be what I am looking for in the way of not irritating my armpits. Nice fragrance,,not overwhelming.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Love it...no stains, smells great! I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t have any troubles with this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells great&lt;br /&gt;- No stains&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive skin friendly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Price&lt;br /&gt;- Availability</li>
            <li> this is a great deodorant, I love the fragrance so I decided to try it, this is my second stick</li>
            <li> I have to say this. it is the Armani and not cheap comparing with normal deodorants. its strong, but smells doesnt last. seems the right guard is better....or probably they sent me old one...</li>
            <li> Excellent service and great shipping great smell and for those of you that have a alcohol inches is great on your skin</li>
            <li> Worse Deodorant ever! I hate wasting my money on this ,it does nothing for you.Dont waste your money,it smells  bad and make your shirt dirty.</li>
            <li> Armani Code (original, not the &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; version) is a beautiful, gentle scent that drifts down like snowflakes and doesn&#x27;t overpower the room. It&#x27;s a refined, luxurious smell that says sophistication and understated presence. Magnificent. Using the deodorant stick allows me to place just a few drops on the wrist and neck to create a nice, soft, signature. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Have use this type of product for 8 years now. Nice scent and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an early Christmas gift for my boyfriend who loves Armani Code cologne. It smells exactly the same and it is so far working great! Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Ever since I got the box set as a gift I continue to order the separate pieces. Even if you don&#x27;t pair it with the cologne, the deodorant gives you a clean masculine smell that lasts all day. Now it&#x27;s the only thing I use.</li>
            <li> EXCELENT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel so glad for purchase this product full all my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;has very good aroma and lasts the entire day</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry and enhances the already great cologne when you use it in conjunction. Only reason why it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because it&#x27;s a bit pricey for deodorant.</li>
            <li> Got for my son, only brand he will use.  So expensive and the price doubled since he last asked me to order.  Glad I am getting paid back!  He just really likes this brand.  I assume it is because it works well and the smell is not intrusive.</li>
            <li> Armani Code Alchhol Free Deoderant has a nice scent &amp; lasts for a day. I use it every time I go to the gym, which is 3 days a week &amp; it lasts for many, many months. On days when I am not at the gym, I use other deodorants. I am giving it 5 stars because of how long a stick lasts &amp; for the price, which way less than at a department store.</li>
            <li> Armani products are all great smelling.</li>
            <li> love it long lasting and great smell</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves Armani Code cologne and the deodorant stick that comes in the gift sets, but he goes through the deo quicker than the cologne, so we were very happy that Amazon was selling individual sticks. It got to him quickly and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Will not recommend this product. Although the scent is very nice, it sticks to your clothes and can&#x27;t be washed out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for someone who can not use colognes that contain alcohol. It&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant. Basically it&#x27;s a cologne in a stick, and that is what he uses it for. It smells wonderful! The ladies comment on it. They like it. If you&#x27;re looking for an alcohol free cologne, try this.You&#x27;ll smell great. I&#x27;ve purchased other sticks, but none that measure up to this one. It costs a little more, but it was sure worth it.</li>
            <li> but the aroma is a little fu-fu for guys in my opinion. Otherwise the container is appropriate. What else can I say.</li>
            <li> Subtle, and not as harsh as most deodorants. You should switch up your deodorant/soap/shampoo occasionally, and this is my &amp;#34;shirt and tie&amp;#34; to my Old Spice &amp;#34;jeans and a t-shirt&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The smell is wondiferous.</li>
            <li> Items as described,  great service !!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described, very pleased with the seller and the item.</li>
            <li> Great product, service, accuracy of the description and promptly delivery.</li>
            <li> mehh... this one is far from the Armani Code I know. Not a deo for sure and it vaguely smells like Armani Code. Will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> Smells great obviously, but the $15 price tag may seem a lot for deodorant. I use it daily and it lasts 4 or 5 months, so it&#x27;s about on par with drug store deodorant and you don&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;ocean mist&amp;#34; or whatever they call it now.</li>
            <li> There are ingredients in this stuff that are really bad for you some of the ingredients have been banned. And this has the same smell as the old spice products good Ole Giorgio is trying to do you in.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to put this stuff on your arm pits have at it. I for one will not. And if you want to return it, the price for shipping and the price you payed for it to get to your house and sent it back it will not be cost affective. Word to the wise read all the ingredients on anything before you buy it!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and I strongly recommend to every one,  all my family like it and my friends too.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant. It lasts all day and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue when used. The scent is great and not too strong. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and now I just stock up on this one.</li>
            <li> Armani Code is always has a good products and i am loving it.Armani Code is always has a good products and i am loving it.</li>
            <li> I love this and want to buy more.</li>
            <li> bought for friend, a nice one last really long and smell good</li>
