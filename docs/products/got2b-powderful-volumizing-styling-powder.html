            <li>Good product, my daughter was in the play &amp;#34;Hairspray&amp;#34; with 1960&#x27;s teased undo styles.  </li>

            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like teasing my hair, I just discovered this and love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li>It cheap and makes your hair looks great.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair nice and texturized</li>
            <li>The bottle and packaging are nice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice neutral scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be fair, it had more volume.  </li>
            <li>Which, volume was nice, but it came at a price--</li>
            <li>This is perfect for a super quick refresh of your do as well!</li>
            <li>Awesome, highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Very pleased, am ordering more.</li>
            <li>I think if you have shorter hair this might do a great job of creating super volume in your hair.</li>
            <li>, it keeps my hair soft and touchable (not sticky), and best of all I can throw away my glues, sprays, gels, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and was thrilled to fins it online, after not being able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li>This white powder blends perfectly into my brown hair, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>Loved it, it is light, shows results very quickly.</li>
            <li>This magical powder disappeared into my hair and made it a bit sticky</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>this stuff is potent and it lasts throughout the day to refluff.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>DAMN am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but it does add some volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>Love this one.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this hair powder.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this Product.  </li>
            <li>I find it also helps fit humidity!  </li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than all of the heat-activated, high-maintenance mousses and creams and sprays for volume.</li>
            <li>Of all the volumizing powder this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>That one provides lots of texture and control, but more ability to style once the product is in.</li>
            <li>You wont have to tease any more</li>
            <li>Believe me I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and love it for building volume and giving my hair that piecey look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it sparingly because every time I fall in love with a product, they discontinue it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite volumizing product.  </li>
            <li>WE LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I found this ineffective in creating volume in my hair and felt that more stayed on my hands than I could get onto the roots of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>My hope was that after rubbing the product in thoroughly, a more even distribution would lessen the bonds holding clumps together.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this</li>
            <li>on the days in between, I thought this product could add some more life to it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it, but I am not 110% sure I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it gives me volume that lasts :)</li>
            <li>However, this magic powder will give you a ton more volume that lasts all day if that is what you want.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to work it inside your hair.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work if you put it on top of your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this powder.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice size and light weight so its easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and wish I&#x27;d discovered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li>: I received a full sized sample of g&amp;ouml;t2b powderful from bzzagent.com in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Fabulous volume has never been so easy!  </li>
            <li>What is most important to me is that it doesn&#x27;t *look* sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being that this product ranges in price from $3.99 up to $8.97, I&#x27;m so glad I got it for free.</li>
            <li>Good for a fast touch up</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;got2b POWDER&#x27;ful easily doubled the volume of my hair after I sprinkled the powder onto my fingertips and applied it to the roots.</li>
            <li>It washed out and after I conditioned it felt silky and clean once more.</li>
            <li>, it helped me easily achieve a fancy hairstyle for the wedding I was attending because it did as promised and added a lot of volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>Never one to give up easily</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended for everyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff when you want to foof your do.</li>
            <li>Rub it in real nice, and kind of &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; your hair up, perhaps throw a cute hair band you&#x27;ve always wanted to wear but couldn&#x27;t before because your hair sucks.</li>
            <li>Glad I did not pay full price.</li>
            <li>I do have fine hair, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>Not something I would recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for thin, fine hair, to get more volume!  </li>
            <li>A little tricky to figure out the best application technique, but it does what it says.  </li>
            <li>Getting volume has always been a huge challenge-</li>
            <li>(I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for an extra boost of volume.</li>
            <li>Lightly scrub it at root level and there you have it....</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a perfect travel size and everyday</li>
            <li>I did get to try this product for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign,  </li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things:)</li>
            <li>I love it compared to teasing with hairspray which never holds right.</li>
            <li>Being able to quickly add volume to my hair with a product that also acts as a dry shampoo is great.</li>
            <li>This is great for my long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try got2b&#x27;s POWDER&#x27;ful Volumizing Styling Powder!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say that it would probably work better if my hair were a bit shorter, so if you have longer hair just be aware you won&#x27;t get quite the volume.</li>
            <li>First off, I LOVE</li>
            <li>Perfect for thin, fine hair!</li>
            <li>hair doesnt feel sticky, its not flaking like it would had i used spray and its still got that natural bounce that looks like i should be walking through a vidal sassoon commercial.&lt;br /&gt;love, love, love this stuff</li>
            <li>Clean, full of body,and styled.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re styling an updo for a special event, you&#x27;ll be amazed at how well this helps hold the style..remember the days when you had to wash your hair the day before</li>
            <li>control\\&quot; also fought with a great deal of static that tangled my hair as I applied it; I was able to manage the static with a lightly dampened brush, however, the moisture turned the product into a stiffened mass reminiscent of plastic Barbie doll hair after it dried.</li>
            <li>So I was super excited to find a product like this.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my full, shiny hair almost everywhere I go.</li>
            <li>I guess what I really need is texture more than anything.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like 1/10th full.</li>
            <li>i think there&#x27;s a whole movement of these \\&quot;magic</li>
            <li>I love so much.</li>
            <li>So, go to a beauty supply store, buy yourself a knock-off really good deep conditioner, you&#x27;ll need it when washing this out of your hair.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not a bad thing, it is how they all work.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Came super fast and I love the idea of volumizing powder compared to hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love the texture these types of products provide for my soft, slippery, fine hair, but this one was so sticky, I couldn&#x27;t style it or run my fingers through it all.</li>
            <li>I was blessed with very straight, fine hair</li>
            <li>If you use too much it can get a little tacky feeling but otherwise its the best thing out there.  </li>
            <li>Redken Quick Tease 15 Backcombing Finishing Spray (5.3 oz.)]].</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this product and the BigSexy powder keep getting reviews for not being a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Sooooooo fast and easy</li>
            <li>Better dry shampoos out there that smell better, leave my hair touchable, and still take care of my greasy \\&quot;Spaghetti hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only a dry shampoo, but it&#x27;s the best volumizing product I&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and fine</li>
            <li>I have been a huge fan of the Big Sexy Powder Play product for years.</li>
            <li>It is great help by soft and silky, just recently washed hair, which needs volume and some hold for styling.</li>
            <li>but I could see where it would be a concern to some people if you also want a more natural texture with your products.</li>
            <li>IS WORTH</li>
            <li>, sometimes I just fluff it a bit with my fingers and get a good result.</li>
            <li>With this product, you can style with freshly cleaned hair and you don&#x27;t get dullness from the product either.</li>
            <li>Due to good reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair TONS of volume, just the right amount of hold, pliability (i.e. I can \\&quot;shape\\&quot; it throughout the day)</li>
            <li>but right now I&#x27;m on the fence.</li>
            <li>I saw this product while shopping yesterday and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since it seemed to be priced right.</li>
            <li>this stuff is reasonably priced, fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;give</li>
            <li>My hair is always full of body at the bottom, and flat on top.  </li>
            <li>Most people will probably use a little &amp;#34;sprinkle&amp;#34;, &amp; that&#x27;s probably all you&#x27;ll need, it&#x27;ll lift your hair off your scalp &amp; give you some body, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly thick, kinky-curly hair, so my hair has plenty of volume on its own; however, I have my hair style into an undercut and wear most of my hair off to one side of my head, so</li>
            <li>she likes it very much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li>B0033ROOS6 Redken Body Full Instant Bodifier Volumizing Foam, for Baby Fine Hair, 5-ounce]]or</li>
            <li>The price is incredible and is such a much better value than any of the other similar products found here in the states.  </li>
            <li>i didnt even have to use that much!</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend if you are someone who likes the \\&quot;big\\&quot; hair look!</li>
            <li>Really does work!</li>
            <li>but yes i love it bought three product to last me all month</li>
            <li>This is so much quicker and healthier for hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Big Sexy brand from now on.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>very similar product I have bought and paid much more for.</li>
            <li>first off, I bought it at Walgreens NOT on sale for 6.99...  </li>
            <li>Gives my hair texture and density which enables me to try so many different styles.</li>
            <li>My hair is super fragile and fine</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used, plus it doesn&#x27;t instantly set and get all sticky like hairspray.</li>
            <li>I went out the next day and bought 2 more bottles</li>
            <li>The increased volume will absolutely blow you away!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really dissapointed!</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t love to add volume to their hair in just ten seconds?</li>
            <li>When I blow dry my hair straight, and use this for lift, it works better, but it isn&#x27;t last all day amazing.</li>
            <li>so was flat from the top.</li>
            <li>Please consider testing this product on your hair prior to using for an important event, especially if you have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>it goes right back to super volume!</li>
            <li>naturally, the volumizing powder seemed much more appealing and less</li>
            <li>It made it very full with a lot of holding power, and not necessarily matte but not shiny either.</li>
            <li>It pretty much does what it says it would</li>
            <li>The powder works okay, but it does seem to hold long.</li>
            <li>After you brush it back out you can easily poof up your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ridiculously easy to apply and actually works.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says and it&#x27;s light and compact enough to carry around if I ever needed it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to consider the product for use on special occasions if--and only if--I am able to wash my hair relatively soon afterward.</li>
            <li>If you have fine and flat hair you should really give it a try!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not suitable for all over use as it is a bit &#x27;tacky, sticky&#x27; feeling and creates sort of matting effect (which is good for lifting roots up off the scalp).  </li>
            <li>(you know the feeling your hair has after you swim in salt water - kind of stiff), which was EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but coarse.  </li>
            <li>It is very similar to the Lanza product and adds texture &amp; body to fine hair.</li>
            <li>Give er&#x27; a try if you want as some people seem to really like it &amp; it is cheap enough now</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to know what this stuff is.  </li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>I actually really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Nothing gives my hair volume no matter how MUCH i use.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re a woman (or a man, or even a show-dog, haha), that can wreck your life unless you find a solution.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>It absolutely works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I do really like it.  </li>
            <li>would buy this product again, thanks Got2b</li>
            <li>I really cant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I used too much</li>
            <li>Very affordable and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too</li>
            <li>Maybe I used too much.</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that this really does work.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH I TRY EVERY HAIR SPRAY AND TEASING</li>
            <li>BUT IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH U USE,AND A FEELING LIKE PASTE.</li>
            <li>She had six shows with nightly teased up hairdos, it worked really well.</li>
            <li>, it gives the appearance of much fuller hair.  </li>
            <li>it leaves a very oily residue:</li>
            <li>in fact, I had to shake it to see if there really was any inside..</li>
            <li>This powder really works.</li>
            <li>I think I used too much amount though.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much, but when I did, it did add volume.</li>
            <li>of my bzzcampaign also included free samples to share with friends, so I picked my sister-in-law (who has curly hair) and another friend with the same type of hair as I have.</li>
            <li>powders\\&quot; and even brands like Prive &amp; Aveda have much more expensive versions of this kind of product.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I have really fine, flat hair.</li>
            <li>Stick straight, fine, always flat!</li>
            <li>Have tried so many other products for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>i hope it someday is, because they claim to be able to share other tips, etc.</li>
            <li>it gives some puffiness but it makes the hair sticky little bit.&lt;br /&gt;in general its good</li>
            <li>I was so excited I went out and bought me some the very next day.</li>
            <li>Imma be honest, i usually end up with burns from the curling iron &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I just got it yesterday was really surprised fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It was like a very strong, stiff hair spray, but I didn&#x27;t have a chance to style it because it stuck before I</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Because the lift began at root-level, my hair had more body than I am used to--and in much less time (15-20 seconds with got2b&#x27;s POWDER&#x27;ful</li>
            <li>I will try it again and use less and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li>I will try it again using less, if it feels better I will change this review.</li>
            <li>, so any quick extra volume is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>So I had high expectations going into this Got 2B product.</li>
            <li>It hides the flat spot at the back top of my head.</li>
            <li>A girlfriend (and wizard when it comes to styling hair) accepted the challenge of giving my hair volume one night, and she brought along a little magical friend - got2b Powder&#x27;ful Volumizing Styling Powder.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, naturally wavy hair and this stuff made it sticky, stringy and greasy.</li>
            <li>But overall it results in more volume all day long.</li>
            <li>Even if i can get a curl to hang out for more than a few mins I can never get any lift!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair and this product is fantastic for creating dramatic volume at the roots.</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve discovered several products (my fave being Suave dry shampoo) that are much better than this one.</li>
            <li>I have thin straight fine blonde hair like many others (sigh).</li>
            <li>I usually tease then use hairspray just over the top and my bangs to smooth any loose hairs.</li>
            <li>First off, this is not a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>So I set my blow dryer on cool, &amp; blow dry away.</li>
            <li>I would suggest shopping around to major drugstores and local retailers to get the best price, but this product goes a long way with a little applied, so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>This was a new product for me.  </li>
            <li>When one of my typical shopping days i happen  to be looking for a good sandlotion for african american hair</li>
            <li>So I too bought this at a local drugstore and wanted to go on here to see how much it was selling for (thanks to the amazon app \\&quot;snap</li>
            <li>(did I mention how fine and flat my hair is?), I tried alternately brushing and teasing my roots.  </li>
            <li>the powder completely disappears when you rub it in your hands!  </li>
            <li>but for the results and as long as the bottle lasts its worth it.</li>
            <li>I was using Big Sexy Hair and it was 3x&#x27;s more expensive with the exact same result.  </li>
            <li>I sprinkle this stuff directly to my roots instead of on my hands, and after some rubbing and fluffing, my hair&#x27;s done!</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s micro-particles are so light that they do not weigh strands down, even after sleeping on them.</li>
            <li>When I wrote the original review, we were still pretty limited in dry shampoo products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I change hair colors and styles way, way more often than the average person and am constantly tinkering around with new products to see what I can come up with.</li>
            <li>I also think this would give really amazing volume to shorter lighter hair ( mine is really long and heavy at the moment).</li>
            <li>For a first time user, don&#x27;t be surprised buy how powders are not what you think of as a traditional powder.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine &amp; thin hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m just buying my second one and had to leave some positive feedback.</li>
            <li>, if the wind blows, you can see my white scalp shimmering in the dark, so naturally I am super-concerned with my appearance, because I look ok otherwise</li>
            <li>You will get a funny texture but it works wonders on flat hair.</li>
            <li>I only use a mild sprinkle over my fingers, rub them together, and scrunch up my hair around the roots, so it&#x27;s the inner hair where this is ever applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love this for a night out but not on a daily basis it leaves your hair a little too sticky but that might just be me</li>
            <li>Well as soon as I try this powder on my roots and only my crown area I tease a little bit ,I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!!!I l LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>There was a \\&quot;tag\\&quot; on the box that you can snap a photo of and text in to the manufacturer, but after several tries it said it wasn&#x27;t currently available.</li>
            <li>And they need to make a darker powder for brunettes because this stuff leaves a white residue that no amount of brushing will fix (not that you can really brush your hair after using this, that&#x27;s how sticky your hair feels).</li>
            <li>Trust me, bed-hair is far preferable to patchy hair.</li>
            <li>Wow, thank you Got2B...</li>
            <li>So far, meh.</li>
            <li>I am 100 per cent gray but my hair is professionally colored.  </li>
            <li>I got a bottle free and a few bottles for friends.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, your hair will look like you&#x27;ve got white powder in it...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a busy mom</li>
            <li>so at least I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This does give some volume but for me, it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff on thin hair and its the best at making my hair look thick.  </li>
            <li>PERFECT FOR THICK HAIR,AND FOR THIN HAIR U HAVE TO WORK ON IT TILL U GET THE STYLE U WANT</li>
            <li>I would rather feel like my hair is dry and snarly and look nice, than my hair not look nice and feel thin and stuck to my head as usual.</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell where the powder is and like to get it washed out right away the next day.</li>
            <li>Most other brands have similar size containers, but the product amount inside of them is next to nothing...</li>
            <li>A small bottle easy to carry in the bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it gets one star because it was delivered quickly, but the product itself gets no stars and is not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li>My hair is stick straight and flat.  </li>
            <li>I do have very long fine hair, but I expected miracles I guess.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, just a little sprinkle here and there, and adds instant fullness to my hair.</li>
            <li>Especially if you hair is kind of greasy or dirty, just a small amount applied at the roots gives tremendous lift and volume!!!</li>
            <li>I bought it in London last year after my daughter recommended it highly to me.  </li>
            <li>If u use alot it can be a pain to wash it out without tons of shampoo (I actually use wen and it works great even with a small amount and my hairs three or four inches past my shoulders)</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say, to the person \\&quot;concerned\\&quot; about chemicals in their products - there is an ingredient label, so there&#x27;s no real mystery...</li>
            <li>so take your time and track it down it worth</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin oily hair.  </li>
            <li>All I need now is this TINY little bottle of powder that can fit in my purse</li>
            <li>a billion dallor industry hair is key we all live and breath it being women of all ethnicty</li>
            <li>Just the very tiniest of powder goes a very, very long way.  </li>
            <li>and it made my hair feel very coated, sticky and dry.</li>
            <li>It gives hair TONS on volume and gives it that dirty (but not really dirty) feeling that I love.</li>
            <li>Then last night after a busy day of errands, and time with family, I removed the scrunchie, glanced in the mirror, and was surprised at how it looked.  </li>
            <li>It works wonders and that usually means lots of fun chemicals!</li>
            <li>The bottle feels like it&#x27;s empty, but a tiny bit of the light weight powder goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, but the strands are fine.  </li>
            <li>I use it on short, fine hair: I apply gel or spraygel to damp hair, then blowdry as usual.</li>
            <li>(go to bed with wet hair, wake up with dry hair), then you won&#x27;t use garnier nutrisse, another thing about garnier nutrisse, it leaves your hair looking really soft &amp; shinny, &amp; the down side, if you leave it in your hair two days or more depending on how often you wash your hair, you&#x27;ll notice a flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try sprinkling it on my roots when my hair is about 80% dry, then flipping upside down and blowdrying.</li>
            <li>you can barely get a brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be careful not to use too much because I can see it getting a bit sticky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Under tips it says you can shake directly onto the roots of your hair and work in with your fingers for extra volume.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions for \\&quot;extra volume\\&quot; (if anyone needs it, I do) and sprinkled the powder directly on my roots.  </li>
            <li>I aim for massive volume, wild curls, untamed, as 80s as it can be.</li>
            <li>my ego is high when i step out all women want pretty hair and being black  african american weave empire  is</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair, and am always looking to get an extra oomph.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, you&#x27;ll use a very small amount on your hand and massage it through your hair.  </li>
            <li>With this little powder, I just douse a bunch in my already dry hair, then bend over, &amp; blow dry some more.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s like maybe a tablespoon total in there, so you pay through the nose and run out quick, and it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li>The delivery fee was high which made the item as expensive as a similar product I was able to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>The product will probably allow you to keep a style overnight, but it is definitely a volumizer that should be applied either directly to your ROOTS not the entire hair shaft or to your fingers, which you then distribute where you want it on your roots.</li>
            <li>It is NOT a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Got2b offers much more product for a mere fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>I then bought more here and lovelovelove to know it Is something that will make my hair have just enough volume and not go flat in either hot or cold weather.</li>
            <li>Used in very small amounts at the scalp it does the job for flat fine hair giving some height to the crown of the head.</li>
            <li>I first tried this at a blow-dry salon and caught it in a few youtube product videos and could only find it here on amazon.</li>
            <li>And there is no powdery residue or scent left behind to give away your styling secret, which can easily be tossed in your purse for a touch-up anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although strong in some aspects</li>
            <li>After that, the first two inches of hair all over my head was not only stiff and clumpy, but looked greasy as well.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps to add a little volume so I can style it</li>
            <li>It does make your hair a bit sticky, but no other product works for me as long as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine, a double whammy</li>
            <li>I have really short, fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried any of the other dry root lifter brands, then just know that this one works just as good, &amp; there&#x27;s no need to spend the extra money on the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>I takes practice to know how much product to use because over doing it will make your hair a flat gross mess.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than all of the heat-activated, high-maintenance mousses and creams and sprays for volume.</li>
            <li> Of all the volumizing powder this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> That one provides lots of texture and control, but more ability to style once the product is in.</li>
            <li> You wont have to tease any more</li>
            <li> Believe me I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and love it for building volume and giving my hair that piecey look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it sparingly because every time I fall in love with a product, they discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite volumizing product.  </li>
            <li> WE LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I found this ineffective in creating volume in my hair and felt that more stayed on my hands than I could get onto the roots of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> My hope was that after rubbing the product in thoroughly, a more even distribution would lessen the bonds holding clumps together.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this</li>
            <li> on the days in between, I thought this product could add some more life to it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, but I am not 110% sure I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it gives me volume that lasts :)</li>
            <li> However, this magic powder will give you a ton more volume that lasts all day if that is what you want.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to work it inside your hair.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work if you put it on top of your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this powder.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice size and light weight so its easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it and wish I&#x27;d discovered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> : I received a full sized sample of g&amp;ouml;t2b powderful from bzzagent.com in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Fabulous volume has never been so easy!  </li>
            <li> What is most important to me is that it doesn&#x27;t *look* sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being that this product ranges in price from $3.99 up to $8.97, I&#x27;m so glad I got it for free.</li>
            <li> Good for a fast touch up</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;got2b POWDER&#x27;ful easily doubled the volume of my hair after I sprinkled the powder onto my fingertips and applied it to the roots.</li>
            <li> It washed out and after I conditioned it felt silky and clean once more.</li>
            <li> , it helped me easily achieve a fancy hairstyle for the wedding I was attending because it did as promised and added a lot of volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> Never one to give up easily</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended for everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff when you want to foof your do.</li>
            <li> Rub it in real nice, and kind of &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; your hair up, perhaps throw a cute hair band you&#x27;ve always wanted to wear but couldn&#x27;t before because your hair sucks.</li>
            <li> Glad I did not pay full price.</li>
            <li> I do have fine hair, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Not something I would recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for thin, fine hair, to get more volume!  </li>
            <li> A little tricky to figure out the best application technique, but it does what it says.  </li>
            <li> Getting volume has always been a huge challenge-</li>
            <li> (I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for an extra boost of volume.</li>
            <li> Lightly scrub it at root level and there you have it....</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a perfect travel size and everyday</li>
            <li> I did get to try this product for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign,  </li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things:)</li>
            <li> I love it compared to teasing with hairspray which never holds right.</li>
            <li> Being able to quickly add volume to my hair with a product that also acts as a dry shampoo is great.</li>
            <li> This is great for my long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try got2b&#x27;s POWDER&#x27;ful Volumizing Styling Powder!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say that it would probably work better if my hair were a bit shorter, so if you have longer hair just be aware you won&#x27;t get quite the volume.</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE</li>
            <li> Perfect for thin, fine hair!</li>
            <li> hair doesnt feel sticky, its not flaking like it would had i used spray and its still got that natural bounce that looks like i should be walking through a vidal sassoon commercial.&lt;br /&gt;love, love, love this stuff</li>
            <li> Clean, full of body,and styled.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re styling an updo for a special event, you&#x27;ll be amazed at how well this helps hold the style..remember the days when you had to wash your hair the day before</li>
            <li> control\\&quot; also fought with a great deal of static that tangled my hair as I applied it; I was able to manage the static with a lightly dampened brush, however, the moisture turned the product into a stiffened mass reminiscent of plastic Barbie doll hair after it dried.</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to find a product like this.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my full, shiny hair almost everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> I guess what I really need is texture more than anything.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like 1/10th full.</li>
            <li> i think there&#x27;s a whole movement of these \\&quot;magic</li>
            <li> I love so much.</li>
            <li> So, go to a beauty supply store, buy yourself a knock-off really good deep conditioner, you&#x27;ll need it when washing this out of your hair.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not a bad thing, it is how they all work.  </li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Came super fast and I love the idea of volumizing powder compared to hairspray.</li>
            <li> I love the texture these types of products provide for my soft, slippery, fine hair, but this one was so sticky, I couldn&#x27;t style it or run my fingers through it all.</li>
            <li> I was blessed with very straight, fine hair</li>
            <li> If you use too much it can get a little tacky feeling but otherwise its the best thing out there.  </li>
            <li> Redken Quick Tease 15 Backcombing Finishing Spray (5.3 oz.)]].</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product and the BigSexy powder keep getting reviews for not being a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Sooooooo fast and easy</li>
            <li> Better dry shampoos out there that smell better, leave my hair touchable, and still take care of my greasy \\&quot;Spaghetti hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only a dry shampoo, but it&#x27;s the best volumizing product I&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and fine</li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of the Big Sexy Powder Play product for years.</li>
            <li> It is great help by soft and silky, just recently washed hair, which needs volume and some hold for styling.</li>
            <li> but I could see where it would be a concern to some people if you also want a more natural texture with your products.</li>
            <li> IS WORTH</li>
            <li> , sometimes I just fluff it a bit with my fingers and get a good result.</li>
            <li> With this product, you can style with freshly cleaned hair and you don&#x27;t get dullness from the product either.</li>
            <li> Due to good reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair TONS of volume, just the right amount of hold, pliability (i.e. I can \\&quot;shape\\&quot; it throughout the day)</li>
            <li> but right now I&#x27;m on the fence.</li>
            <li> I saw this product while shopping yesterday and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since it seemed to be priced right.</li>
            <li> this stuff is reasonably priced, fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;give</li>
            <li> My hair is always full of body at the bottom, and flat on top.  </li>
            <li> Most people will probably use a little &amp;#34;sprinkle&amp;#34;, &amp; that&#x27;s probably all you&#x27;ll need, it&#x27;ll lift your hair off your scalp &amp; give you some body, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick, kinky-curly hair, so my hair has plenty of volume on its own; however, I have my hair style into an undercut and wear most of my hair off to one side of my head, so</li>
            <li> she likes it very much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li> B0033ROOS6 Redken Body Full Instant Bodifier Volumizing Foam, for Baby Fine Hair, 5-ounce]]or</li>
            <li> The price is incredible and is such a much better value than any of the other similar products found here in the states.  </li>
            <li> i didnt even have to use that much!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend if you are someone who likes the \\&quot;big\\&quot; hair look!</li>
            <li> Really does work!</li>
            <li> but yes i love it bought three product to last me all month</li>
            <li> This is so much quicker and healthier for hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Big Sexy brand from now on.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> very similar product I have bought and paid much more for.</li>
            <li> first off, I bought it at Walgreens NOT on sale for 6.99...  </li>
            <li> Gives my hair texture and density which enables me to try so many different styles.</li>
            <li> My hair is super fragile and fine</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used, plus it doesn&#x27;t instantly set and get all sticky like hairspray.</li>
            <li> I went out the next day and bought 2 more bottles</li>
            <li> The increased volume will absolutely blow you away!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love to add volume to their hair in just ten seconds?</li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair straight, and use this for lift, it works better, but it isn&#x27;t last all day amazing.</li>
            <li> so was flat from the top.</li>
            <li> Please consider testing this product on your hair prior to using for an important event, especially if you have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> it goes right back to super volume!</li>
            <li> naturally, the volumizing powder seemed much more appealing and less</li>
            <li> It made it very full with a lot of holding power, and not necessarily matte but not shiny either.</li>
            <li> It pretty much does what it says it would</li>
            <li> The powder works okay, but it does seem to hold long.</li>
            <li> After you brush it back out you can easily poof up your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculously easy to apply and actually works.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says and it&#x27;s light and compact enough to carry around if I ever needed it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to consider the product for use on special occasions if--and only if--I am able to wash my hair relatively soon afterward.</li>
            <li> If you have fine and flat hair you should really give it a try!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not suitable for all over use as it is a bit &#x27;tacky, sticky&#x27; feeling and creates sort of matting effect (which is good for lifting roots up off the scalp).  </li>
            <li> (you know the feeling your hair has after you swim in salt water - kind of stiff), which was EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but coarse.  </li>
            <li> It is very similar to the Lanza product and adds texture &amp; body to fine hair.</li>
            <li> Give er&#x27; a try if you want as some people seem to really like it &amp; it is cheap enough now</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to know what this stuff is.  </li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> I actually really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Nothing gives my hair volume no matter how MUCH i use.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re a woman (or a man, or even a show-dog, haha), that can wreck your life unless you find a solution.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> It absolutely works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I do really like it.  </li>
            <li> would buy this product again, thanks Got2b</li>
            <li> I really cant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I used too much</li>
            <li> Very affordable and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> Maybe I used too much.</li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that this really does work.  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH I TRY EVERY HAIR SPRAY AND TEASING</li>
            <li> BUT IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH U USE,AND A FEELING LIKE PASTE.</li>
            <li> She had six shows with nightly teased up hairdos, it worked really well.</li>
            <li> , it gives the appearance of much fuller hair.  </li>
            <li> it leaves a very oily residue:</li>
            <li> in fact, I had to shake it to see if there really was any inside..</li>
            <li> This powder really works.</li>
            <li> I think I used too much amount though.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much, but when I did, it did add volume.</li>
            <li> of my bzzcampaign also included free samples to share with friends, so I picked my sister-in-law (who has curly hair) and another friend with the same type of hair as I have.</li>
            <li> powders\\&quot; and even brands like Prive &amp; Aveda have much more expensive versions of this kind of product.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have really fine, flat hair.</li>
            <li> Stick straight, fine, always flat!</li>
            <li> Have tried so many other products for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> i hope it someday is, because they claim to be able to share other tips, etc.</li>
            <li> it gives some puffiness but it makes the hair sticky little bit.&lt;br /&gt;in general its good</li>
            <li> I was so excited I went out and bought me some the very next day.</li>
            <li> Imma be honest, i usually end up with burns from the curling iron &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday was really surprised fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It was like a very strong, stiff hair spray, but I didn&#x27;t have a chance to style it because it stuck before I</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Because the lift began at root-level, my hair had more body than I am used to--and in much less time (15-20 seconds with got2b&#x27;s POWDER&#x27;ful</li>
            <li> I will try it again and use less and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> I will try it again using less, if it feels better I will change this review.</li>
            <li> , so any quick extra volume is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> So I had high expectations going into this Got 2B product.</li>
            <li> It hides the flat spot at the back top of my head.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend (and wizard when it comes to styling hair) accepted the challenge of giving my hair volume one night, and she brought along a little magical friend - got2b Powder&#x27;ful Volumizing Styling Powder.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, naturally wavy hair and this stuff made it sticky, stringy and greasy.</li>
            <li> But overall it results in more volume all day long.</li>
            <li> Even if i can get a curl to hang out for more than a few mins I can never get any lift!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love it and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair and this product is fantastic for creating dramatic volume at the roots.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve discovered several products (my fave being Suave dry shampoo) that are much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I have thin straight fine blonde hair like many others (sigh).</li>
            <li> I usually tease then use hairspray just over the top and my bangs to smooth any loose hairs.</li>
            <li> First off, this is not a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> So I set my blow dryer on cool, &amp; blow dry away.</li>
            <li> I would suggest shopping around to major drugstores and local retailers to get the best price, but this product goes a long way with a little applied, so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> This was a new product for me.  </li>
            <li> When one of my typical shopping days i happen  to be looking for a good sandlotion for african american hair</li>
            <li> So I too bought this at a local drugstore and wanted to go on here to see how much it was selling for (thanks to the amazon app \\&quot;snap</li>
            <li> (did I mention how fine and flat my hair is?), I tried alternately brushing and teasing my roots.  </li>
            <li> the powder completely disappears when you rub it in your hands!  </li>
            <li> but for the results and as long as the bottle lasts its worth it.</li>
            <li> I was using Big Sexy Hair and it was 3x&#x27;s more expensive with the exact same result.  </li>
            <li> I sprinkle this stuff directly to my roots instead of on my hands, and after some rubbing and fluffing, my hair&#x27;s done!</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s micro-particles are so light that they do not weigh strands down, even after sleeping on them.</li>
            <li> When I wrote the original review, we were still pretty limited in dry shampoo products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I change hair colors and styles way, way more often than the average person and am constantly tinkering around with new products to see what I can come up with.</li>
            <li> I also think this would give really amazing volume to shorter lighter hair ( mine is really long and heavy at the moment).</li>
            <li> For a first time user, don&#x27;t be surprised buy how powders are not what you think of as a traditional powder.  </li>
            <li> I have super fine &amp; thin hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just buying my second one and had to leave some positive feedback.</li>
            <li> , if the wind blows, you can see my white scalp shimmering in the dark, so naturally I am super-concerned with my appearance, because I look ok otherwise</li>
            <li> You will get a funny texture but it works wonders on flat hair.</li>
            <li> I only use a mild sprinkle over my fingers, rub them together, and scrunch up my hair around the roots, so it&#x27;s the inner hair where this is ever applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do love this for a night out but not on a daily basis it leaves your hair a little too sticky but that might just be me</li>
            <li> Well as soon as I try this powder on my roots and only my crown area I tease a little bit ,I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!!!I l LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> There was a \\&quot;tag\\&quot; on the box that you can snap a photo of and text in to the manufacturer, but after several tries it said it wasn&#x27;t currently available.</li>
            <li> And they need to make a darker powder for brunettes because this stuff leaves a white residue that no amount of brushing will fix (not that you can really brush your hair after using this, that&#x27;s how sticky your hair feels).</li>
            <li> Trust me, bed-hair is far preferable to patchy hair.</li>
            <li> Wow, thank you Got2B...</li>
            <li> So far, meh.</li>
            <li> I am 100 per cent gray but my hair is professionally colored.  </li>
            <li> I got a bottle free and a few bottles for friends.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, your hair will look like you&#x27;ve got white powder in it...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a busy mom</li>
            <li> so at least I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This does give some volume but for me, it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on thin hair and its the best at making my hair look thick.  </li>
            <li> PERFECT FOR THICK HAIR,AND FOR THIN HAIR U HAVE TO WORK ON IT TILL U GET THE STYLE U WANT</li>
            <li> I would rather feel like my hair is dry and snarly and look nice, than my hair not look nice and feel thin and stuck to my head as usual.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell where the powder is and like to get it washed out right away the next day.</li>
            <li> Most other brands have similar size containers, but the product amount inside of them is next to nothing...</li>
            <li> A small bottle easy to carry in the bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it gets one star because it was delivered quickly, but the product itself gets no stars and is not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> My hair is stick straight and flat.  </li>
            <li> I do have very long fine hair, but I expected miracles I guess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, just a little sprinkle here and there, and adds instant fullness to my hair.</li>
            <li> Especially if you hair is kind of greasy or dirty, just a small amount applied at the roots gives tremendous lift and volume!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it in London last year after my daughter recommended it highly to me.  </li>
            <li> If u use alot it can be a pain to wash it out without tons of shampoo (I actually use wen and it works great even with a small amount and my hairs three or four inches past my shoulders)</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say, to the person \\&quot;concerned\\&quot; about chemicals in their products - there is an ingredient label, so there&#x27;s no real mystery...</li>
            <li> so take your time and track it down it worth</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin oily hair.  </li>
            <li> All I need now is this TINY little bottle of powder that can fit in my purse</li>
            <li> a billion dallor industry hair is key we all live and breath it being women of all ethnicty</li>
            <li> Just the very tiniest of powder goes a very, very long way.  </li>
            <li> and it made my hair feel very coated, sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> It gives hair TONS on volume and gives it that dirty (but not really dirty) feeling that I love.</li>
            <li> Then last night after a busy day of errands, and time with family, I removed the scrunchie, glanced in the mirror, and was surprised at how it looked.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders and that usually means lots of fun chemicals!</li>
            <li> The bottle feels like it&#x27;s empty, but a tiny bit of the light weight powder goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, but the strands are fine.  </li>
            <li> I use it on short, fine hair: I apply gel or spraygel to damp hair, then blowdry as usual.</li>
            <li> (go to bed with wet hair, wake up with dry hair), then you won&#x27;t use garnier nutrisse, another thing about garnier nutrisse, it leaves your hair looking really soft &amp; shinny, &amp; the down side, if you leave it in your hair two days or more depending on how often you wash your hair, you&#x27;ll notice a flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try sprinkling it on my roots when my hair is about 80% dry, then flipping upside down and blowdrying.</li>
            <li> you can barely get a brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be careful not to use too much because I can see it getting a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Under tips it says you can shake directly onto the roots of your hair and work in with your fingers for extra volume.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions for \\&quot;extra volume\\&quot; (if anyone needs it, I do) and sprinkled the powder directly on my roots.  </li>
            <li> I aim for massive volume, wild curls, untamed, as 80s as it can be.</li>
            <li> my ego is high when i step out all women want pretty hair and being black  african american weave empire  is</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, and am always looking to get an extra oomph.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, you&#x27;ll use a very small amount on your hand and massage it through your hair.  </li>
            <li> With this little powder, I just douse a bunch in my already dry hair, then bend over, &amp; blow dry some more.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s like maybe a tablespoon total in there, so you pay through the nose and run out quick, and it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> The delivery fee was high which made the item as expensive as a similar product I was able to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> The product will probably allow you to keep a style overnight, but it is definitely a volumizer that should be applied either directly to your ROOTS not the entire hair shaft or to your fingers, which you then distribute where you want it on your roots.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Got2b offers much more product for a mere fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> I then bought more here and lovelovelove to know it Is something that will make my hair have just enough volume and not go flat in either hot or cold weather.</li>
            <li> Used in very small amounts at the scalp it does the job for flat fine hair giving some height to the crown of the head.</li>
            <li> I first tried this at a blow-dry salon and caught it in a few youtube product videos and could only find it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> And there is no powdery residue or scent left behind to give away your styling secret, which can easily be tossed in your purse for a touch-up anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although strong in some aspects</li>
            <li> After that, the first two inches of hair all over my head was not only stiff and clumpy, but looked greasy as well.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps to add a little volume so I can style it</li>
            <li> It does make your hair a bit sticky, but no other product works for me as long as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine, a double whammy</li>
            <li> I have really short, fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried any of the other dry root lifter brands, then just know that this one works just as good, &amp; there&#x27;s no need to spend the extra money on the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I takes practice to know how much product to use because over doing it will make your hair a flat gross mess.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way for the average person, but I&#x27;m more then average...</li>
            <li> All other products I&#x27;ve tried (aerosol sprays, root lifting mousse, texturizing sprays) end up making my hair look sticky or oily at the roots, but this creates volume while still leaving my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Even with big curlers, my hair rolls out flat &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products, sprays, gels, dry shampoos and mousses in failed attempts to fix the problem.    </li>
            <li> If used properly, this bottle will last you a long while.  </li>
            <li> While no one would be able to see it, my hair&#x27;s \\&quot;amazing texture\\&quot; felt chalky within minutes after applying the product and felt dirty, as though I had heavily perspired, after approximately an hour.</li>
            <li> But other than that little downside, I really like this product and recommend if you are looking for volumizing help!</li>
            <li> And yes, 0.35 ounces is a small amount, but you don&#x27;t need much to make it work and</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last a long time on my hair...</li>
            <li> do I want flat hair.  </li>
            <li> its my little hair magic secret volume to the max</li>
            <li> I initially got it because I was looking for an alternative to aerosol dry shampoo for a weekend trip--</li>
            <li> My straight hair typically loses volume shortly after it&#x27;s been done.  </li>
            <li> Also, this bottle will last you a long long time.</li>
            <li> Okay, it seems to me you are either going to really like this product or really hate it</li>
            <li> So, after that, I just styled it a certain way to dry, added my usual product, used got2b hairspray at my roots for some teasing...</li>
            <li> Number one, garnier nutrisse root lifter has to be put in your hair while it&#x27;s still wet/damp, therefore, blow drying is necessary after washing your hair, if you have long hair, &amp; you want to let it air dry overnight</li>
            <li> My hairdresser put this powder in my hair because I have thin hair which tends to part at the windmill (on the back, top of my head) and makes it impossible to look full.</li>
            <li> With Got2b I lift that section of hair up with my hands..sprinkle a little powder directly on the scalp/roots, then rub it in.  </li>
            <li> If I use too much, it makes my hair look dull.  </li>
            <li> I have expensive and cheap spray volumeizers.</li>
            <li> I saw one review that complained about how this is a \\&quot;sample size.\\&quot; Honey, you must be using way too much product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used got2b Glued for a really long time</li>
            <li> and NOTHING had ever worked, I could backcomb it, but it doesn&#x27;t stay in for long.</li>
            <li> With this stuff, you can go to bed with wet hair, &amp; just put some of this in the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have the finest hair, but I like growing it long and teasing it to add in extensions.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that I like to flat-iron.</li>
            <li> I recommend this all the time, and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it as long as they sell it</li>
            <li> I recommend this all the time, and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it as long as they sell it</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick, stick straight hair that has never responded to mousses, sprays, gels, nothing.</li>
            <li> Just for reference I have moderately thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I am a dark brunette and this left no visible white residue like some dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark and heavy and normally falls flat around  my face.</li>
            <li> Will ALWAYS carry this in my purse as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> The style eventually falls a little, but it&#x27;s sticky enough to keep a hold and retain enough volume.</li>
            <li> I received my first powder from my sister and was afraid that when I bought my own, it would be expensive.</li>
            <li> I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, and you&#x27;d think they could put a little more in there-</li>
            <li> It is a powdery substance and not a cream, foam or a spray which makes it different than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> It also kinda works like dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The product was just too sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> No need to blow this dry like a spray-in root</li>
            <li> No stranger to dry shampoo, I persevered, separating sections of my hair and sprinkling a bit of this product at the roots of each sectioned.  </li>
            <li> 2B dry</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a rough, gritty texture, so don&#x27;t expect to drag a comb through it.</li>
            <li> Two different brushes and a fine toothed comb later, my roots looked dirty, but a lot less greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the misunderstanding is with the earlier review, but this is not a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The powder is rather sticky and leaves residue on your hair (especially if you&#x27;re dark headed).</li>
            <li> It adds major volume with out making my hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about it, so I thought I&#x27;d try it, and it just takes a tiny bit, rub it btwn your palms, and run fingers thru hair, and fluff!!  </li>
            <li> It will make your hair coarse and slightly sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unbelievable product, puts lots of volume in you hair and you only use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> As soon as we left the store and got in the car I applied a small amount while my husband drove us on to our next errand.</li>
            <li> someone else said, this is NOT a sample size... a little bit of this stuff can go a very long way, and you do NOT need to coat your entire head!</li>
            <li> It does give your hair volume but it also leaves your hair a sticky mess they  need to make this in colors  as the white residue is visible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried this and ended up with my hair being a big sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Normally, I&#x27;d spray volume spray or hairspray directly onto my roots and blowdry, in order to get my roots to pop and REALLY bring out a volume, but my blow dryer&#x27;s been busted, and I hate drying my hair that way, anyway.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same as Aveda&#x27;s but far less expensive!</li>
            <li> My second day hair is a little greasy by the roots.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a drug store and sprinkled a little on my scalp in several places.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try, because it&#x27;s supposed to be similar, but it was a little bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> and I have yet to master that little poof in the back.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight, hair.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s also why it makes the hair fluff up and stay.</li>
            <li> I will admit, I really do not like the texture it gives.</li>
            <li> Those for hair are slightly wet or sticky once they are rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> so I was curious.</li>
            <li> ( And is rough on your hands when you put it in your hair, who knows what kinda of chemicals are in this product.</li>
            <li> So on something ive spent $5 on its cost me $30 to remove from my hair...</li>
            <li> had I spent the money on a product</li>
            <li> i a white substance i did what the product directed and was amazed at how my results came out my hair went from thick to pow in ten seconds</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said they had some trouble getting the stuff out of their hair, but I had no issue the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this roughly every other day since i purchased it over the summer, and i just ran out in December.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and every time you fluff your hair</li>
            <li> and I have always been wary of volumizing products for fear that they would weigh my strands down or make them appear less than clean.</li>
            <li> I have already told my mom and some other friends about it.</li>
            <li> I sometimes even do spot applications if my hair is flatter in one spot than the other.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t brush my hair after application to distribute it (due to the sticky feeling)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but they just don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of the product to get volume.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of this.  </li>
            <li> A little will go a long way with this product!</li>
            <li> I also found that the little lift it gives you, doesn&#x27;t stay very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very delicate powder that I apply directly to the scalp or you can apply it to the palm of your hand then to your hair.</li>
            <li> Just a slight dusting on your palm, rub together and fluff!</li>
            <li> However, I really like my hair to be touchable, and this product gives the hair a really weird feel to the touch when it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li> but it is not worth returning the product.</li>
            <li> not worth it</li>
            <li> Now, if you&#x27;re like me, &amp; you like extra everything, then my advice is to slowly work your way up to using lots of this.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small purple tube container about 3 and a half inches long.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have stated, it does make your hair feel sticky, even when you use just a little bit.</li>
            <li> (of course I use four other products in conjunction with it!)  </li>
            <li> It does, but after a while my slightly longer than shoulder length, weighs it down.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair sticky, felt thick, greasy no matter how much or little was used.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers complained of feeling dry or hating the way their hair feels.</li>
            <li> and it was a lot less sticky than this brand.</li>
            <li> Yes, it gives your roots a slightly &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feel, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I should have known when, as instructed, I sprinkled some in my hands and it just felt like a sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and sometimes it is too heavy and just lays flat.  </li>
            <li> I was using to much..cut it down to a few sprinkles..</li>
            <li> No matter what it made my hair SO greasy, weighed down, dried out, crunchy (think</li>
            <li> Only thing I can say is what really does work for me which I will be sticking with: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> A little goes along way too.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> I use this when I run out of my bumble and bumble styling creme to add a little lift to my hair.</li>
            <li> and this helps provide a little volume.</li>
            <li> You can also find it on ebay for a little cheaper once you factor in shipping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It creates a lot of texture, just like the hair putty did - it feels like it dries out my hair a little bit</li>
            <li> You have very little to loose (a few bucks) and a LOT to gain!</li>
            <li> , got2b POWDER&#x27;ful has a few weaknesses.</li>
            <li> I also feel as though the product dried out my hands, heightening the less-than-desirable feel of my hair in the 24 hours between using it and washing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really working with my \\&quot;modern\\&quot; style which is a chin-length bob with thick bangs (and lots of layers).</li>
            <li> like I do after a while when my hair starts falling limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Now, another thing, when you go to wash this out of your hair, you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about when I say &amp;#34;dried/powder glue&amp;#34;, it&#x27;ll feel like your hair is dried unmovable glue...</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a few years for a replacement for a discontinued got2be product (a hair putty).</li>
            <li> tried it a few ways..</li>
            <li> I have medium weight, slightly wavy hair and unless I curl and spray and tease I dont usually get volume.</li>
            <li> I can repeat throughout the day if things are feeling flat or tired.  </li>
            <li> It does make your hair stiff on where you apply it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t rub the product in because my hair was so stiff it couldn&#x27;t move</li>
            <li> I usually shake a little powder into my hands and rub them together and then flip my hair over and work it through my roots.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, my hair is baby thin and long.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed some reviewers seem to be confused by the fact that this is a powder, and they assume it is a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> very messy, let my hair stiff and mate.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thin - - this is one of the few products that gives me volume without weighing my hair down, or making it look greasy after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 years and haven&#x27;t found anything like it.</li>
            <li> Plus the sticky feeling is just not sexy at all.  </li>
            <li> (I have to do a few \\&quot;applications\\&quot; since my hair is so thick.)</li>
            <li> so i went to the cacasion section this small box product was just sitting there i purchased</li>
            <li> It blends well and definitely adds volume to my (sadly) limp-as-of-late hair.</li>
            <li> I usually have to wash it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have a weird cowlick or a spot in the back of my scalp where my hair separates.  </li>
            <li> It was an extremely small size for the price and didn&#x27;t add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> One thing to note is that this stuff is sort of like dried glue, or at least that&#x27;s what it makes me think of.</li>
            <li> directions tell you to shake a small amount on your hands and rub your hands together.</li>

            <li> this works for my thin hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to other products.</li>

            <li> I broke out on my scalp, doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it was because of this product, but just wanted to warn you guys, there could be an allergen in this.</li>

            <li> The powder is rather sticky and leaves residue on your hair (especially if you&#x27;re dark headed). It&#x27;s difficult to put on since your trying not to put too much in your hair because of the residue and that it makes combing through your hair very difficult. I also found that the little lift it gives you, doesn&#x27;t stay very long.</li>
            <li> I was blessed with very straight, fine hair and I have always been wary of volumizing products for fear that they would weigh my strands down or make them appear less than clean. I was so excited to try got2b&#x27;s POWDER&#x27;ful Volumizing Styling Powder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got2b POWDER&#x27;ful easily doubled the volume of my hair after I sprinkled the powder onto my fingertips and applied it to the roots. Because the lift began at root-level, my hair had more body than I am used to--and in much less time (15-20 seconds with got2b&#x27;s POWDER&#x27;ful vs. 2-4 minutes with a hairdryer)! The product&#x27;s micro-particles are so light that they do not weigh strands down, even after sleeping on them. And there is no powdery residue or scent left behind to give away your styling secret, which can easily be tossed in your purse for a touch-up anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although strong in some aspects, got2b POWDER&#x27;ful has a few weaknesses. While no one would be able to see it, my hair&#x27;s \\&quot;amazing texture\\&quot; felt chalky within minutes after applying the product and felt dirty, as though I had heavily perspired, after approximately an hour. Its \\&quot;flexible control\\&quot; also fought with a great deal of static that tangled my hair as I applied it; I was able to manage the static with a lightly dampened brush, however, the moisture turned the product into a stiffened mass reminiscent of plastic Barbie doll hair after it dried. I also feel as though the product dried out my hands, heightening the less-than-desirable feel of my hair in the 24 hours between using it and washing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I applaud the way that got2b&#x27;s POWDER&#x27;ful Volumizing Styling Powder made my hair look. However, I loathe the way that it made my hair feel. I will continue to consider the product for use on special occasions if--and only if--I am able to wash my hair relatively soon afterward. (I received this full-sized product sample to review for free from BzzAgent.)</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to know what this stuff is.  It works wonders and that usually means lots of fun chemicals! My hair is stick straight and flat.  Using a little bit of this on the roots makes me look lie an extra on Mad Men. Fabulous volume has never been so easy!  There is no smell and the powder completely disappears when you rub it in your hands!  This is perfect for a super quick refresh of your do as well!</li>
            <li> this product is awful. even if you use the smallest amount it leaves your hair feeling sticky and gross at the roots. you can barely get a brush through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gets one star because it was delivered quickly, but the product itself gets no stars and is not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> I have thin, wimpy hair. I have expensive and cheap spray volumeizers. I bought this on a fluke from a store clearance basket. I then bought more here and lovelovelove to know it Is something that will make my hair have just enough volume and not go flat in either hot or cold weather.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser put this powder in my hair because I have thin hair which tends to part at the windmill (on the back, top of my head) and makes it impossible to look full. This magical powder disappeared into my hair and made it a bit sticky but whenever I fluffed it, POW!! Body and lift ALL DAY!! This powder is a miracle for hair issues like mine. I definitely recommend to anyone who needs extra \\&quot;UMPH\\&quot; in their hair without all the extra drama.</li>
            <li> When I wrote the original review, we were still pretty limited in dry shampoo products. Since then, I&#x27;ve discovered several products (my fave being Suave dry shampoo) that are much better than this one. Yes, this product is volumizing but you (nor anyone else) will want to touch your hair after you have dusted it on. It leaves hair feeling \\&quot;gummy\\&quot;. And they need to make a darker powder for brunettes because this stuff leaves a white residue that no amount of brushing will fix (not that you can really brush your hair after using this, that&#x27;s how sticky your hair feels). So, moving on! Better dry shampoos out there that smell better, leave my hair touchable, and still take care of my greasy \\&quot;Spaghetti hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 years and haven&#x27;t found anything like it. I love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a powder and I can just sprinkle by roots and presto!! I have voluminous hair. It does make your hair stiff on where you apply it but that&#x27;s also why it makes the hair fluff up and stay. It also kinda works like dry shampoo. My second day hair is a little greasy by the roots. But once I apply this stuff it takes away the oilyness and adds volume at the same day. The bottle is a nice size and light weight so its easy to travel with. I&#x27;ve also given a bottle to my sister and best friend and they&#x27;ve started purchasing it in their own after the finished it.</li>
            <li> This works really well, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is great help by soft and silky, just recently washed hair, which needs volume and some hold for styling.</li>
            <li> AHHHHHHH-MAY-ZING!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously! I have medium weight, slightly wavy hair and unless I curl and spray and tease I dont usually get volume. Even with big curlers, my hair rolls out flat &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on a whim after washing and blow drying my hair. I just threw a handful in my hand and gave my roots a once over and POW! i didnt even have to use that much! this stuff is potent and it lasts throughout the day to refluff.&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesnt feel sticky, its not flaking like it would had i used spray and its still got that natural bounce that looks like i should be walking through a vidal sassoon commercial.&lt;br /&gt;love, love, love this stuff and you will too.&lt;br /&gt;convenient packaging means you can keep this treasure in your purse but seriously, I did my hair at 6am and it is now 2pm and I still have body. BAM!&lt;br /&gt;I am not by any means a hair styling genious. Imma be honest, i usually end up with burns from the curling iron &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;but this stuff is reasonably priced, fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;give it a try, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best invention since sliced bread.  Especially if you hair is kind of greasy or dirty, just a small amount applied at the roots gives tremendous lift and volume!!!</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick, stick straight hair that has never responded to mousses, sprays, gels, nothing. I&#x27;ve used got2b Glued for a really long time but it&#x27;s not really working with my \\&quot;modern\\&quot; style which is a chin-length bob with thick bangs (and lots of layers). Plus the sticky feeling is just not sexy at all.  I was skeptical about this powder but it was on sale at the store so I bought it and DAMN am I glad I did. You just use a very tiny amount, rub it between your hands, and then distribute it throughout your hair. (I have to do a few \\&quot;applications\\&quot; since my hair is so thick.) THIS PRODUCT WORKS AS ADVERTISED!! It gives my hair TONS of volume, just the right amount of hold, pliability (i.e. I can \\&quot;shape\\&quot; it throughout the day), it keeps my hair soft and touchable (not sticky), and best of all I can throw away my glues, sprays, gels, etc.  All I need now is this TINY little bottle of powder that can fit in my purse so I can take it with me anywhere... Even on a plane.   I saw one review that complained about how this is a \\&quot;sample size.\\&quot; Honey, you must be using way too much product. You literally only need a dime size amount... If used properly, this bottle will last you a long while.  BEST HAIR PRODUCT I HAVE USED IN YEARS. I have already told my mom and some other friends about it.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair a bit sticky, but no other product works for me as long as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply. My hair is dark and heavy and normally falls flat around  my face.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this stuff. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but it does add some volume to your hair. I usually shake a little powder into my hands and rub them together and then flip my hair over and work it through my roots. After you brush it back out you can easily poof up your hair. I&#x27;d be careful not to use too much because I can see it getting a bit sticky. I also think this would give really amazing volume to shorter lighter hair ( mine is really long and heavy at the moment).</li>
            <li> Have tried so many other products for my thinning hair. Love this one. A little goes along way too.&lt;br /&gt;Must have</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  A must have if you have short hair or want BIG hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! The bottle feels like it&#x27;s empty, but a tiny bit of the light weight powder goes a long way! I&#x27;ve used this roughly every other day since i purchased it over the summer, and i just ran out in December. It makes your hair look fuller and helps it to lay beautifully. It&#x27;s definitely a must hav!.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this hair powder. I used to spend over $20 on hair powders like this and was still disappointed. This product is incredible. I get compliments on my full, shiny hair almost everywhere I go. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price. I absolutely recommend if you are someone who likes the \\&quot;big\\&quot; hair look!</li>
            <li> Used in very small amounts at the scalp it does the job for flat fine hair giving some height to the crown of the head.</li>
            <li> I have thin oily hair. Nothing gives my hair volume no matter how MUCH i use. I bought this at a drug store and sprinkled a little on my scalp in several places. BOOM! Instant umph! It lasts all day. All i do is scrunch and lift and the umph comes back. Will ALWAYS carry this in my purse as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li> Alright, so this was my last resort to fuller hair, and...IT WORKED! :O&lt;br /&gt;I have terrible hyperthyroid, and maybe you guessed it-- thin, brittle hair that falls out rapidly as a symptom. It&#x27;s just awful, plain awful.&lt;br /&gt;Like, if the wind blows, you can see my white scalp shimmering in the dark, so naturally I am super-concerned with my appearance, because I look ok otherwise, it&#x27;s just my hair. But if you&#x27;re a woman (or a man, or even a show-dog, haha), that can wreck your life unless you find a solution. It&#x27;s just dreadful, and I have sympathy for anyone who struggles with this.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a similar issue to me, try this please. Rub it in real nice, and kind of &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; your hair up, perhaps throw a cute hair band you&#x27;ve always wanted to wear but couldn&#x27;t before because your hair sucks. Trust me, bed-hair is far preferable to patchy hair. Plus, this stuff adds texture so well, it stays in place, and if you need another bounce, just rub on your roots. Awesome, highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;My hair went from looking/feeling like the Cryptkeeper&#x27;s, to Dee-Lite&#x27;s! (kinda like the girl on the box) Wow, thank you Got2B...</li>
            <li> she likes it very much</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have been using for awhile and it&#x27;s great for an extra boost of volume.</li>
            <li> Really does work! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> When one of my typical shopping days i happen  to be looking for a good sandlotion for african american hair i did achieve big bouncy volumious hair that i craved so i went to the cacasion section this small box product was just sitting there i purchased it didnt quite know what to expect it was a powder fomula i a white substance i did what the product directed and was amazed at how my results came out my hair went from thick to pow in ten seconds my ego is high when i step out all women want pretty hair and being black  african american weave empire  is a billion dallor industry hair is key we all live and breath it being women of all ethnicty but yes i love it bought three product to last me all month its my little hair magic secret volume to the max and you can look for it at your local walmart or retail stores  and its well hinden so take your time and track it down it worth the treasure haunt</li>
            <li> It works GREAT for volume, I love it! No need for hairspray when I use this product. However, I really like my hair to be touchable, and this product gives the hair a really weird feel to the touch when it&#x27;s in. Also I always have to wash my hair twice to get it out all of the way.</li>
            <li> It does give your hair volume but it also leaves your hair a sticky mess they  need to make this in colors  as the white residue is visible.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Redken version of this  and it was a lot less sticky than this brand. I got mine ( Got2b) on clearance at Walgreen&#x27;s. Glad I did not pay full price.</li>
            <li> I love this Product.  I find it also helps fit humidity!  Best thing ever!</li>
            <li> Got it for the girlfriend. She didn&#x27;t complain so 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Granted, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; things in place, you need to keep fluffing over the day. But overall it results in more volume all day long. Other reviewers complained of feeling dry or hating the way their hair feels. I didn&#x27;t experience this at all. I only use a mild sprinkle over my fingers, rub them together, and scrunch up my hair around the roots, so it&#x27;s the inner hair where this is ever applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to describe the texture of this powder once you rub it is &amp;#34;a hard sort of tacky.&amp;#34; So by pressing it in as you rub up, you sort of stick them up and away from your head. The style eventually falls a little, but it&#x27;s sticky enough to keep a hold and retain enough volume. I&#x27;ve never used a product like this and I really love it. It&#x27;s so much better than all of the heat-activated, high-maintenance mousses and creams and sprays for volume. This is so much quicker and healthier for hair!</li>
            <li> Of all the volumizing powder this one is my favorite. Give my short hair a bit of a boost</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to another Schwarzkopf product that is significantly more expensive. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It blends well and definitely adds volume to my (sadly) limp-as-of-late hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product to add volume to my hair!</li>
            <li> First off, this is not a dry shampoo. I don&#x27;t know why this product and the BigSexy powder keep getting reviews for not being a good dry shampoo. No where on it does it say it is. I have very thin hair and NOTHING had ever worked, I could backcomb it, but it doesn&#x27;t stay in for long. I will admit, I really do not like the texture it gives. The volume it gives your hair is incredible though. I would rather feel like my hair is dry and snarly and look nice, than my hair not look nice and feel thin and stuck to my head as usual. I don&#x27;t know how great this would work on darker hair though. I have blonde hair and the product is sort of visible on my roots. I read other reviews that said they had some trouble getting the stuff out of their hair, but I had no issue the next morning. It washed out and after I conditioned it felt silky and clean once more. Great product and it is a life saver for people with thin lifeless hair like me.</li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of the Big Sexy Powder Play product for years. I decided to give this product a try, because it&#x27;s supposed to be similar, but it was a little bit cheaper. I didn&#x27;t like it very much. The product was just too sticky and dry. I love the texture these types of products provide for my soft, slippery, fine hair, but this one was so sticky, I couldn&#x27;t style it or run my fingers through it all. My hair felt kinda like a big clump. Haha. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Big Sexy brand from now on. That one provides lots of texture and control, but more ability to style once the product is in.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see an increase volume and left my hair sticky.  Did not work but it is not worth returning the product.</li>
            <li> I received my first powder from my sister and was afraid that when I bought my own, it would be expensive. The powder works and the price was lower than I had imagined it would be.</li>
            <li> Cool and works awesome!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical about this product, don&#x27;t be. It absolutely works as advertised. I have noticed some reviewers seem to be confused by the fact that this is a powder, and they assume it is a dry shampoo. It is NOT a dry shampoo. The product will probably allow you to keep a style overnight, but it is definitely a volumizer that should be applied either directly to your ROOTS not the entire hair shaft or to your fingers, which you then distribute where you want it on your roots. If you just shake it all over and expect it to work, it won&#x27;t. It will make your hair coarse and slightly sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it on short, fine hair: I apply gel or spraygel to damp hair, then blowdry as usual. Then I apply this powder to my crown and the back/top of my head to create some lift. I sometimes even do spot applications if my hair is flatter in one spot than the other. Then spray, and I&#x27;m done! That&#x27;s it. No need to blow this dry like a spray-in root lifter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and give this a shot. I would suggest shopping around to major drugstores and local retailers to get the best price, but this product goes a long way with a little applied, so it should last awhile. Also, it is a smallish can, perfect for traveling or carrying in a purse for quick touchups (although it works all day--I&#x27;ve never had to use it for a touchup).</li>
            <li> For a first time user, don&#x27;t be surprised buy how powders are not what you think of as a traditional powder.  Those for hair are slightly wet or sticky once they are rubbed in.  But that&#x27;s not a bad thing, it is how they all work.  This is exactly the same as Aveda&#x27;s but far less expensive!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a lot of volume.  I have thick hair and sometimes it is too heavy and just lays flat.  This powder gives it some volume and gives the cut some definition... you can see the layers and fullness.  I do really like it.  Amazon has the best price, unless you can buy it at Ulta when it&#x27;s on sale.  When I need it, it&#x27;s never on sale so I buy at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Love this powder! Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I searched for this product at stores (Target, Wal-Mart, CVS, Rite Aid). I had no luck finding it. Amazon had it at a great price so I stocked up. The delivery fee was high which made the item as expensive as a similar product I was able to find in the stores. I prefer this product.</li>
            <li> unbelievable product, puts lots of volume in you hair and you only use a tiny amount. sprinkle on roots and rub in and then just use your fingers to style your hair.  Sooooooo fast and easy</li>
            <li> I love this product and was thrilled to fins it online, after not being able to find it in stores. It gives hair TONS on volume and gives it that dirty (but not really dirty) feeling that I love. I will use this product forever!!</li>
            <li> So I saw this used in a blog for shorter hair to give volume and texture so I was curious. I just cut my hair and figured why not. So far, meh. My hair gets instantly gummy and looks greasy. Maybe I need to try it a bit more and try and figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong (if anything) but right now I&#x27;m on the fence.</li>
            <li> You will get a funny texture but it works wonders on flat hair. You wont have to tease any more</li>
            <li> this works for my thin hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to other products. would buy this product again, thanks Got2b</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on thin hair and its the best at making my hair look thick.  Believe me I have tried many products.  If you use too much it can get a little tacky feeling but otherwise its the best thing out there.  And its cheap !!</li>
            <li> i did not like this product. did not help my silky blond hair .... not worth it</li>
            <li> I use this when I run out of my bumble and bumble styling creme to add a little lift to my hair. I guess what I really need is texture more than anything. This does give some volume but for me, it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Buy it all the time. Keeps my hair nice and texturized</li>
            <li> Not bad. Good for a fast touch up</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product. My hair is thin and fine, a double whammy and so the reasons for my purchase of Got2b. It&#x27;s a very delicate powder that I apply directly to the scalp or you can apply it to the palm of your hand then to your hair. Lightly scrub it at root level and there you have it....VOLUME! I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. I really cant. I discovered it a year ago, and haven&#x27;t looked back. When I run out, I look like crap. I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, and you&#x27;d think they could put a little more in there- it&#x27;s like 1/10th full. there&#x27;s like maybe a tablespoon total in there, so you pay through the nose and run out quick, and it&#x27;s not cheap. I think maybe they make it out of gold, to justify the price. However, I&#x27;ll keep paying it. It also fights the oils in my scalp. I&#x27;m a greasy Italian! (:</li>
            <li> I do love this for a night out but not on a daily basis it leaves your hair a little too sticky but that might just be me I don&#x27;t know if I used too much but you definitely get a lot of volume</li>
            <li> I have thin/straight hair and this helps provide a little volume.</li>
            <li> This is great for my long fine hair. I initially got it because I was looking for an alternative to aerosol dry shampoo for a weekend trip--I needed something that I could take in a carry-on bag. Not only did it work in that respect, it helped me easily achieve a fancy hairstyle for the wedding I was attending because it did as promised and added a lot of volume to my hair. Also, I am a dark brunette and this left no visible white residue like some dry shampoos do. As some other reviewers have stated, it does make your hair feel sticky, even when you use just a little bit. This didn&#x27;t bother me but I could see where it would be a concern to some people if you also want a more natural texture with your products. What is most important to me is that it doesn&#x27;t *look* sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t brush my hair after application to distribute it (due to the sticky feeling) but I do work it through thoroughly with my fingers. Being able to quickly add volume to my hair with a product that also acts as a dry shampoo is great. I don&#x27;t use it frequently--only when I want to get fancied up for some reason or another (a formal event, a date night with my husband, etc.). Sometimes I wash it out shortly after, sometimes I don&#x27;t; either way, my hair has not suffered for use of this product. I&#x27;m very happy with it and wish I&#x27;d discovered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My thinning hair likes this product a lot.The instructions on how to use it, work and make a lot of sense, unlike&lt;br /&gt;a very similar product I have bought and paid much more for.Will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> It pretty much does what it says it would however I found it&#x27;s (temporary) stickiness a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only a dry shampoo, but it&#x27;s the best volumizing product I&#x27;ve found on the market. Very affordable and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  I do have very long fine hair, but I expected miracles I guess.  Maybe I&#x27;m not using enough.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair and this product is fantastic for creating dramatic volume at the roots. All other products I&#x27;ve tried (aerosol sprays, root lifting mousse, texturizing sprays) end up making my hair look sticky or oily at the roots, but this creates volume while still leaving my hair soft and manageable. I first tried this at a blow-dry salon and caught it in a few youtube product videos and could only find it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Fast shipping too</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin oily hair.  When I wash it in the mornings, it looks greasy and dirty within just a few hours, long before lunch. I usually have to wash it twice a day. I have tried many different products, sprays, gels, dry shampoos and mousses in failed attempts to fix the problem.    I saw this product while shopping yesterday and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since it seemed to be priced right. As soon as we left the store and got in the car I applied a small amount while my husband drove us on to our next errand. During the afternoon, I&#x27;d forgotten I&#x27;d applied the powder and out of habit, I threw my hair into a ponytail like I do after a while when my hair starts falling limp and lifeless. Then last night after a busy day of errands, and time with family, I removed the scrunchie, glanced in the mirror, and was surprised at how it looked.  Clean, full of body,and styled. It was such a shock.    I am now hooked.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for thin, fine hair, to get more volume!  A friend told me about it, so I thought I&#x27;d try it, and it just takes a tiny bit, rub it btwn your palms, and run fingers thru hair, and fluff!!  My hair is so thin - - this is one of the few products that gives me volume without weighing my hair down, or making it look greasy after a few hours.  LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;6 month update: Still love this!!!... Just buying my 3rd bottle. Will never do without this again!!! Just a slight dusting on your palm, rub together and fluff! Perfect for thin, fine hair!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! Best I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> Saw the product from one of the youtube gurus. Loved it, it is light, shows results very quickly. A small bottle easy to carry in the bag. Very pleased, am ordering more.</li>
            <li> So I too bought this at a local drugstore and wanted to go on here to see how much it was selling for (thanks to the amazon app \\&quot;snap a photo\\&quot; thing it took me to here).... first off, I bought it at Walgreens NOT on sale for 6.99...  which isn&#x27;t the point. I wanted to say this stuff is like MAGIC! i think there&#x27;s a whole movement of these \\&quot;magic powders\\&quot; and even brands like Prive &amp; Aveda have much more expensive versions of this kind of product. I haven&#x27;t tried those, but for 6.99 I think i&#x27;m hooked on this!  I just tried a teeny bit in my hands and applied to my \\&quot;bang\\&quot; area, which I like to twist back in a retro poof thing for updos.  It made it very full with a lot of holding power, and not necessarily matte but not shiny either. It&#x27;s hard to describe. But i love it... great for those of us who adore the retro bouffant styles! a must try.  I&#x27;m excited to try sprinkling it on my roots when my hair is about 80% dry, then flipping upside down and blowdrying. I think it will be MARVELOUS.  There was a \\&quot;tag\\&quot; on the box that you can snap a photo of and text in to the manufacturer, but after several tries it said it wasn&#x27;t currently available. i hope it someday is, because they claim to be able to share other tips, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair is fine, but coarse.  I am 100 per cent gray but my hair is professionally colored.  I have a weird cowlick or a spot in the back of my scalp where my hair separates.  I have always used hairspray to hold hair in place.  With Got2b I lift that section of hair up with my hands..sprinkle a little powder directly on the scalp/roots, then rub it in.  I continue to brush and style my hair and this product gives just enough lift and stay to keep the hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not suitable for all over use as it is a bit &#x27;tacky, sticky&#x27; feeling and creates sort of matting effect (which is good for lifting roots up off the scalp).  This has been a good replacement for hairspray.  And yes, 0.35 ounces is a small amount, but you don&#x27;t need much to make it work and mine has lasted for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the misunderstanding is with the earlier review, but this is not a dry shampoo. Its a volumizing powder. Which means u put it on, comb it through a bit to disperse, then tease (or back comb) your hair and this sh!t literally holds it without hairspray. I love it compared to teasing with hairspray which never holds right. I usually tease then use hairspray just over the top and my bangs to smooth any loose hairs. If u use alot it can be a pain to wash it out without tons of shampoo (I actually use wen and it works great even with a small amount and my hairs three or four inches past my shoulders) but for the results and as long as the bottle lasts its worth it. Also this stuff is 6-7$ at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I received a defective product or perhaps my hair texture is just not compatible with this product, but for me it was quite possibly one of the worst hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have long, fine, naturally wavy hair and this stuff made it sticky, stringy and greasy. I should have known when, as instructed, I sprinkled some in my hands and it just felt like a sticky mess.  Unfortunately, I went ahead and applied it anyway and was left feeling disgusting for the rest of the night.  If I had time to re-wash my hair, I would have.  Please consider testing this product on your hair prior to using for an important event, especially if you have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money on this item.  It was an extremely small size for the price and didn&#x27;t add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> This was a new product for me.  I tried it and love it for building volume and giving my hair that piecey look I love so much.</li>
            <li> Great great great!  Gives my hair texture and density which enables me to try so many different styles.</li>
            <li> I only used it once and it made my hair feel very coated, sticky and dry. Maybe I used too much. I will try it again and use less and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> I have thin straight fine blonde hair like many others (sigh). On a whim I decided to try this powder and I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. I keep my hair on the shorter side (chin to mid neck) because the longer it gets the thinner it looks. I have no idea what this powder is made out of but it must be fairy dust because it gives you an instant lift....an automatic fullness effect. For a powder it can get sticky but that&#x27;s part of the reason it works so well. It gives you the just out of salon look. I&#x27;ve been using it sparingly because every time I fall in love with a product, they discontinue it. Thank you Amazon for carrying it. You can also find it on ebay for a little cheaper once you factor in shipping on Amazon. For now so stock up! Follow the instructions &amp; you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last a long time on my hair...</li>
            <li> Great for adding body to your hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s ridiculously easy to apply and actually works.  I shake some on to my hands, rub them together, and massage into my roots.  Let me tell you, my hair is baby thin and long.  Once it&#x27;s in, I scrunch things around have a ton of lift.  I can repeat throughout the day if things are feeling flat or tired.  AND...one 0.35oz container has lasted almost an entire year.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just buying my second one and had to leave some positive feedback.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product. I really did. The look I got with it was alright. It made my scalp feel so icky and gunky that I couldn&#x27;t stand it! I do have fine hair, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite volumizing product.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but they just don&#x27;t work as well.  Yes, it gives your roots a slightly &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feel, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Walmart seems to have stopped carrying this in favor of a different brand, so I will continue to purchase this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have always hated my hair! Stick straight, fine, always flat! Even if i can get a curl to hang out for more than a few mins I can never get any lift!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical to try this product, then I got chosen to try it through Bzzagent! I got a bottle free and a few bottles for friends. WE LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;Just a little goes a long way and every time you fluff your hair it goes right back to super volume! If you have fine and flat hair you should really give it a try! You have very little to loose (a few bucks) and a LOT to gain! (awesome hair!)&lt;br /&gt;I am proud to be a Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a total product junkie and I can tell you that this really does work.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff when you want to foof your do.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of the product to get volume. It also absorbs oil, so I use it when traveling, when I want to skip washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I heard of this product from an online tutorial on how to do hair (Jaclyn Hill) ....thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s so affordable! I LOVE it!! I call it my &amp;#34;magical hair powder&amp;#34; and it works just as well as the ones that cost twice the amount.</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday was really surprised fast shipping! So i decided to try it on my hair,but I had my hair in a bun and haven&#x27;t wash it for 2 days lol so was flat from the top.Well as soon as I try this powder on my roots and only my crown area I tease a little bit ,I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!!!I l LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH I TRY EVERY HAIR SPRAY AND TEASING AND ALWAYS WENT BACK FLAT.IT WORKS REALLY GREAT A DAY AFTER U TAKE A SHOWER N POUR UR HAIR.IS PERFECT FOR THICK HAIR,AND FOR THIN HAIR U HAVE TO WORK ON IT TILL U GET THE STYLE U WANT BUT IT DOES WORK!IS PERFECT IF U HAVE LAYERS ON YOUR HAIR AND BEST PART IT DOES STAY ALL DAY LONG.IT MAKES UR HAIR STICKY WHERE YOU PUT IT AT BUT IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH U USE,AND A FEELING LIKE PASTE. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE IS WORTH IT.&lt;br /&gt;The pics are a day after I shower lol!</li>
            <li> My hair is always full of body at the bottom, and flat on top.  I have very thick, straight, hair.  This product worked great to give me body at top.  I have never teased my hair.  If you do tease your hair, you will never have to do it again with got2b!</li>
            <li> Good product, my daughter was in the play &amp;#34;Hairspray&amp;#34; with 1960&#x27;s teased undo styles.  She had six shows with nightly teased up hairdos, it worked really well.</li>
            <li> This hair product is one of the best for fine hair.  Holds hair in place and this got2b product does the same as the products that are twice the price!  Awesome and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of this.  It hides the flat spot at the back top of my head.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried any of the other dry root lifter brands, then just know that this one works just as good, &amp; there&#x27;s no need to spend the extra money on the expensive stuff. A little does go a long way for the average person, but I&#x27;m more then average...I like a lot, &amp; I like a big poof. I&#x27;d tried those &amp;#34;bump it&amp;#34; products, not a fan, they just look like you have something under your hair...not the look I&#x27;m going for. With this little powder, I just douse a bunch in my already dry hair, then bend over, &amp; blow dry some more. This way any excess powder will start going towards the ends of my hair, &amp; will be making it appear fuller too. So I set my blow dryer on cool, &amp; blow dry away. One thing to note is that this stuff is sort of like dried glue, or at least that&#x27;s what it makes me think of. So, it starts locking your hair together, &amp; makes it a bit hard to work through your hair if you use a lot. Now, if you&#x27;re like me, &amp; you like extra everything, then my advice is to slowly work your way up to using lots of this. Most people will probably use a little &amp;#34;sprinkle&amp;#34;, &amp; that&#x27;s probably all you&#x27;ll need, it&#x27;ll lift your hair off your scalp &amp; give you some body, that&#x27;s for sure. Now, another thing, when you go to wash this out of your hair, you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about when I say &amp;#34;dried/powder glue&amp;#34;, it&#x27;ll feel like your hair is dried unmovable glue...so get yourself a really good conditioner. I am pro-generic brands, I like to spend my money on lots of things, as opposed to a couple of expensive things. So, go to a beauty supply store, buy yourself a knock-off really good deep conditioner, you&#x27;ll need it when washing this out of your hair. Also, this bottle will last you a long long time. I think it does sort of irritate my scalp a bit...I broke out on my scalp, doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it was because of this product, but just wanted to warn you guys, there could be an allergen in this. Either way, I&#x27;ll probably keep buying this. Iused to use garnier nutrisse root lifter, which is still to this day one of my favorites. I still like both, for different reasons. Number one, garnier nutrisse root lifter has to be put in your hair while it&#x27;s still wet/damp, therefore, blow drying is necessary after washing your hair, if you have long hair, &amp; you want to let it air dry overnight (go to bed with wet hair, wake up with dry hair), then you won&#x27;t use garnier nutrisse, another thing about garnier nutrisse, it leaves your hair looking really soft &amp; shinny, &amp; the down side, if you leave it in your hair two days or more depending on how often you wash your hair, you&#x27;ll notice a flaky scalp. With this stuff, you can go to bed with wet hair, &amp; just put some of this in the next morning. If you use too much, your hair will look like you&#x27;ve got white powder in it...anyway, I like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product but it didn&#x27;t work out. The bottle and packaging are nice. It comes in a small purple tube container about 3 and a half inches long. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the counter.  It is a powdery substance and not a cream, foam or a spray which makes it different than other products I have used. It has a nice neutral scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions tell you to shake a small amount on your hands and rub your hands together. The powder disappears but you can still feel it on your hands. You then rub your hands onto your hair focusing on the roots. I found this ineffective in creating volume in my hair and felt that more stayed on my hands than I could get onto the roots of my hair. Also the residue on my hands did not feel like it was gone even after washing my hands several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under tips it says you can shake directly onto the roots of your hair and work in with your fingers for extra volume. I tried this and ended up with my hair being a big sticky mess. Granted it did add volume to my hair in a way that hairspray and teasing would have, which was not the look I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is about three inches past my shoulders so it might have not worked well because of the length.  I think if you have shorter hair this might do a great job of creating super volume in your hair.</li>
            <li> it gives some puffiness but it makes the hair sticky little bit.&lt;br /&gt;in general its good and I&#x27;m still using it</li>
            <li> Just the very tiniest of powder goes a very, very long way.  My hair is super fragile and fine so I don&#x27;t like to back-brush it nor do I want flat hair.  So just the faintest sprinkle on the crown of my head and well rubbed in, it gives the appearance of much fuller hair.  I was using Big Sexy Hair and it was 3x&#x27;s more expensive with the exact same result.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair that&#x27;s hard to get volume with, try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I have really short, fine, thin hair.  This product really helps to add a little volume so I can style it (of course I use four other products in conjunction with it!)  I just use a tiny bit.  If I use too much, it makes my hair look dull.  I do like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have the finest hair, but I like growing it long and teasing it to add in extensions. This stuff works better than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used, plus it doesn&#x27;t instantly set and get all sticky like hairspray. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product. This gives you volume like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used, and you only need a dash of powder to get instant volume. A little will go a long way with this product!</li>
            <li> Came super fast and I love the idea of volumizing powder compared to hairspray.I love it and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> not a favorite at all.  To sticky and leaves your hair very stiff.  Not something I would recommend if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair sticky, felt thick, greasy no matter how much or little was used. Does not do what it states. Have used got2b products before but this one is horrid.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to figure out the best application technique, but it does what it says.  I would say that it would probably work better if my hair were a bit shorter, so if you have longer hair just be aware you won&#x27;t get quite the volume.</li>
            <li> I always use it! Great product. Strongly recommended. It cheap and makes your hair looks great. Strongly recommended for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a few years for a replacement for a discontinued got2be product (a hair putty). I accidentally came across this product in a store and figured I might as well try it. I am SO glad I did. It creates a lot of texture, just like the hair putty did - it feels like it dries out my hair a little bit (you know the feeling your hair has after you swim in salt water - kind of stiff), which was EXACTLY what I was looking for. It&#x27;s perfect. I went out the next day and bought 2 more bottles - it&#x27;s a perfect travel size and everyday size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It might be just my hair but it is poor quality it leaves a very oily residue:( And is rough on your hands when you put it in your hair, who knows what kinda of chemicals are in this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, and am always looking to get an extra oomph. Unfortunately, I am also crazy bad at doing anything with my hair (besides rocking a ponytail!) and I have yet to master that little poof in the back. No, not Snooki-style, but just an added oomph of fullness. A girlfriend (and wizard when it comes to styling hair) accepted the challenge of giving my hair volume one night, and she brought along a little magical friend - got2b Powder&#x27;ful Volumizing Styling Powder. She sprinkled a bit by my scalp and voila! The poof was found and stayed all night. I was so excited I went out and bought me some the very next day. It&#x27;s easy to use, just a little sprinkle here and there, and adds instant fullness to my hair. I don&#x27;t always tease my hair when I use it, sometimes I just fluff it a bit with my fingers and get a good result. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is it makes my hair feel almost tacky - I can definitely tell where the powder is and like to get it washed out right away the next day. But other than that little downside, I really like this product and recommend if you are looking for volumizing help!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I had high hopes for this product.  I have thick hair, but the strands are fine.  My straight hair typically loses volume shortly after it&#x27;s been done.  I followed the instructions for \\&quot;extra volume\\&quot; (if anyone needs it, I do) and sprinkled the powder directly on my roots.  It disappeared as claimed, but it fused together the hair that it&#x27;d disappeared into in the process!  No stranger to dry shampoo, I persevered, separating sections of my hair and sprinkling a bit of this product at the roots of each sectioned.  My hope was that after rubbing the product in thoroughly, a more even distribution would lessen the bonds holding clumps together.  No such luck.  After that, the first two inches of hair all over my head was not only stiff and clumpy, but looked greasy as well.  Never one to give up easily (did I mention how fine and flat my hair is?), I tried alternately brushing and teasing my roots.  Two different brushes and a fine toothed comb later, my roots looked dirty, but a lot less greasy.  Plus, I couldn&#x27;t run my hands through the rest of my hair.  To be fair, it had more volume.  Unfortunately, it looked and felt gross.</li>
            <li> good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Does not do what is advertised.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product over and over again. It adds major volume with out making my hair stiff or sticky. I takes practice to know how much product to use because over doing it will make your hair a flat gross mess. Just for reference I have moderately thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I bought it in London last year after my daughter recommended it highly to me.  The price is incredible and is such a much better value than any of the other similar products found here in the states.  Most other brands have similar size containers, but the product amount inside of them is next to nothing...in fact, I had to shake it to see if there really was any inside..and they wanted around $14-18 for the minuscule amount of product.  Got2b offers much more product for a mere fraction of the cost.  If you have fine hair, you&#x27;ll use a very small amount on your hand and massage it through your hair.  The increased volume will absolutely blow you away!  If you&#x27;re styling an updo for a special event, you&#x27;ll be amazed at how well this helps hold the style..remember the days when you had to wash your hair the day before so the hair would be slightly dirty and tacky so the pins would stay in?  With this product, you can style with freshly cleaned hair and you don&#x27;t get dullness from the product either.</li>
            <li> After using Lanza for some time I decided to give this one a try.  It is very similar to the Lanza product and adds texture &amp; body to fine hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff changed my hair lifestyle. Love love love this</li>
            <li> DOES FEEL DIRTY,BUT, IT WORKS</li>
            <li> This powder really works. My hair stylist recommended it to me and it is amazing! Gives my hair that extra oomph!!</li>
            <li> Customer Service was excellent and product arrived well before scheduled.  Would recommend this distributor again and have no complaints at this time.</li>
            <li> The powder works okay, but it does seem to hold long. I think it would be great for shorter hair</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE Got 2B dry shampoo-- best one on the market. So I had high expectations going into this Got 2B product. My hair is straight and fine and I&#x27;m a busy mom, so any quick extra volume is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I tried both methods as described on the box-- I shook the powder onto my roots and I also did the put the powder on your hands, then onto the roots,  one on each side of my scalp. But that&#x27;s where things went downhill.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to rub the powder in, but it immediately stiffened my hair up. Which, volume was nice, but it came at a price-- I couldn&#x27;t rub the product in because my hair was so stiff it couldn&#x27;t move and it hurt to try (it pulled at my roots). It was like a very strong, stiff hair spray, but I didn&#x27;t have a chance to style it because it stuck before I could.&lt;br /&gt;And because I couldn&#x27;t rub in the powder, it left white patches on my scalp. And it couldn&#x27;t be brushed out-- the brush literally got stuck in my hair. It also took several shampoos to get it all washed out.&lt;br /&gt;So, as it stands, I would not recommend this product. I did get to try this product for free as part of a BzzAgent campaign,  so at least I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it.</li>
            <li> This is a very interesting product. I do like it, but I feel that someone with shorter hair would benefit greatly. This white powder blends perfectly into my brown hair, which is amazing. I have naturally curly hair and I try not to wash it every day, so on the days in between, I thought this product could add some more life to it. It does, but after a while my slightly longer than shoulder length, weighs it down. When I blow dry my hair straight, and use this for lift, it works better, but it isn&#x27;t last all day amazing. I will continue to use it, but I am not 110% sure I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like teasing my hair, I just discovered this and love it! and it stays like that all day!</li>
            <li> Love this product, it gives me volume that lasts :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this to help my hair after a lot of thinning from breast-feeding.  The only thing it does is make my hair sticky.  I did not notice any improvement in volume.  I&#x27;m really dissapointed!</li>
            <li> very messy, let my hair stiff and mate. I think I used too much amount though. I will try it again using less, if it feels better I will change this review.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I have long wavy hair that I like to flat-iron. However, I don&#x27;t like the dated, totally-flat-on-your-head look that flat-ironing can give. I put dabs of this powder on my fingertips and work it into the roots of my hair along the crown. And just like that, I have just enough volume and lift and texture to modernize the flat-iron look. However, this magic powder will give you a ton more volume that lasts all day if that is what you want. Just make sure to work it inside your hair. You have to lift up sections of your hair and get to the roots underneath. It won&#x27;t work if you put it on top of your hair.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say, to the person \\&quot;concerned\\&quot; about chemicals in their products - there is an ingredient label, so there&#x27;s no real mystery...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I change hair colors and styles way, way more often than the average person and am constantly tinkering around with new products to see what I can come up with. I know how to treat my hair, what works and what doesn&#x27;t, etc etc~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this at the store one day and just sort of figured, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot; I have incredibly thick, kinky-curly hair, so my hair has plenty of volume on its own; however, I have my hair style into an undercut and wear most of my hair off to one side of my head, so I aim for massive volume, wild curls, untamed, as 80s as it can be. Normally, I&#x27;d spray volume spray or hairspray directly onto my roots and blowdry, in order to get my roots to pop and REALLY bring out a volume, but my blow dryer&#x27;s been busted, and I hate drying my hair that way, anyway. So, after that, I just styled it a certain way to dry, added my usual product, used got2b hairspray at my roots for some teasing... naturally, the volumizing powder seemed much more appealing and less messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an awesome product. It does exactly what it says and it&#x27;s light and compact enough to carry around if I ever needed it. The label says BLATANTLY that it adds TEXTURE and it does... it&#x27;s a rough, gritty texture, so don&#x27;t expect to drag a comb through it. It&#x27;s like hair spray in a powder, if you ever tried the trick I mentioned before. Unlike hairspray, though, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look unnecessarily shiny, nor does it make it feel like a rock. I sprinkle this stuff directly to my roots instead of on my hands, and after some rubbing and fluffing, my hair&#x27;s done! It&#x27;s pliable, as well, so I can sort of re-fluff/mold/mush as I please throughout the day, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my undercut flop falling flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone else said, this is NOT a sample size... a little bit of this stuff can go a very long way, and you do NOT need to coat your entire head! I recommend this all the time, and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it as long as they sell it, I&#x27;ve yet to come by a bad product by this brand.tle bit of this stuff can go a very long way, and you do NOT need to coat your entire head!

            <li> Okay, it seems to me you are either going to really like this product or really hate it &amp; I am in the latter. I have super fine &amp; thin hair. Due to good reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it. Well, if I could give it 0 stars I would (it&#x27;s in the trash now) that about says it all. Thought @ 1st I was using to much..cut it down to a few sprinkles..tried it a few ways..HORRIFIC! No matter what it made my hair SO greasy, weighed down, dried out, crunchy (think \\&quot;Aquanet\\&quot; or as some of us hair stylists call it \\&quot;Cheeto hair\\&quot;). Give er&#x27; a try if you want as some people seem to really like it &amp; it is cheap enough now but I am just expressing my personal opinion. Only thing I can say is what really does work for me which I will be sticking with: [[ASIN:B0033ROOS6 Redken Body Full Instant Bodifier Volumizing Foam, for Baby Fine Hair, 5-ounce]]or this: [[ASIN:B008E9KBZ8 Redken Quick Tease 15 Backcombing Finishing Spray (5.3 oz.)]]. Also, this got2b product is very hard to wash out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I used it and the stuff wouldnt wash out of my hair. It makes my hair look greasy and leaves a waxy texture to it...Ive been to the salon and had 5 treatments done, YES 5!!! and it still hasnt all come out. So on something ive spent $5 on its cost me $30 to remove from my hair...I have an appointment today to try and get the rest out...Save yourself the money and misery.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much, but when I did, it did add volume.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have really fine, flat hair. So I was super excited to find a product like this. Who wouldn&#x27;t love to add volume to their hair in just ten seconds? Unfortunately, that was not the case with g&amp;ouml;t2b powderful. I applied the product to my hair using both of the recommended ways on several different days, and the results remained the same. There was no noticeable difference in my hair after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of my bzzcampaign also included free samples to share with friends, so I picked my sister-in-law (who has curly hair) and another friend with the same type of hair as I have. They both tried it, and like me, had no noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that this product ranges in price from $3.99 up to $8.97, I&#x27;m so glad I got it for free. I would have been annoyed had I spent the money on a product that didn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Would Recommend: NO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I received a full sized sample of g&amp;ouml;t2b powderful from bzzagent.com in exchange for my honest review. This has not reflected on my review in any way.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, heavy hair that tends towards a &#x27;Yoko Ono&#x27; stick-to-your-skull look (no offense to Yoko!).  Getting volume has always been a huge challenge- not anymore!  Every time I use it, people comment on how great my hair looks.  It&#x27;s controllable, I can keep my hair out of my face, and it gives me great volume!  Cannot say enough good things:)</li>
            <li> Seriously, it gets no better than this stuff. I love this powder. It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
