            <li>I&#x27;m glad to hear that others had good luck with customer service; I did not.</li>

            <li>Nice slim handle.</li>
            <li>It no longer brushes my son&#x27;s teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li>The travel case is nice to have for trips.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it came with the BreathRx mouthwash.</li>

            <li>That this particular Sonicare system was the best.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly and happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months now, and so far it&#x27;s been perfect.</li>

            <li>Much better design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more bells and whistles on my Sonicare</li>
            <li>love the travel pouch too.</li>
            <li>I love how my teeth feel after using these brushes,</li>
            <li>I like the handle on the FlexCare better, this one is slipperier.</li>
            <li>On the upside, Phillips extended the warranty by 6 months for registering online.anty expires as many report.</li>
            <li>It took some time to get used to the noise and vibration while brushing, but once I did, I was glad to have it.  </li>
            <li>We especially love the timer function, which lets you know when to move to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li>The brush body also has a better feel to it.</li>
            <li>You really feel like you did a great job after you are done brushing.  </li>
            <li>i dont feel that i am enjoying it .</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it beeps every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will learn to control it better after I have used it a while.</li>
            <li>A lot better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Philips cleans as well (or better) than the Braun and is easier on gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;can use any heads, also snapon-&lt;br /&gt;  DiamondClean - too many features</li>
            <li>many features</li>
            <li>plus) - too many features you dont</li>
            <li>DiamondClean - too many features you dont need.   </li>
            <li>many features you dont need.   </li>
            <li>(plus) - too many features you dont need.   </li>
            <li>My dentist says my teeth and gums are extremely healthy.</li>
            <li>I Love the toothbrush, but I don&#x27;t think it needed to come with a carrying case.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love the timer on this thing (2 minutes) and the fact that they have a brushing your teeth system.</li>
            <li>Love it, I like the head that comes with kit than one pictured with brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be bringing it with me on travel from this point forward, for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be bringing it with me on travel from this point forward, for sure.</li>
            <li>I like that more than what I was using</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth is actually more enjoyable and they have felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>Gets her teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>,  I would love to find one that was easier to keep clean, but don&#x27;t want to spend more money.  </li>
            <li>It is also a lot more slender and light weight, but part of me does miss the heavier feel of the essence.</li>
            <li>Best money ever spent!</li>
            <li>This is a well made product, easy to use because it prompts you when to continue to another area.</li>
            <li>easy interface: 1 button to turn it on or off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good toothbrush and keeps you honest with its 30 second timer, but...</li>
            <li>I heard you can buy the more advanced toothbrush heads (from the Diamond Clean series?)</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the manual (quick and easy read).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smooth like when I leave the dentist office after my semi-annual cleaning.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll fit on the handle, can anyone confirm?</li>
            <li>Slim, easy to use and clean, charges overnight or while I&#x27;m at school.</li>
            <li>Head and body wasn&#x27;t well fit</li>
            <li>The part that goes in your mouth, however is easy to keep  clean with rinsing, so it is not something limiting usefulness.</li>
            <li>I just upgraded to the easy clean sonicare brush after going form oral-b 10 dollar tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Featuring a contoured bristle profile to fit the shape of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, feel free to ask me questions about the EasyClean***models available on market after doing some research:  </li>
            <li>Also, feel free to ask me questions about the EasyClean</li>
            <li>Cheap sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liked it so much I bought one for my girlfriend (not trying to drop any hints you know</li>
            <li>I wish it had a better way to know how much charge was in the battery, so that I could charge it up more, without over charging it.</li>
            <li>I like the toothbrush very much but the brush head is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare toothbrush and I love it.</li>
            <li>Battery holds a charge for a long time, which is great as I don&#x27;t have counter space to keep the charger plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li>Although I love this toothbrush I didn&#x27;t love it at first, when I first used this toothbrush</li>
            <li>, I got used to the feeling within a week, and have been using this toothbrush for 4 months and love it so much now!</li>
            <li>It is worth the buy!</li>
            <li>The level of clean is just unparalleled.</li>
            <li>I keep that in mind and take the head off often to quickly clean it.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel so clean (I got one for myself, too).  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean after every brush.</li>
            <li>some reason the handle doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it should</li>
            <li>True clean feeling after using.</li>
            <li>However, my dentist recently recommend that I replace my Oral B with a Sonicare during too the highly superior cleaning ability.</li>
            <li>I think it really does a much better job at brushing my teeth than I did manually.  </li>
            <li>good basic toothbrush......</li>
            <li>The whose sonicare line over the basic has been good.</li>
            <li>About 15 years ago my parents got the earlier model for me and my sister and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Since it works with overseas power, it&#x27;s actually a good idea to bring it with you rather than using a basic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean under the head before applying the new one.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and my mouth fresh.  </li>
            <li>* heads have to be replaced quick, but you are getting a powerful unit that can clean at 31,000 stoke per min.</li>
            <li>I rarely used the UV sanitizer or any of the special features, so decided to replace the one that died with a simpler model.</li>
            <li>I finally upgraded to this after a decade with an older, electric toothbrush and this is great - lightweight, great brush, quiet and fast.</li>
            <li>cleans much better than manual brushing and is much more pleasent to at least the ears than the oral b brush i used to own.</li>
            <li>this model seems to be the most sensible buy unless you can&#x27;t live without all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;EasyClean&amp;#34; is a great name for it.&lt;br /&gt;-Literally one green LED for feedback, which is used to indicate all status to the user.  </li>
            <li>i prefer the old school type :)</li>
            <li>The battery lasts several weeks which is nice and the toothbrush is lightweight.</li>
            <li>It does seem to do a good job of cleaning my teeth and is much easier to clean than my other Sonicare toothbrushes have been (gunk buillt up in those even when I took them apart and rinsed every time after brusthing).</li>
            <li>The small base/charger is great for travel.</li>
            <li>So years later I finally bought my own and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my older original Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>There are more expensive Sonicare models which have more settings and may be a little thinner or lighter, but this brush suits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be using it until it dies (the last one I had died suddenly, which wasn&#x27;t very nice).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be using it until it dies (the last one I had died suddenly, which wasn&#x27;t very nice).</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel smooth and clean like no regular toothbrush has ever done.</li>
            <li>This model is lighter and thinner and sealed tight so it is very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth way better than regular brushing.</li>
            <li>Price varies too much!</li>
            <li>It does in front, but I spend more time and effort on the back side of my teeth.       </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says next month 8-)</li>
            <li>At first it kinda &amp;#34;tickled&amp;#34; my mouth i guess you can say</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>, you do 30 second of your front side of you top teeth, 30 seconds of the inside side of your top teeth (and the same for the bottom).</li>
            <li>My only concern is whether I will ever be able to get used to the tickling sensation when it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast too!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;-Motor seems as good as more expensive models.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just as good if not better than the Diamond care toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This design still needs to be degunked regularly but it is easy to do with no resevoirs for accumulation.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.  Very loud and sounds like I&#x27;m flying a remote control plane.</li>
            <li>a nice little bag you can use while traveling.  </li>
            <li>WOW, this is a HUGE improvement, I don&#x27;t even know what to say, holy wow.</li>
            <li>Vibrates your fave to much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much slimmer and lighter, and as others have pointed out there&#x27;s  no crevices for gunk to build up.</li>
            <li>The only drawback to the Proresults head is the pronounced curves meant to fit around the tooth surface.</li>
            <li>I almost purchased the Healthywhite as its price was greatly reduced, but I&#x27;d read many negative reviews about its  longevity,  and the whitening mode seemed gimmicky.</li>
            <li>The timer buzzer is very helpful and it feels like it&#x27;s really getting my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;-Toothbrush</li>
            <li>The tongue scraper works very well too.</li>
            <li>It does have a quad timer than bumps every 30 seconds, I dont think this feature is worth the extra cost than the essence toothbrush, but the cleanliness of this brush definitely is worth</li>
            <li>I still use it, but the main section appears to have gotten loose and makes a lot more noise than before.</li>
            <li>Life seems as good as more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;-Simple to use!</li>
            <li>/&gt;  SimplyClean - $8 - A model similar to the original ProResults</li>
            <li>My mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this clean since my last visit to the dentist!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what was on my old Essence model, and it was very gentle on my teeth and receding gums.      </li>
            <li>Love philips sonicare brushes, this one is a slimmed down version as far as options, but it works as good if not better than the versions with all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>I paid the extra for this model to get the lithium battery and the new style (cheap) brush heads.</li>
            <li>I found it easiest to first brush the front of all my left teeth, the front of all my right teeth, the back of all my bottom teeth, and then the back of all my top teeth.</li>
            <li>Works so much better than my previous generation of Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It finally died after 10 years of loyal service.</li>
            <li>Does not have the messiness (inside) concern that the older models had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had multiple Sonicare and they have more power than the Braun or Dazzlepro models (although Dazzlepro is close) and makes the regular cleanings at the dentist go faster.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush-</li>
            <li>Love the snap-on little brush heads.</li>
            <li>Most online reviews show little to no difference in the whitening ability when compared to the Easyclean.</li>
            <li>the usual push-on sonicare heads, including the new Diamond Clean ones, which are supposedly better.&lt;br /&gt;-Usual contactless charger, should work with most any recent sonicare model.</li>
            <li>PowerUp - very low model,  for kids, not as powerful  Thank you for taking time to read my thoughts</li>
            <li>Worked fine for about four months and then started to be loose and make a loud noise.</li>
            <li>but my older version was looking pretty gross.  </li>
            <li>I had so far only used the cheap Oral-B electric toothbrush, what was already a big improvement, but still all I knew for 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little padded and easy to just throw my brush, toothpaste, mouthwash and floss in the bag for trips.</li>
            <li>Totally not worth the extra $100 to use four more settings you&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare toothbrush but the heads seem to wear out quickly and are expensive to replace.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are much cleaner after using this compared to my old standard brush.</li>
            <li>My suggestion for those who need a sensitive option is to use the Easyclean with the optional Sonicare sensitive brush head.</li>
            <li>This model is replacing my old Philips Sonicare HX6510 Essence which would accumulate filth under the brush head.</li>
            <li>Bought it to replace my old Sonicare that lasted 10 years.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth fleeing far cleaner than manually brushing.</li>
            <li>I old version of this brush lasted four years.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last much longer than 3 years, though.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a less expensive Oral B electric toothbrush for a couple of years now and have been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>And the sensitive mode on the Healthywhite is powered down and less effective.</li>
            <li>Seems to clean teeth very well, even in hard to reach locations.</li>
            <li>It functions the same as my older one</li>
            <li>High quality and this kit came with extras for the same price as the brush alone (when I bought it).</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>The package with the mouthwash and bag and extra head was CHEAPER than the normal one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the sensitive Essence brush heads, but the standard Proresults doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive gums and teeth</li>
            <li>I love to try the expensive models, but dont really need those features.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HealthyWhite - does same thing as Easyclean, really it looks the same, sibling has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HealthyWhite - does same thing as Easyclean, really it looks the same, sibling has it.  </li>
            <li>Even though pricey, my boyfriend and I use the same base (but we each have our own heads--mine is the standard one and his is the gum healthy one</li>
            <li>I had an old Sonicare model that used the &amp;#34;screw-on&amp;#34; type brush heads and was extremely hard to clean.</li>
            <li>e-Series brush heads can only be used with older style Sonicares, such as the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A regular old manual toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t feel like it does the job.</li>
            <li>recent Sonicare toothbrushes use a sealed design with near zero maintenance.  </li>
            <li>, it was my first time using an electric toothbrush, and so it felt really odd on my teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;here are break down of other models available on market after doing some research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(My dentist sells the higher end  models but admits they offer little if any benefit over this or even the Essence.)</li>
            <li>Lets just hope it doesn&#x27;t go bad right after the warranty expires as many report.</li>
            <li>It worked as well or better than my Sonicare tooth brush, and according to my wife it is quieter and less irritating than the older brush.</li>
            <li>The mouth wash is nothing to get excited over and the tongue cleaner is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I started a live chat, asked a couple questions, and then had my chat closed by the agent with no response.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush comes with 2 heads, a regular and a diamond one, so, for those of you, like me, that bought this along with extra diamond clean heads, there&#x27;s no need to do so, at least for 3 months or so.</li>

            <li> Nice slim handle.</li>
            <li> It no longer brushes my son&#x27;s teeth effectively.  </li>

            <li> Received it quickly and happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months now, and so far it&#x27;s been perfect.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had more bells and whistles on my Sonicare</li>
            <li> love the travel pouch too.</li>
            <li> I love how my teeth feel after using these brushes,</li>
            <li> I like the handle on the FlexCare better, this one is slipperier.</li>
            <li> On the upside, Phillips extended the warranty by 6 months for registering online.anty expires as many report.</li>
            <li> It took some time to get used to the noise and vibration while brushing, but once I did, I was glad to have it.  </li>
            <li> We especially love the timer function, which lets you know when to move to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li> The brush body also has a better feel to it.</li>
            <li> You really feel like you did a great job after you are done brushing.  </li>
            <li> i dont feel that i am enjoying it .</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it beeps every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will learn to control it better after I have used it a while.</li>
            <li> A lot better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Philips cleans as well (or better) than the Braun and is easier on gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;can use any heads, also snapon-&lt;br /&gt;  DiamondClean - too many features</li>
            <li> many features</li>
            <li> plus) - too many features you dont</li>
            <li> DiamondClean - too many features you dont need.   </li>
            <li> many features you dont need.   </li>
            <li> (plus) - too many features you dont need.   </li>
            <li> My dentist says my teeth and gums are extremely healthy.</li>
            <li> I Love the toothbrush, but I don&#x27;t think it needed to come with a carrying case.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love the timer on this thing (2 minutes) and the fact that they have a brushing your teeth system.</li>
            <li> Love it, I like the head that comes with kit than one pictured with brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be bringing it with me on travel from this point forward, for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be bringing it with me on travel from this point forward, for sure.</li>
            <li> I like that more than what I was using</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth is actually more enjoyable and they have felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> Gets her teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> ,  I would love to find one that was easier to keep clean, but don&#x27;t want to spend more money.  </li>
            <li> It is also a lot more slender and light weight, but part of me does miss the heavier feel of the essence.</li>
            <li> Best money ever spent!</li>
            <li> This is a well made product, easy to use because it prompts you when to continue to another area.</li>
            <li> easy interface: 1 button to turn it on or off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good toothbrush and keeps you honest with its 30 second timer, but...</li>
            <li> I heard you can buy the more advanced toothbrush heads (from the Diamond Clean series?)</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the manual (quick and easy read).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smooth like when I leave the dentist office after my semi-annual cleaning.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll fit on the handle, can anyone confirm?</li>
            <li> Slim, easy to use and clean, charges overnight or while I&#x27;m at school.</li>
            <li> Head and body wasn&#x27;t well fit</li>
            <li> The part that goes in your mouth, however is easy to keep  clean with rinsing, so it is not something limiting usefulness.</li>
            <li> I just upgraded to the easy clean sonicare brush after going form oral-b 10 dollar tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Featuring a contoured bristle profile to fit the shape of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, feel free to ask me questions about the EasyClean***models available on market after doing some research:  </li>
            <li> Also, feel free to ask me questions about the EasyClean</li>
            <li> Cheap sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Liked it so much I bought one for my girlfriend (not trying to drop any hints you know</li>
            <li> I wish it had a better way to know how much charge was in the battery, so that I could charge it up more, without over charging it.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush very much but the brush head is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare toothbrush and I love it.</li>
            <li> Battery holds a charge for a long time, which is great as I don&#x27;t have counter space to keep the charger plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li> Although I love this toothbrush I didn&#x27;t love it at first, when I first used this toothbrush</li>
            <li> , I got used to the feeling within a week, and have been using this toothbrush for 4 months and love it so much now!</li>
            <li> It is worth the buy!</li>
            <li> The level of clean is just unparalleled.</li>
            <li> I keep that in mind and take the head off often to quickly clean it.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel so clean (I got one for myself, too).  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean after every brush.</li>
            <li> some reason the handle doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it should</li>
            <li> True clean feeling after using.</li>
            <li> However, my dentist recently recommend that I replace my Oral B with a Sonicare during too the highly superior cleaning ability.</li>
            <li> I think it really does a much better job at brushing my teeth than I did manually.  </li>
            <li> good basic toothbrush......</li>
            <li> The whose sonicare line over the basic has been good.</li>
            <li> About 15 years ago my parents got the earlier model for me and my sister and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Since it works with overseas power, it&#x27;s actually a good idea to bring it with you rather than using a basic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to clean under the head before applying the new one.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and my mouth fresh.  </li>
            <li> * heads have to be replaced quick, but you are getting a powerful unit that can clean at 31,000 stoke per min.</li>
            <li> I rarely used the UV sanitizer or any of the special features, so decided to replace the one that died with a simpler model.</li>
            <li> I finally upgraded to this after a decade with an older, electric toothbrush and this is great - lightweight, great brush, quiet and fast.</li>
            <li> cleans much better than manual brushing and is much more pleasent to at least the ears than the oral b brush i used to own.</li>
            <li> this model seems to be the most sensible buy unless you can&#x27;t live without all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;EasyClean&amp;#34; is a great name for it.&lt;br /&gt;-Literally one green LED for feedback, which is used to indicate all status to the user.  </li>
            <li> i prefer the old school type :)</li>
            <li> The battery lasts several weeks which is nice and the toothbrush is lightweight.</li>
            <li> It does seem to do a good job of cleaning my teeth and is much easier to clean than my other Sonicare toothbrushes have been (gunk buillt up in those even when I took them apart and rinsed every time after brusthing).</li>
            <li> The small base/charger is great for travel.</li>
            <li> So years later I finally bought my own and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my older original Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> There are more expensive Sonicare models which have more settings and may be a little thinner or lighter, but this brush suits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using it until it dies (the last one I had died suddenly, which wasn&#x27;t very nice).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using it until it dies (the last one I had died suddenly, which wasn&#x27;t very nice).</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel smooth and clean like no regular toothbrush has ever done.</li>
            <li> This model is lighter and thinner and sealed tight so it is very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth way better than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> Price varies too much!</li>
            <li> It does in front, but I spend more time and effort on the back side of my teeth.       </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says next month 8-)</li>
            <li> At first it kinda &amp;#34;tickled&amp;#34; my mouth i guess you can say</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> , you do 30 second of your front side of you top teeth, 30 seconds of the inside side of your top teeth (and the same for the bottom).</li>
            <li> My only concern is whether I will ever be able to get used to the tickling sensation when it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast too!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;-Motor seems as good as more expensive models.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just as good if not better than the Diamond care toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This design still needs to be degunked regularly but it is easy to do with no resevoirs for accumulation.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.  Very loud and sounds like I&#x27;m flying a remote control plane.</li>
            <li> a nice little bag you can use while traveling.  </li>
            <li> WOW, this is a HUGE improvement, I don&#x27;t even know what to say, holy wow.</li>
            <li> Vibrates your fave to much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much slimmer and lighter, and as others have pointed out there&#x27;s  no crevices for gunk to build up.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to the Proresults head is the pronounced curves meant to fit around the tooth surface.</li>
            <li> I almost purchased the Healthywhite as its price was greatly reduced, but I&#x27;d read many negative reviews about its  longevity,  and the whitening mode seemed gimmicky.</li>
            <li> The timer buzzer is very helpful and it feels like it&#x27;s really getting my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;-Toothbrush</li>
            <li> The tongue scraper works very well too.</li>
            <li> It does have a quad timer than bumps every 30 seconds, I dont think this feature is worth the extra cost than the essence toothbrush, but the cleanliness of this brush definitely is worth</li>
            <li> I still use it, but the main section appears to have gotten loose and makes a lot more noise than before.</li>
            <li> Life seems as good as more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;-Simple to use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;  SimplyClean - $8 - A model similar to the original ProResults</li>
            <li> My mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this clean since my last visit to the dentist!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what was on my old Essence model, and it was very gentle on my teeth and receding gums.      </li>
            <li> Love philips sonicare brushes, this one is a slimmed down version as far as options, but it works as good if not better than the versions with all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I paid the extra for this model to get the lithium battery and the new style (cheap) brush heads.</li>
            <li> I found it easiest to first brush the front of all my left teeth, the front of all my right teeth, the back of all my bottom teeth, and then the back of all my top teeth.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than my previous generation of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It finally died after 10 years of loyal service.</li>
            <li> Does not have the messiness (inside) concern that the older models had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple Sonicare and they have more power than the Braun or Dazzlepro models (although Dazzlepro is close) and makes the regular cleanings at the dentist go faster.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush-</li>
            <li> Love the snap-on little brush heads.</li>
            <li> Most online reviews show little to no difference in the whitening ability when compared to the Easyclean.</li>
            <li> the usual push-on sonicare heads, including the new Diamond Clean ones, which are supposedly better.&lt;br /&gt;-Usual contactless charger, should work with most any recent sonicare model.</li>
            <li> PowerUp - very low model,  for kids, not as powerful  Thank you for taking time to read my thoughts</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about four months and then started to be loose and make a loud noise.</li>
            <li> but my older version was looking pretty gross.  </li>
            <li> I had so far only used the cheap Oral-B electric toothbrush, what was already a big improvement, but still all I knew for 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little padded and easy to just throw my brush, toothpaste, mouthwash and floss in the bag for trips.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth the extra $100 to use four more settings you&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush but the heads seem to wear out quickly and are expensive to replace.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are much cleaner after using this compared to my old standard brush.</li>
            <li> My suggestion for those who need a sensitive option is to use the Easyclean with the optional Sonicare sensitive brush head.</li>
            <li> This model is replacing my old Philips Sonicare HX6510 Essence which would accumulate filth under the brush head.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace my old Sonicare that lasted 10 years.</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth fleeing far cleaner than manually brushing.</li>
            <li> I old version of this brush lasted four years.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last much longer than 3 years, though.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a less expensive Oral B electric toothbrush for a couple of years now and have been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> And the sensitive mode on the Healthywhite is powered down and less effective.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean teeth very well, even in hard to reach locations.</li>
            <li> It functions the same as my older one</li>
            <li> High quality and this kit came with extras for the same price as the brush alone (when I bought it).</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> The package with the mouthwash and bag and extra head was CHEAPER than the normal one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the sensitive Essence brush heads, but the standard Proresults doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive gums and teeth</li>
            <li> I love to try the expensive models, but dont really need those features.&lt;br</li>
            <li> HealthyWhite - does same thing as Easyclean, really it looks the same, sibling has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HealthyWhite - does same thing as Easyclean, really it looks the same, sibling has it.  </li>
            <li> Even though pricey, my boyfriend and I use the same base (but we each have our own heads--mine is the standard one and his is the gum healthy one</li>
            <li> I had an old Sonicare model that used the &amp;#34;screw-on&amp;#34; type brush heads and was extremely hard to clean.</li>
            <li> e-Series brush heads can only be used with older style Sonicares, such as the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A regular old manual toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t feel like it does the job.</li>
            <li> recent Sonicare toothbrushes use a sealed design with near zero maintenance.  </li>
            <li> , it was my first time using an electric toothbrush, and so it felt really odd on my teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;here are break down of other models available on market after doing some research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (My dentist sells the higher end  models but admits they offer little if any benefit over this or even the Essence.)</li>
            <li> Lets just hope it doesn&#x27;t go bad right after the warranty expires as many report.</li>
            <li> It worked as well or better than my Sonicare tooth brush, and according to my wife it is quieter and less irritating than the older brush.</li>
            <li> The mouth wash is nothing to get excited over and the tongue cleaner is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I started a live chat, asked a couple questions, and then had my chat closed by the agent with no response.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush comes with 2 heads, a regular and a diamond one, so, for those of you, like me, that bought this along with extra diamond clean heads, there&#x27;s no need to do so, at least for 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, is quiet, and holds a charge a long time</li>
            <li> the package only has a single brush head.  </li>
            <li> I had wanted a Sonicare toothbrush for a long time, and after doing a lot of research, I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> They just didn&#x27;t have to scrape nearly as long</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are only few models  that can use multiple heads and this was the low end of that model list.</li>
            <li> now that will save money in long run form dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so other electric toothbrushes can&#x27;t work the same as a sonic care.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the more expensive version with modes you&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li> Good value , I gave only 4 stars because the base is too narrow making it unstable.</li>
            <li> the extra doe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here are break down as to why i got this after doing some research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a week to a week and a half.</li>
            <li> With this brush beeping in 30 second intervals you can&#x27;t mess anything up.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts longer than I expected, considering we are both using it.</li>
            <li> though the heads were too wide.   </li>
            <li> needs no real maintenance.</li>
            <li> I also like the tiny recharge station that takes up very little room on the bathroom counter and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally due to this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first I thought it would be useless</li>
            <li> I found my mouth was uncomfortably ticklish at first, but I adjusted and now do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Just be aware of this expensive replacement - you can not return a toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Ann</li>
            <li> I probably don&#x27;t replace mine as I should due to this fact.  </li>
            <li> like the fact that it comes with a travel bag and has a small charger stand, much smaller than my previous one.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this brush in the first place because my dentist said I brush too hard and probably not as long as I should (guilty as charged).</li>
            <li> but I saw that there was less tarter build up and healthier gums.</li>
            <li> Update: this one lasted less then two years, even less than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is, but we have had to replace the SonicCare toothbrush multiple times this past year.  </li>
            <li> from 2013, has been replaced with a newer version but is still being sold.&lt;br /&gt;-extremely basic unit, almost scary how simple it is.  </li>
            <li> My hygienist says she can tell who uses them because their teeth has little to no tarter buildup.</li>
            <li> Little sprays of water get on the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> a little better.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> If nothing happens after that, it&#x27;s dead and can&#x27;t be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If nothing happens after that, it&#x27;s dead and can&#x27;t be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that the charger is small, and that the heads are replaceable with less consumer waste</li>
            <li> But it is somewhat hard to control and messy.</li>
            <li> : here are some average prices for these and other heads, only thing I hate is they are expensive:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it stops when I press too hard.</li>
            <li> Even dropped it once on hard marble floor.</li>
            <li> What I mean is</li>
            <li> I only had 1 cavity after 2 years of skipping on going to the dentist because of this bad boy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the FlexCare+ which died after only two years (disappointing for an expensive item).</li>
            <li> If yours stops working, basically, tough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little disappointing that the replacement heads are so expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike the old one, this one doesn&#x27;t have a cavity that fills up with toothpaste/slobber goo (that was disgusting).</li>
            <li> Not too expensive, my teeth feel like I went to the dentist after every time I brush.</li>
            <li> Silly silly Sonicare.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Sonicare is the best!</li>
            <li> I had so far only used the cheap Oral-B electric toothbrush, what was already a big improvement, but still all I knew for 2 1/2 years. WOW, this is a HUGE improvement, I don&#x27;t even know what to say, holy wow. The toothbrush comes with 2 heads, a regular and a diamond one, so, for those of you, like me, that bought this along with extra diamond clean heads, there&#x27;s no need to do so, at least for 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare. It&#x27;s so lightweight . I ended up buying one for my daughter &amp; son also!</li>
            <li> I finally upgraded to this after a decade with an older, electric toothbrush and this is great - lightweight, great brush, quiet and fast.</li>
            <li> Works great easy to use and the timer makes it nice</li>
            <li> Works so much better than my previous generation of Sonicare. Unlike the old one, this one doesn&#x27;t have a cavity that fills up with toothpaste/slobber goo (that was disgusting). Much better design.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth way better than regular brushing. Received it quickly and happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love philips sonicare brushes, this one is a slimmed down version as far as options, but it works as good if not better than the versions with all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this enough! My teeth feel like they were preofessionally cleaned and polished every day. I could not go back to a regular toothbrush. The level of clean is just unparalleled.</li>
            <li> Vibrates your fave to much. Had to return.</li>
            <li> I had an old Sonicare model that used the &amp;#34;screw-on&amp;#34; type brush heads and was extremely hard to clean. It finally died after 10 years of loyal service. This model is lighter and thinner and sealed tight so it is very easy to keep clean. Love the snap-on little brush heads. There are more expensive Sonicare models which have more settings and may be a little thinner or lighter, but this brush suits my needs perfectly. I also like the tiny recharge station that takes up very little room on the bathroom counter and the travel bag was a nice bonus as well. This brush is a great value for the money and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The best.  Teeth feel like I just had a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office every time.</li>
            <li> I have been using a less expensive Oral B electric toothbrush for a couple of years now and have been pretty happy with it. A regular old manual toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t feel like it does the job. However, my dentist recently recommend that I replace my Oral B with a Sonicare during too the highly superior cleaning ability.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, great quality, great product</li>
            <li> I like the simple design. I&#x27;ve had more bells and whistles on my Sonicare and I just didn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the kids!</li>
            <li> The brush was a pleasant surprise. It worked as well or better than my Sonicare tooth brush, and according to my wife it is quieter and less irritating than the older brush.</li>
            <li> cleans much better than manual brushing and is much more pleasent to at least the ears than the oral b brush i used to own. keeps charge for over a week</li>
            <li> I had wanted a Sonicare toothbrush for a long time, and after doing a lot of research, I decided on this one. Some of the reviews were concerned about water, toothpaste, and gunk getting into the motor head. I keep that in mind and take the head off often to quickly clean it. It&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good toothbrush and keeps you honest with its 30 second timer, but... I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed whiter or cleaner teeth. In fact, I recently had my dental exam and the dentist didn&#x27;t notice any difference either. It&#x27;s a little disappointing that the replacement heads are so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, it is a good toothbrush - it does the job - but I probably won&#x27;t be getting another one even though I have friends who swear by it. I think it&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush! Have been using it for just over 6 months and there is a noted difference in my teeth.  I have good teeth to begin with but I saw that there was less tarter build up and healthier gums. I switched to this brush in the first place because my dentist said I brush too hard and probably not as long as I should (guilty as charged). With this brush beeping in 30 second intervals you can&#x27;t mess anything up. My 6 month dentist visit was the best it&#x27;s been in years.  They just didn&#x27;t have to scrape nearly as long and it&#x27;s totally due to this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I love the travel pouch too. At first I thought it would be useless but it&#x27;s a little padded and easy to just throw my brush, toothpaste, mouthwash and floss in the bag for trips.</li>
            <li> Does not have the messiness (inside) concern that the older models had. Cleans well, is quiet, and holds a charge a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for years.  This one works great.</li>
            <li> Price varies too much! One day, it&#x27;s $49.9, the next day, it&#x27;s $39.9, and then you will see $29.9 on the following day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for several months now, and my mouth feels a lot cleaner than it did before I started using it. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the FlexCare+ which died after only two years (disappointing for an expensive item). I&#x27;m glad to hear that others had good luck with customer service; I did not. I started a live chat, asked a couple questions, and then had my chat closed by the agent with no response.  I love how my teeth feel after using these brushes, smooth like when I leave the dentist office after my semi-annual cleaning. I rarely used the UV sanitizer or any of the special features, so decided to replace the one that died with a simpler model. I like the handle on the FlexCare better, this one is slipperier. I hope it lasts.  2/14/17 Update: this one lasted less then two years, even less than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li> Description says package includes additional bonus brush head which is also shown in the photograph but the package only has a single brush head.  &amp;#34;Bonus: 1 additional ProResults gum health brush head&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Definitely an upgrade from the Essence model.  It&#x27;s much slimmer and lighter, and as others have pointed out there&#x27;s  no crevices for gunk to build up. No involved cleaning is the biggest benefit over the Essence. I have to admit that I was looking forward to the quadpacer interval timer, but I&#x27;d done without it on the Essence. And as I tend to brush longer than 2 minutes, I just ignore it.      The Proresults brush head is softer than the standard Essence, and that&#x27;s a plus for me.  I&#x27;d been using the sensitive Essence brush heads, but the standard Proresults doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive gums and teeth so I may stay with it. The only drawback to the Proresults head is the pronounced curves meant to fit around the tooth surface. It does in front, but I spend more time and effort on the back side of my teeth.       I almost purchased the Healthywhite as its price was greatly reduced, but I&#x27;d read many negative reviews about its  longevity,  and the whitening mode seemed gimmicky. Most online reviews show little to no difference in the whitening ability when compared to the Easyclean. I noticed substantial whitening even with my Essence. And the sensitive mode on the Healthywhite is powered down and less effective. My suggestion for those who need a sensitive option is to use the Easyclean with the optional Sonicare sensitive brush head. That&#x27;s what was on my old Essence model, and it was very gentle on my teeth and receding gums.      All-in-all this model seems to be the most sensible buy unless you can&#x27;t live without all the bells and whistles. (My dentist sells the higher end  models but admits they offer little if any benefit over this or even the Essence.) Lets just hope it doesn&#x27;t go bad right after the warranty expires as many report. On the upside, Phillips extended the warranty by 6 months for registering online.anty expires as many report. On the upside, Phillips extended the warranty by 6 months for registering online.</li>
            <li> Works great, price was right and shipping no issues</li>
            <li> I only had 1 cavity after 2 years of skipping on going to the dentist because of this bad boy. Worth every cent!!!</li>
            <li> It took some time to get used to the noise and vibration while brushing, but once I did, I was glad to have it.  Thankfully, it stops when I press too hard. I think it really does a much better job at brushing my teeth than I did manually.  We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says next month 8-)</li>
            <li> good basic toothbrush......</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush very much but the brush head is not my favorite.  I can choose another style for replacements.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. We got one for the two of us and use different heads for each person. The charge lasts longer than I expected, considering we are both using it. We especially love the timer function, which lets you know when to move to the next quadrant. Note: my husband liked it immediately, but it took a couple days before I really liked it. I found my mouth was uncomfortably ticklish at first, but I adjusted and now do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Best money ever spent!</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare toothbrush and I love it. Came in as described, in retailer&#x27;s packaging. The bonus items were a plus at this price and my teeth even feel cleaner after each brushing session. I heard you can buy the more advanced toothbrush heads (from the Diamond Clean series?) of this brand and it&#x27;ll fit on the handle, can anyone confirm?</li>
            <li> The best (of the 3) electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  The timer buzzer is very helpful and it feels like it&#x27;s really getting my teeth cleaned.  My hygienist recommended it.</li>
            <li> Works great and stays clean. This model is replacing my old Philips Sonicare HX6510 Essence which would accumulate filth under the brush head. The brush body also has a better feel to it.</li>
            <li> Nice slim handle. Comes with carrying case replacement head, charger and a bottle of mouth rinse. Bought it to replace my old Sonicare that lasted 10 years. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the more expensive version with modes you&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush for my son who was having gum problems.  This is an amazing toothbrush.  Your teeth feel so clean (I got one for myself, too).  You really feel like you did a great job after you are done brushing.  There is a 2 minute timer that beeps after every 30 seconds to get you to change from upper to lower and inner to outer.  I highly recommend this toothbrush- and incidentally, it did help the gum issue a lot.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare.  It works as advertised and keeps me from the periodontist.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush.  For about a month.  Then the charge dissipates and it can&#x27;t be rebooted nor recharged.  It no longer brushes my son&#x27;s teeth effectively.  Not sure what the problem is, but we have had to replace the SonicCare toothbrush multiple times this past year.  Just be aware of this expensive replacement - you can not return a toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Ann Flemings</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months now, and so far it&#x27;s been perfect.</li>
            <li> Works well. Even dropped it once on hard marble floor. Still works.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel smooth and clean like no regular toothbrush has ever done.</li>
            <li> i dont feel that i am enjoying it . i prefer the old school type :)</li>
            <li> Seems to clean teeth very well, even in hard to reach locations. Battery holds a charge for a long time, which is great as I don&#x27;t have counter space to keep the charger plugged in all the time. Solidly made with a quality feel.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush so I gave one as a gift to my son. My hygienist says she can tell who uses them because their teeth has little to no tarter buildup.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a better way to know how much charge was in the battery, so that I could charge it up more, without over charging it.</li>
            <li> We like this toothbrush but, while it said it came with an extra brush head, ours did not.</li>
            <li> I might have given this 5 stars. The whose sonicare line over the basic has been good. I upgraded, but this looked as if it worked great!</li>
            <li> I love it. At first it kinda &amp;#34;tickled&amp;#34; my mouth i guess you can say but now I am used to it. Works very well. Teeth feel clean after every brush.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, all the freebies are nice too (and it was cheaper than the version without the freebies).  Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush works very well. There is such a noticeable difference between a manual toothbrush and this electrical one. The battery lasts several weeks which is nice and the toothbrush is lightweight. No complaints! The carrying case that comes along with this kit is a good size as well and can even be used as a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. It leaves my teeth fleeing far cleaner than manually brushing. I old version of this brush lasted four years.</li>
            <li> Slim, easy to use and clean, charges overnight or while I&#x27;m at school. The battery lasts about 2 weeks before it starts flashing that it&#x27;s at about 20% charge. I don&#x27;t keep it on the charger unless it needs to be charged. I found it easiest to first brush the front of all my left teeth, the front of all my right teeth, the back of all my bottom teeth, and then the back of all my top teeth.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my last Sonicare after 4 years of service. They don&#x27;t last forever, but I don&#x27;t ever want to brush with anything else.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had multiple Sonicare and they have more power than the Braun or Dazzlepro models (although Dazzlepro is close) and makes the regular cleanings at the dentist go faster. I paid the extra for this model to get the lithium battery and the new style (cheap) brush heads. The small base/charger is great for travel. This is my 3rd Sonicare and will likely not ever buy another brand</li>
            <li> Works great!  I love how it beeps every 30 seconds so I know to switch to another section of teeth</li>
            <li> Package came without additional brush head which is different from what advertised. Head and body wasn&#x27;t well fit but I will try once I get replaced package with additional brush head.</li>
            <li> I think I am going to like it. But it is somewhat hard to control and messy. Little sprays of water get on the bathroom mirror. It does seem to do a good job of cleaning my teeth and is much easier to clean than my other Sonicare toothbrushes have been (gunk buillt up in those even when I took them apart and rinsed every time after brusthing). Hopefully I will learn to control it better after I have used it a while.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.  Very loud and sounds like I&#x27;m flying a remote control plane.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my older original Sonicare.  It functions the same as my older one but my older version was looking pretty gross.  I love the Sonicare toothbrush but the heads seem to wear out quickly and are expensive to replace.  I probably don&#x27;t replace mine as I should due to this fact.  I gave it a 4 stars for that reason.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Not too expensive, my teeth feel like I went to the dentist after every time I brush. A lot better than a manual toothbrush. Although I love this toothbrush I didn&#x27;t love it at first, when I first used this toothbrush, it was my first time using an electric toothbrush, and so it felt really odd on my teeth, I got used to the feeling within a week, and have been using this toothbrush for 4 months and love it so much now! And I could never go back to a manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li> My mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this clean since my last visit to the dentist!</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about four months and then started to be loose and make a loud noise. I still use it, but the main section appears to have gotten loose and makes a lot more noise than before.</li>
            <li> We like these and everyone in the family has one.  I like that the charger is small, and that the heads are replaceable with less consumer waste, I have 2 complaints:  the crease between the brush and the handle collects toothpaste and grime even though we wash it after each use.  Maybe the company can come up with something a little better.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason the handle doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it should and I find that I wash it with an alcohol swab about once a month.,  I would love to find one that was easier to keep clean, but don&#x27;t want to spend more money.  The part that goes in your mouth, however is easy to keep  clean with rinsing, so it is not something limiting usefulness.</li>
            <li> The technology is an improvement over the Braun I used for years.  The Philips cleans as well (or better) than the Braun and is easier on gums.</li>
            <li> I just upgraded to the easy clean sonicare brush after going form oral-b 10 dollar tooth brush. The tooth brush works great, and is WAY WAY easier to clean than the essence and 10 dollar brush. It is also a lot more slender and light weight, but part of me does miss the heavier feel of the essence. It does have a quad timer than bumps every 30 seconds, I dont think this feature is worth the extra cost than the essence toothbrush, but the cleanliness of this brush definitely is worth the extra doe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here are break down as to why i got this after doing some research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only few models  that can use multiple heads and this was the low end of that model list. meaning its the cheapest, but still reliable toothbrush. I love to try the expensive models, but dont really need those features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*use these styles of brush heads - DiamondClean, InterCare, ProResults&lt;br /&gt;The e-Series brush heads can only be used with older style Sonicares, such as the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; FYI: here are some average prices for these and other heads, only thing I hate is they are expensive:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  DiamondClean - $13 - Featuring a central stain-removal pad of diamond-shaped bristles.&lt;br /&gt;  InterCare - $13 - Featuring extra-long bristles that reach further between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;  ProResults - Featuring curved bristles (power tufts) that aid with cleaning. There seem to be 3 versions of this head&lt;br /&gt;  SimplyClean - $8 - A model similar to the original ProResults design.&lt;br /&gt;  Plaque Control - $10 - A design focused toward &amp;#34;superior&amp;#34; plaque removal.&lt;br /&gt;  Gum Health - $10 - Features softer bristles for gentler brushing.&lt;br /&gt;  e-Series - $12.33 - Featuring a contoured bristle profile to fit the shape of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I also wanted the 30 second pause to let me know when to go to next section.&lt;br /&gt;*Battery that will last 2weeks is a must for me.&lt;br /&gt;* heads have to be replaced quick, but you are getting a powerful unit that can clean at 31,000 stoke per min. now that will save money in long run form dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here are break down of other models available on market after doing some research:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can use any heads, also snapon-&lt;br /&gt;  DiamondClean - too many features you dont need.&lt;br /&gt;  FlexCare Platinum -too many features you dont need.&lt;br /&gt;  FlexCare+ (plus) - too many features you dont need.&lt;br /&gt;  HealthyWhite - does same thing as Easyclean, really it looks the same, sibling has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have limitation on heads it can use, plus not all support snap on heads, some are scew on heads that can be a pain to remove if you are sharing the body of the toothbrush-&lt;br /&gt;  Sonicare 2 series plaque control - I though the heads were too wide.&lt;br /&gt;  Sonicare for Kids (HX6311/07) - Well I cannot be a kid again.&lt;br /&gt;  Essence (HX5610/01) - had it but it will not accept but lots of  heads.&lt;br /&gt;  PowerUp - very low model,  for kids, not as powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for taking time to read my thoughts; I hope I’ve helped.

            <li> Great product!  Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
            <li> Works great. The charge seems to last a week to a week and a half. High quality and this kit came with extras for the same price as the brush alone (when I bought it). The travel case is nice to have for trips. I feel like my teeth are much cleaner after using this compared to my old standard brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase.  Best automatic toothbrush I have ever used.  My dentist says my teeth and gums are extremely healthy.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a Sonicare for awhile. Love it! I could see imprivement in my gums in 2 weeks. Teeth feel much cleaner. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I Love the toothbrush, but I don&#x27;t think it needed to come with a carrying case. The mouth wash is nothing to get excited over and the tongue cleaner is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare toothbrush. Came dentist recommended but my dentist said I did not need to get the fancier systems. That this particular Sonicare system was the best. Finally got around to purchasing it and I can say WOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize that the way the brush vibrates is patented and so other electric toothbrushes can&#x27;t work the same as a sonic care. Love this thing. Even though pricey, my boyfriend and I use the same base (but we each have our own heads--mine is the standard one and his is the gum healthy one so we can tell the difference). I love the timer on this thing (2 minutes) and the fact that they have a brushing your teeth system. What I mean is, you do 30 second of your front side of you top teeth, 30 seconds of the inside side of your top teeth (and the same for the bottom). The brush pauses for like a millisecond at each 30 second interval to let you know when to switch. Awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then you can turn it on again for additional brushing and tongue brushing. Be sure to read the manual (quick and easy read).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good investment!</li>
            <li> This is just as good if not better than the Diamond care toothbrush. Totally not worth the extra $100 to use four more settings you&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li> True clean feeling after using. Battery life excellent made it almost 2 months before needing a recharge. Brush head size works perfect for my mouth size</li>
            <li> This was a steal. The package with the mouthwash and bag and extra head was CHEAPER than the normal one. Silly silly Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Love it, I like the head that comes with kit than one pictured with brush.</li>
            <li> This is a well made product, easy to use because it prompts you when to continue to another area. My only concern is whether I will ever be able to get used to the tickling sensation when it cleans my teeth. I was hoping that with constant use that it would also whiten my teeth but has not happened yet. My teeth feel cleaner when I use it.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!  About 15 years ago my parents got the earlier model for me and my sister and I loved it.  So years later I finally bought my own and glad I did.  My teeth feel clean and my mouth fresh.  It is worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Cheap sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;-Ridiculously easy interface: 1 button to turn it on or off.  1 status LED.  That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;-Motor seems as good as more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;-Battery Life seems as good as more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;-Simple to use! Not a lot of room for mistakes. Nothing unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;-Takes the usual push-on sonicare heads, including the new Diamond Clean ones, which are supposedly better.&lt;br /&gt;-Usual contactless charger, should work with most any recent sonicare model. No way to accidentally electrocute yourself.&lt;br /&gt;-Charger works with 110-240VAC, so should work virtually anywhere in the world with a simple physical adapter.  Competitors do NOT offer this compatibility.&lt;br /&gt;-Includes a nice little bag you can use while traveling.  Since it works with overseas power, it&#x27;s actually a good idea to bring it with you rather than using a basic toothbrush.  Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;-Toothbrush needs no real maintenance. Just replace the heads when worn or every couple months.  Make sure to clean under the head before applying the new one.  Charge maybe once a week.&lt;br /&gt;-Warranty: 2 years! Not bad for a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;-model from 2013, has been replaced with a newer version but is still being sold.&lt;br /&gt;-extremely basic unit, almost scary how simple it is.  &amp;#34;EasyClean&amp;#34; is a great name for it.&lt;br /&gt;-Literally one green LED for feedback, which is used to indicate all status to the user.  No dedicated &amp;#34;low battery&amp;#34; LED, no dedicated &amp;#34;Charging&amp;#34; LED, nothing.  Doesn&#x27;t change colors to indicate state.  Simply lights up when turned on, blinks when charging, and is solid when charging is complete.&lt;br /&gt;-All recent Sonicare toothbrushes use a sealed design with near zero maintenance.  If yours stops working, basically, tough.  Any attempt to disassemble it will ruin it.  If it is within the warranty period of 2 years, they might replace it.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last much longer than 3 years, though.  If you put it on the charger and nothing happens, try holding the power button for 10 seconds.  If nothing happens after that, it&#x27;s dead and can&#x27;t be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using it until it dies (the last one I had died suddenly, which wasn&#x27;t very nice). I&#x27;d recommend it to friends and family. My mouth feels a lot cleaner than when I&#x27;ve had to use basic toothbrushes.  I&#x27;ll be bringing it with me on travel from this point forward, for sure.If you put it on the charger and nothing happens, try holding the power button for 10 seconds.

            <li> Great product, works well for me and easy to clean when done, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Philips Sonicare for some years now and just recently upgraded to this model.  Excellent toothbrush, and I like the fact that it comes with a travel bag and has a small charger stand, much smaller than my previous one.  Liked it so much I bought one for my girlfriend (not trying to drop any hints you know, just wanted her to have one too).  She loves it as well.  I also liked that it came with the BreathRx mouthwash. I like that more than what I was using, that now BreathRx is the only mouthwash I use.  Delivery was fast too!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Gets her teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> Great deal with the travel package. Brushing my teeth is actually more enjoyable and they have felt cleaner. The tongue scraper works very well too.</li>
            <li> Good value , I gave only 4 stars because the base is too narrow making it unstable. The brush works well..this was an upgrade ftom the Essence model for me which had design flaws allowing gunk to drip into shaft. This design still needs to be degunked regularly but it is easy to do with no resevoirs for accumulation.</li>
