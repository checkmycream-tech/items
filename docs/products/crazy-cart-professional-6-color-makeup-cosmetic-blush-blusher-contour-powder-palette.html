            <li>love!</li>
            <li>This is great makeup on the cheap.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s amazing and</li>
            <li>Colors are really nice thought that the bronzer was going to be darker but it would be great for a light skinned person and highlighters are really nice pigmentation is......</li>
            <li>Despite the many good reviews I received/read, what I received was not was is pictured.</li>
            <li>Very good packaging and the casing is pretty durable.</li>
            <li>This is the best blush color set I found so far.</li>
            <li>So nice :3</li>
            <li>It also seemed to irritate my skin after I applied it very lightly.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are very smooth and I have no problem picking up product with my brushes because of their color payoff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s HUGE and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>BUT IT&#x27;S HUGE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure to reorder them as friends are requesting them.</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>how much I love it.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I wanted to purchase one for my own kit.</li>
            <li>But the red is awesome</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and these smooth tones are perfect to create all your makeup needs.</li>
            <li>But I absolutely love the blush colors.</li>
            <li>My mom and my grandmother now want me to get them one because they love the highlighter and the blush.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li>did I say I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I wish I had recieved the colors in the picture,  but I will be able to use the ones I got one way or another.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the texture.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Ok so I ordered this</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE, my make up is 100% because of this üôåüèΩüòòüòò</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>This palette is cheap and amazing.</li>
            <li>I love it(:</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this item..</li>
            <li>The contour color is more of a beige tone which couldn&#x27;t contour even the fairest of complexion.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 98% sure that I like it more than shimmery highlights because of that.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Nah, but a great learning set and decent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The contour color was more the color of a light bronzer than a darker brown a contour should be.</li>
            <li>Shades are WAY different and the contour shade was WAY too light (I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews mention a strong smell,  </li>
            <li>The colors are all very pigmented and surprisingly, the matte highlight (the white) looks great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li>The brown shade in the picture came as a light beige shade.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I have light skin</li>
            <li>Shipping for this item was free and took 8 days to arrive for me.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and the darkest color was a light color.</li>
            <li>and it was still too light)</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Great price and very big.</li>
            <li>and I can say that I will do enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the softness of the powders, the blendablilty of the powders, and the ease of have one palette.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really great for beginners, aspiring artists, or even just anyone looking for a set to use daily, for travel, or to just experiment with.</li>
            <li>so I should be able to use it for contouring still, but anyone with darker than fair skin should probably look for a different contouring palette.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!!!</li>
            <li>I love this pallet so much!</li>
            <li>this thing is pretty pigmented.i love it and would order it again in a heartbeat</li>
            <li>I was soo excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>The colors are so light that the contour shades only work as contours for my fair, light, and sometimes my medium toned clients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a half a year and thought the colours are not like in the photo they&#x27;re still very good.</li>
            <li>It works great and the color stays on for a long time even without primer!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and was cheap.</li>
            <li>REALLY soft feels amazing on my skin</li>
            <li>I am requesting a full refund.</li>
            <li>Pallete is good overall for ua beginners.  </li>
            <li>But for the price it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger in person than it looks on camera which is a super good thing.</li>
            <li>Love it was ex tacitly what I expected and for such a great price totally satisfied with my blush pallete</li>
            <li>I think in the cases of such things like these palettes it&#x27;s most helpful to say where or which seller you purchase from, especially if the experience is good, as there are in fact three types of theses contour pallets out there and like many others</li>
            <li>My first one was completely damaged but my second one is just perfect!</li>
            <li>But other than that I is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the yellowy/tanish color mixed with the white for setting makeup under my eyes and it works great!</li>
            <li>, im pleased with this product and will buy alot more in future!</li>
            <li>This is a super  buy</li>
            <li>As always, I received it from them quickly and undamaged.....</li>
            <li>First of all, this palette is way bigger than I thought it would be, so I think it&#x27;s a good price for the size.</li>
            <li>The product is cheap, so save your money and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>I think its a great deal for people who are just learning to contour Or need something for everyday use.</li>
            <li>and it dries your skin real fast.</li>
            <li>Just spend more and buy from a direct website.</li>
            <li>Nor was the quality worth anything.</li>
            <li>I wanted to experiment with contouring and bought this product for fun and because it was cheap, and you get what you pay for really.</li>
            <li>I DO NOT RECOMMEND, not even for fun or one time use.</li>
            <li>Ive had many dry patches on my skin, including near my eye area and everytime I would try to set my makeup, you could tell I had very dry skin underneath, but with this palette I don&#x27;t have that problem, so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>The only shades that were true to color are the 3 lightest shades in the top corner.</li>
            <li>The second I opened it there was this very strong chemical scent to it.</li>
            <li>The other shade would probably suit really cool toned skin too or maybe warm skin.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors can be a little intimidatng, but this palette is an amazing but cheap.</li>
            <li>a basic bronzer!&lt;br /&gt;(I have very fair/porcelain skin with warm</li>
            <li>Loving this so far got it yesterday and completely intact.</li>
            <li>Amazing just like the picture and got to me wayyyyyy before the expected delivery date....</li>
            <li>First of all I did not receive the pallette in the picture.</li>
            <li>Works ok but makes your face smell like paint which last all day.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I expect it to be EXACTLY like</li>
            <li>Which means you powder it on top of a liquid contour or regular foundation routine.</li>
            <li>This was exactly the pallet I needed.</li>
            <li>, I get why some bronzers are shimmery, but contours should be matte if you actually want to give the illusion of more sculpted features.</li>
            <li>the pallet itself isn&#x27;t good for contouring, I&#x27;ve tried and the darkest brown just blends into my skin and as I am fairly pale</li>
            <li>I have expected a little better quality from this product, but it is was a good bargain for the money.</li>
            <li>For me three times was a charm, however, I saw that Olymstore was on the list of sellers and I&#x27;ve bought from them before with a positive experience.</li>
            <li>The top right pink color is much brighter than shown but I will never get to use it because it was shattered.  </li>
            <li>I simply emailed them in advance asking them if they could verify that the item was as pictured, which they did very quickly....</li>
            <li>Overall i think this is a great deal, its comparable to the coastal scent palette for about half the money.</li>
            <li>I feel like there is probably a very high lead content in it</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The ones that are not broken are junk.</li>
            <li>They are more of coral colors than pink.</li>
            <li>Ready to order another.</li>
            <li>For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>You only need a light hand, and can build if you need to, also you can mix some colors to lighten as you wish and blend blend blend.</li>
            <li>Nooo, don&#x27;t buy this, the brown contouring is not even dark is super light</li>
            <li>Honestly it came broken but other than that the powders are good</li>
            <li>I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because some people said the same thing however it was true.  </li>
            <li>Like others have said, the dark brown shown in the image is actually more of a medium tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I will say, from what little I was able to touch of these powders, they are very pimgented and feel silky</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>The blushes are nice, however, I don&#x27;t use them because the pink is definitely blue-toned and my cool/yellow undertones</li>
            <li>A few of the colors are slightly different than in the picture but for me that&#x27;s actually a good thing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was worth the price I paid for.</li>
            <li>the colors and content just isn&#x27;t worth even the relatively low price tag.</li>
            <li>the product is good however received the shipment broken.  </li>
            <li>There are tutorials by Gigi/Gregory Gorgeous on youtube if at any point you are confused.</li>
            <li>They are a nice, thin large pallet.  </li>
            <li>at the moment im trying to contact them to see if i can get a new product.</li>
            <li>I only use the blush, which is kind of a waste of the rest of the pallet</li>
            <li>The pigments are heavy and strong--too strong to get any decent looking contour effect without ending up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li>First it&#x27;s not like the picture, I recived different color</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would ever travel with it because of it&#x27;s size and because I mostly just use the contour and highlight, but I suppose a lot of other people would if they actually use all of the shades in the palette frequently.</li>
            <li>The plate is very large that you can keep it for a long time</li>
            <li>The product came completely destroyed and made a huge mess all over my bathroom when I opened it.</li>
            <li>the way, this is the same exact palette that BH Cosmetics and Coastal Scents sell, I think a few other brands sell it too under their own labels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft brown color, it&#x27;s supposed to be soft and buildable because its a contour kit not a blush.</li>
            <li>I was surprised for the price of this item</li>
            <li>I just received it today and it was complete damage case was also damage from inside.</li>
            <li>The white and blush colors show up very well.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist so naturally I gravitate towards palettes.</li>
            <li>The brown for contouring is more like a dirty blonde color,it is not  like the picture shows ,blush colors are ok</li>
            <li>I also like that the contour shade is completely matte</li>
            <li>This is definitely a good option for people who don&#x27;t want to blow a lot of money on expensive makeup</li>
            <li>The pale pink (bottom left) is actually a light brown, and the more muted pink (bottom right) is actually orange.</li>
            <li>Cheap blushes and waste of money!</li>
            <li>The darkest color is not dark at all.</li>
            <li>Hot pink and an orangish brown.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the blushes are much more pigmented than the contour.</li>
            <li>All colors are matte pressed powder and are pretty pigmented and long lasting.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that the color of the product in the picture is not the actually color in real life.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not mad because i paid so little</li>
            <li>and I am super pale.</li>
            <li>The product finally arrived after nearly 2 weeks and after opening the package i noticed there was makeup all over the box inside the packaging.</li>
            <li>The pallet came with broken, The pigment seems to be ok.</li>
            <li>One thing worth mentioning though is that the palette feels a bit flimsy (I think because the plastic isn&#x27;t thick enough for the size), but since I don&#x27;t abuse my makeup or plan on travelingwith it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter to</li>
            <li>Barely has any color and only makes my feel and look ashy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell any thing other than the usual light, makeup smell.</li>
            <li>Its way different and the blushes are small circles not even large as shown on the photo!</li>
            <li>The colors that appear darker in the picture are a little lighter in the actual palette, but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far, nothing bad to say about it.</li>

            <li> Colors are really nice thought that the bronzer was going to be darker but it would be great for a light skinned person and highlighters are really nice pigmentation is......</li>
            <li> Despite the many good reviews I received/read, what I received was not was is pictured.</li>
            <li> Very good packaging and the casing is pretty durable.</li>
            <li> This is the best blush color set I found so far.</li>
            <li> So nice :3</li>
            <li> It also seemed to irritate my skin after I applied it very lightly.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are very smooth and I have no problem picking up product with my brushes because of their color payoff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HUGE and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> BUT IT&#x27;S HUGE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure to reorder them as friends are requesting them.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> how much I love it.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much that I wanted to purchase one for my own kit.</li>
            <li> But the red is awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and these smooth tones are perfect to create all your makeup needs.</li>
            <li> But I absolutely love the blush colors.</li>
            <li> My mom and my grandmother now want me to get them one because they love the highlighter and the blush.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li> did I say I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I wish I had recieved the colors in the picture,  but I will be able to use the ones I got one way or another.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the texture.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered this</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE, my make up is 100% because of this üôåüèΩüòòüòò</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> This palette is cheap and amazing.</li>
            <li> I love it(:</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item..</li>
            <li> The contour color is more of a beige tone which couldn&#x27;t contour even the fairest of complexion.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 98% sure that I like it more than shimmery highlights because of that.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Nah, but a great learning set and decent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The contour color was more the color of a light bronzer than a darker brown a contour should be.</li>
            <li> Shades are WAY different and the contour shade was WAY too light (I have very fair skin</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews mention a strong smell,  </li>
            <li> The colors are all very pigmented and surprisingly, the matte highlight (the white) looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li> The brown shade in the picture came as a light beige shade.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I have light skin</li>
            <li> Shipping for this item was free and took 8 days to arrive for me.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and the darkest color was a light color.</li>
            <li> and it was still too light)</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great price and very big.</li>
            <li> and I can say that I will do enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the softness of the powders, the blendablilty of the powders, and the ease of have one palette.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really great for beginners, aspiring artists, or even just anyone looking for a set to use daily, for travel, or to just experiment with.</li>
            <li> so I should be able to use it for contouring still, but anyone with darker than fair skin should probably look for a different contouring palette.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!!!</li>
            <li> I love this pallet so much!</li>
            <li> this thing is pretty pigmented.i love it and would order it again in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> I was soo excited to get this product.</li>
            <li> The colors are so light that the contour shades only work as contours for my fair, light, and sometimes my medium toned clients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a half a year and thought the colours are not like in the photo they&#x27;re still very good.</li>
            <li> It works great and the color stays on for a long time even without primer!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and was cheap.</li>
            <li> REALLY soft feels amazing on my skin</li>
            <li> I am requesting a full refund.</li>
            <li> Pallete is good overall for ua beginners.  </li>
            <li> But for the price it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger in person than it looks on camera which is a super good thing.</li>
            <li> Love it was ex tacitly what I expected and for such a great price totally satisfied with my blush pallete</li>
            <li> I think in the cases of such things like these palettes it&#x27;s most helpful to say where or which seller you purchase from, especially if the experience is good, as there are in fact three types of theses contour pallets out there and like many others</li>
            <li> My first one was completely damaged but my second one is just perfect!</li>
            <li> But other than that I is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the yellowy/tanish color mixed with the white for setting makeup under my eyes and it works great!</li>
            <li> , im pleased with this product and will buy alot more in future!</li>
            <li> This is a super  buy</li>
            <li> As always, I received it from them quickly and undamaged.....</li>
            <li> First of all, this palette is way bigger than I thought it would be, so I think it&#x27;s a good price for the size.</li>
            <li> The product is cheap, so save your money and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> I think its a great deal for people who are just learning to contour Or need something for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and it dries your skin real fast.</li>
            <li> Just spend more and buy from a direct website.</li>
            <li> Nor was the quality worth anything.</li>
            <li> I wanted to experiment with contouring and bought this product for fun and because it was cheap, and you get what you pay for really.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT RECOMMEND, not even for fun or one time use.</li>
            <li> Ive had many dry patches on my skin, including near my eye area and everytime I would try to set my makeup, you could tell I had very dry skin underneath, but with this palette I don&#x27;t have that problem, so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The only shades that were true to color are the 3 lightest shades in the top corner.</li>
            <li> The second I opened it there was this very strong chemical scent to it.</li>
            <li> The other shade would probably suit really cool toned skin too or maybe warm skin.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors can be a little intimidatng, but this palette is an amazing but cheap.</li>
            <li> a basic bronzer!&lt;br /&gt;(I have very fair/porcelain skin with warm</li>
            <li> Loving this so far got it yesterday and completely intact.</li>
            <li> Amazing just like the picture and got to me wayyyyyy before the expected delivery date....</li>
            <li> First of all I did not receive the pallette in the picture.</li>
            <li> Works ok but makes your face smell like paint which last all day.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I expect it to be EXACTLY like</li>
            <li> Which means you powder it on top of a liquid contour or regular foundation routine.</li>
            <li> This was exactly the pallet I needed.</li>
            <li> , I get why some bronzers are shimmery, but contours should be matte if you actually want to give the illusion of more sculpted features.</li>
            <li> the pallet itself isn&#x27;t good for contouring, I&#x27;ve tried and the darkest brown just blends into my skin and as I am fairly pale</li>
            <li> I have expected a little better quality from this product, but it is was a good bargain for the money.</li>
            <li> For me three times was a charm, however, I saw that Olymstore was on the list of sellers and I&#x27;ve bought from them before with a positive experience.</li>
            <li> The top right pink color is much brighter than shown but I will never get to use it because it was shattered.  </li>
            <li> I simply emailed them in advance asking them if they could verify that the item was as pictured, which they did very quickly....</li>
            <li> Overall i think this is a great deal, its comparable to the coastal scent palette for about half the money.</li>
            <li> I feel like there is probably a very high lead content in it</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The ones that are not broken are junk.</li>
            <li> They are more of coral colors than pink.</li>
            <li> Ready to order another.</li>
            <li> For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> You only need a light hand, and can build if you need to, also you can mix some colors to lighten as you wish and blend blend blend.</li>
            <li> Nooo, don&#x27;t buy this, the brown contouring is not even dark is super light</li>
            <li> Honestly it came broken but other than that the powders are good</li>
            <li> I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because some people said the same thing however it was true.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, the dark brown shown in the image is actually more of a medium tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I will say, from what little I was able to touch of these powders, they are very pimgented and feel silky</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> The blushes are nice, however, I don&#x27;t use them because the pink is definitely blue-toned and my cool/yellow undertones</li>
            <li> A few of the colors are slightly different than in the picture but for me that&#x27;s actually a good thing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was worth the price I paid for.</li>
            <li> the colors and content just isn&#x27;t worth even the relatively low price tag.</li>
            <li> the product is good however received the shipment broken.  </li>
            <li> There are tutorials by Gigi/Gregory Gorgeous on youtube if at any point you are confused.</li>
            <li> They are a nice, thin large pallet.  </li>
            <li> at the moment im trying to contact them to see if i can get a new product.</li>
            <li> I only use the blush, which is kind of a waste of the rest of the pallet</li>
            <li> The pigments are heavy and strong--too strong to get any decent looking contour effect without ending up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s not like the picture, I recived different color</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would ever travel with it because of it&#x27;s size and because I mostly just use the contour and highlight, but I suppose a lot of other people would if they actually use all of the shades in the palette frequently.</li>
            <li> The plate is very large that you can keep it for a long time</li>
            <li> The product came completely destroyed and made a huge mess all over my bathroom when I opened it.</li>
            <li> the way, this is the same exact palette that BH Cosmetics and Coastal Scents sell, I think a few other brands sell it too under their own labels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft brown color, it&#x27;s supposed to be soft and buildable because its a contour kit not a blush.</li>
            <li> I was surprised for the price of this item</li>
            <li> I just received it today and it was complete damage case was also damage from inside.</li>
            <li> The white and blush colors show up very well.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist so naturally I gravitate towards palettes.</li>
            <li> The brown for contouring is more like a dirty blonde color,it is not  like the picture shows ,blush colors are ok</li>
            <li> I also like that the contour shade is completely matte</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good option for people who don&#x27;t want to blow a lot of money on expensive makeup</li>
            <li> The pale pink (bottom left) is actually a light brown, and the more muted pink (bottom right) is actually orange.</li>
            <li> Cheap blushes and waste of money!</li>
            <li> The darkest color is not dark at all.</li>
            <li> Hot pink and an orangish brown.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the blushes are much more pigmented than the contour.</li>
            <li> All colors are matte pressed powder and are pretty pigmented and long lasting.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that the color of the product in the picture is not the actually color in real life.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not mad because i paid so little</li>
            <li> and I am super pale.</li>
            <li> The product finally arrived after nearly 2 weeks and after opening the package i noticed there was makeup all over the box inside the packaging.</li>
            <li> The pallet came with broken, The pigment seems to be ok.</li>
            <li> One thing worth mentioning though is that the palette feels a bit flimsy (I think because the plastic isn&#x27;t thick enough for the size), but since I don&#x27;t abuse my makeup or plan on travelingwith it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter to</li>
            <li> Barely has any color and only makes my feel and look ashy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell any thing other than the usual light, makeup smell.</li>
            <li> Its way different and the blushes are small circles not even large as shown on the photo!</li>
            <li> The colors that appear darker in the picture are a little lighter in the actual palette, but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far, nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Maybe that is just because I have such pale skin and the blushes really stand out against it.</li>
            <li> is that the colors are really pigmented so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t blend AS easily as other products on the market, but they still blend pretty well with a little work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first got this and tried to use it I dabbed my brush into it too hard.</li>
            <li> I thought it would look chalky or odd, but it actually looks really natural</li>
            <li> Ladies please if to you buy this product and give any bad review learn how to use the product develop a technique on how to apply the blushes and you will be very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of how long and inconsistent the delivery times are.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting</li>
            <li> It will last you long.</li>
            <li> Seems like it will last a long time and is quite pigmented.</li>
            <li> All the other colors are there, and are decent quality, but the dark brown is not.</li>
            <li> You really have to be careful that you put very little on or you will look like a clown.</li>
            <li> The product lastes long</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is no sparkle in the pink blush.</li>
            <li> One took over a month to get here, where the other only took 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The white powder was broken and was all over the whole palette.</li>
            <li> He darkest one isn&#x27;t even dark enough.</li>
            <li> I am currently hunting for a darker palette for my medium, tan, and dark toned clients.</li>
            <li> I use every single color in this palette!  </li>
            <li> and I advise people to spend a little extra money on a product that won&#x27;t eventually end up killing  you.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not really scented.</li>
            <li> It smells almost like wet paint.</li>
            <li> but I expected this for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what i expected.</li>
            <li> I can make the other colors work but the blush colors won&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> The colors are not exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered this one due to the affordable price.</li>
            <li> the pinks aren&#x27;t very pink.</li>
            <li> The other two colors, I just use to help blend the contour or to go over areas with slight discolouration.</li>
            <li> A very little blush goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I know you risk a bad product when its cheap</li>
            <li> And my skin is not even dark.</li>
            <li> but in the end its not worth it.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and never before have I broken out in hives after using a makeup product.</li>
            <li> The case is large but very thin.</li>
            <li> but like I&#x27;ve said; I&#x27;ve used it for half a year and it works for me.</li>
            <li> formula does dry a little harsh in oil spots (or due to oiler base product like your foundation) and may settle in unflattering spots if you apply to heavily or your foundation is still very fresh.</li>
            <li> A cakey powdery mess</li>
            <li> The colors were not true to what the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super bad for your skin, it almost feel like baby powder</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday since I received this, so for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> The product picture is a little misleading because the palette I received did not have any Blush colors.</li>
            <li> Now since we generally cannot talk about a negative seller experience here I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t mention who we actually did get the &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; pallet from, helping others avoid going thru what some of us unfortunately have.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday for highlighting, contouring, and blending.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time if your looking for a contour color in this pallete.</li>
            <li> Once again, DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE MONEY AND WASTE DAYS OF BUYING AND WAITING FOR THIS PRODUCT TO COME.</li>
            <li> The product is not to heavy and does not give a powder look.</li>
            <li> but I feel as though they might feel heavy as you build up for the look.</li>
            <li> Save the hassle and waste of money, buy coastal scents instead.</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF HOW TO CONTOUR PLEASE DON&#x27;T WRITE A NEGATIVE REVIEW.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I received the palette with 6 colors like shown, but I am a little disappointed as the darker colors are barely dark enough to contour with, they are almost</li>
            <li> After a month I should have at least received what I ordered.</li>
            <li> unfortunately when i did open it, the colors inside were broken and it was a disaster.</li>
            <li> I read the negative and one star reviews before purchasing just in case.</li>
            <li> I am beyond outraged right now.</li>
            <li> When it finally arrived it was the wrong palette!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> but it also feels really weak</li>
            <li> I at very least expect to receive the product that&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> The product was broken.</li>
            <li> just wish it didn&#x27;t come with the broken color.</li>
            <li> 2 of them are broken.</li>
            <li> i received this pallet with Broken blush and contour</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t come broken, the colors in the palette don&#x27;t match the image.</li>
            <li> the Product came cavered with powder and two section were broken up...</li>
            <li> I opened the cover and found 2 of the palletes completely broken and makeup was scattered everywhere inside the container.</li>
            <li> Irreversibly damaged I am not happy and will be requesting a refund.</li>
            <li> it came broken</li>
            <li> they may not like if they&#x27;re just starting out and don&#x27;t know what to look for, I know I hate myself in the morning when I do that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came totally broken.</li>
            <li> I also either got the one not pictured or a broken one.</li>
            <li> But i got the wrong color scheme.</li>
            <li> Useless colors.</li>
            <li> After trying this out, I&#x27;m sorry to say that it just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Not good!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the wrong palette  .</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the colors are nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> Being that it comes from China, I tried getting someone in customer service to call me and it was useless.</li>
            <li> The product feels like I&#x27;m apply dirty dust on my face.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to waste their money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad reviews on this item, but you won&#x27;t get one from me yet.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The colors are awful. I would never use this on a client.</li>
            <li> This is great makeup on the cheap. The contour may look intimidating, but it goes well with my skin tone and I am super pale. This is a great starter kit for someone who has never worked with contour or highlight before. I will definitely be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the blushes are much more pigmented than the contour. You really have to be careful that you put very little on or you will look like a clown. Maybe that is just because I have such pale skin and the blushes really stand out against it.</li>
            <li> the product is good however received the shipment broken.  the color brow is totally broke in pieces</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given 2 of these away as gifts, and the girls loved them.  They are a nice, thin large pallet.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of how long and inconsistent the delivery times are.  One took over a month to get here, where the other only took 2 weeks.  Both were packaged well.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad reviews on this item, but you won&#x27;t get one from me yet.  I&#x27;m sure to reorder them as friends are requesting them.</li>
            <li> This compact is not compact! It&#x27;s HUGE and I LOVE it!  All the colors on the pallet are great and they all blend well together.  It&#x27;s long lasting and I use it everyday for highlighting, contouring, and blending. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Colors are really nice thought that the bronzer was going to be darker but it would be great for a light skinned person and highlighters are really nice pigmentation is......eeeh not so good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time if your looking for a contour color in this pallete. The brown shade in the picture came as a light beige shade. The only shades that were true to color are the 3 lightest shades in the top corner. I only use this pallete for the bushes even thou they aren&#x27;t my favorite I get some use out of it, so It&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
            <li> greate price, awesome product</li>
            <li> Love this product. But i got the wrong color scheme. I didn&#x27;t return. I&#x27;m moving on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Amazing I absolutely loved it. It&#x27;s a soft brown color, it&#x27;s supposed to be soft and buildable because its a contour kit not a blush. It works perfectly if you know how to use it. I even used one of the powders just as a matte powder for my overall face. The product lastes long and it&#x27;s not really scented. Also it&#x27;s really big!! It will last you long. I love it. If you can&#x27;t work with it keep practicing because its a good product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette and it took a month to get to me. When it finally arrived it was the wrong palette! I received a concealer palette. I am not happy. After a month I should have at least received what I ordered. I emailed them and I am waiting to hear back. Hopefully it won&#x27;t take 2 months to resolve this. I guess I&#x27;ll write a review on the actual product when I receive it. If I ever do. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Despite the many good reviews I received/read, what I received was not was is pictured. The contour color was more the color of a light bronzer than a darker brown a contour should be. All the other colors are there, and are decent quality, but the dark brown is not.</li>
            <li> I received the palette with 6 colors like shown, but I am a little disappointed as the darker colors are barely dark enough to contour with, they are almost a basic bronzer!&lt;br /&gt;(I have very fair/porcelain skin with warm undertones)&lt;br /&gt;The formula does dry a little harsh in oil spots (or due to oiler base product like your foundation) and may settle in unflattering spots if you apply to heavily or your foundation is still very fresh. I have to wait a couple mins for my base to set before applying powder.&lt;br /&gt;Is it the best set? Nah, but a great learning set and decent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice a \\&quot;baby powder\\&quot; smell, but if you do, it&#x27;s probably the talc.</li>
            <li> The product was awesome well rapped its one of the best purchase ive made ....and for the prize ...cant beat it</li>
            <li> Once you order this product its not what it looks like in the pic! Such a rip off! Its way different and the blushes are small circles not even large as shown on the photo! That photo is actually a Coastal Scents blush palette. Do not buy! Cheap blushes and waste of money! Once again, DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE MONEY AND WASTE DAYS OF BUYING AND WAITING FOR THIS PRODUCT TO COME.</li>
            <li> Love it was ex tacitly what I expected and for such a great price totally satisfied with my blush pallete</li>
            <li> when i got this product in the mail i was soooo happy i couldn&#x27;t wait to open it. unfortunately when i did open it, the colors inside were broken and it was a disaster. at the moment im trying to contact them to see if i can get a new product. so cross your fingers that i get it..</li>
            <li> I was surprised for the price of this item how much I love it. A very little blush goes a long way. I only use the blush, which is kind of a waste of the rest of the pallet but I can&#x27;t find a use for it, especially the really white one. The pallet is much much bigger than shown</li>
            <li> Not creamy, all pressed powder.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Color doesn&#x27;t show up at all. The darkest color is not dark at all. This does not work. Don&#x27;t buy. I&#x27;ll never use this</li>
            <li> The product was broken. Do not order this product.  They do not ship things packaged well enough to keep it from breaking. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because some people said the same thing however it was true.  The top right pink color is much brighter than shown but I will never get to use it because it was shattered.  Buy from someone that packages things well like bh cosmetics or something else.  very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Just received today. The white powder was broken and was all over the whole palette. I am happy with the rest of the palette just wish it didn&#x27;t come with the broken color.</li>
            <li> I am requesting a full refund. The product came completely destroyed and made a huge mess all over my bathroom when I opened it. None of the circles were salvaged.</li>
            <li> Not the colors pictured. Hot pink and an orangish brown. I can make the other colors work but the blush colors won&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> First of all, this palette is way bigger than I thought it would be, so I think it&#x27;s a good price for the size. The colors that appear darker in the picture are a little lighter in the actual palette, but I don&#x27;t really mind. I&#x27;ve used the yellowy/tanish color mixed with the white for setting makeup under my eyes and it works great! Ive had many dry patches on my skin, including near my eye area and everytime I would try to set my makeup, you could tell I had very dry skin underneath, but with this palette I don&#x27;t have that problem, so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The second I opened it there was this very strong chemical scent to it. It smells almost like wet paint. I used it on my face once and broke out in hives. I do not have sensitive skin and never before have I broken out in hives after using a makeup product. I feel like there is probably a very high lead content in it and I advise people to spend a little extra money on a product that won&#x27;t eventually end up killing  you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and a colleague of my has the pallette in the picture. I&#x27;ve tried hers and I loved it so much that I wanted to purchase one for my own kit. First of all I did not receive the pallette in the picture. When I took it out of the packaging the entire outer cover was COVERED in powder. 2 of them are broken. The ones that are not broken are junk. A cakey powdery mess I might as well just spray baby powder all over someone&#x27;s face. I know you risk a bad product when its cheap but since I&#x27;ve used one that someone has already bought I didn&#x27;t think I needed to worry. I at very least expect to receive the product that&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! Every time I contour with this I get compliments. The product is not to heavy and does not give a powder look.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple of weeks ago and got it in the mail today and I am very disappointed with what I received. I ordered the palette for the purpose of contouring! That&#x27;s what the name says! What is advertised is not what you will receive. The darkest shade in the palette cannot provide the contour my skin tone required, and my skin tone is fair/medium. The color pay off is great for what I paid but if you want a palette for contouring, look somewhere else. They are refunding me my money though, so that&#x27;s an upside I guess.</li>
            <li> The colors are not what it looks like. Useless colors. He darkest one isn&#x27;t even dark enough. And my skin is not even dark. And it spells like paint.</li>
            <li> it is a good product for blushing and contouring you could even take it with you if you wanna travel</li>
            <li> The product feels like I&#x27;m apply dirty dust on my face. Barely has any color and only makes my feel and look ashy.</li>
            <li> More of a seller issue than product issue but after waiting 6 weeks for my order with no tracking, it arrived broken! There was no salvaging it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will say, from what little I was able to touch of these powders, they are very pimgented and feel silky but I feel as though they might feel heavy as you build up for the look.</li>
            <li> The powder smells like paint... Works ok but makes your face smell like paint which last all day. I&#x27;d recommend a different product.</li>
            <li> The pallet came with broken, The pigment seems to be ok. i&#x27;m not mad because i paid so little but in the end its not worth it.</li>
            <li> i received this pallet with Broken blush and contour&lt;br /&gt;i was hoping they had a (Fragile) Sticker on the package ,BUT IT DIDNTTTTT !!!!</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t come broken, the colors in the palette don&#x27;t match the image. Like others have said, the dark brown shown in the image is actually more of a medium tan. Thankfully I have light skin so I should be able to use it for contouring still, but anyone with darker than fair skin should probably look for a different contouring palette.</li>
            <li> Colors look nothing like picture. Way Lighter. No pigmentation. Flimsy packaging. Would not repurchase or recommend to anyone. Just spend more and buy from a direct website.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this from this seller if you are expecting to receive what is pictured! The product I received was completely different and contained colors that don&#x27;t even show up on my skin for contouring. The product is cheap, so save your money and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> Loving this so far got it yesterday and completely intact. Loving it so far, nothing bad to say about it. The only thing I would say is no sparkle in the pink blush. But the red is awesome</li>
            <li> its just perfect, this product will make your face look smooth and it will shine, im pleased with this product and will buy alot more in future!</li>
            <li> Always a bummer when you get a package and this is what it looks like. Did this happens to anyone else ?</li>
            <li> The plate is very large that you can keep it for a long time</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m going to start contouring with this. This is perfect for beginners the coverage is light but I expected this for the price I paid for it. This product did take about a month to be delivered. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great beginner contour pallet. Not very pigmented. But for the price it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Nooo, don&#x27;t buy this, the brown contouring is not even dark is super light it doesn&#x27;t even show on your face!! very disappointed, I shoud&#x27;ve read the reviews before buying this :(</li>
            <li> Omg. This is the best blush color set I found so far. I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and these smooth tones are perfect to create all your makeup needs. Ladies please if to you buy this product and give any bad review learn how to use the product develop a technique on how to apply the blushes and you will be very satisfied.  I&#x27;m a guy and I practice looks on myself before I do a client. Please research and learn how the product is used and for what. This is a super  buy</li>
            <li> Shipping for this item was free and took 8 days to arrive for me. The product picture is a little misleading because the palette I received did not have any Blush colors. This doesn&#x27;t bother me because i was looking for the contour colors and not the pinks anyway. Overall i think this is a great deal, its comparable to the coastal scent palette for about half the money. (the one i purchased was 8.98 through ever lighting) All colors are matte pressed powder and are pretty pigmented and long lasting.I think its a great deal for people who are just learning to contour Or need something for everyday use. This is a link to a picture i took of the palette i received.  [...]</li>
            <li> I received my package as said in the estimated date. Very good packaging and the casing is pretty durable. However, when I opened up the product, the contour colors appear to be a bit lighter than the pictures. I was disappointed.. But I absolutely love the blush colors. They are more of coral colors than pink. Overall, it was worth the price I paid for.</li>
            <li> The palette was horrible, nothing like the photo. Nor was the quality worth anything. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to waste their money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this pallet so much! My mom and my grandmother now want me to get them one because they love the highlighter and the blush. I have been using this everyday since I received this, so for about a month and a half. I will definitely order again. Oh and just so you know before you buy this is that the colors are really pigmented so a little goes a long way. So I just put on a light swipe blush and it gives off the perfect color. So nice :3</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I use this palette for my makeup every day. Some of the colors can be a little intimidatng, but this palette is an amazing but cheap. There are tutorials by Gigi/Gregory Gorgeous on youtube if at any point you are confused.</li>
            <li> Smh, not for professionals.</li>
            <li> I use every single color in this palette!  It works great and the color stays on for a long time even without primer!</li>
            <li> love this product. good quality.</li>
            <li> One of my FAV makeup kits! Had NO idea how hugh the palettes were and I absolutely LOVED IT! Ready to order another.</li>
            <li> the Product came cavered with powder and two section were broken up...i do not recomend any1 to buy this ..waste of money n u will be dissapointed.!!</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it. It&#x27;s not what I thought it was going to be but it&#x27;s amazing and did I say I love it lol.üòÄ</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to try out a contouring technique with but didn&#x27;t want to invest in a pricier brand. After trying this out, I&#x27;m sorry to say that it just doesn&#x27;t work well. The pigments are heavy and strong--too strong to get any decent looking contour effect without ending up looking like a clown. It also seemed to irritate my skin after I applied it very lightly. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item--the colors and content just isn&#x27;t worth even the relatively low price tag.</li>
            <li> Not good!!! I recieved blush instead of a contour palate</li>
            <li> I have expected a little better quality from this product, but it is was a good bargain for the money.</li>
            <li> The colors are not exactly as shown.  Colors have great pigmentation.  Pallete is good overall for ua beginners.  Great for practice.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and the darkest color was a light color. I do not recommend this as a contouring pallet</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and a little goes a long way. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Amazing just like the picture and got to me wayyyyyy before the expected delivery date....BUT IT&#x27;S HUGE! :/ the size of a notebook almost!!!!! Wanted something a lil more compact but no worries it&#x27;s awesome :)</li>
            <li> I arrived damaged product, made powder shadows</li>
            <li> The product finally arrived after nearly 2 weeks and after opening the package i noticed there was makeup all over the box inside the packaging. I opened the cover and found 2 of the palletes completely broken and makeup was scattered everywhere inside the container. Irreversibly damaged I am not happy and will be requesting a refund.</li>
            <li> My first one was completely damaged but my second one is just perfect! I love it</li>
            <li> I had to throw it away it came broken</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PALLETTE! THE COLORS ARE VERY NICE AND PIGMENTED, DEF WOULD BUY AGAIN üòÑ</li>
            <li> I got the wrong palette!!!!!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a decent product. The pallet I received isn&#x27;t the same as the one in picture. Shades are WAY different and the contour shade was WAY too light (I have very fair skin and it was still too light) A lot of reviews mention a strong smell,  I don&#x27;t smell any thing other than the usual light, makeup smell. That was a plus. I wish I had recieved the colors in the picture,  but I will be able to use the ones I got one way or another.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the texture. Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I ordered my palette on September 1st and I just received it on October 23 and it was covered in scratches and diffrent colors than in the picture</li>
            <li> Great!  Better than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I wanted to experiment with contouring and bought this product for fun and because it was cheap, and you get what you pay for really. It&#x27;s super bad for your skin, it almost feel like baby powder and it dries your skin real fast. I DO NOT RECOMMEND, not even for fun or one time use. I threw it out after a couple of times. Try Balm products for contouring! I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li> Yes it was everything I thought that it would be</li>
            <li> When I first got this and tried to use it I dabbed my brush into it too hard. Bc this thing is pretty pigmented.i love it and would order it again in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> The colors were not true to what the picture shows.  The white and blush are the only colors that were close to what is shown.</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered this and I expect it to be EXACTLY like what I see in the picture I wanted the brown colors and the highlighting color not a bunch of pinks!!! I am beyond outraged right now. If I wanted blush I would&#x27;ve ordered blush but I wanted the contouring palette!!!! Ugh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was broken when I received it !!!!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!!! Great price and very big. It&#x27;s bigger in person than it looks on camera which is a super good thing. Comparable to more expensive contour pallets. Must use with the proper brushes. I wanted the pallet with the Orange color in it, but this one works just as well for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I was soo excited to get this product. I just received it today and it was complete damage case was also damage from inside.</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s not like the picture, I recived different color&lt;br /&gt;Second it was damaged once I get it&lt;br /&gt; I will give 0 out of 10</li>
            <li> I received my make in a timely fashion but it&#x27;s the wrong palette  . I wanted the one that was displayed in cart.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE, my make up is 100% because of this üôåüèΩüòòüòò</li>
            <li> This is a contour palette of powders. Which means you powder it on top of a liquid contour or regular foundation routine. The white and blush colors show up very well. However the brown doesn&#x27;t but that&#x27;s okay considering professionals know bronzers work best for that kind of definition. IF YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF HOW TO CONTOUR PLEASE DON&#x27;T WRITE A NEGATIVE REVIEW. I read the negative and one star reviews before purchasing just in case. They have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about. This palette is cheap and amazing.</li>
            <li> So I got my pallet in the mail today and when I ordered it you offered a brush so I got the brush as well and I gotta say the brush is REALLY soft feels amazing on my skin but it also feels really weak but it works for blush and buffering. And as for the makeup I find is AMAZING!!! I love it(:</li>
            <li> The colours I got DID NOT include the reddish clours shown, I wanted the rosy cheeks but didnt get any reddish colours. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist so naturally I gravitate towards palettes. So I ordered this one due to the affordable price. I received this palette about three weeks ago and I can say that I will do enjoy it. I really enjoy the softness of the powders, the blendablilty of the powders, and the ease of have one palette. My only problem is that the color of the product in the picture is not the actually color in real life. (Also the colors are setup that way.)  The colors are so light that the contour shades only work as contours for my fair, light, and sometimes my medium toned clients. I am currently hunting for a darker palette for my medium, tan, and dark toned clients. But other than that I is great. I would recommend and repurchase if ever necessary.</li>
            <li> The brown for contouring is more like a dirty blonde color,it is not  like the picture shows ,blush colors are ok</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item.. I have used it multiple times and will continue to order it. I have it in three different shades. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This was exactly the pallet I needed. It was such an affordable price and it arrived to me much earlier than initially predicted. I&#x27;m very pleased with the colors and how pigmented this pallet is. This is definitely one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and was cheap. The only concern I have is that the Jockeying palate is a lot lighter than I had anticipated!</li>
            <li> This is getting 2 stars because it came sooner than I&#x27;d expect. Unfortunately, the colors are nothing like the picture. The contour color is more of a beige tone which couldn&#x27;t contour even the fairest of complexion.</li>
            <li> Honestly it came broken but other than that the powders are good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a half a year and thought the colours are not like in the photo they&#x27;re still very good. the only thing is they&#x27;re out of order and the pinks aren&#x27;t very pink. but like I&#x27;ve said; I&#x27;ve used it for half a year and it works for me. the pallet itself isn&#x27;t good for contouring, I&#x27;ve tried and the darkest brown just blends into my skin and as I am fairly pale I do not recommend this for that but otherwise yeah.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it. I think it&#x27;s really great for beginners, aspiring artists, or even just anyone looking for a set to use daily, for travel, or to just experiment with. This is definitely a good option for people who don&#x27;t want to blow a lot of money on expensive makeup they may not like if they&#x27;re just starting out and don&#x27;t know what to look for, I know I hate myself in the morning when I do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The colors are all very pigmented and surprisingly, the matte highlight (the white) looks great. I thought it would look chalky or odd, but it actually looks really natural and I&#x27;m 98% sure that I like it more than shimmery highlights because of that. I also like that the contour shade is completely matte, I get why some bronzers are shimmery, but contours should be matte if you actually want to give the illusion of more sculpted features. The blushes are nice, however, I don&#x27;t use them because the pink is definitely blue-toned and my cool/yellow undertones just can&#x27;t make it work. The other shade would probably suit really cool toned skin too or maybe warm skin. I&#x27;m personally not a fan of the color itself so I don&#x27;t use it. The other two colors, I just use to help blend the contour or to go over areas with slight discolouration. All of the colors are very smooth and I have no problem picking up product with my brushes because of their color payoff. They don&#x27;t blend AS easily as other products on the market, but they still blend pretty well with a little work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The case is large but very thin. I don&#x27;t know if I would ever travel with it because of it&#x27;s size and because I mostly just use the contour and highlight, but I suppose a lot of other people would if they actually use all of the shades in the palette frequently. One thing worth mentioning though is that the palette feels a bit flimsy (I think because the plastic isn&#x27;t thick enough for the size), but since I don&#x27;t abuse my makeup or plan on travelingwith it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this is the same exact palette that BH Cosmetics and Coastal Scents sell, I think a few other brands sell it too under their own labels.</li>
            <li> great price, great size, great colors! everything i could possibly need for a cheek in any beauty makeup situation! love!</li>
            <li> Came totally broken. I could not even use it, all the pieces were shattered. Being that it comes from China, I tried getting someone in customer service to call me and it was useless. Save the hassle and waste of money, buy coastal scents instead.</li>
            <li> I think in the cases of such things like these palettes it&#x27;s most helpful to say where or which seller you purchase from, especially if the experience is good, as there are in fact three types of theses contour pallets out there and like many others I also either got the one not pictured or a broken one. Now since we generally cannot talk about a negative seller experience here I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t mention who we actually did get the &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; pallet from, helping others avoid going thru what some of us unfortunately have. For me three times was a charm, however, I saw that Olymstore was on the list of sellers and I&#x27;ve bought from them before with a positive experience. I simply emailed them in advance asking them if they could verify that the item was as pictured, which they did very quickly.... no problem, and that would be my best advice to anyone ordering this item if you want to be sure you are getting the one pictured. As always, I received it from them quickly and undamaged..... yay....I finally got the one I was looking for and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Just like the BH or Coastal one but for 8 bucks whoooo hooooo It is awesome, I love it and have been playing with it about every day. You only need a light hand, and can build if you need to, also you can mix some colors to lighten as you wish and blend blend blend.</li>
            <li> awful quality, but that&#x27;s what i expected.</li>
            <li> After reading another review that recommended ordering from Olymstore, I did the same. It arrived in perfect condition. A few of the colors are slightly different than in the picture but for me that&#x27;s actually a good thing. The pale pink (bottom left) is actually a light brown, and the more muted pink (bottom right) is actually orange. Seems like it will last a long time and is quite pigmented.</li>
            <li> I cannot rate this product because I have YET to receive it!!!!!!!!!! Where is my stuff? Seriously. Where is it?</li>
