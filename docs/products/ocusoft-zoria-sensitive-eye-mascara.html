            <li> I love this sensitive mascara. I have very sensitive eyes and wear contacts. This is the only mascara I have found that I can use without problems.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for contact lens users. No schmutz to drop into your eyes. Goes on smooth and just feels right. &lt;br /&gt;Try it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> This mascara was very good. It did not make my eyes get red and teary. It goes on wet and takes a bit to dry. So I have to put the first coat on first before appling the rest of my make up.  Then I apply the last coat. It lasts all day without flaking. Not to be used it lengthening is wanted.</li>
            <li> I moved to Maine a few years ago.  Apparently I&#x27;m allergic to this beautiful state, because within a year I developed bumps inside my eyelids (giant papillary conjunctivitis or GPC... don&#x27;t look it up; it&#x27;s really gross).  I could no longer wear my contacts or mascara (horror!).  After about two years of nothing around my eyes (not even eye cream), the bumps finally subsided, but every time I tried to wear contacts or mascara my eyes would be tearing up and itching within an hour.  Very annoying, and lousy for my ego to be seen in glasses with no mascara!  Finally, after five years of this, I&#x27;d had enough and did a search online for mascara for sensitive eyes.  I came across the Physician&#x27;s Formula and the Ocusoft mascara.  I ordered both, and received them within days of each other.  I didn&#x27;t like the brush that came with the Physician&#x27;s Formula, and my eyes definitely reacted to the mascara.  I had high hopes for the Ocusoft, because this is the same maker of the eyelid scrub that I&#x27;ve been using for the past 4 years for my GPC, which works really well.  I tried the Ocusoft mascara one evening (so I could take it off if it hurt my eyes), and sure enough my eyes started stinging a little bit.  I left it on for about 2 hours, but was very disappointed that it seemed to be the same as the other mascaras.  About a week later, I decided to try it again because I had an important function to go to.  I put the mascara on in the morning (determined to tough it out all day), and was thrilled to discover that I was able to wear it all day with no problems whatsoever!  I wore it again the next day, and again had no problems at all.  I skipped the third day (feeling that I shouldn&#x27;t push it), but that was a couple of weeks ago and I&#x27;ve pretty much been wearing the mascara every day since then.  I do skip a day every once in a while, just out of fear I&#x27;ll overdo it, but I&#x27;ve had no problems at all and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled.  My mom has always had problems with mascara, too (she has dry-eye syndrome), so I&#x27;m going to recommend this to her.  And, for anyone else with sensitive eyes, I did finally discover a great lotion that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes: Gold Bond Soothing Fragrance-Free.  It&#x27;s a body lotion, so it&#x27;s intense enough to hydrate my whole face (I had been using eye cream on my whole face to avoid hurting my eyes), but sensitive enough that I can put it right up under my eyes at night with no problems.  So, now that I have Ocusoft mascara and Gold Bond lotion, I&#x27;m a happy camper!  Yay Ocusoft!!!she has dry-eye syndrome), so I&#x27;m going to recommend this to her.

            <li> I bought this mascara because I have very sensitive eyes and I thought it was non-irritating. However, my eyes were still irritated but the worst part is that it was very difficult to remove. I had to use eye makeup remover twice to try to get it all off and it still looked like a bit of it was remaining as a smudged area under my lower lashes. A gentle, non-irritating mascara should also be easy to remove and this wasn&#x27;t. I will continue my search for a non-irritating mascara that is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Ocusoft mascara answered the problems with my eyes. I had irritated, blood shot and dry eyes continually.  Eye doctors perscribed eye drops that temporarily worked. But it seem like any mascara that I tried would burn my eyes as soon as I put it on.  I have been using Ocusoft Mascara for a month and no longer have issues with my eyes.  The only problem with Ocusoft, is that it doesn&#x27;t tends to want to hold a curl when I try to curl my lashes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I saw a mascara that I could use on my eyelashes because of my blepharitis.  I just put a little on to try it and by the end of the day right before I washed it off, it was burning and I couldn&#x27;t see very well.  Very disappointed.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to go without mascara altogether.</li>
            <li> I hate it when a cosmetic is discontinued.  I am super sensitive to everything and it takes a lot of wasted money trying to find something I do not react to.  My mascara that I have used for years is no longer made and I had to start the whole process all over again.  I did a search and found the Ocusoft information.  From that I went on to trusty Amazon and they offered it.  I&#x27;ve used it four days now and it is great.  My eyes are not puffy, red or itching.  It doesn&#x27;t thicken your eyelashes but it does make them noticeable.  The only problem I find with it is that it is hard to wash off.  I can&#x27;t use soaps around my eyes, so I just have to use water and it doesn&#x27;t easily get rid of the mascara.  But all in all - I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever used that never irritated my eyes.  It didn&#x27;t smudge easily.  It washes off gently with water.</li>
            <li> After years &amp; years of buying and returning mascaras that irritated my very sensitive eyes, I have found one that does not!! Ocusoft is like a gift from the gods for me. Yes it does take a few minutes to dry, so try not to blink too much when you first apply it. It is sadly not waterproof, but, hey, I can wear it without having burning eyes. If nothing else has worked for you, try this one!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara is o.k.  It gets clumpy and it seems like it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> This mascara is good for sensitive eyes but does not do much for the eyelash... It does not thicken or lenthen the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The only Mascara I can and will wear.  I have been using it for years.  I hope they do not stop making it.  It does not irritate my eyes like other mascara.</li>
            <li> The tube I received seem very watery. Not sure why. Previous tube was not like that.</li>
            <li> After trying hypo allergenic, sensitive eyes, and any other mascara, Ocusoft does not affect my eyes, and I am again able to wear mascara. Takes a minute to dry, so don&#x27;t blink!</li>
            <li> I have grey/white eyelashes and want a natural look that highlights my eyes. This mascara darkens lashes without clumping and doesn&#x27;t feel stiff on my lashes. Dries out a little bit faster than other brands but still worth it.</li>
            <li> The mascara succeeds in preventing an allergic reaction; however, it doesn&#x27;t thicken the lashes at all.</li>

            <li> This mascara irritated my eyes the same as other brands that I&#x27;ve used for allergic/sensitive eyes.  It also smudged excessively and didn&#x27;t dry quickly when applied.  I would not recommend this product.</li>

Unlike Zoria, it actually worked, and it was so nice to wear mascara again.  While it took a little longer to dry than my previous mascaras, it wasn&#x27;t a problem unless I happened to sneeze, which rarely happened.  Zoria seems wet, and I can&#x27;t get it to even show up on my eyelashes.  Even applying it with great care it splashes onto my eyelids and cheeks.  And it costs more than twice as much.  I don&#x27;t get it...and you shouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> AAfter having rk surgery my eyes could NOT wear any mascara without watering uncontrollably.  This product has allowed me to wear makeup again. Its fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; have found it is the only product I can wear without too much irritation. Plus, it&#x27;s way better than SUNCOAT which is just a sticky mess!!</li>
