            <li> Great product.  It feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> realy fantastic!!!! I use all life!!!!</li>
            <li> Great face cream, loved it a lot,made my over 55 yrs skin feel and look great. purchased product again.</li>
            <li> I like the carapex face day cream. It feels like it is working, I do see improvement in firming.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much. My face normally breaks out easily so I can&#x27;t put on day cream daily but I can with this product. It&#x27;s not greasy and my face feels great afterwards. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I have allergies, rosacea, and sensitive skin and this cream I can wear with absolutely no bad reaction - such as sneezing, swollen eyes, blotchy red skin. Finally, I&#x27;ve found a cream that I can use.  It&#x27;s not advertised as &amp;#34;No Fragrance&amp;#34; but I cannot detect a scent.  The cream itself glides on and feels very good on the skin and a little goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t have to slather it on to feel it working. Makeup, whether mineral powder or liquid foundation, glides on over it without pilling.  The jars have flat lids which makes for easy storage in the cabinet. I love this product.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for. Fragrance free and no sunscreen, which I cannot wear. It has greatly improved my skin.</li>
            <li> Works, keeps the wrinkles at a minimum</li>
            <li> I really loved this cream ,made my face feel softer,look younger! I am in my sixties,so it&#x27;s really a challenge to get a cream that really works,this one does.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have sensitive skin and have had no bad reactions.  I am stilling using the product.</li>
            <li> The day cream is fragrance free (love!), paraben-free, harsh chemical-free, and never tested on animals. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and is light enough to apply makeup over without any issues. I love it, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Goes well with the night cream.  No perfume and no oder. Nice for day.</li>
            <li> Great to find an unscented facial product.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> Creamy texture; funny smell.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have the worst dry skin and since I&#x27;ve turned 40 has only gotten worse, but this stuff actually works. My skin no longer feels like reptile skin.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and find this to be a great, but light, cream for wintertime.  I&#x27;m thinking it would be even better for warmer months.  Works well under foundation.  I&#x27;ve switched to using a heavy cream for nighttime that is supposed to be for general body use, since it&#x27;s so dry where I live (which has yielded the best results of anything I&#x27;ve tried) but still use this during the day.  It has a nice, clean feeling to it.    The one I&#x27;m using at night, in case you want to know, is from a company called Shea Moisture, and it&#x27;s Raw Shea Butter Body Lotion w/Frankincense &amp; Myrrh.  If you are prone to breakouts you might not want to put it on your face, but otherwise it&#x27;s seriously great.  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering to me, but I could see if you had a sensitivity to smells you might think so.  I got mine at Target for under $10.</li>
