            <li>Plus...came very quickly!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved it got so many compliments on the headband!</li>
            <li>Waiting to wear for wedding,  but looks nice and seems to be good quality.  </li>

            <li>Looks even better than the picture!</li>
            <li>LOVE this headband!</li>
            <li>absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Bendable which is nice.</li>
            <li>Very beautiful but very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I read the great reviews before purchasing and I have to say that they are true.</li>
            <li>and you can bend it very easy.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and worked great for my wedding day.</li>
            <li>It has a much more naturally flowing appearance than some of the tiara looks out there, and the beading gives it just the perfect amount of sparkle, so as not to be overbearing.</li>
            <li>My daughter will be wearing this piece around her mounded curls at her first communion, but it would also make a great piece for a bride.</li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>I bought this item as I was looking for something to wear in my hair that wasn&#x27;t over the top.  </li>
            <li>My daughter fell in love with this headband.</li>
            <li>It looks better in person.</li>
            <li>But I love it .</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the item and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Got many compliments, great quality, not tight on head!</li>
            <li>Also, the headband itself bends so you can sort of mold it to your head which makes it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers said, it has the perfect amount of sparkle.</li>
            <li>I was originally going to have a very loose/random wreath of flowers made, I loved this item when I found it.</li>
            <li>fit well and the metal can bend some for a custom fit, can also use bobby pins to secure in place using the holes at the tips of the band.</li>
            <li>You can also bend it to fit your head.</li>
            <li>Looks really good in person, was pleasantly surprised with the quality</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments and felt like a pretty bride without feeling like a spectacle~</li>
            <li>, definitely recommend to buy this one, good price</li>
            <li>They shipped it pretty quickly too!</li>
            <li>Got it in the mail really quickly</li>
            <li>is beautiful but the quality leaves a little to be desired</li>

            <li>I love this Tiara, it is very shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed for my wedding!  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s really pretty!</li>
            <li>Design of the tiara is very airy and light.</li>
            <li>Probably once my hair is all fixed up for my wedding, it will wear better.</li>
            <li>Turns out that it is very pretty and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sit on my head quite right.</li>
            <li>It is pretty bendable, so you have to be careful, but it&#x27;s gorgeous and the pictures don&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li>I got married last Saturday, and this little tiara/headband was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>When I read one reviewer&#x27;s email that she was in her 50s and didn&#x27;t want to go over the top either, but wanted something simple, I was sold.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for...except it was...</li>
            <li>At first, I was nervous purchasing this headband because there in no picture on a model.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something cute, not too big for my head and something tasteful.</li>
            <li>It is so pretty in person.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stick up\\&quot; like a tiara, but gives a nice amount of sparkle to my dark hair.  </li>
            <li>Arrived VERY promptly.</li>
            <li>so be careful taking it out of the package and store somewhere safe.</li>
            <li>Very sparkly and well-made.</li>
            <li>It was just enough bling to make me feel special without having something that screamed &amp;#34;look at me&amp;#34; on my head.</li>
            <li>Very delicate and much more pretty in real life.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something delicate and cute</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more fragile and delicate looking</li>
            <li>Each little leaf has 5 little crystals on it, it&#x27;s so precious.</li>
            <li>I wanted something special to wear for my wedding which will be small and simple.</li>

            <li> This Tiara is bright and beautiful! I am impressed. I may buy a few for my bridesmaids. Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I love this headband! I&#x27;m wearing it for my wedding and it&#x27;s so perfect! It is pretty bendable, so you have to be careful, but it&#x27;s gorgeous and the pictures don&#x27;t do it justice.They shipped it pretty quickly too!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to wear this in my wedding. Arrived VERY promptly. Bendable which is nice.</li>
            <li> Just tried it on and I love it! Sturdy, delicate, not cheap looking at all. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it for the wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal is delicate so be careful taking it out of the package and store somewhere safe.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed for my wedding!  The headband is adjustable and the two tiny hoops at each end made it possible to fasten my veil to.  The decorations of the pearl flowers and crystals are just beautiful and i can wear this to give any other outfit some extra sparkle.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as I was looking for something to wear in my hair that wasn&#x27;t over the top.  When I read one reviewer&#x27;s email that she was in her 50s and didn&#x27;t want to go over the top either, but wanted something simple, I was sold.  It is perfect!  I am so happy with the item and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, it has the perfect amount of sparkle. Not bulky at all. Very delicate and much more pretty in real life.</li>
            <li> fit well and the metal can bend some for a custom fit, can also use bobby pins to secure in place using the holes at the tips of the band.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous headband. My wife looked beautiful in the wedding photos.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a beautiful quality piece. I look forward to wearing it at my wedding!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and great price!</li>
            <li> Looks really good in person, was pleasantly surprised with the quality</li>
            <li> Very beautiful but very flimsy. Doesn&#x27;t sit on my head quite right. Probably once my hair is all fixed up for my wedding, it will wear better.</li>
            <li> Very lovely, great  price.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail really quickly &amp; it&#x27;s really pretty! Was nervous about buying it online especially for my wedding but I really love it!</li>
            <li> Looks even better than the picture! I&#x27;m so happy I ordered this and can&#x27;t wait to try it with my wedding dress!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it got so many compliments on the headband!</li>
            <li> My niece looked very pretty at her wedding.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and worked great for my wedding day. Exactly what I was looking for...except it was...WAY less expensive than other items that I found.  Plus...came very quickly!!</li>
            <li> So beautiful! It looks even prettier in person. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> My daughter fell in love with this headband. Very sparkly and well-made. She has worn it for her choral programs and just recently for Easter. People always seem to notice it.</li>
            <li> At first, I was nervous purchasing this headband because there in no picture on a model.  I wanted a sparkly headband for my wedding.  Turns out that it is very pretty and exactly what I wanted.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stick up\\&quot; like a tiara, but gives a nice amount of sparkle to my dark hair.  Also, the headband itself bends so you can sort of mold it to your head which makes it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I used this for my country wedding. It was just enough bling to make me feel special without having something that screamed &amp;#34;look at me&amp;#34; on my head.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something cute, not too big for my head and something tasteful. This headband is very good quality and very beautiful. I am a petite girl and last thing I wonted is to end up wearing something over-sized or tacky on my head but this tiara is just perfect. It&#x27;s not too big and definitely not tacky. It looks better in person. Each little leaf has 5 little crystals on it, it&#x27;s so precious. Design of the tiara is very airy and light. It&#x27;s more fragile and delicate looking then it looks on the picture. The photo on the website looks a little bulky to me and because of that I was a little nervous but it was not the case. It&#x27;s sparkle a lot too. If you are looking for something delicate and cute this headband is for you. You can also bend it to fit your head. The little flowers and leafs are flexible too, you can turn them a little if you wish. I am very happy with this product :)</li>
            <li> I got married last Saturday, and this little tiara/headband was perfect for me. It was my second wedding and I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, so I didn&#x27;t want anything big or gaudy. It was perfect!  I received so many compliments and felt like a pretty bride without feeling like a spectacle~</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this item. My daughter will be wearing this piece around her mounded curls at her first communion, but it would also make a great piece for a bride. This headband has a very delicate appearance, but would hold up well if dropped. I was originally going to have a very loose/random wreath of flowers made, I loved this item when I found it. It has a much more naturally flowing appearance than some of the tiara looks out there, and the beading gives it just the perfect amount of sparkle, so as not to be overbearing. The price is lower than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> Got many compliments, great quality, not tight on head!</li>
            <li> LOVE this headband! It is so pretty in person. I was very impressed for the price on Amazon. I read the great reviews before purchasing and I have to say that they are true. This head band is gorgeous and fits perfectly. Shipped carefully and well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful head piece and it does stand out, not so heavy either, definitely recommend to buy this one, good price too.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to wear it for my wedding.</li>
            <li> I love this Tiara, it is very shiny and pretty. I used this tiara for my court wedding and received a lot of complements.</li>

            <li> is beautiful but the quality leaves a little to be desired</li>
            <li> Excellent and a great value. I wanted something special to wear for my wedding which will be small and simple. This was the perfect addition.</li>
            <li> Came in earlier. It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> Waiting to wear for wedding,  but looks nice and seems to be good quality.  Received promptly.</li>
