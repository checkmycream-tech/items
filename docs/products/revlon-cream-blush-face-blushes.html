            <li>...highly recommended product - revlon cream blush just slides on smoothly and gives a nice color to your cheeks.</li>
            <li>I love thisi product because it&#x27;s so creamy and becomes a part of your cheeks instead of just staying on the surface as a powder would do.  </li>

            <li>My favorite blush of all time</li>
            <li>Revlon Cream Blush&#x27;s Berry Flirtatious was a favorite of mine two years ago.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite blush, love the color and the fact that its a cream,&lt;br /&gt;hard to find in stores around my area.</li>
            <li>Decided that my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin would look better with a cream blush instead of the powder blush type that I had been using since my Dad allowed me to use make-up.  </li>
            <li>This is especially important for older skin with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Used for a long time and its the perfect color with everything</li>
            <li>It blends to a beautiful, natural shade and it&#x27;s easy to apply whether you use your fingers or a blush brush.  </li>
            <li>I believe it would work on darker skin tones as well as it blends so easy</li>
            <li>I loved the color and the feel of it as a cream blush.&lt;br /&gt;Finding a replacement for this particular products has been a lot of work.</li>
            <li>So smooth and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>So happy to find this...wish they would put it back on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light mauve that makes one&#x27;s cheeks stand out without screaming.  </li>

            <li>How excited to find it again.  </li>

            <li>This cream blush went on smoothly and looked similar to my natural blush color.  </li>

            <li> I used this product for severely years and then it disappeared from the shelves.  I am happy that you were able to supply it.</li>
            <li> I use this under my powder blush. It is moist and lasts most of the day when paired with powder blush. When I don&#x27;t use it, my face looks and feels too dry.</li>
            <li> ...highly recommended product - revlon cream blush just slides on smoothly and gives a nice color to your cheeks. can&#x27;t get enough of it!  thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Used for a long time and its the perfect color with everything</li>
            <li> Revlon, read these reviews!!!  Why do companies discontinue products that customers want and like, wish to purchase? The &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; cream blush, .12 oz/3.4g/3,4g, no mirror on case is necessary, no. 18 Berry Flirtatious is a great color.  I have purchased your new replacement one and it is not good, will be returning it and continue to try to find the discontinued one. If not successful, I will have to go to another company. Please bring it back!!!</li>

            <li> by Revlon.  As soon as I heard that, I immediately got on Amazon and ordered one.  Wonderful cream blush, especially for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; women.  The Berry Flirtatious color is perfect for my skin coloring.</li>
            <li> I love Revlon&#x27;s Cream Blush!  This is one of the best.  A Cream Blush is best for my skin and I&#x27;m glad I can still buy this one which is my all-time favorite!  Diane in FL</li>
            <li> Wife likes it, but it&#x27;s pricey for on purchasing.</li>
            <li> will re-order again--less money than macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It is a great product!</li>
            <li> It is very good makeup. It last a long time. .</li>
            <li> My favorite blush of all time and it got to me so quickly.  Very pleased all the way around.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> the best cream blush anywhere--</li>
            <li> Its getting hard to find this blush in stores.  I wont settle for another brand.  Its smooth and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I order this for an elderly friend who has no computer access and she just loves it.  I&#x27;ve ordered it several times and each time it is here quickly.  I always know where I can find it easily and have it quickly.  She loves it!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.great price ,easy ordering and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Revlon Cream Blush&#x27;s Berry Flirtatious was a favorite of mine two years ago.  I loved the color and the feel of it as a cream blush.&lt;br /&gt;Finding a replacement for this particular products has been a lot of work. How excited to find it again.  This color does not show up well on the computer screen. It&#x27;s a light mauve that makes one&#x27;s cheeks stand out without screaming.  The texture of the cream is not overbearing nor is it a shine signal.  It&#x27;s the perfect compliment to anyone&#x27;s look.</li>
            <li> So smooth and easy to blend. Very natural appearing blush. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and suddenly couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores. I was so disappointed because there is nothing else like it out there.</li>
            <li> This cream blush went on smoothly and looked similar to my natural blush color.  It&#x27;s not in the stores anymore...have to go looking for something else</li>
            <li> Searched everywhere for this discontinued item that I&#x27;ve been using for years.. Excellent product, blends beautifully and looks natural. Bought several and shared with my 71 year old mother who has also been upset with revlon for discontinuing cream blushes.</li>
            <li> Great color. Hard to find in drugstores. Been using it for years. Great price</li>
            <li> this is my favorite blush, love the color and the fact that its a cream,&lt;br /&gt;hard to find in stores around my area.</li>
            <li> The only blush I have been using for more than a year now! I love it and it looks so natural on my pale skin. My skin is also sensitive to a lot of make up products but it tolerates this cream blush very well! I love it!</li>
            <li> Revlon seems to be wanting to get rid of cream blush. I LIKE IT AND WANT TO ORDER IT WHAN I NEED IT. THANK YOU FOR HAVING IT.  FEMALE TWAIN</li>
            <li> Decided that my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin would look better with a cream blush instead of the powder blush type that I had been using since my Dad allowed me to use make-up.  This is a perfect color for my fair skin - it isn&#x27;t as dark as it appears in the picture.  It blends to a beautiful, natural shade and it&#x27;s easy to apply whether you use your fingers or a blush brush.  I believe it would work on darker skin tones as well as it blends so easy and you can build on the color to suit your particular skin tone.</li>
