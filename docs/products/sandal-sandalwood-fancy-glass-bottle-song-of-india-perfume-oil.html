            <li>sandlewood is my very favorite scent...</li>
            <li>so i enjoyed for 3 or 4 days!</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>And one more thing about the bottle is that its made by hand.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of sandalwood, you can&#x27;t get better than \\&quot;Song of India\\&quot; brand.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is very beautiful and fragile.</li>
            <li>Smells exotic and sexy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite and the price remains right!&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>the directions say to run under water then twist the top off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bleed more than I did.</li>
            <li>the oil itself was okay.</li>
            <li>As most women know not all perfumes match ones body chemistry.</li>
            <li>I have had more</li>
            <li>Love sandalwood,buy there are some more like an air freshener instead.</li>
            <li>Most of the oils did not have the sweet and spicy aroma that Song of India has.</li>
            <li>The glass bottle was small but it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>To my surprise when I first applied it I fell in love with</li>
            <li>I have purchased 5 samples of sandalwood oils and aquasols from different sources and of them all Song of India is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Reported it imediately but could not recieve another, the special sale was over.</li>
            <li>this is a great product money well spent.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to pay 5 to sometimes even 10 times more for a real Sandalwood perfume oil.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more when it gets reasonable again.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying this because I thought the bottle looked cool, and I was intent on pouring it out and giving the bottle to my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Lovely bottle and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>strong, it´s not expensive</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was as promised.</li>
            <li>I was lucky</li>
            <li>It is really easy to get too much on</li>
            <li>worth it´s price.</li>
            <li>The Nature&#x27;s Kiss is really expensive and definitely smells more potent / authentic, but this smells really great as well.</li>
            <li>The strength is nice, only the tiniest of dabs is needed.</li>
            <li>This Sandalwood perfume oil and most of the other perfume oils of this company are of good quality - as far as price, odour strenght and volatility are concerned.</li>
            <li>If you´re looking for an authentic natural perfume oil that consists of the real thing (which is Mysore Sandalwood Oil), you should go look somewhere else.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>Love it no cons only pros</li>
            <li>Overall i am pleased...</li>
            <li>And i guess most of the other perfume oils of Song of India are synthetic to - especially the (normally) high priced ones like Rose, Jasmine, Lotus etc.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, which is why I gave it two stars, but definitely not worth the pain.</li>
            <li>To keep it short: If you´re looking for a strong Sandalwood perfume, this is it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>so iot was a lil slower than straight from amazon...</li>
            <li>product delivery was better than expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The real test was how would others react to the scent on me....</li>
            <li>The top of the bottle inserts down into the neck, and it is shaped like a cone.</li>
            <li>At first the lid is stuck together with wax or glue, but it comes with instructions to run under warm water for about 2 minutes, but i got my perfume bottle open less than a minute.</li>
            <li>Mysore Sandalwood Oil is one of the most expensive essential oils in the world and it should be valued as a precious and rare gift of nature.</li>
            <li>This Sandalwood perfume oil isn´t natural at all - it consists of synthetic substances and there is not one drop of real Sandalwood Oil in it.</li>
            <li>This cone fits pretty tightly down into the neck, so if you turn the bottle upside down it will coat the cone with the perfect amount of oil (much less than a single drop).</li>
            <li>The scent is very concentrated and once applied it will last until it is washed off, if not with soap &amp; water try alcohol or oil and/or makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Love the delicate bottle.  </li>
            <li>n natural~</li>
            <li>shipping was direct from vendor~</li>
            <li>A natural perfume consists of a neutral carrier oil and natural essential oils - nothing else.</li>
            <li>Subtle and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>This is true, but I find that you only need a *very* small amount.</li>
            <li>I really like the little bottle.</li>

            <li> I really like the little bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best way to apply is to use the lightest of touch and barely touch the top to your wrist and put an imperceptible dot on one wrist then rub both wrists together then rub your wrists behind your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason why i gave it four stars is because the smell does not last that long.</li>
            <li> its a small bottle about 4\\&quot;inches high and the lid doesnt twist on.</li>
            <li> I know this because we used to sell these perfume oils for a long time until we were informed by the company that it (Sandalwood) is synthetic.</li>
            <li> , it lingers on the skin for ages and it smells like Sandalwood (at least older batches did - the newer batches seem to consist of 90% Cedarwood and 10% Sandalwood, but that´s just my impression).  </li>
            <li> not a strong sandlewood smell that did not last long.</li>
            <li> These bottles must be handled extremely carefully or the glass will break.</li>
            <li> it took a minute to open it(had to run under water for a few seconds).</li>
            <li> then any other perfumes I have tried, It is now become my signature scent.</li>
            <li> Not worth.</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle, about 3.5\\&quot; tall, but goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really think you can&#x27;t go wrong here if you like the scent of sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the sandalwood smells a bit soapy when applying, so no full marks.</li>
            <li> - what a mess!</li>
            <li> bottle\\&quot;):/</li>
            <li> They are so small and delicate.  </li>
            <li> I for one have a hard time finding</li>
            <li> i luv the delicate fancy bottle...</li>
            <li> but it was broken.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately this product came in a delicate glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Broken glass!</li>
            <li> When I found this I was skeptical on how it&lt;</li>
            <li> No alcohol base or other crap that makes you smell like your wearing bug spray.   </li>
            <li> .I&#x27;m very disappointed! !</li>

            <li> The glass bottle was small but it&#x27;s perfect. The oil smells wonderful. Was impressed with the fact it&#x27;s sealed with wax. Came quickly and was as promised.Love the product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I only give one star.  I did recieve the bottle but it was broken.  Reported it imediately but could not recieve another, the special sale was over.</li>
            <li> I give this. One. Star. .I&#x27;m very disappointed! !I It smelled. Like. Spanish. Olives. So upset. Please. Not worth. The money.</li>
            <li> I love these hand blown bottles they are absolutely gorgeous! They are so small and delicate.  One of my girls only set the stopper back in place and the neck broke.  These bottles must be handled extremely carefully or the glass will break. The scent is very concentrated and once applied it will last until it is washed off, if not with soap &amp; water try alcohol or oil and/or makeup remover. It is really easy to get too much on and then you smell like you took a bath in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best way to apply is to use the lightest of touch and barely touch the top to your wrist and put an imperceptible dot on one wrist then rub both wrists together then rub your wrists behind your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last forever and I love it!!</li>
            <li> its a small bottle about 4\\&quot;inches high and the lid doesnt twist on. At first the lid is stuck together with wax or glue, but it comes with instructions to run under warm water for about 2 minutes, but i got my perfume bottle open less than a minute. The reason why i gave it four stars is because the smell does not last that long. And one more thing about the bottle is that its made by hand. And you can not carry the bottle in your pocket or in your purse. I like this product and I will order another one.</li>
            <li> This Sandalwood perfume oil and most of the other perfume oils of this company are of good quality - as far as price, odour strenght and volatility are concerned. It´s strong, it´s not expensive, it lingers on the skin for ages and it smells like Sandalwood (at least older batches did - the newer batches seem to consist of 90% Cedarwood and 10% Sandalwood, but that´s just my impression).  But be careful if you´re looking for a \\&quot;natural perfume oil\\&quot; - because this isn´t. A natural perfume consists of a neutral carrier oil and natural essential oils - nothing else. This Sandalwood perfume oil isn´t natural at all - it consists of synthetic substances and there is not one drop of real Sandalwood Oil in it. I know this because we used to sell these perfume oils for a long time until we were informed by the company that it (Sandalwood) is synthetic. And i guess most of the other perfume oils of Song of India are synthetic to - especially the (normally) high priced ones like Rose, Jasmine, Lotus etc.  To keep it short: If you´re looking for a strong Sandalwood perfume, this is it. If you´re looking for an authentic natural perfume oil that consists of the real thing (which is Mysore Sandalwood Oil), you should go look somewhere else.  All in all, you get what you pay for - a synthetic product worth it´s price. Be prepared to pay 5 to sometimes even 10 times more for a real Sandalwood perfume oil. Mysore Sandalwood Oil is one of the most expensive essential oils in the world and it should be valued as a precious and rare gift of nature.</li>
            <li> This perfume is truly Sandalwood. No alcohol base or other crap that makes you smell like your wearing bug spray.   It is a small bottle, about 3.5\\&quot; tall, but goes a long way. Really only need two dots; one to share with wrists and one at throat.  Very potent stuff! If you love the smell of sandalwood, you can&#x27;t get better than \\&quot;Song of India\\&quot; brand. The bottle itself is very beautiful and fragile. Tom sends them well packaged.</li>
            <li> Smells exotic and sexy.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift, very potent, but smells ingredible.  The bottle is beautiful, but does not seal well.  Would recommend to dilute.</li>
            <li> The neck of the bottle broke after a couple of uses. The bottle is too brittle for the money we give. Perfume oil is good though. But it is of no use for me now.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 5 samples of sandalwood oils and aquasols from different sources and of them all Song of India is by far the best. Most of the oils did not have the sweet and spicy aroma that Song of India has. I would buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several bottles over the years. It&#x27;s my favorite and the price remains right!&lt;br /&gt;Note: Price tripled suddenly. Will purchase more when it gets reasonable again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful box, beautiful bottle - then you try to open it...the directions say to run under water then twist the top off. Ha! This broke in my hands at the middle neck area when I tried twisting. Broken glass! - what a mess! I was lucky I didn&#x27;t bleed more than I did. The fragrance is nice, which is why I gave it two stars, but definitely not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle of Nature&#x27;s Kiss Sandalwood for a family member, and I came across this while I was looking around. I ended up buying this because I thought the bottle looked cool, and I was intent on pouring it out and giving the bottle to my girlfriend. I ended up keeping this after I smelled it, and now I use it every day after I shave. The Nature&#x27;s Kiss is really expensive and definitely smells more potent / authentic, but this smells really great as well. I really think you can&#x27;t go wrong here if you like the scent of sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note - others have mentioned that the bottle is pretty small. This is true, but I find that you only need a *very* small amount. The top of the bottle inserts down into the neck, and it is shaped like a cone. This cone fits pretty tightly down into the neck, so if you turn the bottle upside down it will coat the cone with the perfect amount of oil (much less than a single drop). I estimate that one bottle would last you somewhere between 6 to 8 months with every day use.</li>
            <li> Subtle and not too strong.  Love the delicate bottle.  Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Love it no cons only pros this is a great product money well spent. I recommend this to any one who might be considering buying this product.</li>
            <li> Lovely bottle and fast shipping. The strength is nice, only the tiniest of dabs is needed. I think the sandalwood smells a bit soapy when applying, so no full marks. The soap smell goes away after a bit and you are left with an almost incense smell.</li>
            <li> I really like the little bottle. The sandalwood inside smells divine.</li>
            <li> i luv the delicate fancy bottle...sandlewood is my very favorite scent... it&#x27;s gentle n natural~ shipping was direct from vendor~ so iot was a lil slower than straight from amazon... Overall i am pleased...</li>
            <li> product delivery was better than expected. the oil itself was okay. not a strong sandlewood smell that did not last long. unfortunately this product came in a delicate glass bottle. it took a minute to open it(had to run under water for a few seconds). my cat just yesterday knocked it off my table and broke. so i enjoyed for 3 or 4 days! will not order this again (my fault for not seeing item advertised in \\&quot;fancy glass bottle\\&quot;):/</li>
            <li> As most women know not all perfumes match ones body chemistry. I for one have a hard time finding&lt;br /&gt;something to match mine. I LOVE the smell of sandalwood !!! It reminds me of soap with a hint of spice.&lt;br /&gt;Being a tomboyish women I am not into the fem perfumes ( flowery, candy smells, etc). When I found this I was skeptical on how it&lt;br /&gt;would match my chemistry. To my surprise when I first applied it I fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;The real test was how would others react to the scent on me.... I have had more COMPLIMENTS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;on this then any other perfumes I have tried, It is now become my signature scent.</li>
            <li> So happy to find a scent that smells wearable. Love sandalwood,buy there are some more like an air freshener instead.</li>
