            <li>Quite honestly, I don&#x27;t see that it did anything.</li>
            <li>Nice texture.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with your product,,I have used most of the jar,,my skin feels very soft and smooth,,has a very nice smell</li>
            <li>Leave my skin smooth and smell so good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this since it is a fairly inexpensive whitening product.  </li>
            <li>very light freckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very VERY light.</li>
            <li>I am glad I founded here in America.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of usage, they appear lighter, more like blending in.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Just okay.  </li>
            <li>I use the Pond&#x27;s Flawless White Day Cream in the A.M., and this cream at night.</li>
            <li>Love love it for my</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t give the translucent look to the skin, it whitens the skin faster and more drastically.</li>
            <li>My face has a more even tone after using it for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And cute packaging.</li>
            <li>This seller shipped me an item that was new and great.</li>
            <li>Smells great and feels very soft on your face..</li>
            <li>Mostly I love that it&#x27;s light and not greasy, but watch out around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Like the texture of my skin once you put on the face,can be easily wear under the make up,</li>
            <li>Feels fine.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not so concerned with lightening and just want smooth skin that isn&#x27;t blotchy, this could be the product for you.</li>
            <li>It is creamy with a light texture.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin so some of the Flawless White products are too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>I never expected that this could be so good.</li>
            <li>I had such a good experience with the order.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a lovely smell, though it may be a bit to strong for anyone who is sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>Light cream has a very mild scent and it&#x27;s really improve your complexion and texture of skin.</li>
            <li>I have received several orders of Pond&#x27;s Flawless White Re-brightening Night Cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ocean Discount fills my orders quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am lucky that I can buy this online.</li>
            <li>Good product just that shipping was too long</li>
            <li>This is a great product, little pricey</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use at night after a spa, i use it everyday</li>
            <li>and i struggled with it because its not a round top but screws off.</li>
            <li>right away that night, I used it and kept my fingers crossed</li>
            <li>I wish it were more readily available here in America since it seems to work so well for caucasian women too, but that will never happen as long as tan is in vogue here</li>
            <li>but surprisingly the dark spots got one shade lighter..at this point my smile is from ear to ear..</li>
            <li>My recommendation is ALWAYS use some facial cleanser to clean your face after or before you shower, then press softly and dry face then apply the night cream, it would bring a more effective result!</li>
            <li>it go&#x27;s into your skin very fast and is so nourishing</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the slight smell, but not so strong.  </li>
            <li>It does help with my overall skin clarity even though I am a very fair skinned Caucasian, and helps tone down redness and hyperpigmentation that I get from breakouts.</li>
            <li>i was given this same product in mexico while visiting family and fell in love with the results..</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this product!</li>
            <li>I would advise everyone to check the date on the packaging first....</li>
            <li>The re-brightening qualities are consistent.  </li>
            <li>~I noticed many people use it as lotion, simply applied to their face after shower, but a brightening night cream don&#x27;t work like that..</li>
            <li>first I thought MAYBE,....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but really does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>My skin actually does fine with this product.</li>
            <li>This item really works</li>
            <li>REALLY works.</li>
            <li>when I got the night cream and foam wash within a week I was very impress and gave 5 star rating to my seller...</li>
            <li>No change in complexion, but didn&#x27;t really expect that, was just hoping.</li>
            <li>I bought the day and night brightening creams and I preferred the night because when I used just the night one, my skin wouldn&#x27;t breakout as much, and it really evened out the skin color all over my face.</li>
            <li>It really worked on my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks Ponds.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference with this cream really.</li>
            <li>I use this with other products in the line and have been enjoying them.  </li>
            <li>As always Ponds live up to its name I have been using this cream 2 weeks and my acne scars are disappearing face is noticeably soft, radiant and I can see lightening as well I will definitely purchase again and also get the Day cream :)</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I highly recommend this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t really noticed too much difference.  </li>
            <li>Some people like to compare this to the Shiseido White Lucent range, but I personally like this better.</li>
            <li>I like the lovely little smell, the super-smoothness and absorption.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t you hate those creams that tell you, that you will have beautiful, scar free blemish skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to be fair, I just thought it took a long time to get here.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>makes a big differnce on first use.</li>
            <li>..when I got up the next morning, for the first time, my boyfriend said\\&quot; your skin is so soft\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>jar was a bit tricy to open the first time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 weeks so far and the mask just looks like</li>
            <li>The product: evens overall skintone, lightens pigmentation from post acne and sun damage, smoothens the skin drastically, and whitens the whole face.</li>
            <li>I have not had enough time to really evaluate this product.  </li>
            <li>When I placed my order, I was a little anxious bc of all the good reviews and research I&#x27;ve done...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still use it (mostly because I don&#x27;t understand what a lotion expiration means), but an expired product is really not a good look...even for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Initially I was worried about the scent because it is a little strong for my sensitive face, but once you actually apply it to your face, it goes away.</li>
            <li>I think you are supposed to use this for 12 weeks to see any results, and its only been about 3 weeks so far.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper then some of the other brightening brands.</li>
            <li>Really fades away dark spots.</li>
            <li>I have lots of dark spot on my face and this product really helps it to whiten it.</li>
            <li>If it has actually lightened my overall skin, I can&#x27;t tell because I am naturally super-pale to begin with, but it has helped to improve my skin condition with fewer breakouts and an overall smoothness in tone that I have never had before.</li>
            <li>could only see some slight improvements but nothing really visible or major.</li>

            <li> I love visiting drugstores while traveling (I know crazy)</li>
            <li> shipment didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> Took forever to get to me and I haven&#x27;t been using it for long</li>
            <li> I still have all of my spots, but like I said I haven&#x27;t used it very long.</li>
            <li> This cream is not very moisturizing, so if you have oily skin and are on the fence about this product I say go ahead and take the leap.</li>
            <li> Minus one star for lack of availability here in America.</li>
            <li> really do not prevent tanning.</li>
            <li> and pale is all the rage in Asian countries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other lines from Shiseido to Chanel...and nothing quite this</li>
            <li> A total waste of my time!</li>
            <li> It stings a little after application but the product doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Well, this is the one, and in a couple of weeks you will start to notice fading dark spots and scars from blemishes.</li>
            <li> Helps reduced my dark spots.</li>
            <li> JUST MAYBE it was lightening the dark rings around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Also the box is a little bit wired</li>
            <li> This item has been part of my everyday nighttime skincare routine for years.</li>
            <li> Not sure it is gonna do what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it is doing anything for my skin yet, but I have had someone tell me my skin looked radiant after using it for 2 days.  </li>
            <li> im tired of looking for products to help the crazy and over productive worst case of dark spots all over my oily young Asian acne skin</li>

            <li> Smells great and feels very soft on your face.. shipment didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> Really fades away dark spots. I put it on at night and I feel it working on my skin. Will buy again..</li>
            <li> i was given this same product in mexico while visiting family and fell in love with the results..i am very pleased that i can order this online and delivered to my door. This item really works</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate those creams that tell you, that you will have beautiful, scar free blemish skin. Well, this is the one, and in a couple of weeks you will start to notice fading dark spots and scars from blemishes. Really it does work, I bought this cream in Mexico and in a few weeks I notice the difference in my skin. I just can&#x27;t believe that it took away everything that it stated. I ran out and wanted another one. I am glad I founded here in America.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to be fair, I just thought it took a long time to get here. Maybe I don&#x27;t understand since I think it came from overseas.   I still have all of my spots, but like I said I haven&#x27;t used it very long. Not sure it is gonna do what it is supposed to do.  If they ever come up with something that works, they couldn&#x27;t make enough of it. lol</li>
            <li> this night cream is wonderful it go&#x27;s into your skin very fast and is so nourishing I wake up with nice supple skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now. I can see improvement on my skin. I have brown spots on my cheeks that can&#x27;t seem to go away. After 3 weeks of usage, they appear lighter, more like blending in. I am happy with the result. I just wish they sold this line of product in the states. I really hate waiting forever for the oversea shipment.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream in India. I love visiting drugstores while traveling (I know crazy) anyway , it stay on my shelf for about six months before I even tried it,&lt;br /&gt;As it turned out this stuff REALLY works. I LOVE it. But the only place I found it in America was AMAZON. So I love Amazon tooo!!!! Thanks for carrying this product!</li>
            <li> I have reordered this 3 times and will keep ordering. All of the ponds whitening products are great</li>
            <li> Just okay.  Smells goof.  Feels fine.  Not the miracle whitening cream I was looking for.  Will use up this.jar and won&#x27;t be re biying this.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this since it is a fairly inexpensive whitening product.  However, I am sad to say that I am allergic to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a lovely smell, though it may be a bit to strong for anyone who is sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> The review of this item says that it is best 2 years from the manufacture date.  I did not receive this until January of 2012 and the manufacture date was August of 2010.  This explains why i probably have not get the results others &#x27;may&#x27; have gotten.  I would advise everyone to check the date on the packaging first....I had already started using it and only after a month of use did I notice the date which probably explains why I have seen no results.  Hopefully you will get a &#x27;fresher&#x27; batch !</li>
            <li> great and very effective. makes a big differnce on first use. I will buy it again.I love it very much.</li>
            <li> I googled looking for a cheaper cream that would lighten my pregnancy mask. This product worked within one week! Everyone could tell a difference. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks so far and the mask just looks like very light freckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loveeeeeee this cream!</li>
            <li> When I placed my order, I was a little anxious bc of all the good reviews and research I&#x27;ve done...i couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and see the results...when I got the night cream and foam wash within a week I was very impress and gave 5 star rating to my seller...right away that night, I used it and kept my fingers crossed BC im tired of looking for products to help the crazy and over productive worst case of dark spots all over my oily young Asian acne skin..when I got up the next morning, for the first time, my boyfriend said\\&quot; your skin is so soft\\&quot;... I Ran to the bathroom and no breakouts..but surprisingly the dark spots got one shade lighter..at this point my smile is from ear to ear..I know everybody is different and products work differently for everybody but I wanted to share this review BC It works for me and it may not work for the next person but don&#x27;t feel discourage cause there is something out there for you..just keep looking and wear a lot of sun screen</li>
            <li> I like the lovely little smell, the super-smoothness and absorption. No change in complexion, but didn&#x27;t really expect that, was just hoping.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen the result yet.</li>
            <li> I bought the day and night brightening creams and I preferred the night because when I used just the night one, my skin wouldn&#x27;t breakout as much, and it really evened out the skin color all over my face. I was looking for a brightening lotion and not a lotion that would even out the color of my face.</li>
            <li> I have received several orders of Pond&#x27;s Flawless White Re-brightening Night Cream.  The cream is am excellent night-time moisturizer.  The re-brightening qualities are consistent.  My skin tone has become even.  The redness and splotchy patches have disappeared.  My skin appears lumimous and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Ocean Discount fills my orders quickly.  I have not waited for my orders.  I have received my orders in two days.  Excellent vendor.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 6 months now. I wanted to wait to write a review.  This is best night cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I noticed that Ocean Discount no longer sell this item, which is too bad bc I had such a good experience with the order.  I ordered the same item from another seller and the item was expired.  This seller shipped me an item that was new and great. The shipping was fast and I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;1. does not clog pores-no break out&lt;br /&gt;2. Very VERY light. I&#x27;ve used other lines from Shiseido to Chanel...and nothing quite this good.&lt;br /&gt;3. Good price&lt;br /&gt;4. Evens out and brightens your tone&lt;br /&gt;5. smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Mostly I love that it&#x27;s light and not greasy, but watch out around the eyes.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the product had already expired. I&#x27;ll still use it (mostly because I don&#x27;t understand what a lotion expiration means), but an expired product is really not a good look...even for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but really does not live up to the hype. It&#x27;s not an expensive item, but I don&#x27;t plan on buying this again.</li>
            <li> I like the night cream. Helps reduced my dark spots.</li>
            <li> After i use it, i feel a little bit uncomfortable. i don&#x27;t recommend it. Also the box is a little bit wired,i hope it&#x27;s not because of it&#x27;s a fake one.</li>
            <li> This definitely a part of my routine every night!love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like Ponds and was looking for a cream that would brighten my skin. The cream smells nice but I don&#x27;t see a moisturizing, brightening effect. I don&#x27;t believe it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get to me and I haven&#x27;t been using it for long but so far I haven&#x27;t really noticed too much difference.  I had purchased this for my sun spots on my face so we&#x27;ll see after another month or so.</li>
            <li> The cream works well.  I use the Pond&#x27;s Flawless White Day Cream in the A.M., and this cream at night. I could see a lightening effect after about a week.  It does not moisturize, so following up with a moisturizing night cream is a must.</li>
            <li> Ocean discount sent me wrong product instead of getting night cream they sent me day cream -_- which upsets me because before i could see it i already opened the box but havent used it.</li>
            <li> This cream is not very moisturizing, so if you have oily skin and are on the fence about this product I say go ahead and take the leap. Drier skins should go for the lotion. It does help with my overall skin clarity even though I am a very fair skinned Caucasian, and helps tone down redness and hyperpigmentation that I get from breakouts. I wish it were more readily available here in America since it seems to work so well for caucasian women too, but that will never happen as long as tan is in vogue here and pale is all the rage in Asian countries. If it has actually lightened my overall skin, I can&#x27;t tell because I am naturally super-pale to begin with, but it has helped to improve my skin condition with fewer breakouts and an overall smoothness in tone that I have never had before. If you&#x27;re not so concerned with lightening and just want smooth skin that isn&#x27;t blotchy, this could be the product for you. Minus one star for lack of availability here in America.</li>
            <li> Maybe my mom&#x27;s skin is &amp;#34; different&amp;#34; because it didn&#x27;t work that well. I bought this pond&#x27;s cream because a friend recommended it. It worked on her.</li>
            <li> My skin actually does fine with this product. It stings a little after application but the product doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I have incredibly sensitive skin so some of the Flawless White products are too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I loved the product. It really worked on my face. I will recommended this to my friends. Awesome cream. The price is also affordable.</li>
            <li> horrible does not work after using the whole bottle reqularly</li>
            <li> Love love it for my it&#x27;s like the best night cream</li>
            <li> Like the texture of my skin once you put on the face,can be easily wear under the make up, so far&lt;br /&gt;I could only see some slight improvements but nothing really visible or major.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I never expected that this could be so good. Light cream has a very mild scent and it&#x27;s really improve your complexion and texture of skin. I am going to buy this product again. In USA we don&#x27;t get this product in store. I am lucky that I can buy this online. Excellent product</li>
            <li> I have been using the Ponds face clarifier for about 3 weeks, and it does work at taking the brown spots off.I started using it on my hands also.  Thanks Ponds.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use at night after a spa, i use it everyday and i do see some effect on my skin...It does brighten my skin and make it smoother! BUT DON&#x27;T USE IT AS LOTION~I noticed many people use it as lotion, simply applied to their face after shower, but a brightening night cream don&#x27;t work like that..My recommendation is ALWAYS use some facial cleanser to clean your face after or before you shower, then press softly and dry face then apply the night cream, it would bring a more effective result!</li>
            <li> This item has been part of my everyday nighttime skincare routine for years. The product: evens overall skintone, lightens pigmentation from post acne and sun damage, smoothens the skin drastically, and whitens the whole face. Some people like to compare this to the Shiseido White Lucent range, but I personally like this better. Although it doesn&#x27;t give the translucent look to the skin, it whitens the skin faster and more drastically. Initially I was worried about the scent because it is a little strong for my sensitive face, but once you actually apply it to your face, it goes away. Also the product does not break me out at all, so acne-prone people shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to try this out. I highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I think you are supposed to use this for 12 weeks to see any results, and its only been about 3 weeks so far.  N ice consistency and is not greasy.  I will see what the results are in 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was happy with your product,,I have used most of the jar,,my skin feels very soft and smooth,,has a very nice smell</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without being oily and clogging my pores.  My face has a more even tone after using it for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy the day cream and face wash in the same line as soon as my existing ones are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar was a bit tricy to open the first time and i struggled with it because its not a round top but screws off.</li>
            <li> Darling loves this product, bot it for her...........</li>
            <li> I have used this cream every night for four weeks and seen no results.&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought MAYBE,....JUST MAYBE it was lightening the dark rings around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;But no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess there&#x27;s no getting away from products with Hydroquinine.&lt;br /&gt;SUNBLOCKS really do not prevent tanning. EVEN SPF 100 seems to allow&lt;br /&gt;a tan.&lt;br /&gt;Also this cream, did not moisturize. Quite honestly, I don&#x27;t see that it did anything.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference with this cream really. But moisturizes well. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. And cute packaging.</li>
            <li> Nice texture.  I am not sure it is doing anything for my skin yet, but I have had someone tell me my skin looked radiant after using it for 2 days.  I love the texture and the slight smell, but not so strong.  It is creamy with a light texture.</li>
            <li> I use this with other products in the line and have been enjoying them.  Much cheaper then some of the other brightening brands.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me I didn&#x27;t notice any brightness in my complexion. A total waste of my time!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, little pricey but I can&#x27;t live without it. Leave my skin smooth and smell so good.</li>
            <li> Good product just that shipping was too long</li>
            <li> I have not had enough time to really evaluate this product.  Cream is not greasy and is used at night.</li>
            <li> As always Ponds live up to its name I have been using this cream 2 weeks and my acne scars are disappearing face is noticeably soft, radiant and I can see lightening as well I will definitely purchase again and also get the Day cream :)</li>
            <li> I have lots of dark spot on my face and this product really helps it to whiten it. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> this cream expired 2 years ago, What the hell?? I still use it but I can&#x27;t tell yet if it works or not.</li>
