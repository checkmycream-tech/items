            <li>These were the best smelling incense I&#x27;ve ever smelled!!!  </li>
            <li>Its the best...</li>
            <li>Its the best...</li>
            <li>for the money this is the best you can get.</li>
            <li>The aroma is exquisite.</li>
            <li>This incense is very good for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>I am happy I bought them.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say its wonderful, and it is my opinion you will love it.  </li>
            <li>It may be a bit too strong for some people but for me it is perfect.</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>So I \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; some of those incense sticks from my son and found myself delighted in the scent, and atmosphere it prompted.  </li>
            <li>Burned these during the holidays... were great for friends and family who enjoyed them as well.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the fragrance and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  If you are interested in trying what I have found to be the very best of all the incense I have tried, may I suggest you follow the enclosed link and read my review of the Kamini incense.  </li>

            <li>Each scent came in a nice tin with a ceramic holder, and 30 cones.  </li>
            <li>oh so nice.</li>
            <li>For 16 cones, costing over a dollar, you would expect them to be better.  </li>
            <li>So its okay an all</li>
            <li>but it smells more woodsy than it does scented.  </li>
            <li>I had to look up directions online instead, which were probably more thorough, but an inconvenience if you&#x27;re not around a computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Smells exotic for all of you who wish to be taken into another land by end of day.  </li>
            <li>this is draw-back but looking forward to ordering more from this company since pleased by this pick.</li>
            <li>All in All pretty good.</li>
            <li>another great product by  Wild Berry.  </li>
            <li>I loved them so much, I bought all of them.  </li>
            <li>We liked them so much that I have ordered another box.</li>
            <li>I ENJOY IT  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use and lights quick.  </li>
            <li>Resin proved much more pleasing and lasted far longer, making it much more cost efficient and without risk of setting off the smoke alarms.  </li>
            <li>I like this incense and it was more reasonably priced here than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the exotic sounding ones like \\&quot;dragons blood\\&quot;, \\&quot;midnight rain\\&quot;, and \\&quot;autumn breeze\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This other one is great though (Nag Champa Incense Cones by Auric Blends)...</li>
            <li>frankincense and myrrh not only does indeed have two cool names, but is one of the most pleasant out of all that I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>All told, I have better that burns better and smells ten times stronger.</li>
            <li>If there could be one improvement I would change the durability as this brand of incense burns fairly quick.</li>
            <li>It is a mild, clean, and soothing fragrance - not heavy or strong.  </li>
            <li>I then purchased a burner of my own, and bought a selection of different scented incense in the cone design, (easier to use and safer).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is good, but other brands may be worth a try.</li>
            <li>and most of our guests didn&#x27;t seem to find it&#x27;s aroma as pleasing as the more conventional smells of cinnamon, apple, pine, etc.  </li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT WAS YES RIGHT  </li>
            <li>No, but only because I have had better at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I should have bought more, but I will remedy that shortly.</li>
            <li>I suppose that people that are into incense so heavily that they can easily write a review of each and every scent have their favorites to be sure.  </li>
            <li>Frankincense and Myrrh has always been my favorite incense and this one is good, but a little smokey especially at the end, which isn&#x27;t unusual.</li>
            <li>I have not bought any other kind since finding this.  </li>
            <li>I have not bought any other kind since finding this.  </li>
            <li>This is pure incense, doesn&#x27;t give you a  headache.  </li>
            <li>I have moved on to HEM&#x27;s pure Frankincense cones and am very</li>
            <li>but I always light each kind at the same time to counter act the heavy wood smell.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t burn that much anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very relaxing mellow smell.</li>
            <li>, I just never felt I had much of a use for it.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, this package of 16 cones, (you get one package of 16, not three like what&#x27;s pictured), was purchased along with a burner I also bought here on Amazon in order to qualify for the free shipping, (which is what I suggest you do.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up for a kid&#x27;s VBS demonstration - overall, the smell is nice and it gave the kids (and us adults) something to relate back to for the stories they hear from the Bible.  </li>
            <li>The best Frankincense and or Myrrh resins are very, very expensive.</li>
            <li>it was 15min of a some what decent smell</li>
            <li>The main reason I like the smell of this incense is because it doesn&#x27;t have that smokey smell that a lot of cheaper incenses have.</li>
            <li>I have to confess that I am new to this incense business.  </li>
            <li>One cone smolders for approx 10-15 minutes, where resin burns for hours on a stove turned to low heat, and if you use a warmer (a $5 candle warmer and metal can work very well)</li>
            <li>Though we&#x27;ve burned frangrant candles for years, I&#x27;m new to actual incense burning.  </li>
            <li>However these cones of Frankincense and Myrrh are very soothing to me and they are not as overpowering as some of the other kinds of incense are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best incense I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve been  burning incense since the 1960&#x27;s  Don&#x27;t be afraid of this!!</li>
            <li>These little bastards burn really fast</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this incense and it was more reasonably priced here than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked. Burns just long enough and gives the desired effect.</li>
            <li> When I was living in Korea, I discovered cone incense.  I loved them so much, I bought all of them.  Each scent came in a nice tin with a ceramic holder, and 30 cones.  These were the best smelling incense I&#x27;ve ever smelled!!!  You smelled the scent, not wood, or the filler the composes the cone.  Each tin (again, with 30 cones and a holder) cost about under a dollar, around 92 cents.      Since I was running low, I needed to find something to take the place of the incense that I got from Korea.  These were close, but no cigar.  There was no comparison.  For 16 cones, costing over a dollar, you would expect them to be better.  Many of the cones I received were not a perfect cone, thus the ashes spilling over the cone holder.  Also, they also burned up quicker than the ones I got in Korea.  Anyway, would I recommend them?  Maybe.  Would I purchase them again myself? No, but only because I have had better at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> So its okay an all but it smells more woodsy than it does scented.  This other one is great though (Nag Champa Incense Cones by Auric Blends)...all franincense &amp; myrrh. I bought a ton load of this one so I&#x27;m still going through the woodsy smell but I always light each kind at the same time to counter act the heavy wood smell.</li>
            <li> Though we&#x27;ve burned frangrant candles for years, I&#x27;m new to actual incense burning.  This cone incense was purchased along with a bag of Frankincense and Myrrh resin, both from the same vendor here.  My only criticism is that the vendor should avoid placing store labels over the burning instructions on the package.  I had to look up directions online instead, which were probably more thorough, but an inconvenience if you&#x27;re not around a computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In describing the aromatic fragrance of Frank &amp; Myrrh, I would probably say it&#x27;s an acquired smell.  I burned or warmed it in the house throughout the month of December and most of our guests didn&#x27;t seem to find it&#x27;s aroma as pleasing as the more conventional smells of cinnamon, apple, pine, etc.  Knowing what it was they were smelling enhanced thier appreciation, though, especially with it being Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, even for Frank &amp; Myrrh, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  I don&#x27;t know about other cone incense fragrances, but the smell of smoke overwhelmed any fragrance these cones produced.  Resin proved much more pleasing and lasted far longer, making it much more cost efficient and without risk of setting off the smoke alarms.  One cone smolders for approx 10-15 minutes, where resin burns for hours on a stove turned to low heat, and if you use a warmer (a $5 candle warmer and metal can work very well) instead, resin will last for days or weeks, depending on continuousness of use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Its easy to use and lights quick.  Smells exotic for all of you who wish to be taken into another land by end of day.  The down side is the package is only 16 cones.  Since cones as opposed to sticks burn only about 1/2 hour this is draw-back but looking forward to ordering more from this company since pleased by this pick.</li>
            <li> Burned these during the holidays... were great for friends and family who enjoyed them as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with the regular Mag Champa incense sticks as well as a 6 pack variety of incense. For some reason whenever I burn the blue box Mag Champa it actually makes me nauseated so I really don&#x27;t burn that much anymore. However these cones of Frankincense and Myrrh are very soothing to me and they are not as overpowering as some of the other kinds of incense are. I am happy I bought them.</li>
            <li> This is a classical blend of frankincense and myrrh.  It is a mild, clean, and soothing fragrance - not heavy or strong.  It is not overly perfumey, or flowery.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like smoke when burning.  It reminds me of what a sacred place would smell like.  I have a terrible problem with allergies, especially with incense.  This blend doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitivities.  I am very pleased with the fragrance and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Frankincense and Myrrh cone incense burn well and smell oh so nice. We liked them so much that I have ordered another box.</li>
            <li> The cones did not burn well to start. They ALL have gone out with about a 1/4 of the cone left at the bottom whether in my incense burner or on a metal plate. To get them to finish burning I had to flip them and light the entire base up.    The scent is also very weak and like others have said it smells smoky rather than scenty.    All told, I have better that burns better and smells ten times stronger.</li>
            <li> These little bastards burn really fast I doubt I will buy these again&lt;br /&gt;But it was 15min of a some what decent smell</li>
            <li> I ENJOY IT  SMELL GOOD THE PRODUCT WAS YES RIGHT  TO FED IN MY INSENCEN&lt;br /&gt; HOLD . EASEIER TO PURCHES&lt;br /&gt;IN AMAZON,COM  ARRIVE ON TIME.THANKS.</li>
            <li> Frankincense and Myrrh has always been my favorite incense and this one is good, but a little smokey especially at the end, which isn&#x27;t unusual. I have moved on to HEM&#x27;s pure Frankincense cones and am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good, but other brands may be worth a try.</li>
            <li> The main reason I like the smell of this incense is because it doesn&#x27;t have that smokey smell that a lot of cheaper incenses have. It&#x27;s a very relaxing mellow smell. All in All pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have to confess that I am new to this incense business.  I never had anything against it, I just never felt I had much of a use for it.  Then quite a few years ago I started working from home, and it was then that I took more notice of the stale odors and musky remnants that can emanate in a closed room or house, especially of course in wintertime.  So I \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; some of those incense sticks from my son and found myself delighted in the scent, and atmosphere it prompted.  I then purchased a burner of my own, and bought a selection of different scented incense in the cone design, (easier to use and safer).  I suppose that people that are into incense so heavily that they can easily write a review of each and every scent have their favorites to be sure.  Perhaps even different scents for different moods, and seasons.  As for me, all I can say is I have not found a scent yet that I have not taken too.  Except perhaps for the what I refer to as the basic blends, that is, \\&quot;rose\\&quot;, \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;, \\&quot;sage\\&quot;, etc.  I much prefer the exotic sounding ones like \\&quot;dragons blood\\&quot;, \\&quot;midnight rain\\&quot;, and \\&quot;autumn breeze\\&quot;.  Not because they have cooler names, but because they are blends of different scents, and therefore usually smell a whole lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This frankincense and myrrh not only does indeed have two cool names, but is one of the most pleasant out of all that I have tried so far.  I won&#x27;t bother to attempt to describe it to you.  Suffice it to say its wonderful, and it is my opinion you will love it.  Lastly, this package of 16 cones, (you get one package of 16, not three like what&#x27;s pictured), was purchased along with a burner I also bought here on Amazon in order to qualify for the free shipping, (which is what I suggest you do.  Either buy enough of this, or combine with other incense, or a burner. You will then be saving something on what you will pay for this for in one of those weired gift shops that sell this sort of stuff).  Try it, then sit down, relax, and just breathe.

            <li> I should have bought more, but I will remedy that shortly. It is a great product. It may be a bit too strong for some people but for me it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I got the cones for my son...another great product by  Wild Berry.  This is pure incense, doesn&#x27;t give you a  headache.  It&#x27;s the best incense I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve been  burning incense since the 1960&#x27;s  Don&#x27;t be afraid of this!!</li>
            <li> I picked this up for a kid&#x27;s VBS demonstration - overall, the smell is nice and it gave the kids (and us adults) something to relate back to for the stories they hear from the Bible.  They will remember it for a long time if not the rest of their lives.  If there could be one improvement I would change the durability as this brand of incense burns fairly quick.</li>
            <li> This incense is very good for it&#x27;s price. The best Frankincense and or Myrrh resins are very, very expensive. If you can afford a couple of hundred dollars an ounce then go for it. I can&#x27;t swing that on my budget and for the money this is the best you can get.</li>
            <li> Frankincense and myrrh are used on incense burning rituals for cleansing and purifying the home and for bringing protection to one&#x27;s home. It is used in religious ceremonies on churches for exaltation and adoration. This one contains cone incenses, therefore it required a cone incense burning device. The aroma is exquisite.</li>
