            <li>This is the best product for in between hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for hiding outgrowth when you don&#x27;t feel like dyeing your hair just yet, but it&#x27;s also wonderful for hiding patches of thinning hair.  </li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Stock up very handy.</li>
            <li>this blended perfectly and was great until I was able to get to the salon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic, love it!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>This would be perfect if there were more colors to pick from.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best thing since sliced bread, no WAY better, because it saves me $100s of dollars.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed that the color matches so evenly and is so easy to apply.    </li>
            <li>Style Edit is an excellent product for covering my roots between coloring a. Easy to apply and matches my hair color leaving no tell tale signs.</li>
            <li>do not recommend it, it is a paint spray, good luck spraying on your scalp and having your hair fall out</li>
            <li>but if you have brown hair, the coverage is good.  </li>
            <li>Does good job covering gray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>This color blended perfectly for my in between colorings, was easy to apply, and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Style Edit is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t sweat, and covers roots beautifully.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is the best root concealer I have used, have been using it since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love this, no time to color, no worries...keeps gray roots covered until you get to it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Auburn/Red\\&quot; is &#x27;ferr sherr&#x27; better than sporting gray roots!</li>
            <li>I referred too many people to my hairdresser and now I can&#x27;t get in!</li>
            <li>amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best root concealer I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>but it is a muted auburn and blends in nicely.  </li>
            <li>but then the product kind of dripped out on my head.  </li>
            <li>just wish they had a nice auburn color like the one I have gotten from Samy Hair Salon.</li>
            <li>I use auburn and it blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to a friend and she liked it too.</li>
            <li>Application is very easy.  </li>
            <li>Good staying power, best spray I have found, and also best for auburn/red --which is difficult to find.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>will keep ordering this product I have tried 5 before this, and by far this is the best for coverage and hold.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this spray in between dye jobs.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product ever to get you through the next time you get colorb</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I used Oribe before and I love that</li>
            <li>This iss more brown than auburn and does not blend with my hair</li>
            <li>It is more brown.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>After using this, I had to check the can to make sure I&#x27;d received the color I&#x27;d ordered.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get to use it more than once.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot better, it&#x27;s fragrance-free, non-irritating, covers and blends in well, and as a bonus, the Grayce powder can be used on brows, too.</li>
            <li>but I rate it a 4 instead of a 5 star because the auburn/red is more of a brown color.</li>
            <li>If there were more options you could also do some temporary highlighting.  </li>
            <li>I love this product to cover the gray in the crown of my hair between having my hair colored at the salon.</li>
            <li>And ironically, they&#x27;re available at Home Depot!</li>
            <li>Make sure you hold up a tissue on your skin while spraying, otherwise you&#x27;ll get droplets on your skin.</li>
            <li>I actually love this product.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>She mentioned that there were spray on powder dyes available, but did not want to promote anything that cut into her own profits.  </li>
            <li>I read many Amazon reviews and chose this</li>
            <li>how many applications I will get from one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>Love it and the price.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love the color to.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It really covers grays very nicely...</li>
            <li>Greatest thing ever for someone who is going grey!  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t feel very full.</li>
            <li>I wish it were more available in stores.  </li>
            <li>On the hair this looks more of a light brown tint.</li>
            <li>Super Fast shipping, Great Item.</li>
            <li>My roots are completely gray, but style edit covers it very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and covers well.</li>
            <li>The company is very quick to deliver and I received both my shipments on time (</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t spray easily.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I like the product very much</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for a quick, easy root touch up.  </li>
            <li>its fine use it a lot</li>
            <li>This is the third time I have experienced this problem.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a shame as I enjoy having shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>I resisted it for a while, thinking it couldn&#x27;t cover very specific areas, but am happy to say it works great, and it actually comes in my color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy and stays in until my hair is</li>
            <li>Its great to have a way to cover grays quickly on those mornings when I realize my roots are starting to show.  </li>
            <li>The aerosol spray was so forceful that it just blew the part in my hair that I was trying to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; completely clean.  </li>
            <li>perfect shade for burgundy colored hair (not strawberry blonde  but really red-violet) and the dispenser directs the spray exactly where you want it to go.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price was just right!</li>
            <li>Very timely and love this product.</li>
            <li>Stretches my hair color for a full week, saving me the cost of three appointments on an annual basis.</li>
            <li>I love this SO much that I want to share with the world</li>
            <li>I was worried about it not rubbing off if I miss my hairline, but it does rub off skin pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>Works great and the product doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or other things.  </li>
            <li>other than that, the product has good coverage and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>A quick spray and my roots are gone.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for those last 2 weeks before my next hair coloring appointment!</li>
            <li>It takes just a quick shot of spray in the gray hairs between dye jobs.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy this unless you are happy with dark brown roots.</li>
            <li>The nozzle is pretty precise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new customer for sure.</li>
            <li>WOW- extends the life of your color job by days or even a week!!!!!</li>
            <li>great root concealer for my red hair - covers the grey nicely and looks very natural so that I can go for longer periods of time between salon visits!</li>
            <li>Truthfully when it gets this close to coloring week, I have darker color near my roots and lighter at the ends.  </li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re going for the hideous, yet trendy \\&quot;brown roots, red hair &#x27;ombre&#x27; effect\\&quot;, avoid it at all costs.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I rated it only three stars, but it does spray on nicely and covers,</li>
            <li>but I feel worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Works for that inbetween color time and you just can&#x27;t get to the salon right away.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by a friend and she was right.</li>
            <li>blends well, with great coverage (grey) hair, my tint color is true red.</li>
            <li>It is a good match even though my hair is no where near red.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more &#x27;rough-textury&#x27; and rubs off more than the brown color of &#x27;Gray Away&#x27; (haven&#x27;t been able to purchase the red Gray Away), but \\&quot;Style Edit</li>
            <li>I love that it goes only where I want it and stays til I wash it out.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using a concealer spray.  </li>
            <li>it is exactly what I wanted to cover thinning hair and gray.</li>
            <li>it shows up as a brown more than red.  </li>
            <li>My best beauty secret ever!</li>
            <li>My first order was light/med brown...</li>
            <li>That said, Wood Furniture &amp; Floor Repair Markers by Rejuvinate© in both Maple and Oak do a MUCH better job on my RED roots.</li>
            <li>With chemical help it is still red :))  </li>
            <li>It is a tiny bottle, and it takes a lot of spray even to cover just the top of the head roots.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this product at the salon for over a year to cover my grey roots and love it.</li>
            <li>Not as good a product as I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it will work for now.</li>
            <li>The applicator top takes some oomph to depress which makes it spray too much in one spot.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, I would get my roots done every 6 weeks at salon prices, now I spray this on (takes seconds, looks amazing) and this extends to months (yes, months!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly true auburn, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close; plus it sure is better than grey.  </li>
            <li>Color really blends.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps a bit pricey and you can feel it on your hair, but it works so well that I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>This really is helpful at the crown of my head to conceal those roots and also not allowing my scalp to be noticeable.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for light to medium auburn red or brown hair.</li>
            <li>My very observant husband who could spot a needle in a haystack was also impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely does not rub off on anything.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves a visible mark not only on your scalp, but also under your fingernails anytime you lightly scratch your scalp.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really hides the roots.</li>
            <li>Love this...easy to use, covers growth with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>It blends in really nice with my brownish red hair and I use it when my hair needs it most, that last week before I&#x27;m due for a coloring.</li>
            <li>stays on for a couple of days if you don&#x27;t wash your hair (and even if you do, doesn&#x27;t completely wash out right away.  </li>
            <li>Way better than other concealers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I have been in a significantly stressful situation in the last year and my hair has paid the price.  </li>
            <li>Works amazing for those in-between weeks that the grey and white start showing!</li>
            <li>only wish it had a true auburn color</li>
            <li>The best part is that it&#x27;s not as messy as other similar products.  </li>
            <li>I bought several Root Concealer Sprays for my dyed-dark red hair, and I LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>It is a decent product and I would buy again.  </li>
            <li>I finally was able to press and immediately release which provided short bursts which worked great.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>, it has more of a brown red,  instead of a red brown.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anybody that needs touch up between color appointments.  </li>
            <li>IT recommend it so highly.</li>
            <li>This covers very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I would love a refund and a free box of hair color as an apology for overpaying for a useless product that will sit under my sink until I finally gift it to someone who knows the risks, but more likely I will throw it away, despite the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Gray Away and My Secret Correctives and experienced the same effect.</li>
            <li>However, it does cover nicely and this is one of the few red root covers in the market.</li>
            <li>I do not know if the other colors work as well as the red, but I would imagine as long as it is a good color match, that they would.</li>
            <li>It is a darker color than you would think (I use the red and it is medium brown) but it covers gray very very well.</li>
            <li>A couple of tips: follow the instructions (spray from 8+ inches away); don&#x27;t overspray (spray lightly); and hold your hair up vertically with one hand so you spray the gray roots and not right on the scalp.</li>
            <li>The Auburn/Red color is not Auburn at all - it&#x27;s like a light brown color when sprayed, but it does seem to blend in with my hair color - dark reddish brown.</li>
            <li>No mess!</li>
            <li>As for the product, it worked okay, though it was hard to control.</li>
            <li>Another thing I noticed is that it is hard to shampoo out, which makes me wonder if it is okay for my hair.  </li>
            <li>But really miraculous for that last week before you get your color done.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Your hair stays soft after it is applied.</li>
            <li>When I got my can from the vendor, it had a sticker marked Tester on it</li>
            <li>Gave me a seamless look.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead</li>
            <li>It gives my hair volume and the product is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It looks verry natural and is not sticky or powdery.</li>
            <li>It belongs in the spray paint aisle at your local Home Depot, right next to the Rustoleum(tm).  </li>
            <li>It was the correct color, all right, but came out of the can very, very much darker than previous orders of the same product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and lasts until next shampoo with just a little touch up in the a.m.  </li>
            <li>But it arrived on time &amp; the whole point is to cover the grey and it does do that.</li>
            <li>Seems that the red colors - besides being harder to find - are either a bit dark (and brownish) or if they&#x27;re more red, they don&#x27;t cover very well.</li>
            <li>Does make your hair a little stiff feeling where you spray it, but it&#x27;s better than being gray!</li>
            <li>As others have said, this is not bright red, more like a used penny, but it does blend seamlessly.  </li>
            <li>It is difficult for it to not be visible on your scalp, but maybe that is just because my hair is pretty fine.  </li>
            <li>(yes, I mean it! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I generally use it for one week in between coloring.</li>
            <li>Allowed me to go an extra month before having my roots professionally done.</li>
            <li>As I said my roots are mostly white and this stuff covers seamlessly.  </li>
            <li>so I could go back to my natural color.</li>
            <li>My roots are white, my hair is auburn with highlights and this product keeps the roots completely covered for 4 days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely gray, but can now go weeks longer until my next color appointment.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little practice to use neatly but works so much better than other products on the market for the same purpose.</li>
            <li>now I will have to wait for this half inch ruined hair to match the color I have been trying to grow out in the first place.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this, it covers the grey well, but as other reviews stated the color is not red, more of a dark brown.  </li>
            <li>Still, that&#x27;s barely noticeable since you really only spray it at your roots.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t wash this out right away</li>
            <li>The color is a very brown red which works for me, but would be too dark if your hair is anything lighter than the color of a used penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little messy but really easy to wipe off your skin.</li>

            <li> Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> but it is awesome at covering the roots.  </li>
            <li> My best advice is:  READ the instructions, they are written for a reason.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but had to share that this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for in between hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for hiding outgrowth when you don&#x27;t feel like dyeing your hair just yet, but it&#x27;s also wonderful for hiding patches of thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Perfect coverage to get you through those periods of not being able to get to the salon &amp; the grays are showing!</li>
            <li> Great for in between coloring root touch ups.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> This product covers great for me.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great for in-between coloring.</li>
            <li> My sister uses the brown color and it works great on her gray roots too.</li>
            <li> It works great and I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> The auburn color is great.</li>
            <li> This spray is great to hide the gray.</li>
            <li> Great size for traveling as</li>
            <li> Product is great.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product....</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Stock up very handy.</li>
            <li> this blended perfectly and was great until I was able to get to the salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic, love it!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> This would be perfect if there were more colors to pick from.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best thing since sliced bread, no WAY better, because it saves me $100s of dollars.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed that the color matches so evenly and is so easy to apply.    </li>
            <li> Style Edit is an excellent product for covering my roots between coloring a. Easy to apply and matches my hair color leaving no tell tale signs.</li>
            <li> do not recommend it, it is a paint spray, good luck spraying on your scalp and having your hair fall out</li>
            <li> but if you have brown hair, the coverage is good.  </li>
            <li> Does good job covering gray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li> This color blended perfectly for my in between colorings, was easy to apply, and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Style Edit is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t sweat, and covers roots beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best root concealer I have used, have been using it since it first came out.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love this, no time to color, no worries...keeps gray roots covered until you get to it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Auburn/Red\\&quot; is &#x27;ferr sherr&#x27; better than sporting gray roots!</li>
            <li> I referred too many people to my hairdresser and now I can&#x27;t get in!</li>
            <li> amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best root concealer I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> but it is a muted auburn and blends in nicely.  </li>
            <li> but then the product kind of dripped out on my head.  </li>
            <li> just wish they had a nice auburn color like the one I have gotten from Samy Hair Salon.</li>
            <li> I use auburn and it blends nicely.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to a friend and she liked it too.</li>
            <li> Application is very easy.  </li>
            <li> Good staying power, best spray I have found, and also best for auburn/red --which is difficult to find.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> will keep ordering this product I have tried 5 before this, and by far this is the best for coverage and hold.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this spray in between dye jobs.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product ever to get you through the next time you get colorb</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I used Oribe before and I love that</li>
            <li> This iss more brown than auburn and does not blend with my hair</li>
            <li> It is more brown.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> After using this, I had to check the can to make sure I&#x27;d received the color I&#x27;d ordered.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get to use it more than once.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot better, it&#x27;s fragrance-free, non-irritating, covers and blends in well, and as a bonus, the Grayce powder can be used on brows, too.</li>
            <li> but I rate it a 4 instead of a 5 star because the auburn/red is more of a brown color.</li>
            <li> If there were more options you could also do some temporary highlighting.  </li>
            <li> I love this product to cover the gray in the crown of my hair between having my hair colored at the salon.</li>
            <li> And ironically, they&#x27;re available at Home Depot!</li>
            <li> Make sure you hold up a tissue on your skin while spraying, otherwise you&#x27;ll get droplets on your skin.</li>
            <li> I actually love this product.</li>
            <li> You will be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> She mentioned that there were spray on powder dyes available, but did not want to promote anything that cut into her own profits.  </li>
            <li> I read many Amazon reviews and chose this</li>
            <li> how many applications I will get from one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> Love it and the price.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Love the color to.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It really covers grays very nicely...</li>
            <li> Greatest thing ever for someone who is going grey!  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t feel very full.</li>
            <li> I wish it were more available in stores.  </li>
            <li> On the hair this looks more of a light brown tint.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping, Great Item.</li>
            <li> My roots are completely gray, but style edit covers it very nicely.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and covers well.</li>
            <li> The company is very quick to deliver and I received both my shipments on time (</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t spray easily.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I like the product very much</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for a quick, easy root touch up.  </li>
            <li> its fine use it a lot</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have experienced this problem.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a shame as I enjoy having shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> I resisted it for a while, thinking it couldn&#x27;t cover very specific areas, but am happy to say it works great, and it actually comes in my color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy and stays in until my hair is</li>
            <li> Its great to have a way to cover grays quickly on those mornings when I realize my roots are starting to show.  </li>
            <li> The aerosol spray was so forceful that it just blew the part in my hair that I was trying to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; completely clean.  </li>
            <li> perfect shade for burgundy colored hair (not strawberry blonde  but really red-violet) and the dispenser directs the spray exactly where you want it to go.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price was just right!</li>
            <li> Very timely and love this product.</li>
            <li> Stretches my hair color for a full week, saving me the cost of three appointments on an annual basis.</li>
            <li> I love this SO much that I want to share with the world</li>
            <li> I was worried about it not rubbing off if I miss my hairline, but it does rub off skin pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> Works great and the product doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or other things.  </li>
            <li> other than that, the product has good coverage and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> A quick spray and my roots are gone.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for those last 2 weeks before my next hair coloring appointment!</li>
            <li> It takes just a quick shot of spray in the gray hairs between dye jobs.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this unless you are happy with dark brown roots.</li>
            <li> The nozzle is pretty precise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new customer for sure.</li>
            <li> WOW- extends the life of your color job by days or even a week!!!!!</li>
            <li> great root concealer for my red hair - covers the grey nicely and looks very natural so that I can go for longer periods of time between salon visits!</li>
            <li> Truthfully when it gets this close to coloring week, I have darker color near my roots and lighter at the ends.  </li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re going for the hideous, yet trendy \\&quot;brown roots, red hair &#x27;ombre&#x27; effect\\&quot;, avoid it at all costs.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I rated it only three stars, but it does spray on nicely and covers,</li>
            <li> but I feel worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Works for that inbetween color time and you just can&#x27;t get to the salon right away.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by a friend and she was right.</li>
            <li> blends well, with great coverage (grey) hair, my tint color is true red.</li>
            <li> It is a good match even though my hair is no where near red.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more &#x27;rough-textury&#x27; and rubs off more than the brown color of &#x27;Gray Away&#x27; (haven&#x27;t been able to purchase the red Gray Away), but \\&quot;Style Edit</li>
            <li> I love that it goes only where I want it and stays til I wash it out.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using a concealer spray.  </li>
            <li> it is exactly what I wanted to cover thinning hair and gray.</li>
            <li> it shows up as a brown more than red.  </li>
            <li> My best beauty secret ever!</li>
            <li> My first order was light/med brown...</li>
            <li> That said, Wood Furniture &amp; Floor Repair Markers by Rejuvinate© in both Maple and Oak do a MUCH better job on my RED roots.</li>
            <li> With chemical help it is still red :))  </li>
            <li> It is a tiny bottle, and it takes a lot of spray even to cover just the top of the head roots.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this product at the salon for over a year to cover my grey roots and love it.</li>
            <li> Not as good a product as I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it will work for now.</li>
            <li> The applicator top takes some oomph to depress which makes it spray too much in one spot.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I would get my roots done every 6 weeks at salon prices, now I spray this on (takes seconds, looks amazing) and this extends to months (yes, months!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly true auburn, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close; plus it sure is better than grey.  </li>
            <li> Color really blends.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps a bit pricey and you can feel it on your hair, but it works so well that I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> This really is helpful at the crown of my head to conceal those roots and also not allowing my scalp to be noticeable.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for light to medium auburn red or brown hair.</li>
            <li> My very observant husband who could spot a needle in a haystack was also impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not rub off on anything.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves a visible mark not only on your scalp, but also under your fingernails anytime you lightly scratch your scalp.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really hides the roots.</li>
            <li> Love this...easy to use, covers growth with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> It blends in really nice with my brownish red hair and I use it when my hair needs it most, that last week before I&#x27;m due for a coloring.</li>
            <li> stays on for a couple of days if you don&#x27;t wash your hair (and even if you do, doesn&#x27;t completely wash out right away.  </li>
            <li> Way better than other concealers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I have been in a significantly stressful situation in the last year and my hair has paid the price.  </li>
            <li> Works amazing for those in-between weeks that the grey and white start showing!</li>
            <li> only wish it had a true auburn color</li>
            <li> The best part is that it&#x27;s not as messy as other similar products.  </li>
            <li> I bought several Root Concealer Sprays for my dyed-dark red hair, and I LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> It is a decent product and I would buy again.  </li>
            <li> I finally was able to press and immediately release which provided short bursts which worked great.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> , it has more of a brown red,  instead of a red brown.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anybody that needs touch up between color appointments.  </li>
            <li> IT recommend it so highly.</li>
            <li> This covers very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I would love a refund and a free box of hair color as an apology for overpaying for a useless product that will sit under my sink until I finally gift it to someone who knows the risks, but more likely I will throw it away, despite the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried Gray Away and My Secret Correctives and experienced the same effect.</li>
            <li> However, it does cover nicely and this is one of the few red root covers in the market.</li>
            <li> I do not know if the other colors work as well as the red, but I would imagine as long as it is a good color match, that they would.</li>
            <li> It is a darker color than you would think (I use the red and it is medium brown) but it covers gray very very well.</li>
            <li> A couple of tips: follow the instructions (spray from 8+ inches away); don&#x27;t overspray (spray lightly); and hold your hair up vertically with one hand so you spray the gray roots and not right on the scalp.</li>
            <li> The Auburn/Red color is not Auburn at all - it&#x27;s like a light brown color when sprayed, but it does seem to blend in with my hair color - dark reddish brown.</li>
            <li> No mess!</li>
            <li> As for the product, it worked okay, though it was hard to control.</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed is that it is hard to shampoo out, which makes me wonder if it is okay for my hair.  </li>
            <li> But really miraculous for that last week before you get your color done.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Your hair stays soft after it is applied.</li>
            <li> When I got my can from the vendor, it had a sticker marked Tester on it</li>
            <li> Gave me a seamless look.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead</li>
            <li> It gives my hair volume and the product is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> It looks verry natural and is not sticky or powdery.</li>
            <li> It belongs in the spray paint aisle at your local Home Depot, right next to the Rustoleum(tm).  </li>
            <li> It was the correct color, all right, but came out of the can very, very much darker than previous orders of the same product.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts until next shampoo with just a little touch up in the a.m.  </li>
            <li> But it arrived on time &amp; the whole point is to cover the grey and it does do that.</li>
            <li> Seems that the red colors - besides being harder to find - are either a bit dark (and brownish) or if they&#x27;re more red, they don&#x27;t cover very well.</li>
            <li> Does make your hair a little stiff feeling where you spray it, but it&#x27;s better than being gray!</li>
            <li> As others have said, this is not bright red, more like a used penny, but it does blend seamlessly.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult for it to not be visible on your scalp, but maybe that is just because my hair is pretty fine.  </li>
            <li> (yes, I mean it! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I generally use it for one week in between coloring.</li>
            <li> Allowed me to go an extra month before having my roots professionally done.</li>
            <li> As I said my roots are mostly white and this stuff covers seamlessly.  </li>
            <li> so I could go back to my natural color.</li>
            <li> My roots are white, my hair is auburn with highlights and this product keeps the roots completely covered for 4 days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely gray, but can now go weeks longer until my next color appointment.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to use neatly but works so much better than other products on the market for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> now I will have to wait for this half inch ruined hair to match the color I have been trying to grow out in the first place.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this, it covers the grey well, but as other reviews stated the color is not red, more of a dark brown.  </li>
            <li> Still, that&#x27;s barely noticeable since you really only spray it at your roots.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wash this out right away</li>
            <li> The color is a very brown red which works for me, but would be too dark if your hair is anything lighter than the color of a used penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy but really easy to wipe off your skin.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair except for right in front where my bangs grow.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT the exact match for my dark red/perhaps a bit maroon red hair---but it&#x27;s the best match I have found so far, and doesn&#x27;t make a HORRIBLE mess like the other brands I tried and are now sitting in my bathroom collecting dust.  </li>
            <li> but its much more expensive and doesn&#x27;t last as long as this!</li>
            <li> Sorry I can&#x27;t be more specific other than to say it works well.</li>
            <li> While I am in the process of growing out my natural white/gray hair, my stylist suggested I use this product to fill in the colored brown I&#x27;ve had for years with the half inch white/gray regrowth.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find this product.</li>
            <li> With the skinny long nozzle it&#x27;s easier to get the spray to where you want it.  </li>
            <li> Came on time and it was just what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for a long time....</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get the right amount of spray.  </li>
            <li> This might be a great product to use if you are continuing to color your hair the same color, but it is awful for fill in of regrowth of lighter hair.  </li>
            <li> Once it is dry it stays on until you wash your hair again.</li>
            <li> If you have dark red hair color,  you might want to look for another product.</li>
            <li> I bought the auburn/red, but it isn&#x27;t red at all; it is dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I have washed my hair every day for the past week scrubbing my scalp where this product was sprayed and it will not wash out completely.  </li>
            <li> Next can I buy will be the dark brown/black to see how it compares to the auburn/red one.</li>
            <li> Actually I am washing my hair less that I used to because this product doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to press, and when it finally starts spaying you get a big hunk of spray in one spot.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair but have dark red highlights put in for the winter.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t rub off like other sprays, but it does get a little itchy the next day, so the product will get under your fingernails FYI.</li>
            <li> Later, my hairdresser sold me a pressed powder called Grayce, which I brush onto my my gray &amp;#34;skunk line&amp;#34; with a stiff make-up brush.</li>
            <li> its not worth the trouble or money to send back</li>
            <li> I prefer it over other interim products.</li>
            <li> As for other qualities -- texture, sheen etc.?  </li>
            <li> covers only small spot,expensive  for the amount in the bottle</li>
            <li> The hair that I sprayed was very stiff, as if it had been painted (which, essentially, it had.)</li>
            <li> It is dark brown -- not even a \\&quot;reddish\\&quot; brown, just DARK BROWN -- as other reviewers have also stated.</li>
            <li> red is a really hard color all around ...</li>
            <li> It is dark brown.</li>
            <li> the auburn color is really dark.</li>
            <li> The supposed Auburn/Red version makes your hair dark brown.</li>
            <li> that was way too dark</li>
            <li> This covers well but IS a bit dark.</li>
            <li> It is dark brown.</li>
            <li> Not what I  expected .a WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> although I thought the last shipment was late, but that was due to someone misplacing my box!)</li>
            <li> broke down and asked my beautician if there was any temporary hair color to tide me over.  </li>
            <li> In the past I used Bumble &amp; Bumble dry shampoo to cover up my roots between coloring.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff like other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times and held down the button with less pressure</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t avoid my scalp, and that looked odd, plus it stung a little bit, and made a disquieting sizzling or crackling noise as it touched my hair.</li>
            <li> It should at least cover the grays in my roots regardless of my ends&#x27; color, but it just makes a shockingly dark, wide stripe.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually bother to take the time writing product reviews, love or hate.</li>
            <li> My hair color is a little darker than that</li>
            <li> It was expensive, but a little bit goes a long way, and it seems to last a lot longer than other root concealers I have tried (Roux Stix and Touchback Marker, to name two), and it takes up hardly any room in my crowded bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well if the hair is wet, makes the hair hard to style.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the auburn is a tad too brown for me, but it&#x27;s still a lot better than the horrible gray.</li>
            <li> This product can get messy.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair look uneven.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> it is really difficult to find auburn root concealer in any store - no matter that they have every other possible color in existence.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately what comes out of my scalp is very white and my hair grows rapidly.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who was not blessed with red hair knows how hard it is to cover roots naturally without using a messy product like another hair dye or one of those horrible sticks.</li>
            <li> than Gray Away, and doesn&#x27;t leave a dull finish where sprayed.</li>
            <li> but the spray is really hard to control.</li>
            <li> The sticks are hard to use compared to this.</li>
            <li> Hate the fact that as I am getting older my hair is getting thinner!  </li>
            <li> This product saves me at least 2 weeks from having to color my hair again.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to avoid either, however a gloss instead of matte would have given this at least 3 stars.</li>
            <li> So I can extend my tint process for at least 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This is a serious lifesaver, or at least face saver.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my thin hair and it made it look as thick as the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Stained my hair and was very hard to get out.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> It has left my white/gray hair a dull brownish gray that is atrocious!  </li>
            <li> The only thing I hate about the product is the sprayer.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it is not a great color match.  </li>
            <li> This product is also not returnable because it contains butane, even if you are not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It is worthless for Red or Auburn hair.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who dyes their hair or who has thin or thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Help cover my thin spots and gray root.  </li>
            <li> Sadly what has taken over is what seems to be the norm for us redheads; nasty white hairs.  </li>
            <li> And the texture once it is sprayed on the hair feels a bit sticky and weird.  </li>
            <li> and I get terrible grey around my forehead and ears but</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a horrible color.  </li>
            <li> Nothing horrible but noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on and it made me look like my roots were even worst.</li>
            <li> The worst part?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find this product. Once I started telling people about it, it turns out that everyone uses it. I guess I was the last to know. But really miraculous for that last week before you get your color done.</li>
            <li> I love this spray in between dye jobs. Otherwise I would be dying my hair every two weeks. With this I can go almost four weeks without having to touch up my roots.</li>
            <li> Not as good a product as I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it will work for now.</li>
            <li> very disappointed. The color spray does not even come close to red.It is dark brown. Not what I  expected .a WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this, it covers the grey well, but as other reviews stated the color is not red, more of a dark brown.  But it arrived on time &amp; the whole point is to cover the grey and it does do that.</li>
            <li> Greatest thing ever for someone who is going grey!  A quick spray and my roots are gone.  LOVE IT.  Stays put, no rubbing off on my pillow.  Great for in between coloring root touch ups.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever to get you through the next time you get colorb</li>
            <li> This covers very well and looks natural. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff like other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Allowed me to go an extra month before having my roots professionally done.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!  Works like a dream and is perfect to cover your roots between hair colorings!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Color really blends.  Application is very easy.  Perhaps a bit pricey and you can feel it on your hair, but it works so well that I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Back in the day I was red, but now need chemical help every 6 weeks.  Sadly what has taken over is what seems to be the norm for us redheads; nasty white hairs.  I could go in on the 4th week, but in an effort to not submit myself to constant chemical bombardment I use this product to tide me over between visits to the salon.  As others have said, this is not bright red, more like a used penny, but it does blend seamlessly.  Truthfully when it gets this close to coloring week, I have darker color near my roots and lighter at the ends.  This product covers great for me.  As I said my roots are mostly white and this stuff covers seamlessly.  It&#x27;s like magic, love it!!!!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Hate the fact that as I am getting older my hair is getting thinner!  This really is helpful at the crown of my head to conceal those roots and also not allowing my scalp to be noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have medium auburn hair, and this product is a perfect match.  It&#x27;s a larger can than Gray Away, and doesn&#x27;t leave a dull finish where sprayed.</li>
            <li> the auburn is not.  they say when called it is deep auburn, but it comes out as brown.  and acording to the web they will not accept returns.  so if you are looking for auburn don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I am throwing both bottles away</li>
            <li> I love this product! Takes a little practice to use neatly but works so much better than other products on the market for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best root concealer I have ever tried.  I love that it goes only where I want it and stays til I wash it out.  Has cut by trips to the salon from every 4 weeks to 6.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and covers well.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and uses it between colorings all the time now!</li>
            <li> This root concealer was perfect for me! I have auburn air with some lighter red highlights and I get terrible grey around my forehead and ears but this blended perfectly and was great until I was able to get to the salon. I used Oribe before and I love that but its much more expensive and doesn&#x27;t last as long as this! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for those last 2 weeks before my next hair coloring appointment! It really covers grays very nicely...</li>
            <li> great root concealer for my red hair - covers the grey nicely and looks very natural so that I can go for longer periods of time between salon visits!</li>
            <li> It does cover the grays, but if you have red or auburn hair, it will just make you look like you have brown roots. I&#x27;ve also tried Gray Away and My Secret Correctives and experienced the same effect. If someone could make a root concealer that truly is red or auburn, it would be a miracle!</li>
            <li> The auburn Style Edit is actually brown, not auburn.  This is the third time I have experienced this problem.  They do not have the color control set up properly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great for in-between coloring.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for a quick, easy root touch up.  No mess!</li>
            <li> Works well for red hair</li>
            <li> I bought several Root Concealer Sprays for my dyed-dark red hair, and I LOVE this.  With the skinny long nozzle it&#x27;s easier to get the spray to where you want it.  It is NOT the exact match for my dark red/perhaps a bit maroon red hair---but it&#x27;s the best match I have found so far, and doesn&#x27;t make a HORRIBLE mess like the other brands I tried and are now sitting in my bathroom collecting dust.  I have bought this several times and plan to keep buying it to cover my greys.  I usually don&#x27;t wash this out right away and it doesn&#x27;t rub off like other sprays, but it does get a little itchy the next day, so the product will get under your fingernails FYI. I only wish the red came in different tones.</li>
            <li> no way to protect your scalp.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my sister,a hair stylist.  It takes just a quick shot of spray in the gray hairs between dye jobs.  I got to go 8 weeks between coloring rather than 6 weeks.  I was concerned about the red color but it is a muted auburn and blends in nicely.  My sister uses the brown color and it works great on her gray roots too.</li>
            <li> do not recommend it, it is a paint spray, good luck spraying on your scalp and having your hair fall out</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping, Great Item. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a concealer spray.  Wow.  This product saves me at least 2 weeks from having to color my hair again.  Yeah, yeah, it&#x27;s like others have said.  It&#x27;s not exactly true auburn, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close; plus it sure is better than grey.  I was worried about it not rubbing off if I miss my hairline, but it does rub off skin pretty easily.  I&#x27;m a new customer for sure.</li>
            <li> Works for that inbetween color time and you just can&#x27;t get to the salon right away.  Saves money because it can take a person a week or two before they have to get to salon.</li>
            <li> This iss more brown than auburn and does not blend with my hair</li>
            <li> Very timely and love this product.</li>
            <li> What a horrible color.  Doesn&#x27;t match my red hair.  It is more brown.  Stained my hair and was very hard to get out.  Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Its perfect for in between salon visits. The only thing I hate about the product is the sprayer. It is so hard to press, and when it finally starts spaying you get a big hunk of spray in one spot. If they can fix that it will be perfect because it is the perfect color for my hair. I&#x27;m still going to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what I wanted to cover thinning hair and gray. I will be ordering it again...definitely!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those in between hair color appointments!</li>
            <li> It works great and I will be ordering it again. It was recommended by a friend and she was right.</li>
            <li> Anyone who was not blessed with red hair knows how hard it is to cover roots naturally without using a messy product like another hair dye or one of those horrible sticks. Style Edit is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t sweat, and covers roots beautifully. Your hair stays soft after it is applied. You can come and brush and still have root coverage. The company is very quick to deliver and I received both my shipments on time (although I thought the last shipment was late, but that was due to someone misplacing my box!) This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Style Edit for about a year and it covers my gray roots until I can get into the salon.  I prefer it over other interim products. It&#x27;s quick and easy and stays in until my hair is shampoo&#x27;d. A couple of tips: follow the instructions (spray from 8+ inches away); don&#x27;t overspray (spray lightly); and hold your hair up vertically with one hand so you spray the gray roots and not right on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Used it to help grow out my hair so I could go back to my natural color.</li>
            <li> After using this, I had to check the can to make sure I&#x27;d received the color I&#x27;d ordered.  It was the correct color, all right, but came out of the can very, very much darker than previous orders of the same product.  It&#x27;s usable, but only just.  I&#x27;ll be looking for another root concealing spray.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I like the product very much but I lost my can when we went away for a weekend and I didn&#x27;t get to use it more than once.</li>
            <li> When I got my can from the vendor, it had a sticker marked Tester on it and it didn&#x27;t feel very full. Should have contacted the vendor about it, but I never did, so that&#x27;s on me. As for the product, it worked okay, though it was hard to control. The hair that I sprayed was very stiff, as if it had been painted (which, essentially, it had.) I couldn&#x27;t avoid my scalp, and that looked odd, plus it stung a little bit, and made a disquieting sizzling or crackling noise as it touched my hair. I stopped using it. Later, my hairdresser sold me a pressed powder called Grayce, which I brush onto my my gray &amp;#34;skunk line&amp;#34; with a stiff make-up brush. I like it a lot better, it&#x27;s fragrance-free, non-irritating, covers and blends in well, and as a bonus, the Grayce powder can be used on brows, too. It was expensive, but a little bit goes a long way, and it seems to last a lot longer than other root concealers I have tried (Roux Stix and Touchback Marker, to name two), and it takes up hardly any room in my crowded bathroom cabinet. If you can find Grayce, I recommend that instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she really likes it.  Sorry I can&#x27;t be more specific other than to say it works well.</li>
            <li> This product does the job but I rate it a 4 instead of a 5 star because the auburn/red is more of a brown color. If you have dark red hair color,  you might want to look for another product. This will work perfect for auburn/mahogany brown hair. My hair color is a little darker than that so it wasn&#x27;t a perfect match but it still blends well with my hair.  I would recommend this for light to medium auburn red or brown hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts until next shampoo with just a little touch up in the a.m.  The auburn color is great. My roots are completely gray, but style edit covers it very nicely.  I generally use it for one week in between coloring. Way better than other concealers I&#x27;ve used before. It&#x27;s a beauty necessity for me now.</li>
            <li> Perfect coverage to get you through those periods of not being able to get to the salon &amp; the grays are showing!</li>
            <li> Great product! Covers wonderfully and stays until you shampoo out! Only wish it comes in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to concealer in between my colors to cover my grays.  Does make your hair a little stiff feeling where you spray it, but it&#x27;s better than being gray!</li>
            <li> This spray is great to hide the gray. It stays on and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;would have given it a five but the spray is really hard to control.</li>
            <li> i thought i would try this brand of spray concealer.  unfortunately it is not a great color match.  it shows up as a brown more than red.  red is a really hard color all around ... but if you have brown hair, the coverage is good.  the lower score for me is for the lack of the correct color.  other than that, the product has good coverage and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best root concealer I have used, have been using it since it first came out.  My roots are white, my hair is auburn with highlights and this product keeps the roots completely covered for 4 days.  As to the matte finish that some reviewers mentioned the blending in helps with this.  I do hold the can about an inch away to prevent darker coverage and brush/ wipe with a tissue to blend in.  Can&#x27;t tell that it is on, friends are amazed when I show them the sections that are not concealed.  The only reason I removed a star is I wish the spray novel was easier to control. My best beauty secret ever!</li>
            <li> Came on time and it was just what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for a long time....Also, the price was just right!</li>
            <li> the auburn color is really dark. its not worth the trouble or money to send back</li>
            <li> The supposed Auburn/Red version makes your hair dark brown. It does cover gray as stated however not in the color claimed on the packaging. This product is also not returnable because it contains butane, even if you are not happy with the product. Do not buy this unless you are happy with dark brown roots.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how I lived without this spray.  I&#x27;m completely gray, but can now go weeks longer until my next color appointment.  The only negative is that the auburn is a tad too brown for me, but it&#x27;s still a lot better than the horrible gray.</li>
            <li> This would be perfect if there were more colors to pick from.  My first order was light/med brown...that was way too dark so I ordered Auburn/red next.  It is a good match even though my hair is no where near red.  If there were more options you could also do some temporary highlighting.  I will continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> The aerosol spray was so forceful that it just blew the part in my hair that I was trying to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; completely clean.  Did not conceal anything.  Tried it a few times and held down the button with less pressure but then the product kind of dripped out on my head.  I had high hopes for this product and am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> In the past I used Bumble &amp; Bumble dry shampoo to cover up my roots between coloring.  That brand costs around $40 a can, but it probably lasted me close to 2 years.  This is a fraction of the cost and works well.  I bought the auburn/red, but it isn&#x27;t red at all; it is dark brown.  But I will choose brown over gray any day of the week.  Another thing I noticed is that it is hard to shampoo out, which makes me wonder if it is okay for my hair.  I prefer B&amp;B, but will finish the can of this since I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this product to cover the gray in the crown of my hair between having my hair colored at the salon.</li>
            <li> It is a decent product and I would buy again.  It is difficult for it to not be visible on your scalp, but maybe that is just because my hair is pretty fine.  Helps cover grays, but definitely won&#x27;t cover darker roots at all.</li>
            <li> Stretches my hair color for a full week, saving me the cost of three appointments on an annual basis.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have discovered this a while ago. This will help me grow my hair out without the worry of greys. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> BEWARE -- this \\&quot;Red\\&quot; color is NOT at all red.  It is dark brown -- not even a \\&quot;reddish\\&quot; brown, just DARK BROWN -- as other reviewers have also stated. Unless you&#x27;re going for the hideous, yet trendy \\&quot;brown roots, red hair &#x27;ombre&#x27; effect\\&quot;, avoid it at all costs.  As for other qualities -- texture, sheen etc.?  It belongs in the spray paint aisle at your local Home Depot, right next to the Rustoleum(tm).  That said, Wood Furniture &amp; Floor Repair Markers by Rejuvinate© in both Maple and Oak do a MUCH better job on my RED roots. (No, NOT kidding!) And they don&#x27;t leave my roots feeling like cotton candy.  And ironically, they&#x27;re available at Home Depot!</li>
            <li> While I am in the process of growing out my natural white/gray hair, my stylist suggested I use this product to fill in the colored brown I&#x27;ve had for years with the half inch white/gray regrowth.  I was assured the product will wash out.  This is not so!  I have washed my hair every day for the past week scrubbing my scalp where this product was sprayed and it will not wash out completely.  It has left my white/gray hair a dull brownish gray that is atrocious!  Even my scalp is this color.  This might be a great product to use if you are continuing to color your hair the same color, but it is awful for fill in of regrowth of lighter hair.  I am livid......now I will have to wait for this half inch ruined hair to match the color I have been trying to grow out in the first place.</li>
            <li> My stylist told me about this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 months. It blends in really nice with my brownish red hair and I use it when my hair needs it most, that last week before I&#x27;m due for a coloring. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for covering gray or thinning areas.  Great size for traveling as it&#x27;s carry on size.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t red it&#x27;s copper, it covers and works as stated but I was expecting an auburn or red color not copper that&#x27;s why I rated it only three stars, but it does spray on nicely and covers, just wish they had a nice auburn color like the one I have gotten from Samy Hair Salon. But this will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> This product can get messy. Make sure you hold up a tissue on your skin while spraying, otherwise you&#x27;ll get droplets on your skin. And the texture once it is sprayed on the hair feels a bit sticky and weird.  However, it does cover nicely and this is one of the few red root covers in the market. The formula could use some updating so it won&#x27;t feel so sticky and textured in the hair.</li>
            <li> its fine use it a lot</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Extends my color a couple weeks.  I use auburn and it blends nicely.</li>
            <li> This is a serious lifesaver, or at least face saver.  It gets the greying among us to the next coloring appointment.</li>
            <li> I actually love this product. I have naturally dark brown hair but have dark red highlights put in for the winter. This color blended perfectly for my in between colorings, was easy to apply, and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  Highly recommend for anybody that needs touch up between color appointments.  You will be pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Does the job but for me I after 1 day it starts to itch.  Does good job covering gray. I would still buy the product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  gets me through an extra week till my next color appointment!</li>
            <li> Love this, no time to color, no worries...keeps gray roots covered until you get to it! Stock up very handy.</li>
            <li> Great product! When those roots suddenly start to show and there is no time for getting to a salon or any DIY touchups, this is my go to product. Once it is dry it stays on until you wash your hair again. It&#x27;s quick, easy and looks natural. It has been a life saver on several occasions.</li>
            <li> This stuff works if your hair is brown. It is worthless for Red or Auburn hair.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time my hair was red.  With chemical help it is still red :))  Unfortunately what comes out of my scalp is very white and my hair grows rapidly.  In the final week in the time between salon visits the roots are as different from the rest of my hair as the stripes on the American Flag.  NOT GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke down and asked my beautician if there was any temporary hair color to tide me over.  She mentioned that there were spray on powder dyes available, but did not want to promote anything that cut into her own profits.  I read many Amazon reviews and chose this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it works - but it is awesome at covering the roots.  I do have the following comments/thoughts for anyone considering this spray:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is a tiny bottle, and it takes a lot of spray even to cover just the top of the head roots.  If you shampoo your hair often this could be a problem.  Don&#x27;t know yet how many applications I will get from one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The color is a very brown red which works for me, but would be too dark if your hair is anything lighter than the color of a used penny.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It is a little hard to get the right amount of spray.  The applicator top takes some oomph to depress which makes it spray too much in one spot.  I finally was able to press and immediately release which provided short bursts which worked great.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Made my scalp itchy on the second day.  Nothing horrible but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The hair does feel gummy where the product has been applied.  You can&#x27;t see the difference but you can feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Gave me a seamless look.  Could not tell that any product had been used.  My very observant husband who could spot a needle in a haystack was also impressed.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Absolutely does not rub off on anything.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Dries rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Covers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and I don&#x27;t want anybody to ever question that.    I have been in a significantly stressful situation in the last year and my hair has paid the price.  I look in the mirror the week before my hair appointment and I am mortified.  MORTIFIED that I can see a white line along my part.  Applying Style Edit makes all the difference.  It lasts all day and gives me confidence that I am not going to be one of those women with that \\&quot;white line\\&quot; showing at their part.    I am very impressed that the color matches so evenly and is so easy to apply.    My best advice is:  READ the instructions, they are written for a reason.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but had to share that this stuff works great! It&#x27;s a little messy but really easy to wipe off your skin. I will definitely be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves a visible mark not only on your scalp, but also under your fingernails anytime you lightly scratch your scalp. There&#x27;s no way to avoid either, however a gloss instead of matte would have given this at least 3 stars. Overall: total meh and so overpriced. I would love a refund and a free box of hair color as an apology for overpaying for a useless product that will sit under my sink until I finally gift it to someone who knows the risks, but more likely I will throw it away, despite the cost.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! The Auburn/Red color is not Auburn at all - it&#x27;s like a light brown color when sprayed, but it does seem to blend in with my hair color - dark reddish brown. Next can I buy will be the dark brown/black to see how it compares to the auburn/red one. It gives my hair volume and the product is not heavy or greasy. Actually I am washing my hair less that I used to because this product doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily. I have recommended it to a friend and she liked it too. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. No sticky feeling at all. I love it! Covers roots and stays put till I shampoo. A must try</li>
            <li> Not very red at all. I  have medium/dark Strawberry Blonde (Henna) with medium brown roots. This was darker than my roots. This is now the 3rd color I&#x27;ve tried of this product line and NONE of them match even close enough to pull off. It should at least cover the grays in my roots regardless of my ends&#x27; color, but it just makes a shockingly dark, wide stripe.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t spray easily. covers only small spot,expensive  for the amount in the bottle</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but I will in the future.  It&#x27;s good stuff.  I bought it at my salon on the advice of my stylist.  It&#x27;s great for hiding outgrowth when you don&#x27;t feel like dyeing your hair just yet, but it&#x27;s also wonderful for hiding patches of thinning hair.  I have thick hair except for right in front where my bangs grow.  This makes my hair look uneven.  I used this on my thin hair and it made it look as thick as the rest of my hair.  The best part is that it&#x27;s not as messy as other similar products.  The nozzle is pretty precise.  I&#x27;ll be buying it again and again and I recommend it to anyone who dyes their hair or who has thin or thinning hair.  I removed one star because it tends to remove the shine from your hair wherever you spray it.  That&#x27;s a shame as I enjoy having shiny hair.  Still, that&#x27;s barely noticeable since you really only spray it at your roots.</li>
            <li> Style Edit is an excellent product for covering my roots between coloring a. Easy to apply and matches my hair color leaving no tell tale signs. Use it from my 4th-6th weeks.</li>
            <li> Seems that the red colors - besides being harder to find - are either a bit dark (and brownish) or if they&#x27;re more red, they don&#x27;t cover very well. This covers well but IS a bit dark. It&#x27;s a little more &#x27;rough-textury&#x27; and rubs off more than the brown color of &#x27;Gray Away&#x27; (haven&#x27;t been able to purchase the red Gray Away), but \\&quot;Style Edit Auburn/Red\\&quot; is &#x27;ferr sherr&#x27; better than sporting gray roots!</li>
            <li> Good staying power, best spray I have found, and also best for auburn/red --which is difficult to find.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep ordering this product I have tried 5 before this, and by far this is the best for coverage and hold.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it had a true auburn color, it has more of a brown red,  instead of a red brown. But when it is sprayed on&lt;br /&gt;it blends well, with great coverage (grey) hair, my tint color is true red. So I can extend my tint process for at least 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;using this product. I will continue to use it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works great and the product doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or other things.  I will buy it again.  I wish it were more available in stores.  Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> On the hair this looks more of a light brown tint. I like how it is a spay. I would buy it again just because it is a spay and is somewhat close to the color I need, but I will keep looking for a closer match.</li>
            <li> Use it in between my hair appointments. Great stuff. Enables me to wait a couple weeks before I have to get my hair colored</li>
            <li> Its great to have a way to cover grays quickly on those mornings when I realize my roots are starting to show.  Its kinda pricey - but I feel worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it and the price.</li>
            <li> perfect shade for burgundy colored hair (not strawberry blonde  but really red-violet) and the dispenser directs the spray exactly where you want it to go.  stays on for a couple of days if you don&#x27;t wash your hair (and even if you do, doesn&#x27;t completely wash out right away.  amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> Help cover my thin spots and gray root.  Love this product will order again and again.  Love the color to.</li>
            <li> I got this for my red hair, and I have medium brown roots. I got the auburn/red spray. It is dark brown. It was darker brown than my roots. I sprayed it on and it made me look like my roots were even worst. The worst part? You can&#x27;t return this item because it&#x27;s aerosol. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> WOW- extends the life of your color job by days or even a week!!!!! It looks verry natural and is not sticky or powdery.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for in between hair coloring.  It really hides the roots.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually bother to take the time writing product reviews, love or hate. I love this SO much that I want to share with the world (yes, I mean it! :)&lt;br /&gt;This is the best thing since sliced bread, no WAY better, because it saves me $100s of dollars. Seriously, I would get my roots done every 6 weeks at salon prices, now I spray this on (takes seconds, looks amazing) and this extends to months (yes, months!) of root coverage. LOVE IT recommend it so highly. I do not know if the other colors work as well as the red, but I would imagine as long as it is a good color match, that they would.</li>
            <li> Works amazing for those in-between weeks that the grey and white start showing!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product at the salon for over a year to cover my grey roots and love it. I especially like it for helping to camouflage my thinning hair on the crown of my head. I spray some on the scalp to help cover the thinning parts. I do this after I style my hair. It doesn&#x27;t work well if the hair is wet, makes the hair hard to style. It doesn&#x27;t rub off on my pillow.</li>
            <li> This product is the bomb! I resisted it for a while, thinking it couldn&#x27;t cover very specific areas, but am happy to say it works great, and it actually comes in my color. it is really difficult to find auburn root concealer in any store - no matter that they have every other possible color in existence. Great product....</li>
            <li> I will never buy again , u can spray and spray and spray and nothing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Takes 5 yrs off by covering those dang roots.</li>
            <li> I referred too many people to my hairdresser and now I can&#x27;t get in! This product is a lifesaver for stretching out time between hair appointments. It is a darker color than you would think (I use the red and it is medium brown) but it covers gray very very well. Great product.</li>
            <li> typo errors in &amp;#34; product description&amp;#34; has put me off even trying it!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this...easy to use, covers growth with minimal effort. The sticks are hard to use compared to this.</li>
