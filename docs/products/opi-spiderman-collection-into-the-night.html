            <li>That bright clear blue in the picture is gorgeous ...</li>

            <li>It came quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>The colour definitely has a violet undertone that you don&#x27;t see in the picture, but I actually love it all the more for it.  </li>
            <li>I needed a blue for my toes to go with a specific outfit and this was perfect.</li>

            <li>I Two coats went on smooth with good coverage and it last for a few weeks before a repolish.</li>
            <li>It takes 3 coats to reach the perfect shade, but as long as you let each coat dry properly (I watch a show on tv while applying)</li>
            <li>colors in this ate all very usable by all ages and the service from whete purchased was fast.</li>
            <li>I wont be giving these away unless its for a gift and it will be brand new, but they can&#x27;t have mine!</li>
            <li>Worth spending the extra money.</li>

            <li> Wife reports that this polish requires at least 2 coats to get the color right.</li>
            <li> Two coats over a clear base is enough to provide full coverage of the nail and last a very long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> Not much of a pastel user, but....</li>
            <li> just the color is not what I expected</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a ligher cobalt color.</li>
            <li> I already gave away all my other nail polishes to a girl that isn&#x27;t picky.</li>
            <li> I feel like a girl again and I wont be wanting to scrap them off like I did with the other ones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than I expected, but that could be just from monitor color distortion.</li>
            <li> Neither dark, nor pastel, but a metallic hue somewhere in between.</li>
            <li> what I received is dark and purplish.</li>
            <li> I am usually a stickler for jewel tones.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a blue the shade shown in the photos, but instead it was a very dark and ugly color</li>
            <li> My other nail polishes didn&#x27;t last a hour before they started chipping and looking like crap.</li>
            <li> Also for being an OPI product, the polish is thin and took three coats to get an even color.</li>
            <li> (I know bad, but I couldn&#x27;t help myself they were bugging me)I just stumbled onto these after I was going through a magazine with the stick on nail polish stickers with all the designs and stuff-they have like stones on them to.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> to add a photo taken in sunlight (please forgive my terrible paint job, just trying to show the color)</li>

            <li> The color does not look anything like the photo.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. One coat does the trick and looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color but to me, I did not see the two tone effect pictured. I prefer to get my nails done at the salon using the &amp;#34;mood changing&amp;#34; gel now.</li>
            <li> It is a bit more purple than blue and it does take 3-4 coats to make it look nice and non-see through, but overall I like it a lot !</li>
            <li> Just one look a the bottle and I fell in love!!! I just painted my fingernails to see the durability of another color same brand haven&#x27;t the foggiest for when I don&#x27;t want to be all silver, outstanding!!! My other nail polishes didn&#x27;t last a hour before they started chipping and looking like crap. I got those from supermarkets. Never again will I own anything but OPI!!!!! Even eating shelled pistachios they held up pretty good. I applied this color to my toes right away, all I can say is WOW!!!! I already gave away all my other nail polishes to a girl that isn&#x27;t picky. I wont be giving these away unless its for a gift and it will be brand new, but they can&#x27;t have mine! I feel like a girl again and I wont be wanting to scrap them off like I did with the other ones (I know bad, but I couldn&#x27;t help myself they were bugging me)I just stumbled onto these after I was going through a magazine with the stick on nail polish stickers with all the designs and stuff-they have like stones on them to. And I didn&#x27;t like that you pay $15.00 or so for them only lasting 2 weeks if that. I wanted something that would be in a bottle that I could use over and over again and change it up without forking over $15.00 each time. Under $10.00 for a lot of these polishes and it&#x27;s worth every penny!!! I&#x27;m going to be forever in love with these nail polishes!</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish and love this color.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a blue the shade shown in the photos, but instead it was a very dark and ugly color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than I expected, but that could be just from monitor color distortion. Quick delivery! Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> I am usually a stickler for jewel tones. Not much of a pastel user, but....this blue is neither! It is fabulous! Neither dark, nor pastel, but a metallic hue somewhere in between. It&#x27;s like wearing a sports car on your nails! Fun! Fun! Fun!</li>
            <li> This blue is one of my favorite colors. I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  It came quickly and packaged well. What&#x27;s not to like?  OPI is great.</li>
            <li> I normally like pinks or peaches but this color is amazing and looks wonderful on.  I simply love it, it looks better than in the picture.</li>
            <li> thought it was going to be brighter the polish it self is great just the color is not what I expected</li>
            <li> Worth spending the extra money. Awesome colors, great wear, and big variety of colors to choose from. Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this color was expecting a bright blue,not at what I received..I got a deep more purple color. Not at all what I wanted or thought I was ordering! Will definitely not be ordering from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the 4th of July and didn&#x27;t  expect to love the shade as much as I do.  It&#x27;s gorgeous.  I&#x27;m already plotting putting silver glittery snowflakes over it for most of the winter ;)  As Always, OPI is a a great quality polish.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. That bright clear blue in the picture is gorgeous ... what I received is dark and purplish. In fact it matches the color of a purple nail polish I already own.</li>
            <li> exactly as shown long lasting</li>
            <li> Love it!  The color is also pefect to add designs to it.</li>
            <li> The color is darker and more purple than shown in the photo. I expected this to be a ligher cobalt color. Still giving high stars because it is a beautiful color, just not exactly what is shown. Opi&#x27;s polish are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT to add a photo taken in sunlight (please forgive my terrible paint job, just trying to show the color)</li>
            <li> I love OPI so had no problem buying this sight unseen.  The colour definitely has a violet undertone that you don&#x27;t see in the picture, but I actually love it all the more for it.  It takes 3 coats to reach the perfect shade, but as long as you let each coat dry properly (I watch a show on tv while applying), you will have a smooth, dent-free finish.</li>
            <li> These little bottles are great. colors in this ate all very usable by all ages and the service from whete purchased was fast.</li>
            <li> The color I received is more periwinkle than this blue. Also for being an OPI product, the polish is thin and took three coats to get an even color. I wont be ordering from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> I needed a blue for my toes to go with a specific outfit and this was perfect. I Two coats went on smooth with good coverage and it last for a few weeks before a repolish. Good polish.</li>
            <li> The polish is beautiful, but much darker blue than in the online photo. It is closer to OPI Nail Polish Yoga-ta Get This Blue 0.5 oz. I still gave it 4 stars because the color is rich and has a nice shine. Two coats over a clear base is enough to provide full coverage of the nail and last a very long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> My go-to pedicure color.  Looks amazing.</li>
            <li> What an interesting nail polish color! It changes color depending on the angle you&#x27;re looking at it. Its much darker than the picture shows BUT its a very cool color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail polish addict and I didn&#x27;t have this Gorgeous color! I also got tons of compliments when I wore this.</li>
            <li> Not as pretty as the picture.  but nice.</li>
            <li> Love spidy! And now I can wear it on my nails. Lovely color!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the color, and thank you for such a quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Wife reports that this polish requires at least 2 coats to get the color right. Three coats to make it opaque. Shimmery color is a nice blue but with so many coats required, the polish then dents and marks easily. Not the best OPI color, but just okay.</li>
