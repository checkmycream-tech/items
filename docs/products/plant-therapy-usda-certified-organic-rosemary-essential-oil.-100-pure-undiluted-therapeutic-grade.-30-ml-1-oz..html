            <li>I use it every day and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with all my purchases from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>Lovely, invigorating, soothing!  </li>
            <li>there are too many variables to consider!</li>
            <li>Nice quality</li>
            <li>27 Hz and go all the way up to 360 Hz, which is the frequency of rose oil (provided</li>
            <li>The odor is very strong if used by itself ( which is not recommended).</li>
            <li>This is my first product by this company and was very pleased!</li>
            <li>Bought this for a friend and she loved it very much!</li>
            <li>I recommend being sure this is what you want before you buy it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this oil.  </li>
            <li>--I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Have been totally pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this source.</li>
            <li>So we shall see whether or not it is &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34;, since I cannot afford to purchase my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>So many manufacturers these days do not care about quality.</li>
            <li>it Seems to work well as a memory stimulator does not increase memory but speeds it up :)</li>
            <li>It seems to contain more top-notes, rather than the woodsy notes.</li>
            <li>So happy to have found a quality product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this rosemary oil.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>love it will buy it again</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use it in home made hair treatments to facilitate healthy scalp and hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and wil buy more from this customer when I run out.</li>
            <li>The rest were sealed appropriately.</li>
            <li>This oil is a great quality, and is priced very well for the amount too.  </li>
            <li>Great organic essential oil at a much better price than in stores!</li>
            <li>, I use it in my conditioner to help with my hair growth and thickness its doing a great job so far.</li>
            <li>Giving a 4 star is NOT bad at all, when I haven&#x27;t even begun using it!</li>
            <li>Love this essential oil, the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li>but I gave two stars because I liked the way it made my hair look when I first combed it in...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this to 5 stars if the second bottle is satisfactory as the product was wonderful for the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was more economical compared to others offered.  </li>
            <li>That is why it is so important</li>
            <li>This came in record time and fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy&#x27;s Organic Rosemary Essential oil is a great multifunctional product.  </li>
            <li>The smell, when mixed, is pleasant and I definitely feel the increase of blood flow in my body afterwards, which is a great feeling.</li>
            <li>I do compare everything to YLEO, because of being a distributor for almost 30 years (only to purchase at wholesale, not to sell, as that is a 18-hour day job, 7 days/week, if one really wants to be successful!</li>
            <li>I essentially bought this oil to help hair regrowth, but have found so many more uses!  </li>
            <li>Came at a great time, didn&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
            <li>This oil smells fresh and has a label on the lid for easy recognition.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my hair to help clean my scalp and stimulate growth.</li>
            <li>like it, very strong rosemary, good price, little makes a lot</li>
            <li>Smells good no lasting effects</li>
            <li>the oil is distilled properly), and again, each step of the process that a plant must go through depends upon the plant, along with myriad other factors involved, so using the best and highest quality essential oils one can get one&#x27;s hands on is of great importance and necessity, if one wishes to maintain optimal health.</li>
            <li>This was fine at first</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product and service.</li>
            <li>The essential oil of every plant is the most potent part of the plant -- it is where the nutrition comes from.</li>
            <li>It appears to be quite pure.&lt;br /&gt;Really enjoying, and recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Tested it- was more pure than the ones I baught at whole foods...AND CHEAPER!</li>
            <li>The frequency when measuring in hertz of each oil is what is the most important (provided the integrity is not compromised) as far as how effective from a nutritional standpoint any essential oil will be.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops on a cotton ball can make your room smell great.</li>
            <li>Smell fresh, and be skinny.</li>
            <li>and it also clears out my nose as well, but i quickly ran out of the first bottle</li>
            <li>I really like this brand as well!</li>
            <li>This brand is the first time I have purchased it, so time will tell as to whether or not I will continue to purchase from this company.</li>
            <li>that &amp;#34;where&amp;#34; one purchases their oils really does matter!</li>
            <li>My scalp tingles to a much greater degree than I have experienced in the past with other rosemary ois, when I use it in my hair care products.  </li>
            <li>I ordered my first one and it smelled very minty, i use it for my hair for when i shampoo and after shower since I am losing hair</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most care only about how much money they can make, and how much of &#x27;anything&#x27; they can produce in the shortest amount of time.</li>
            <li>Having been using them for about 30 years, I know quite a lot, and I can attest to their effectiveness in keeping my body as healthy as possible, given my particular circumstances.</li>
            <li>This stronger grade may cause a mild sensation of burn or mild irritation to the eyes if you unknowingly still have some trace amounts left on your hands.</li>
            <li>I used this to make rosemary bath salts and the fragrance is quite strong enough for this purpose</li>
            <li>(I prefer this smell over the smell of the pure tea tree oil)</li>
            <li>My new favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>So given all these factors, I believe I&#x27;m being very generous in my feedback, giving 4 stars, when I really am taking a chance at this point.</li>
            <li>So given all these factors, I believe I&#x27;m being very generous in my feedback, giving 4 stars, when I really am taking a chance at this point.</li>
            <li>My Daughter has Fibromyalgia and this really seems to help her.</li>
            <li>Very aromatic and therapeutic Rosemary.</li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>I have purchased rosemary oil for my beauty regimen before, but I can really smell and feel the difference in this organic, therapeutic grade.  </li>
            <li>MOST essential oils on the market are far from &amp;</li>
            <li>Scent is a little strong, but it quickly fades.</li>
            <li>So useful it should be an essential in any home first aid kit.</li>
            <li>You only have to use a small amount to get a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>few years this was my best site to buy essential oil, but the store was closed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s stimulated growth as added &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to my thin hair - Loving the results!</li>
            <li>Lavender still is a very close second, but Rosemary is a new scent to me and I am very much enjoying using it in several homemade spa products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten this same oil from this company before, and I absolutely love the quality of their oils and will still keep buying them after this last order but this bottle did come with a cracked seal</li>
            <li>I use essential oils a lot and love the quality of the Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>highly respect</li>
            <li>High quality, I do recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality and cant beat the price</li>
            <li>This particular essential oil appears to be of high quality and in a very convenient bottle.  </li>
            <li>I did not give it a 5 star only because the quality is nowhere near good enough as YLEO, but comparing essential oils to YL is setting a very high standard, which is essential (pardon the pun) when it comes to reaping the benefits of each and every oil.</li>
            <li>And just making the tablets and the resulting fragrance through the house helped clear all the noses!</li>
            <li>The average frequency of a healthy human body during the daytime is 62 to 68</li>
            <li>There is SO much information about essential oils!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because it pours out too fast.</li>
            <li>I also occasionally diffuse it because I really like the smell of rosemary.</li>
            <li>They hold serious medicinal qualities -- but that depends upon the quality of the essential oil and how it is processed/distilled, etc.; the equipment used and every single step taken not being compromised by lack of integrity on the part of the individuals and machinery used, as well as &#x27;where&#x27; a plant is grown, how healthy the soil is (i.e. is it rich in minerals, etc.?)</li>
            <li>However, I am referring to the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; in this particular context as being what I would expect Rosemary Essential Oil to smell like.</li>
            <li>Each plant has to go through a specific distillation process that is unique for every single plant, and if every step of the process is not done properly, the integrity of the oil becomes compromised.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product for my hair only, but after doing some research, I have discovered a myriad of other uses for this oil!</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy&#x27;s price (compared to other comparable brands) is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>They said it was only the second case of this in thousands of bottles sent out, and I am very pleased that they stand behind their product so well.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that the fluid line was lower on it than on my other two bottles of the same size I ordered (which is why this isn&#x27;t a full 5 stars)</li>
            <li>Just started using it for the purposes to stimulate hair follicles, has a slight menthol smell, but using with lavender oil and other oils.&lt;br /&gt;Seems a fresh and quality organic oil.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, especially for diffusing during a cold.</li>

            <li> The frequency when measuring in hertz of each oil is what is the most important (provided the integrity is not compromised) as far as how effective from a nutritional standpoint any essential oil will be.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops on a cotton ball can make your room smell great.</li>
            <li> Smell fresh, and be skinny.</li>
            <li> and it also clears out my nose as well, but i quickly ran out of the first bottle</li>
            <li> I really like this brand as well!</li>
            <li> This brand is the first time I have purchased it, so time will tell as to whether or not I will continue to purchase from this company.</li>
            <li> that &amp;#34;where&amp;#34; one purchases their oils really does matter!</li>
            <li> My scalp tingles to a much greater degree than I have experienced in the past with other rosemary ois, when I use it in my hair care products.  </li>
            <li> I ordered my first one and it smelled very minty, i use it for my hair for when i shampoo and after shower since I am losing hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, most care only about how much money they can make, and how much of &#x27;anything&#x27; they can produce in the shortest amount of time.</li>
            <li> Having been using them for about 30 years, I know quite a lot, and I can attest to their effectiveness in keeping my body as healthy as possible, given my particular circumstances.</li>
            <li> This stronger grade may cause a mild sensation of burn or mild irritation to the eyes if you unknowingly still have some trace amounts left on your hands.</li>
            <li> I used this to make rosemary bath salts and the fragrance is quite strong enough for this purpose</li>
            <li> (I prefer this smell over the smell of the pure tea tree oil)</li>
            <li> My new favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> So given all these factors, I believe I&#x27;m being very generous in my feedback, giving 4 stars, when I really am taking a chance at this point.</li>
            <li> So given all these factors, I believe I&#x27;m being very generous in my feedback, giving 4 stars, when I really am taking a chance at this point.</li>
            <li> My Daughter has Fibromyalgia and this really seems to help her.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic and therapeutic Rosemary.</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> I have purchased rosemary oil for my beauty regimen before, but I can really smell and feel the difference in this organic, therapeutic grade.  </li>
            <li> MOST essential oils on the market are far from &amp;</li>
            <li> Scent is a little strong, but it quickly fades.</li>
            <li> So useful it should be an essential in any home first aid kit.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount to get a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li> few years this was my best site to buy essential oil, but the store was closed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stimulated growth as added &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to my thin hair - Loving the results!</li>
            <li> Lavender still is a very close second, but Rosemary is a new scent to me and I am very much enjoying using it in several homemade spa products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this same oil from this company before, and I absolutely love the quality of their oils and will still keep buying them after this last order but this bottle did come with a cracked seal</li>
            <li> I use essential oils a lot and love the quality of the Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> highly respect</li>
            <li> High quality, I do recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality and cant beat the price</li>
            <li> This particular essential oil appears to be of high quality and in a very convenient bottle.  </li>
            <li> I did not give it a 5 star only because the quality is nowhere near good enough as YLEO, but comparing essential oils to YL is setting a very high standard, which is essential (pardon the pun) when it comes to reaping the benefits of each and every oil.</li>
            <li> And just making the tablets and the resulting fragrance through the house helped clear all the noses!</li>
            <li> The average frequency of a healthy human body during the daytime is 62 to 68</li>
            <li> There is SO much information about essential oils!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because it pours out too fast.</li>
            <li> I also occasionally diffuse it because I really like the smell of rosemary.</li>
            <li> They hold serious medicinal qualities -- but that depends upon the quality of the essential oil and how it is processed/distilled, etc.; the equipment used and every single step taken not being compromised by lack of integrity on the part of the individuals and machinery used, as well as &#x27;where&#x27; a plant is grown, how healthy the soil is (i.e. is it rich in minerals, etc.?)</li>
            <li> However, I am referring to the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; in this particular context as being what I would expect Rosemary Essential Oil to smell like.</li>
            <li> Each plant has to go through a specific distillation process that is unique for every single plant, and if every step of the process is not done properly, the integrity of the oil becomes compromised.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product for my hair only, but after doing some research, I have discovered a myriad of other uses for this oil!</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy&#x27;s price (compared to other comparable brands) is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> They said it was only the second case of this in thousands of bottles sent out, and I am very pleased that they stand behind their product so well.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the fluid line was lower on it than on my other two bottles of the same size I ordered (which is why this isn&#x27;t a full 5 stars)</li>
            <li> Just started using it for the purposes to stimulate hair follicles, has a slight menthol smell, but using with lavender oil and other oils.&lt;br /&gt;Seems a fresh and quality organic oil.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, especially for diffusing during a cold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Young Living Essential Oils, whose quality I&#x27;ve come to count on and</li>
            <li> A few times a week, I co-mingle it with Organic Lavender and brush my hair with a natural bristle brush to invigorate my scalp and encourage hair growth.</li>
            <li> In order to continue to use therapeutic essential oils, I had no choice but to look for other alternatives.</li>
            <li> The smell is similar, and of course, every batch of any oils going through the proper distillation process will smell a little different due to the plants themselves and their uniqueness.</li>
            <li> Its fragrance isn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> I plan to try other oils from this brand.</li>
            <li> For now, I chose this over other brands based upon reviews and other factors I read on the website.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it myself, so I won&#x27;t give the 5 stars as I&#x27;m not sure how it measures up to my regular brand.</li>
            <li> A very little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I use this brand for about 90% of my essential oils (some they do not carry or I am unable to get via prime which is critical when I am needing to fill an order).</li>
            <li> The laws are not strict enough (unfortunately) to hold ALL who manufacture essential oils to the highest standards in order to TRULY BE therapeutic grade!</li>
            <li> It can be a little overpowering so use sparingly</li>
            <li> Put a few drops on your pillow helps with sleep.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my palm and mix it with my moisturizer at night.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased quite a few and have never had a problem with any of them.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product in anticipation of cold/flu season coming in just a few months.  </li>
            <li> Being able to purchase these at an affordable price also means I don&#x27;t have to sell my products for outrageous prices to compensate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to work that hard, nor could I if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> It clears up my congestion immediately and I almost feel like I&#x27;m not sick all day, even during the worst colds!</li>
            <li> the 2nd bottle started to go bad as the scent and the texture of the oil</li>
            <li> First, this smells horrible.</li>
            <li> The description of the product is false.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hear it for a company that stands behind their products!</li>
            <li> was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> However,  I couldn&#x27;t find the words &#x27;therapeutic grade&#x27; on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells like that disgusting old-timey liniment ointment stuff</li>
            <li> but it has gone rancid and the aroma is awful two weeks after opening it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good, very strong. A very little bit goes a very long way. this is a very strong oil!! Recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this same oil from this company before, and I absolutely love the quality of their oils and will still keep buying them after this last order but this bottle did come with a cracked seal and I noticed that the fluid line was lower on it than on my other two bottles of the same size I ordered (which is why this isn&#x27;t a full 5 stars) but thankfully the 1oz bottles contained 1.2 oz as a perk so I don&#x27;t feel quite as cheated.</li>
            <li> First, this smells horrible. It smells like that disgusting old-timey liniment ointment stuff and I can&#x27;t stand it. Neither can anyone else who lives with me, and I&#x27;ve had to promise I would either never use this again, or only use it outside.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I bought this because rosemary is supposed to increase hair growth, and I&#x27;m growing my hair out. I noticed no effect...but I gave two stars because I liked the way it made my hair look when I first combed it in...of course, I couldn&#x27;t wear it like that because the smell is longlasting and horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed. I recommend being sure this is what you want before you buy it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This oil smells fresh and has a label on the lid for easy recognition.  Rosemary is great for scalp and hair follicle health.</li>
            <li> This is and oil I am never without.  So useful it should be an essential in any home first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner, undamaged in a package properly designed for size, protection, and ease of opening.  Product is as advertised and does what is advertised.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with all Plant Therapy Products!</li>
            <li> excellent product and price</li>
            <li> Lovely, invigorating, soothing!  I use it in my bath preparations.  It appears to be quite pure.&lt;br /&gt;Really enjoying, and recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Very good quality EO. Use for hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil for memory. It makes me feel good when I take it.</li>
            <li> This oil smells very nice. I use it in my home to reduce stress. Put a few drops on your pillow helps with sleep. Oil is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this oil.  I use it in my hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I essentially bought this oil to help hair regrowth, but have found so many more uses!  I really like this brand as well! This is my first product by this company and was very pleased!</li>
            <li> I used this to make rosemary bath salts and the fragrance is quite strong enough for this purpose--I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> this is the best one we&#x27;ve used.  Add it to a bath for a delightful aromatherapy journey and Rosemary is believed to suppress cortisol production.  Smell fresh, and be skinny.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend and she loved it very much! she uses it as a moisturizer and to keep her skin flawless.</li>
            <li> Have been totally pleased with this product.  It was more economical compared to others offered.  Glad I found this source.</li>
            <li> Lovey to add to cleansing oil mix...strong scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered my Organic Rosemary Essential Oil, it was delivered on time and I was very happy with the product. It worked so well that I re-ordered it for my grandmother, who is using it also and she loves it too. Thanks for such a great product and service.</li>
            <li> I purchased to mix with eucalyptus essential oil for a hair thickening formula suggested by my hair dresser.  It works!</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair for regrowth mixed with lavender and castor oil and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I make skin products so using Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils are key so as not to cause irritations. I use this brand for about 90% of my essential oils (some they do not carry or I am unable to get via prime which is critical when I am needing to fill an order). I have experienced no issues myself in testing nor have I received any complaints from customers. Being able to purchase these at an affordable price also means I don&#x27;t have to sell my products for outrageous prices to compensate. Very pleased with this brand and will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> This oil is very nice.  You only have to use a small amount to get a great fragrance.  Nice quality</li>
            <li> Great organic essential oil at a much better price than in stores!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Young Living Essential Oils, whose quality I&#x27;ve come to count on and highly respect -- however, I cannot afford their prices. In order to continue to use therapeutic essential oils, I had no choice but to look for other alternatives. The smell is similar, and of course, every batch of any oils going through the proper distillation process will smell a little different due to the plants themselves and their uniqueness. However, I am referring to the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; in this particular context as being what I would expect Rosemary Essential Oil to smell like. I do compare everything to YLEO, because of being a distributor for almost 30 years (only to purchase at wholesale, not to sell, as that is a 18-hour day job, 7 days/week, if one really wants to be successful! I don&#x27;t want to work that hard, nor could I if I wanted to. I plan to try other oils from this brand. I did not give it a 5 star only because the quality is nowhere near good enough as YLEO, but comparing essential oils to YL is setting a very high standard, which is essential (pardon the pun) when it comes to reaping the benefits of each and every oil. The essential oil of every plant is the most potent part of the plant -- it is where the nutrition comes from. Each plant has to go through a specific distillation process that is unique for every single plant, and if every step of the process is not done properly, the integrity of the oil becomes compromised. MOST essential oils on the market are far from &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34;, even though they &amp;#34;say&amp;#34; they are &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;. The laws are not strict enough (unfortunately) to hold ALL who manufacture essential oils to the highest standards in order to TRULY BE therapeutic grade! That is simply a fact! It is not an opinion. The frequency when measuring in hertz of each oil is what is the most important (provided the integrity is not compromised) as far as how effective from a nutritional standpoint any essential oil will be. The average frequency of a healthy human body during the daytime is 62 to 68 Hz. Disease begins at around a frequency of 55-58 Hz. Essential oils are one of the healthiest things for the human body, as YLEO begin around 27 Hz and go all the way up to 360 Hz, which is the frequency of rose oil (provided the oil is distilled properly), and again, each step of the process that a plant must go through depends upon the plant, along with myriad other factors involved, so using the best and highest quality essential oils one can get one&#x27;s hands on is of great importance and necessity, if one wishes to maintain optimal health. This brand is the first time I have purchased it, so time will tell as to whether or not I will continue to purchase from this company. Giving a 4 star is NOT bad at all, when I haven&#x27;t even begun using it! For now, I chose this over other brands based upon reviews and other factors I read on the website. So we shall see whether or not it is &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34;, since I cannot afford to purchase my favorite brand. There is SO much information about essential oils! Having been using them for about 30 years, I know quite a lot, and I can attest to their effectiveness in keeping my body as healthy as possible, given my particular circumstances. They hold serious medicinal qualities -- but that depends upon the quality of the essential oil and how it is processed/distilled, etc.; the equipment used and every single step taken not being compromised by lack of integrity on the part of the individuals and machinery used, as well as &#x27;where&#x27; a plant is grown, how healthy the soil is (i.e. is it rich in minerals, etc.?), how/when it has been harvested .... there are too many variables to consider! That is why it is so important that &amp;#34;where&amp;#34; one purchases their oils really does matter! So many manufacturers these days do not care about quality. Unfortunately, most care only about how much money they can make, and how much of &#x27;anything&#x27; they can produce in the shortest amount of time. The integrity of plants for essential oils is something where &amp;#34;time&amp;#34; cannot be rushed! So given all these factors, I believe I&#x27;m being very generous in my feedback, giving 4 stars, when I really am taking a chance at this point. But again, time will tell....anything&#x27; they can produce in the shortest amount of time. The integrity of plants for essential oils is something where &amp;#34;time&amp;#34; cannot be rushed! So given all these factors, I believe I&#x27;m being very generous in my feedback, giving 4 stars, when I really am taking a chance at this point. But again, time will tell....</li>
            <li> Smells good no lasting effects</li>
            <li> great oil, as described</li>
            <li> like it, very strong rosemary, good price, little makes a lot</li>
            <li> This is a solid product. I sought it out at the suggestion of a friend and now use it daily on different energy points on my body. When it runs out, I look forward to purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell! very pleased</li>
            <li> Excellent products and service!!! Will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a relative.  She has no complaints.  Service was prompt.  I didn&#x27;t use it myself, so I won&#x27;t give the 5 stars as I&#x27;m not sure how it measures up to my regular brand.</li>
            <li> Just started using it for the purposes to stimulate hair follicles, has a slight menthol smell, but using with lavender oil and other oils.&lt;br /&gt;Seems a fresh and quality organic oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived packed with a book ! Almost missed it Seems to work well as a memory stimulator does not increase memory but speeds it up :)</li>
            <li> Very good oil, with a nice plant like smell, I use it in my conditioner to help with my hair growth and thickness its doing a great job so far. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because it pours out too fast.</li>
            <li> I am trying some aroma therapy and I wanted an organic oil. This came in record time and fit the bill. I use it every day and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This was fine at first but it has gone rancid and the aroma is awful two weeks after opening it. I don&#x27;t know if refrigerating it would&#x27;ve helped, but there was nothing about that on the packaging or description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I wrote the company and they replied almost immediately offering to send out a replacement. They said it was only the second case of this in thousands of bottles sent out, and I am very pleased that they stand behind their product so well. I&#x27;ll update this to 5 stars if the second bottle is satisfactory as the product was wonderful for the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RE-EDIT: Received a replacement bottle and it is great. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now and the oil is great. Let&#x27;s hear it for a company that stands behind their products!</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant rosemary aroma, which can be strong in some oils. It seems to contain more top-notes, rather than the woodsy notes.</li>
            <li> Great product. So happy to have found a quality product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My Daughter has Fibromyalgia and this really seems to help her.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this rosemary oil. It has a great fragrance and works wonderfully for keeping my nose untapped while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic and therapeutic Rosemary. We love it.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy&#x27;s Organic Rosemary Essential oil is a great multifunctional product.  I put a few drops in my palm and mix it with my moisturizer at night.  A few times a week, I co-mingle it with Organic Lavender and brush my hair with a natural bristle brush to invigorate my scalp and encourage hair growth. I also occasionally diffuse it because I really like the smell of rosemary. Plant Therapy&#x27;s price (compared to other comparable brands) is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This particular essential oil appears to be of high quality and in a very convenient bottle.  Its fragrance isn&#x27;t what I expected but I&#x27;m intending to mix it off in order to utilize its beneficial qualities.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, especially for diffusing during a cold. It clears up my congestion immediately and I almost feel like I&#x27;m not sick all day, even during the worst colds!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this seller as well as the product!  Using this in my shampoo now for about a month - it&#x27;s stimulated growth as added &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; to my thin hair - Loving the results!</li>
            <li> smells good and helps stay alert and concentrate. I use it in my office in a diffuser. It can be a little overpowering so use sparingly</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my skin and hair. Scent is a little strong, but it quickly fades. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> love it will buy it again</li>
            <li> I use this in a vinegar hair rinse and I use it in my oil burner. It smells great. High quality product!</li>
            <li> The package was perfect. Arrived in time.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality and price. This is the best quality I found since Aroma4Life.com - form few years this was my best site to buy essential oil, but the store was closed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. My new favorite essential oil. Lavender still is a very close second, but Rosemary is a new scent to me and I am very much enjoying using it in several homemade spa products. High quality, I do recommend.</li>
            <li> Great great product! I use it on my hair to help clean my scalp and stimulate growth. I also use it to help treat acne breakouts. So far it has been doing all that I expected. It has a great camphor&amp;#34;ish&amp;#34; smell. (I prefer this smell over the smell of the pure tea tree oil) however I combine the two a lot. It shipped in no time at all!</li>
            <li> This is great quality.  I use it in home made hair treatments to facilitate healthy scalp and hair growth.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin and hair feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I use essential oils a lot and love the quality of the Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  Have purchased quite a few and have never had a problem with any of them.</li>
            <li> I ordered my first one and it smelled very minty, i use it for my hair for when i shampoo and after shower since I am losing hair and it also clears out my nose as well, but i quickly ran out of the first bottle so i decided to order a second one, and not a week has passed the 2nd bottle started to go bad as the scent and the texture of the oil have gone totally different!</li>
            <li> The description of the product is false. I thought I was buying a therapeutic grade Rosemary oil. However,  I couldn&#x27;t find the words &#x27;therapeutic grade&#x27; on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this essential oil, the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product for my hair only, but after doing some research, I have discovered a myriad of other uses for this oil! What a pleasant surprise. The odor is very strong if used by itself ( which is not recommended). I add several drops to both my shampoo and conditioner to enhance hair growth. I also use it in my lotion.  The smell, when mixed, is pleasant and I definitely feel the increase of blood flow in my body afterwards, which is a great feeling. I love this stuff and wil buy more from this customer when I run out. Came at a great time, didn&#x27;t have to wait long. Am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for itchy skin and also apply to my hair, can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference in my hair but seems to be helping with my winter skin. I have been very satisfied with all my purchases from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> The lid wasn&#x27;t sealed, as in the plastic pieces which lock on the plastic pieces had already been opened.  I am the one who opened the package, and I know that it had already been opened.  Since I was mixing up Thieves oil to leave the country with on a missions trip, I went ahead and used it.  This was the same with four of the Essential Oils I purchased from you.  The rest were sealed appropriately.</li>
            <li> This brand of rosemary itched my face when I mixed it with a carrier oil.  It also smells like there is something added, similar to rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Great item, great price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased rosemary oil for my beauty regimen before, but I can really smell and feel the difference in this organic, therapeutic grade.  My scalp tingles to a much greater degree than I have experienced in the past with other rosemary ois, when I use it in my hair care products.  Just a bit of caution:  Be mindful to wash hands thoroughly after use or handling, as with any oils.  This stronger grade may cause a mild sensation of burn or mild irritation to the eyes if you unknowingly still have some trace amounts left on your hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I use it for my scalp.  Arrived as described. I will buy again from this company.</li>
            <li> We found a recipe to make some homemade &#x27;vapor shower tablets&#x27; that included rosemary and eucalyptus essential oil.  We purchased this product in anticipation of cold/flu season coming in just a few months.  With 6 kids (yes), and asthma, allergies, and the regular gunk kids share at school, we hoped this would help. This oil is a great quality, and is priced very well for the amount too.  And just making the tablets and the resulting fragrance through the house helped clear all the noses!</li>
            <li> This oil has a wonderful odor, just as if you would run your hand over the plant itself. Just a few drops on a cotton ball can make your room smell great.</li>
            <li> Tested it- was more pure than the ones I baught at whole foods...AND CHEAPER! High quality and cant beat the price</li>
