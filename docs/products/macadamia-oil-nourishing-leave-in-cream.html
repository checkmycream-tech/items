            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product a lot!</li>
            <li>my hair is healthy and not tangle-y!</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite hair product for years!</li>
            <li>This leave in cream conditioner is amazing</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing,  </li>
            <li>this is just a amazing cream.</li>
            <li>Those products smell amazing, this product smells like one of those Flinstone vitamins for kids...</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and works amazingly for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>Also it gives hair kind of a grimy feel and doesn&#x27;t make it silky or shiny</li>
            <li>It kind of finishes it off well when I used both together.</li>
            <li>I liked this</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair and honestly for the price, I would stay with Nexxus.</li>
            <li>Awesome product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Nice and creamy without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I run it through damp hair before blow-drying - it makes my hair soft, smells delicious (a hint of sweet/fruity -</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soo soft &amp; manageable &amp; smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Came in the mail very quickly!</li>
            <li>Leave-In cream after each shower I have static free hair for a good 48 hours</li>
            <li>Did deliver quickly!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made my hair very soft and smell very good</li>
            <li>a nice smell but its strong and lasts until you wash it</li>
            <li>It is best used on hair ends and not roots, where it can make hair look greasy the next day</li>
            <li>Although I love the Macadamia Oil from this brand, this conditioner did not work as intended for me</li>
            <li>We will probably try more products from the line (a friend of mine swears by the mask).</li>
            <li>And maybe it is better than most leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Out of all 4 items purchase, I would recomend this as a sure thing along with the repair masque.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite leave in creams...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shinier and has a better smell.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I was in love with all the products but  after using them for more than 6months</li>
            <li>and I feel that my ends aren&#x27;t as healthy as I&#x27;d expect</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I personally love this leave in cream.</li>
            <li>so i think maybe thatâ€™s why it worked better for her.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I also think it makes it look a bit more shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>plan on buying more products from this brand</li>
            <li>I love the product, but this one came with a pump that did not work.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is more course than mine</li>
            <li>I love these products, and my hair loves them too.</li>
            <li>I just smells much better than others.</li>
            <li>and I would never spend that much on a hair product lol)</li>
            <li>I rubbed the cream in the palms of my hands and stared working it into my ends and up about to the top of my ears avoiding my roots so they wouldnt get oily.</li>
            <li>This leave on bottle&#x27;s top was chipped off at the top.</li>
            <li>Quality inside was okay</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I need to buy more.</li>
            <li>but I think it should have been packaged better</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This works just as well on all lengths of hair, all of my four daughters love it too.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the Macadamia Oil Nourishing Leave-In Cream.</li>
            <li>I could have bought some Cantu Creamy Leave-In Conditioner for 4.99 and would have had better results.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could give it a better review.  </li>
            <li>The kids love it too:), way cheaper at amazon than in the mall!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by us to all of you who have curly fuzzy hair, and need fast fix!!!!</li>
            <li>So far it is good!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and will continue to use as long as it is sold.</li>
            <li>It was ok for me nothing special!</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, it is good quality and so far I can&#x27;t complain about how it makes nice her hair.</li>
            <li>I think it works best when my hair is wet and sectioned.</li>
            <li>it smells great and makes your hair really soft.</li>
            <li>Great for naturally curly afro hair</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this leave in cream, it leaves my hair smooth with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>It smells good but the texture is really greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!:)</li>
            <li>The best part is that it does not clump or leave any residue like other products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This cream smells great and leaves your hair feeling smooth and not heavy .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use since there is no rinsing.</li>
            <li>I also liked how her hair looked after using the product (nice soft, defined curls).</li>
            <li>and I can see the shine and healthy difference after a summer full of swimming.</li>
            <li>Very good for my very long hair (hip length)</li>
            <li>It does not weigh my hair down and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li>The smell is beautiful and fresh and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>works well on my fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a soft pleasant scent in my hair that doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfumes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but it&#x27;s not super amazing.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous and it now a staple product.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, I dont see a real big difference in my hair, I think the leave in nuetrogena leaves my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great, but i was looking for something i could use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>just incase this product didn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped i would have enough time to wash my hair and style it again lol.</li>
            <li>I really like this product though because it smells amazing</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smooth them and doesn&#x27;t help with the frizz.</li>
            <li>It works well enough and smells good, but you&#x27;d be better off getting a leave in from the corner store.</li>
            <li>The product did make my hair feel soft but did nothing for me style wise.</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>Cannot say enough about how much this has changed my hair routine for the better, no split ends here!!!</li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and clean smelling,</li>
            <li>was amazing they were soft ,smooth and bright and no heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw the package at my door.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to get home and try it.</li>
            <li>so I use this on the ends of my hair or anywhere my hair feels dry and it makes my hair feel great.  </li>
            <li>Been using for months, nothing special about this product but the price.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as mosturizing as I expected after the great reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and soft when I use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to work good, the smell is not a gross smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;nice\\&quot; either &#x3D;</li>
            <li>but it is still sweet and almost smells like grapes.</li>
            <li>but it is still sweet and almost smells like grapes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it make my hair so soft and it was easy to detangle and scalp felt so clean.</li>
            <li>use the whole Macadamia line and am in love with all of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it would be as good as the deep repair mask in this line, but for me it just wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>First of all it smells AMAZING (a bit strong) and it leaves her curls manageable and soft without feeling greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product (and all other products sold by this company) as i have been highly impressed with it.</li>
            <li>product makes my hair SUPER greasy and the smell of the product does not wear</li>
            <li>I use it on top of the rinse-out one and this helps keep my frizzies soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this on Amazon, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this at it&#x27;s normal price for what it did.</li>
            <li>It works great, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (and I have very fine / thin hair), and smells great.</li>
            <li>is Pretty good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have pretty frizzy/crazy hair!</li>
            <li>Works great with just a little bit of cream</li>
            <li>Nothing great about this product, it a waste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it three stars for the fast shipping since it&#x27;s available for prime</li>
            <li>I bought this because there was such an enthusiastic review about</li>
            <li>I bought macadamia natural brand healing oil, leave in treatment, and the repair mask, and i must say that my hair has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t decide if the pros are worth the cons.</li>
            <li>I thought the leave in cream would smell the same, but it smells kind of like grape medicine.</li>
            <li>leave my hair soft and light and its cheap</li>
            <li>it is a good product not really  amazing but is ok</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky just soft.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it just buy the travel size like i did.</li>
            <li>Back to the hair lol, once i was confident i saturated every strand, i took a wide tooth comb and combed my hair.</li>
            <li>they packaging was not yet opened and completely fun.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair so soft n&#x27; shinning.  </li>
            <li>use on freshly washed and conditioned hair before styling to retain moisture.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky and shiny and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting to try this for sooo long &amp; I am sooo glad I did!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and makes my hair soft, but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using this and the conditioner my hair is literally softer than it was before and amazing!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I just wanted to shampoo my hair right away.</li>
            <li>I especially love that you can use it on wet hair AND dry hair, where most products for curly hair need to be applied to damp hair, not taking into account that we don&#x27;t necessarily wash our hair every day and</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft too!!!  </li>
            <li>this is my second bottle already and my hair feels very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky soft, easy to brush, and feels light and soft all day.</li>
            <li>first day I received it</li>
            <li>I apply the leave-in first and then the curl cream.</li>
            <li>Somedays I&#x27;ll put one pump of the healing oil onto my hair first</li>
            <li>Since i started using this product my hair is much healthier!</li>
            <li>so be aware.</li>
            <li>-- I just rub some into the length after towel drying and my hair is soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, it&#x27;d different from the Deep repair masque ( as i like the smell of that one better)</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will DEFINITELY buy this again!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, it&#x27;d different from the Deep repair masque ( as i like the smell of that one better)</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will DEFINITELY buy this again!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than mixed chicks by a mile!</li>
            <li>smells fantastic and keeps my hair moisturised, so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>After first use you will feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also love the deep hair mask in this line and the oil.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and clean!The product was packaged to prevent damage and arrived on time and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I noticed the hair was detangled and dryness was reduced after first use.</li>
            <li>But when I use it, I don&#x27;t really find a huge difference from many other leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants soft, shiny, luxurious hair. :)</li>
            <li>This large size bottle last me a very long time at a great savings too.</li>
            <li>AND my hair dries more quickly than with other products.</li>
            <li>Needed something new to replace what I was using, Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum - after a while</li>
            <li>I liked the flavor and will be buying this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li>The hair masque didn&#x27;t really do wonders to my hair but this tamed my frizz and made my hair super soft and shiny like it never has before!!</li>
            <li>Not many stores carry this product where I live and all the salon and beauty shops I been tell me its a great product to use.</li>
            <li>The Product was exactly what was advertised on Amazon, shipment was fast and nothing was damaged on arrival.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, barely wavy hair</li>
            <li>and i mean NEVER used a leave in conditioner/cream this amazing in my life!</li>
            <li>Then I apply it generously and let it air dry :)</li>
            <li>I got up super early because I had work and</li>
            <li>This product adds smoothness and shine and has a delicate, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I use this with a few drops of sweet almond oil &amp; my hair has never looked healthier or better.</li>
            <li>the product is wonderful for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve certainly used them all.</li>
            <li>When I use it on nice soft parts of my hair it can make it greasy, so I recommend using it on dry brittle hair</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I really like this leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>so I am assuming it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It even restores the frizzy ends of my hair that were caused by too much dying.</li>
            <li>She really loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li>VERY Dissappointed in Amazon and hope they will take care of this problem.</li>
            <li>I purchased this conditioner after running into some issues with dandruff and having to use some of the very drying anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>did discover that if I used it when I didn&#x27;t need it that it was too much for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the real product.</li>
            <li>For some reason the lotion makes my hair very flaky.  </li>
            <li>But this leave in conditioner makes my hair feel like straw and very tangled.</li>
            <li>Do not use too much or your hair will get greasy.</li>
            <li>I am very upset about this whole process.</li>
            <li>I have heard so much hype about this</li>
            <li>both are only 3/4 filled up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li>I can really feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I wake up with my hair feeling like I put too much product in--</li>
            <li>If they would send me another pump that worked, I would be very grateful.</li>
            <li>Very greasy and oily not a fan at all.</li>
            <li>I go between curly and straight</li>
            <li>The product is very moisturizing and non greasy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product several months ago and love the way how it keeps my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and it helps to tame my hair into nice curls.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque ( because i had an amazon gift card</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, slightly dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels amazing all day long and even through the next day when i don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels amazing all day long and even through the next day when i don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li>Smells good but made my hair really oily even with only half a pump.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, it keeps my hair moisturised, soft and shiny and I only need to use a little for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I purchased this leave in cream about a week ago to try to give my dry fine hair some life.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like to put too much on my hair.</li>
            <li>If i blow dry it now, i do not have to use a straightener, because my hair is soft and shiney and smooth as silk, STRAIGHT, and no frizzies!  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that I find it works much better after I use the deep repair masque on my hair and put this on afterwards.</li>
            <li>It actually works better than Mixed chicks</li>
            <li>Used to use mixed chicks on my mixed kids hair but find that this works much better for defining and hydrating my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>But this actually has mild hold</li>
            <li>and it does a decent job</li>
            <li>What works better for me is Hask Argan oil (once weekly deep conditioner, daily conditioner and oil).</li>
            <li>It leaves it very soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>but the top push down dispenser was broken, so every time we go to use it we have to sit it on top right to get product out!</li>
            <li>highly recommend it,I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>and it was only my first time using it!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants soft, shiny, luxurious hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is not that wonderful but its not too bad either.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly but very frizzy</li>
            <li>so I normally have to use mousse and hairspray which gets to feeling crunchy.</li>
            <li>and once i was done, my hair was still soft, shiney, frizz free (even on a humid day) and my curls actually held better than usual.</li>
            <li>and once i was done, my hair was still soft, shiney, frizz free (even on a humid day) and my curls actually held better than usual.</li>
            <li>yourself a few dollars because there is much better leave in conditioners on the market.</li>
            <li>This Macadamia Oil Cream has been my new favorite thing for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>,the texture is very rich and may be heavy in non damaged hair  </li>
            <li>with the leave in cream, if you use even a little bit too much, it will not come out well at all, and when you do use the right amount, the affects are good but not amazing as with the oil.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without a live-in cream or conditioner.</li>
            <li>my hair is always super dry.</li>
            <li>Just start with a small dot and then work up to more if you need it.  </li>
            <li>keeps my hair soft -- but it doesn&#x27;t stop it from frizzing!</li>
            <li>I did some research and saw that the Macadamia Natural Oil line also had a leave in cream, so I had to have it!</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying the smaller size before buying this large size if you have any doubts.</li>
            <li>This product helps smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>and they didnt have a seal on it and the products were half filled..</li>
            <li>She wears her hair natural, and the first time she used it she said that it left her hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it to style my hair with [[ASIN:B005HJ4474 Natural Oil Reviving Curl Cream 8.5 oz]].</li>
            <li>MACADAMIA OIL by Macadamia Natural Oil:</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Delivered early.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>I concentrate the majority of the product toward the middle of my hair shaft all the way through to the ends and it has really made a difference.</li>
            <li>But, rather than make my hair look moisturized and soft it made it looked mousy and greasy.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, curly, &amp; very unruly hair.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft &amp; managable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started to use this on my young daughters hair</li>
            <li>She has curly hair and when she uses this it leaves her hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>I decided to curl my hair that morning for some soft beachy waves, so i curled it as usualy</li>
            <li>I decided to curl my hair that morning for some soft beachy waves, so i curled it as usualy</li>
            <li>The cream soaks into every strand leaving it soft and feeling thicker.</li>
            <li>Someone complimented me by saying how soft my hair was</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It leaves my daughters course hair soft and manageable .</li>
            <li>I have never experienced my hair so healthy until now thanks to these products.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and thick this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something to make my curls soft and full and not weigh them down</li>
            <li>I love this leave in conditioner but daily use can weigh your hair down, definitely something I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li>It is A LOT better than any Mixed Chicks or Nexxus products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>The 10 ounce bottle should last a long time since you don&#x27;t need very much.  </li>
            <li>I guess it didn&#x27;t work for my hair, which is really curly and dry.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, just like the repair masque I reviewed earlier the leave conditioner left my hair feeling so silk and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I do have thick oily hair, and I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to get extra oily like some products do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spend the little extra money because it is certainly worth it!</li>
            <li>Overall, this leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>careful how much you use.</li>
            <li>I style my hair often and this product makes my hair soft, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li>Really like this leave in cream for detangling and moisturizing my wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my dull dry hair was shiney and healthy looking</li>
            <li>AMAZING product for my dry and damaged hair that is quite thin.  </li>
            <li>They really do wonders to very dry or coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday, a little goes a long way and it makes my hair so soft and shiny, not to mention healthy.  </li>
            <li>Before i tell you the miracle it worked on my hair, my hands were pruney and dry from my shower and as soon as i finished working this through my hair, my hands were as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li>After so much damage and dry ends, I tried this leave in creme and my hair flowed and it did not look dry.</li>
            <li>really cuts down on breakage.</li>
            <li>however I&#x27;m not sure if the amounts said is right inside the bottles.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair easy to manage which is something I had never experienced before with my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have always had thin, easy to tangle hair.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price, especially since a little bit of the product goes a very long way and there is quite a substantial amount of product in the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I have black, straight Asian hair, for Reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very curly, unruly hair and a little bit of this does the trick.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, it almost seems to make my hair more rather than less frizzy (and dried out).</li>

            <li> I enjoyed this product a lot!</li>
            <li> my hair is healthy and not tangle-y!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite hair product for years!</li>
            <li> This leave in cream conditioner is amazing</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing,  </li>
            <li> this is just a amazing cream.</li>
            <li> Those products smell amazing, this product smells like one of those Flinstone vitamins for kids...</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and works amazingly for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> Also it gives hair kind of a grimy feel and doesn&#x27;t make it silky or shiny</li>
            <li> It kind of finishes it off well when I used both together.</li>
            <li> I liked this</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair and honestly for the price, I would stay with Nexxus.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Nice and creamy without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I run it through damp hair before blow-drying - it makes my hair soft, smells delicious (a hint of sweet/fruity -</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soo soft &amp; manageable &amp; smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Came in the mail very quickly!</li>
            <li> Leave-In cream after each shower I have static free hair for a good 48 hours</li>
            <li> Did deliver quickly!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made my hair very soft and smell very good</li>
            <li> a nice smell but its strong and lasts until you wash it</li>
            <li> It is best used on hair ends and not roots, where it can make hair look greasy the next day</li>
            <li> Although I love the Macadamia Oil from this brand, this conditioner did not work as intended for me</li>
            <li> We will probably try more products from the line (a friend of mine swears by the mask).</li>
            <li> And maybe it is better than most leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Out of all 4 items purchase, I would recomend this as a sure thing along with the repair masque.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite leave in creams...</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shinier and has a better smell.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I was in love with all the products but  after using them for more than 6months</li>
            <li> and I feel that my ends aren&#x27;t as healthy as I&#x27;d expect</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I personally love this leave in cream.</li>
            <li> so i think maybe thatâ€™s why it worked better for her.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I also think it makes it look a bit more shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> plan on buying more products from this brand</li>
            <li> I love the product, but this one came with a pump that did not work.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is more course than mine</li>
            <li> I love these products, and my hair loves them too.</li>
            <li> I just smells much better than others.</li>
            <li> and I would never spend that much on a hair product lol)</li>
            <li> I rubbed the cream in the palms of my hands and stared working it into my ends and up about to the top of my ears avoiding my roots so they wouldnt get oily.</li>
            <li> This leave on bottle&#x27;s top was chipped off at the top.</li>
            <li> Quality inside was okay</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> but I think it should have been packaged better</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This works just as well on all lengths of hair, all of my four daughters love it too.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the Macadamia Oil Nourishing Leave-In Cream.</li>
            <li> I could have bought some Cantu Creamy Leave-In Conditioner for 4.99 and would have had better results.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could give it a better review.  </li>
            <li> The kids love it too:), way cheaper at amazon than in the mall!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by us to all of you who have curly fuzzy hair, and need fast fix!!!!</li>
            <li> So far it is good!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and will continue to use as long as it is sold.</li>
            <li> It was ok for me nothing special!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, it is good quality and so far I can&#x27;t complain about how it makes nice her hair.</li>
            <li> I think it works best when my hair is wet and sectioned.</li>
            <li> it smells great and makes your hair really soft.</li>
            <li> Great for naturally curly afro hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this leave in cream, it leaves my hair smooth with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> It smells good but the texture is really greasy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!:)</li>
            <li> The best part is that it does not clump or leave any residue like other products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This cream smells great and leaves your hair feeling smooth and not heavy .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use since there is no rinsing.</li>
            <li> I also liked how her hair looked after using the product (nice soft, defined curls).</li>
            <li> and I can see the shine and healthy difference after a summer full of swimming.</li>
            <li> Very good for my very long hair (hip length)</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> The smell is beautiful and fresh and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> works well on my fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a soft pleasant scent in my hair that doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but it&#x27;s not super amazing.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous and it now a staple product.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, I dont see a real big difference in my hair, I think the leave in nuetrogena leaves my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great, but i was looking for something i could use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> just incase this product didn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped i would have enough time to wash my hair and style it again lol.</li>
            <li> I really like this product though because it smells amazing</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smooth them and doesn&#x27;t help with the frizz.</li>
            <li> It works well enough and smells good, but you&#x27;d be better off getting a leave in from the corner store.</li>
            <li> The product did make my hair feel soft but did nothing for me style wise.</li>
            <li> It smells good and leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about how much this has changed my hair routine for the better, no split ends here!!!</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and clean smelling,</li>
            <li> was amazing they were soft ,smooth and bright and no heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw the package at my door.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to get home and try it.</li>
            <li> so I use this on the ends of my hair or anywhere my hair feels dry and it makes my hair feel great.  </li>
            <li> Been using for months, nothing special about this product but the price.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as mosturizing as I expected after the great reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nice and soft when I use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to work good, the smell is not a gross smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;nice\\&quot; either &#x3D;</li>
            <li> but it is still sweet and almost smells like grapes.</li>
            <li> but it is still sweet and almost smells like grapes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it make my hair so soft and it was easy to detangle and scalp felt so clean.</li>
            <li> use the whole Macadamia line and am in love with all of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it would be as good as the deep repair mask in this line, but for me it just wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> First of all it smells AMAZING (a bit strong) and it leaves her curls manageable and soft without feeling greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product (and all other products sold by this company) as i have been highly impressed with it.</li>
            <li> product makes my hair SUPER greasy and the smell of the product does not wear</li>
            <li> I use it on top of the rinse-out one and this helps keep my frizzies soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this on Amazon, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this at it&#x27;s normal price for what it did.</li>
            <li> It works great, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (and I have very fine / thin hair), and smells great.</li>
            <li> is Pretty good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have pretty frizzy/crazy hair!</li>
            <li> Works great with just a little bit of cream</li>
            <li> Nothing great about this product, it a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it three stars for the fast shipping since it&#x27;s available for prime</li>
            <li> I bought this because there was such an enthusiastic review about</li>
            <li> I bought macadamia natural brand healing oil, leave in treatment, and the repair mask, and i must say that my hair has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t decide if the pros are worth the cons.</li>
            <li> I thought the leave in cream would smell the same, but it smells kind of like grape medicine.</li>
            <li> leave my hair soft and light and its cheap</li>
            <li> it is a good product not really  amazing but is ok</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair healthy, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky just soft.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it just buy the travel size like i did.</li>
            <li> Back to the hair lol, once i was confident i saturated every strand, i took a wide tooth comb and combed my hair.</li>
            <li> they packaging was not yet opened and completely fun.</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my hair so soft n&#x27; shinning.  </li>
            <li> use on freshly washed and conditioned hair before styling to retain moisture.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and shiny and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this for sooo long &amp; I am sooo glad I did!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and makes my hair soft, but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this and the conditioner my hair is literally softer than it was before and amazing!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I just wanted to shampoo my hair right away.</li>
            <li> I especially love that you can use it on wet hair AND dry hair, where most products for curly hair need to be applied to damp hair, not taking into account that we don&#x27;t necessarily wash our hair every day and</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft too!!!  </li>
            <li> this is my second bottle already and my hair feels very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky soft, easy to brush, and feels light and soft all day.</li>
            <li> first day I received it</li>
            <li> I apply the leave-in first and then the curl cream.</li>
            <li> Somedays I&#x27;ll put one pump of the healing oil onto my hair first</li>
            <li> Since i started using this product my hair is much healthier!</li>
            <li> so be aware.</li>
            <li> -- I just rub some into the length after towel drying and my hair is soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, it&#x27;d different from the Deep repair masque ( as i like the smell of that one better)</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will DEFINITELY buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, it&#x27;d different from the Deep repair masque ( as i like the smell of that one better)</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will DEFINITELY buy this again!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than mixed chicks by a mile!</li>
            <li> smells fantastic and keeps my hair moisturised, so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> After first use you will feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also love the deep hair mask in this line and the oil.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and clean!The product was packaged to prevent damage and arrived on time and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I noticed the hair was detangled and dryness was reduced after first use.</li>
            <li> But when I use it, I don&#x27;t really find a huge difference from many other leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants soft, shiny, luxurious hair. :)</li>
            <li> This large size bottle last me a very long time at a great savings too.</li>
            <li> AND my hair dries more quickly than with other products.</li>
            <li> Needed something new to replace what I was using, Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum - after a while</li>
            <li> I liked the flavor and will be buying this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li> The hair masque didn&#x27;t really do wonders to my hair but this tamed my frizz and made my hair super soft and shiny like it never has before!!</li>
            <li> Not many stores carry this product where I live and all the salon and beauty shops I been tell me its a great product to use.</li>
            <li> The Product was exactly what was advertised on Amazon, shipment was fast and nothing was damaged on arrival.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, barely wavy hair</li>
            <li> and i mean NEVER used a leave in conditioner/cream this amazing in my life!</li>
            <li> Then I apply it generously and let it air dry :)</li>
            <li> I got up super early because I had work and</li>
            <li> This product adds smoothness and shine and has a delicate, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I use this with a few drops of sweet almond oil &amp; my hair has never looked healthier or better.</li>
            <li> the product is wonderful for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve certainly used them all.</li>
            <li> When I use it on nice soft parts of my hair it can make it greasy, so I recommend using it on dry brittle hair</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I really like this leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> so I am assuming it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> It even restores the frizzy ends of my hair that were caused by too much dying.</li>
            <li> She really loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li> VERY Dissappointed in Amazon and hope they will take care of this problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner after running into some issues with dandruff and having to use some of the very drying anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> did discover that if I used it when I didn&#x27;t need it that it was too much for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the real product.</li>
            <li> For some reason the lotion makes my hair very flaky.  </li>
            <li> But this leave in conditioner makes my hair feel like straw and very tangled.</li>
            <li> Do not use too much or your hair will get greasy.</li>
            <li> I am very upset about this whole process.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much hype about this</li>
            <li> both are only 3/4 filled up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I can really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I wake up with my hair feeling like I put too much product in--</li>
            <li> If they would send me another pump that worked, I would be very grateful.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and oily not a fan at all.</li>
            <li> I go between curly and straight</li>
            <li> The product is very moisturizing and non greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several months ago and love the way how it keeps my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and it helps to tame my hair into nice curls.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque ( because i had an amazon gift card</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, slightly dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels amazing all day long and even through the next day when i don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels amazing all day long and even through the next day when i don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but made my hair really oily even with only half a pump.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, it keeps my hair moisturised, soft and shiny and I only need to use a little for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this leave in cream about a week ago to try to give my dry fine hair some life.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like to put too much on my hair.</li>
            <li> If i blow dry it now, i do not have to use a straightener, because my hair is soft and shiney and smooth as silk, STRAIGHT, and no frizzies!  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that I find it works much better after I use the deep repair masque on my hair and put this on afterwards.</li>
            <li> It actually works better than Mixed chicks</li>
            <li> Used to use mixed chicks on my mixed kids hair but find that this works much better for defining and hydrating my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> But this actually has mild hold</li>
            <li> and it does a decent job</li>
            <li> What works better for me is Hask Argan oil (once weekly deep conditioner, daily conditioner and oil).</li>
            <li> It leaves it very soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> but the top push down dispenser was broken, so every time we go to use it we have to sit it on top right to get product out!</li>
            <li> highly recommend it,I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> and it was only my first time using it!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants soft, shiny, luxurious hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is not that wonderful but its not too bad either.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly but very frizzy</li>
            <li> so I normally have to use mousse and hairspray which gets to feeling crunchy.</li>
            <li> and once i was done, my hair was still soft, shiney, frizz free (even on a humid day) and my curls actually held better than usual.</li>
            <li> and once i was done, my hair was still soft, shiney, frizz free (even on a humid day) and my curls actually held better than usual.</li>
            <li> yourself a few dollars because there is much better leave in conditioners on the market.</li>
            <li> This Macadamia Oil Cream has been my new favorite thing for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> ,the texture is very rich and may be heavy in non damaged hair  </li>
            <li> with the leave in cream, if you use even a little bit too much, it will not come out well at all, and when you do use the right amount, the affects are good but not amazing as with the oil.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without a live-in cream or conditioner.</li>
            <li> my hair is always super dry.</li>
            <li> Just start with a small dot and then work up to more if you need it.  </li>
            <li> keeps my hair soft -- but it doesn&#x27;t stop it from frizzing!</li>
            <li> I did some research and saw that the Macadamia Natural Oil line also had a leave in cream, so I had to have it!</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying the smaller size before buying this large size if you have any doubts.</li>
            <li> This product helps smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> and they didnt have a seal on it and the products were half filled..</li>
            <li> She wears her hair natural, and the first time she used it she said that it left her hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I use it to style my hair with [[ASIN:B005HJ4474 Natural Oil Reviving Curl Cream 8.5 oz]].</li>

            <li> Delivered early.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> I concentrate the majority of the product toward the middle of my hair shaft all the way through to the ends and it has really made a difference.</li>

            <li> This product makes my hair soft &amp; managable.</li>

            <li> It is A LOT better than any Mixed Chicks or Nexxus products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The 10 ounce bottle should last a long time since you don&#x27;t need very much.  </li>

            <li> Before i tell you the miracle it worked on my hair, my hands were pruney and dry from my shower and as soon as i finished working this through my hair, my hands were as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> After so much damage and dry ends, I tried this leave in creme and my hair flowed and it did not look dry.</li>
            <li> really cuts down on breakage.</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m not sure if the amounts said is right inside the bottles.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair easy to manage which is something I had never experienced before with my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had thin, easy to tangle hair.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price, especially since a little bit of the product goes a very long way and there is quite a substantial amount of product in the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I have black, straight Asian hair, for Reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very curly, unruly hair and a little bit of this does the trick.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, it almost seems to make my hair more rather than less frizzy (and dried out).</li>
            <li> We are all guilty of getting on the band wagon of the latest new thing and macademia oil is the thing now and this stuff, though a little pricey did not meet the expectation that I had for it.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I decided to put it on damp hair and then dry, and still same results.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a film on your hair if you are flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like almond extract (a smell that I loveee) and leaves my hair soft!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to trash this product because I couldn&#x27;t stand the strong smell.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner actually made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> I use this on my very dry coarse hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much -- and it works in both wet and dry hair (wet as a leave in conditioner and dry to hold down fly-aways).</li>
            <li> Strange.  </li>
            <li> And while my hair felt soft, it also dried it out.</li>
            <li> about 2-3 pumps and my hair is about 12 inchs long.  </li>
            <li> Like the natural smell and does not leave my hair feeling heavy, greasy or like it has a product in it.</li>
            <li> n&#x27; long waist length hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, when I massage this in wet hair it makes my hair pretty manageable.</li>
            <li> i have reallllly thick wavy/curly hair and was really hoping this worked</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with my hair from my other product I usually use.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for anyone who needs just a little extra moisture for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> LONG hair too!</li>
            <li> if i dont blow dry it and straighten it immediatly after i blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy hair which is dry because i get highlights put in it....</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use when I straighten my hair and for the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> if you have dry, damaged hair you should consider adding this product to your hair care line up.</li>
            <li> I use it after washing hair with the shampoo, and leave my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> It has always been dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who swims a lot and her hair gets dry and damage from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> and we both have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I put on my leave in cream and dry my hair</li>
            <li> i can imagine it would work on extremely dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> So this oil must do wonders for dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> So i proceeded to blow dry my hair, when it was dry</li>
            <li> ,  I color it and blow it dry</li>
            <li> I like to brush it through with my hair dryer on low to incorporate it in to my &amp;#34;extra thick&amp;#34; hair, it only takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li> can barely even tell a difference, the texture of my hair is barely softer, but also a little heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I honestly can say I am utterly disappointed in this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is unfortunately not working and made my hair even worse.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, less stringy looking and less tangly&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was extremely hard for my to blow dry my hair whilre having this product on which usually never happens to me, it took forever.</li>
            <li> and I can see it is not as dry and brittle as it was before!</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;ll put half pump of this leave-in-conditioner to give it an extra shine and softness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes rough dry hair even rougher and dryer.  </li>
            <li> Living in Alaska the air is very dry, I found using the Macadamia Oil Nourishing</li>
            <li> Well I have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to buy this because of rave reviews I saw on the internet, but when it finally arrived and I used it on dry hair, it feels heavy and leaves a film in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I spritzed it with a little hair spray an i left.</li>
            <li> I spritzed it with a little hair spray an i left.</li>
            <li> (I wash my hair every other day to keep it from getting to dry).  </li>
            <li> I use the repair mask once a week, and i use the leave in treatment and healing oil together on my wet hair every time i shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I go a lot by reviews, so i expected this product to blow me away; it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product performed as expected.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I use now , I recommended to anyone that has dried, fizzy, damaged hair, as well as, to those who have had their hair treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kinda of flowery but not really.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair when I get out of the shower and it is still wet.</li>
            <li> expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Actually had this product a few times.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE ARRIVED EMPTY,</li>
            <li> Not really liking this product.</li>
            <li> I mix it with the Macadamia Oil to my wet hair and the tangles just seem to fall out when I comb it.  </li>
            <li> a little of this goes a long way, soon id like to try their shampoo, this stuff is thick enough that you wouldn&#x27;t need a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not only does the cream tame the frizz</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long</li>
            <li> My wife, on the other hand, is not bald.  </li>
            <li> My hair goes through extreme heat while styling</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this product because I love their conditioner and detangle spray.</li>
            <li> I use it with other shampoos but the one that it comes with... like the texture it leaves on my hair</li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair greasy like other leave in creams and</li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair greasy like other leave in creams and</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;nourishes&amp;#34; hair either, since the ingredients include all the usual chemicals that are used by the regular cheaper brands sold in the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I also use it when I want to add a little moisturizer to my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with just my regular Aussie Moist shampoo, got out of the shower, towel dried my hair a little and then got started.</li>
            <li> On the plus side it does keep my hair from frizzing without feeling crunchy but it is also very heavy and tends to make hair flat.</li>
            <li> My hair is between curly and wavy, a little dry on the ends and therefore a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> My problem is for such a thick product I didnt feel like it was moisturizing and nourishing my hair</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ll have to add this product to the long list of creams, conditioners, and such that I&#x27;ve bought to try and put my dry, frizzy hair in check.</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> But if I put any less it makes no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That it&#x27;s half price is a superbonus.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, less stringy looking and less tangly.</li>
            <li> This was half the price as found in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and less course.  </li>
            <li> Concentrate on the lower half and ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> this stuff is a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> This product is not special or even revolutionary.</li>
            <li> The cream was too thick and my hair was still dry.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, dry hair</li>
            <li> i decided to try mxing a little with the oil, again nothing.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do... just apply a little at a time or you can over do it and it will start to look greasy.</li>
            <li> Using this product for a few days restores my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used it few times, can&#x27;t say I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hesitant to use it before styling since it felt so heavy on my hair</li>
            <li> Just makes your hair greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> I use it every night before bed and in the morning if I have a few unwanted frizzy hairs around.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this.</li>
            <li> I have hair past my shoulders and it&#x27;s very thick and wavy with dry ends as i hadnt gotten a haircut in a long time , so i used about 3 or 4 small pumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was honestly a waste of my hard earned money down the drain. .</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair, which is long and thin.  </li>
            <li> have long, thin hair</li>
            <li> It left my hair freezy and with a thick dirty feeling especially my ends.</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair or anything!!</li>
            <li> so i apply a small ammount except to the roots.the result</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wash my hair at night, so i had to wait until morning.</li>
            <li> though just not sure if they took some out though.....</li>
            <li> No more band wagons for me.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream, therefore I use a very small amount in order to avoid my hair looking greasy and being too weighed down.</li>
            <li> Which is quit hard to find...</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard (like a gel would, which I&#x27;ve had with some leave in conditioners) and it isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> when I tried it on my hair it made it so hard...</li>
            <li> It never leaves my hair weighted down or dirty looking like some other products.</li>
            <li> It is thick but you wont get greasy.</li>
            <li> I have extrea thick</li>
            <li> Sticky, white and impossible to comb.</li>
            <li> im a little sad</li>
            <li> Not sure if Ill buy again or try something else.</li>
            <li> THE SECRET IS THE AMOUNT YOU USE .I</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> This stuff is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair stick together, doesn&#x27;t matter how small amount I use, feels like I&#x27;m putting glue in my hair:(</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product on Amazon because of the reviews reporting fake shampoo and conditioner of this brand being sold.</li>
            <li> I have read sellers on Amazon sell fake products from this line</li>
            <li> Not impressed for the cost.</li>
            <li> but it expensive.</li>
            <li> not too bad, not great.</li>
            <li> and i was afraid it would burn it.</li>
            <li> A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or unpleasant feeling in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase on my part.</li>
            <li> This item is clearly a fake!!</li>
            <li> i hated this.</li>
            <li> i hated the way it felt in my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used the oil in this brand and loved it. Was not as found of the leave in cream. For 1/4 price I can get OGX macadamia oil that works just as well.</li>
            <li> Product has a great scent &amp; it feels wonderful on my hair. It&#x27;s so easy to use since there is no rinsing.</li>
            <li> This product adds smoothness and shine and has a delicate, pleasant scent.  It is best used on hair ends and not roots, where it can make hair look greasy the next day (I wash my hair every other day to keep it from getting to dry).  I apply this cream to damp hair after washing and before styling.</li>
            <li> I honestly can say I am utterly disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I received it I put ALOT of this product in my hair. About 2 golf balls amount.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my hair SUPER greasy and the smell of the product does not wear off.&lt;br /&gt;Its a nice smell but its strong and lasts until you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I only put a dime size amount in my hair. I can&#x27;t wait to get rid of this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was honestly a waste of my hard earned money down the drain. .</li>
            <li> Needed something new to replace what I was using, Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum - after a while I guess my hair got \\&quot;used\\&quot; to it and it didn&#x27;t do much. This Macadamia Oil Cream has been my new favorite thing for a few weeks. I run it through damp hair before blow-drying - it makes my hair soft, smells delicious (a hint of sweet/fruity - though now, I don&#x27;t even notice it), and does not make my hair appear greasy at all. Great price on Amazon. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because there was such an enthusiastic review about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend your money. this stuff is a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I really like this leave-in conditioner.  I use it on top of the rinse-out one and this helps keep my frizzies soft and smooth.  Just start with a small dot and then work up to more if you need it.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or unpleasant feeling in your hair.</li>
            <li> I researched this item after seeing it in a salon, and decided to give it a try.  I have unremarkable hair, frizzy and wavy if i dont blow dry it and straighten it immediatly after i blow dry.  I bought macadamia natural brand healing oil, leave in treatment, and the repair mask, and i must say that my hair has never looked or felt better.  If i blow dry it now, i do not have to use a straightener, because my hair is soft and shiney and smooth as silk, STRAIGHT, and no frizzies!  My straightener is starting to literally gather dust!!  I use the repair mask once a week, and i use the leave in treatment and healing oil together on my wet hair every time i shampoo.  This stuff smells heavenly, all 3 products!  Cannot say enough about how much this has changed my hair routine for the better, no split ends here!!! i am a macadamia user for life!!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ll have to add this product to the long list of creams, conditioners, and such that I&#x27;ve bought to try and put my dry, frizzy hair in check. As other reviewers have mentioned, it almost seems to make my hair more rather than less frizzy (and dried out). I also tend to get an itchy scalp after using this cream. Contact the company  to request a sample pack (of all their products) in the mail before buying this 10 oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I use it in conjunction with Semi Di Lino Diamante Products. This leave-in product is especially great for the edge/hairline to keep it moisturized. My hair feels nice and soft when I use it. The best part is that it does not clump or leave any residue like other products that I&#x27;ve used. It is A LOT better than any Mixed Chicks or Nexxus products that I have used in the past. I highly recommend trying the smaller size before buying this large size if you have any doubts. Products work differently depending on your hair type.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I thought it would be. I too have frizzy hair, but for some reason, this leave-in conditioner makes my scalp break out in flakes. Wasn&#x27;t as mosturizing as I expected after the great reviews. Although I love the Macadamia Oil from this brand, this conditioner did not work as intended for me</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT!!!  I have wavy hair which is dry because i get highlights put in it....After washing, conditioning, then diffusing my hair, I apply this product and it instantly smoothes and de-frizzes my entire head!!! Makes my hair super soft too!!!  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It does not weigh my hair down and it smells delicious. It makes my hair easy to manage which is something I had never experienced before with my curly hair. I use it to style my hair with [[ASIN:B005HJ4474 Natural Oil Reviving Curl Cream 8.5 oz]]. I apply the leave-in first and then the curl cream. Together they actually moisturize and provide hold for my hair. I have never experienced my hair so healthy until now thanks to these products. I think it works best when my hair is wet and sectioned. Then I apply it generously and let it air dry :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use and LOVE:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002NV21DS MACADAMIA OIL by Macadamia Natural Oil: HEALING OIL TREATMENT 4.2 OZ]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002WTC37A Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask, 8.5 ounces Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have TYPE 3B curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and I absolutely love it!  First of all it smells AMAZING (a bit strong) and it leaves her curls manageable and soft without feeling greasy at all.  Great for humid climates and works well as a leave-in cream as well as a styling product.  My hair is very curly and it helps to tame my hair into nice curls.  The 10 ounce bottle should last a long time since you don&#x27;t need very much.  I&#x27;ve heard of knock offs for this product, but all I know what I got was really good so I am assuming it&#x27;s the real deal.  We will probably try more products from the line (a friend of mine swears by the mask).</li>
            <li> I loved this product! It came in perfect condition within a week.</li>
            <li> I go a lot by reviews, so i expected this product to blow me away; it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work good, the smell is not a gross smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;nice\\&quot; either &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product seems to be working!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw the package at my door. But when I use it, I don&#x27;t really find a huge difference from many other leave in conditioners. It smells wonderful though. And maybe it is better than most leave in conditioners. But I can not tell. It&#x27;s a great product, but it&#x27;s not super amazing. It&#x27;s just good. Just good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to buy this because of rave reviews I saw on the internet, but when it finally arrived and I used it on dry hair, it feels heavy and leaves a film in your hair.  The next morning I decided to put it on damp hair and then dry, and still same results.  It feels course and filmy, didn&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in cream! I have short, curly, frizzy hair. Not only does the cream tame the frizz, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue AND my hair dries more quickly than with other products. I am using it in conjunction with the Macadamia Oil shampoo. My hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was worried about spending money on another product that would not work, this DOES WORK! I use it everyday, a little goes a long way and it makes my hair so soft and shiny, not to mention healthy.  I also bought the shampoo, conditioner rinse and the deep repair masque. Out of all 4 items purchase, I would recomend this as a sure thing along with the repair masque. Great product line.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and looks beautiful. She gets it from her DAD. She orders this item all the time.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny...love it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite leave in creams...I love the smell!!</li>
            <li> I got this together with the healing oil and the hair masque. I have fine, straight, slightly dry and frizzy hair. The hair masque didn&#x27;t really do wonders to my hair but this tamed my frizz and made my hair super soft and shiny like it never has before!! I know alot of reviews said a pea size is enough for your hair but I used 1 pump for my shoulder length hair and the results were AMAAAAAZING! I use it in different ways. Somedays I&#x27;ll put one pump of the healing oil onto my hair first and then I&#x27;ll put half pump of this leave-in-conditioner to give it an extra shine and softness. This product is not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Oh &amp; I love the scent of it too! Great product &amp; would definately repurchase once I&#x27;m running out!!</li>
            <li> The best leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> This product performed as expected. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Delivered early.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use when I straighten my hair and for the dry winter months. My hair is naturally curly but very frizzy so I normally have to use mousse and hairspray which gets to feeling crunchy. So I decided to try this stuff but I can&#x27;t decide if the pros are worth the cons. On the plus side it does keep my hair from frizzing without feeling crunchy but it is also very heavy and tends to make hair flat. Also it gives hair kind of a grimy feel and doesn&#x27;t make it silky or shiny like the bottle says. This stuff is way too expensive. I will probably use the bottle I have but never buy again</li>
            <li> Overall, this leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I prefer the Macadamia Oil (same company).  It leaves my hair shinier and has a better smell.  I thought the leave in cream would smell the same, but it smells kind of like grape medicine.</li>
            <li> Smells good but made my hair really oily even with only half a pump.</li>
            <li> This stuff works alright on my hair. I have thick hair, when I massage this in wet hair it makes my hair pretty manageable. Smells good. Sometimes it gets your hair greasy looking, careful how much you use.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It leaves my hair sooooo soft. The smell is not that wonderful but its not too bad either. It even restores the frizzy ends of my hair that were caused by too much dying.</li>
            <li> Since i started using this product my hair is much healthier!</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the shampoo and repair mask. I was in love with all the products but  after using them for more than 6months I realized that the leave in cream contains Mineral Oil! I have fine, straight, barely wavy hair and I feel that my ends aren&#x27;t as healthy as I&#x27;d expect (they break off a lot) and I&#x27;m pointing the finger at the leave in cream.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me, and since I have really coarse, frizzy hair, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can barely even tell a difference, the texture of my hair is barely softer, but also a little heavy and greasy. But if I put any less it makes no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this with the infusing oil as well. I use it as conditioner with the macadamia shampoo. Love it</li>
            <li> I personally love this leave in cream. It smells fantastic, it keeps my hair moisturised, soft and shiny and I only need to use a little for it to be effective. The only thing is that I find it works much better after I use the deep repair masque on my hair and put this on afterwards. It kind of finishes it off well when I used both together. It works well enough without the deep repair masque but I can definitely tell the difference. I hope this helped!</li>
            <li> Cheapest I&#x27;ve found it anywhere, works just as well as the stuff you would buy in the store for 20+ dollars!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It works so well on my hair! Def recommend this. It actually works better than Mixed chicks and it&#x27;s cheaper!</li>
            <li> Being bald with a beard, I&#x27;ve no reason to utilize this product.  My wife, on the other hand, is not bald.  She really loves this stuff.  That it&#x27;s half price is a superbonus.</li>
            <li> This item is clearly a fake!! I can&#x27;t believe whoever sold or packaged this item believed that could pass this product off as a Macadamia product. VERY Dissappointed in Amazon and hope they will take care of this problem.</li>
            <li> The Product was exactly what was advertised on Amazon, shipment was fast and nothing was damaged on arrival. This cream smells great and leaves your hair feeling smooth and not heavy .</li>
            <li> This leave in cream conditioner is amazing it smells great and makes your hair really soft. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner after running into some issues with dandruff and having to use some of the very drying anti-dandruff shampoos. It works great, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (and I have very fine / thin hair), and smells great. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who needs just a little extra moisture for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Smells so so amazinnnng</li>
            <li> I use Macadamia oil in my hair, and after I get my highlights my hair is always super dry. Using this product for a few days restores my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thin hair and I&#x27;ve found I only need 1 pump of this to drench my hair in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I did discover that if I used it when I didn&#x27;t need it that it was too much for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But if you have dry, damaged hair you should consider adding this product to your hair care line up.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair stick together, doesn&#x27;t matter how small amount I use, feels like I&#x27;m putting glue in my hair:(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to trash this product because I couldn&#x27;t stand the strong smell. The first time I used it, I just wanted to shampoo my hair right away.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with my hair from my other product I usually use.  i have reallllly thick wavy/curly hair and was really hoping this worked but it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing,  im a little sad it didn&#x27;t work as good as i was hoping  but i gave it to my coworker and she loved it!  She has thinner hair but still curly so i think maybe thatâ€™s why it worked better for her.</li>
            <li> Since I have to do a texture treatment and the keratin treatment, I must use a hair product that has disodium laureth sulfosuccinate. Which is quit hard to find... Thankfully I found this product and it works great for my treated hair. Not many stores carry this product where I live and all the salon and beauty shops I been tell me its a great product to use. It smells great too which is a plus. This is the only hair product I use now , I recommended to anyone that has dried, fizzy, damaged hair, as well as, to those who have had their hair treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside the bottle is only 10z so every two weeks I have to order the next set.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This product is unfortunately not working and made my hair even worse. Sticky, white and impossible to comb.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner but daily use can weigh your hair down, definitely something I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Great price for this product</li>
            <li> I liked this but I wasnt blown away. It is thick but you wont get greasy. My problem is for such a thick product I didnt feel like it was moisturizing and nourishing my hair so I would still need an oil.</li>
            <li> Living in Alaska the air is very dry, I found using the Macadamia Oil Nourishing Leave-In cream after each shower I have static free hair for a good 48 hours. I do have thick oily hair, and I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to get extra oily like some products do.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to test out the Macadamia products before shelling out the money for them, because they are quite pricey. This isn&#x27;t the real product. Beware.</li>
            <li> I have used the oil deep repair and the healing oil treatment and have not no issues.  For some reason the lotion makes my hair very flaky.  Strange.  I love the smell, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again. this is just a amazing cream. leave my hair soft and light and its cheap</li>
            <li> Works great with just a little bit of cream</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product on Amazon because of the reviews reporting fake shampoo and conditioner of this brand being sold. I purchased this leave in cream about a week ago to try to give my dry fine hair some life. It is a very thick cream, therefore I use a very small amount in order to avoid my hair looking greasy and being too weighed down. Anyway, this product smells like heaven! IT is wonderful. I can&#x27;t even describe it...kinda of flowery but not really. I concentrate the majority of the product toward the middle of my hair shaft all the way through to the ends and it has really made a difference. My hair is softer, less stringy looking and less tangly. I also think it makes it look a bit more shiny. I would highly recommend this product (and all other products sold by this company) as i have been highly impressed with it. It is definitely worth the price, especially since a little bit of the product goes a very long way and there is quite a substantial amount of product in the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves my hair soft, less stringy looking and less tangly&lt;br /&gt;2. Makes my hair appear shinier&lt;br /&gt;3. Smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;4. A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. A bit pricy&lt;br /&gt;2. I have read sellers on Amazon sell fake products from this line so be aware. I purchased my when it was on Hautelook and it&#x27;s legitimate.</li>
            <li> It is fairly expensive, and more so locally, but it is the only conditioner that helps my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great at those pesky knots and smells great. I use it in my hair, and my daughter&#x27;s, almost daily.</li>
            <li> I guess it didn&#x27;t work for my hair, which is really curly and dry.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair when I get out of the shower and it is still wet. I style my hair often and this product makes my hair soft, especially at the ends. I am very happy with this product and will continue to use as long as it is sold. Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> This is the third bottle I have purchased, I use it after every time I shower. It makes my hair silky soft, easy to brush, and feels light and soft all day. Smells great too! Try it out!</li>
            <li> This leave in cream makes my daughter hair so soft,and it smell so good.I use it every time I comb her hair,and I notice the breakage has stopped a lot.I love it.</li>
            <li> Used to use mixed chicks on my mixed kids hair but find that this works much better for defining and hydrating my son&#x27;s hair.  I even use it on my own hair with great results</li>
            <li> Product arrived on schedule and is great on my hair. It also has a nice smell to it.  I would recommend others to try it as well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> is awesome! but the top push down dispenser was broken, so every time we go to use it we have to sit it on top right to get product out!</li>
            <li> it is moisturizing all day though I don&#x27;t think miraculously healed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is Pretty good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Great price on a great product!  Very good for my very long hair (hip length) -- I just rub some into the length after towel drying and my hair is soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and I love this product for my curly hair!</li>
            <li> Well I have very dry hair. But, rather than make my hair look moisturized and soft it made it looked mousy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Very good results for putting moisture and shine in your hair. My hair goes through extreme heat while styling</li>
            <li> I bought this leave in when i was (unsuccessfully) working through a shopping addiction. It works well enough and smells good, but you&#x27;d be better off getting a leave in from the corner store. This product is not special or even revolutionary. It&#x27;s run of the mill leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Thank you, they work very good</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, it is good quality and so far I can&#x27;t complain about how it makes nice her hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several months ago and love the way how it keeps my hair soft and manageable.  I use it after washing hair with the shampoo, and leave my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> Not impressed for the cost.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this product because I love their conditioner and detangle spray. Those products smell amazing, this product smells like one of those Flinstone vitamins for kids...not too bad, not great. Anyway, it made my hair frizzy looking which is the opposite of what I hope for in a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> love it! expensive but worth it. plan on buying more products from this brand</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair so I use this on the ends of my hair or anywhere my hair feels dry and it makes my hair feel great.  When I use it on nice soft parts of my hair it can make it greasy, so I recommend using it on dry brittle hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few years now.  I have very curly, unruly hair and a little bit of this does the trick.  I especially love that you can use it on wet hair AND dry hair, where most products for curly hair need to be applied to damp hair, not taking into account that we don&#x27;t necessarily wash our hair every day and so, your hair is going to still need help on those days that it&#x27;s dry.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> this is my second bottle already and my hair feels very smooth and shiny. I also use the oil therapy with this leave in.  what a great combination.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be an awesome product, as I do use the mask and the oil. But this leave in conditioner makes my hair feel like straw and very tangled. I can&#x27;t get a comb through it in the shower anymore with conditioner. I am very disappointed. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair soft -- but it doesn&#x27;t stop it from frizzing!</li>
            <li> I have a keratin treatment.  The cream was too thick and my hair was still dry.  Save your money.  Don&#x27;t get this product.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, curly, &amp; very unruly hair. It has always been dry. I have tried everything under the sun to remedy this. I have ordered every product imaginable from emu oil to Ojon products &amp; was about to give up.So glad I didn&#x27;t! This product makes my hair soft &amp; managable. Love the scent &amp; will be using it from now on! Tames my frizzies too! Give it a try!  Quick shipping always makes me happy too! Highly recommend!!!!:)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who swims a lot and her hair gets dry and damage from the chlorine. She is been using it only for a couple of weeks and I can see it is not as dry and brittle as it was before! So far it is good!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the Awesome price..!!</li>
            <li> I use this product after I use the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque. It is fabulous and it now a staple product.</li>
            <li> This was half the price as found in retail stores.  I love the product, but this one came with a pump that did not work.  Replaced pump with one from a hand lotion.</li>
            <li> it is a good product not really  amazing but is ok</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this product to me. Her hair is more course than mine and we both have dry hair. The product did make my hair feel soft but did nothing for me style wise. And while my hair felt soft, it also dried it out.</li>
            <li> This is great! I bleached my hair to a platinum blonde and you can probably imagine the damage...After a few weeks of using this and the conditioner my hair is literally softer than it was before and amazing! Do not use too much or your hair will get greasy. A little goes a LONG way. I&#x27;ve started to use this on my young daughters hair and I can see the shine and healthy difference after a summer full of swimming.</li>
            <li> I love these products, and my hair loves them too. I put on my leave in cream and dry my hair and it helps with the humidity over here. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was ok for me nothing special! These are the ingredients on my bottle: Aqua/Water/Eau, Isopropyl Myristate, Glyceryl Stearate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Peg-40 Stearate, Dimethicone, Sorbitan Tristearate, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Parfum/Fragrance, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lactic Acid, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1, 3-diol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool, Citronellol, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Alpha-isomethyl Ionone, Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellal, Coumarin</li>
            <li> I use it with other shampoos but the one that it comes with... like the texture it leaves on my hair</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product. She has curly hair and when she uses this it leaves her hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and works amazingly for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It leaves it very soft and manageable! Will keep on reordering and hope it never goes off the market.</li>
            <li> Nothing great about this product, it a waste. I used it few times, can&#x27;t say I would purchase again. I use it now (when I think about it) as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hesitant to use it before styling since it felt so heavy on my hair and i was afraid it would burn it. 1 pump of this product is enough 2 pumps will make your hair feel greasy and sticky. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you have soft/thin hair even if you have split ends.. i can imagine it would work on extremely dry frizzy hair. But personally, I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I placed an order for me and my syster because someone told me about amazon and I wanted to give it a try.  I never received the items, but they charged my credit card.  I contacted the seller and they do not respond.  I am very upset about this whole process.</li>
            <li> Love it! Keeps my hair healthy, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and is good for your hair, but the oil works better and makes your hair more manageable. with the leave in cream, if you use even a little bit too much, it will not come out well at all, and when you do use the right amount, the affects are good but not amazing as with the oil.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this for sooo long &amp; I am sooo glad I did! it makes my hair soo soft &amp; manageable &amp; smells wonderful! I use this with a few drops of sweet almond oil &amp; my hair has never looked healthier or better. I dont even need styling products anymore &amp; I have pretty frizzy/crazy hair! LONG hair too!</li>
            <li> i wear it every day in my hair</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff.  It leaves my hair shiny and less course.  I have black, straight Asian hair, for Reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about 2-3 pumps and my hair is about 12 inchs long.  Concentrate on the lower half and ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Great for naturally curly afro hair</li>
            <li> The smell is great, I dont see a real big difference in my hair, I think the leave in nuetrogena leaves my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;I have highlighted longer hair.  Not sure if Ill buy again or try something else.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much hype about this and I don&#x27;t think it is any differenct than a store bought brand of Leave in conditioner. I just smells much better than others. I don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair and honestly for the price, I would stay with Nexxus.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky just soft. Helps with the frizzes. Don&#x27;t buy at target cost $29. Amazon is sold at a fraction of the cost. works great.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail product when I have my hair curly&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair well moisturized and shiny.</li>
            <li> the product is wonderful for long thick hair.My hair are not damaged but i wanted to give this a try after all this reviews ,the texture is very rich and may be heavy in non damaged hair  so i apply a small ammount except to the roots.the result was amazing they were soft ,smooth and bright and no heavy at all. THE SECRET IS THE AMOUNT YOU USE .I definately reccomended to mediterranean hair types.if you want to use it and you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it just buy the travel size like i did.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel amazing.  After so much damage and dry ends, I tried this leave in creme and my hair flowed and it did not look dry.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER and i mean NEVER used a leave in conditioner/cream this amazing in my life! I originally bought the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque ( because i had an amazon gift card and I would never spend that much on a hair product lol) but i heard good things about it so i decided to give it a shot. I tried it and loved it! I use it once a week and it&#x27;s great, but i was looking for something i could use on a daily basis. I did some research and saw that the Macadamia Natural Oil line also had a leave in cream, so I had to have it! I got it for $15.99 which was a deal compared to the $20-something they were charging at Ulta. It arrived 2 days after i placed the order to my office and I was so excited to get home and try it. I don&#x27;t usually wash my hair at night, so i had to wait until morning. I got up super early because I had work and just incase this product didn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped i would have enough time to wash my hair and style it again lol. I washed my hair with just my regular Aussie Moist shampoo, got out of the shower, towel dried my hair a little and then got started. I have hair past my shoulders and it&#x27;s very thick and wavy with dry ends as i hadnt gotten a haircut in a long time , so i used about 3 or 4 small pumps. I rubbed the cream in the palms of my hands and stared working it into my ends and up about to the top of my ears avoiding my roots so they wouldnt get oily. Before i tell you the miracle it worked on my hair, my hands were pruney and dry from my shower and as soon as i finished working this through my hair, my hands were as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt! So this oil must do wonders for dry skin as well. Back to the hair lol, once i was confident i saturated every strand, i took a wide tooth comb and combed my hair. The comb went through like a knife through room temperture butter and this never happens! So i proceeded to blow dry my hair, when it was dry I noticed my dull dry hair was shiney and healthy looking and I havent even done anything to it yet! I decided to curl my hair that morning for some soft beachy waves, so i curled it as usualy and once i was done, my hair was still soft, shiney, frizz free (even on a humid day) and my curls actually held better than usual. I spritzed it with a little hair spray an i left. I got so many compliments on my hair ( and i still do!) and my hair feels amazing all day long and even through the next day when i don&#x27;t wash it. It does not leave your hair greasy like other leave in creams and the smell of it sticks around for a while as well ( for me, through the end of the second day) I love the smell of it, it&#x27;d different from the Deep repair masque ( as i like the smell of that one better) but it is still sweet and almost smells like grapes. I love this product and I will DEFINITELY buy this again! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants soft, shiny, luxurious hair. :)g to it yet!

            <li> I&#x27;ll give it three stars for the fast shipping since it&#x27;s available for prime however I&#x27;m not sure if the amounts said is right inside the bottles. I got this leave on cream with the macadamia oil and both are only 3/4 filled up. This leave on bottle&#x27;s top was chipped off at the top. Quality inside was okay though just not sure if they took some out though.....</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two weeks. I haven&#x27;t noticed the difference of my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some reviewers complain about this product, but it makes my hair silky and healthier looking. And it smells amazing! Maybe some hair reacts different with it. My hair is on the dryer side and colored. The cream soaks into every strand leaving it soft and feeling thicker. I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I love it! The smell is beautiful and fresh and it makes my hair so soft. You don&#x27;t need to use much -- and it works in both wet and dry hair (wet as a leave in conditioner and dry to hold down fly-aways). I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair. Like the natural smell and does not leave my hair feeling heavy, greasy or like it has a product in it.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner actually made my hair very dry. I also noticed some breakage while using this product. Extremely disappointed!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Actually had this product a few times. I go back to Moroccan oil often. But this actually has mild hold and I truly recommend for curly hair. I&#x27;ve certainly used them all. Fab price as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to make my curls soft and full and not weigh them down and this is perfect</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she is happy with the product.  She wears her hair natural, and the first time she used it she said that it left her hair feeling soft.  I also liked how her hair looked after using the product (nice soft, defined curls).</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product a lot! I used it with a combination of the macadamia oil hair mask and it worked wonders!  Someone complimented me by saying how soft my hair was and it was only my first time using it! I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> I love how soft and thick this makes my hair feel. I use it every time after I wash my hair. I can really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have always had thin, easy to tangle hair. This product helps smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> The kids love it too:), way cheaper at amazon than in the mall!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by us to all of you who have curly fuzzy hair, and need fast fix!!!!</li>
            <li> i hated this. i hated the way it felt in my hair. it was not moisturizing at all. i decided to try mxing a little with the oil, again nothing.</li>
            <li> works well on my fine curly hair.  I use it when I am not using the mask by the same company</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and smell amazing!!! I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> One of the best leave ins I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot! I have fine curly hair and this works great! It&#x27;s better than mixed chicks by a mile!</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a reasonable price.  Delivery was in timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, just like the repair masque I reviewed earlier the leave conditioner left my hair feeling so silk and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Used this and even my hairdresser remarked what great condition my hair is in.,  I color it and blow it dry and it takes away the dryness</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it make my hair so soft and it was easy to detangle and scalp felt so clean. for a big bottle and that price it&#x27;s a very good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product? yes run and order .</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product. After I wash it and put this on it leaves my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations .It smells fantastic and keeps my hair moisturised, so soft and shiny.After first use you will feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it,I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not great either. It has a pleasant smell and makes my hair soft, but it seems like it doesn&#x27;t last. I wake up with my hair feeling like I put too much product in--like when you leave hairspray in. Mind you, I only used one pump and I have A LOT of hair. It&#x27;s not bad, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this on Amazon, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this at it&#x27;s normal price for what it did.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when I received it but things happen but I think it should have been packaged better but the product smells great make my hair feel softer</li>
            <li> Just makes your hair greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!</li>
            <li> this stuff is wonderful! I have nothing bad to say about it. a little of this goes a long way, soon id like to try their shampoo, this stuff is thick enough that you wouldn&#x27;t need a regular conditioner. I also have their &amp;#34;flawless cleansing cream&amp;#34; which I like to use a couple times a week, that stuff is amazing as well!</li>
            <li> I use it every night before bed and in the morning if I have a few unwanted frizzy hairs around. I really like this product though because it smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard (like a gel would, which I&#x27;ve had with some leave in conditioners) and it isn&#x27;t sticky. It smells a little like almond extract (a smell that I loveee) and leaves my hair soft!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use this on my very dry coarse hair. It makes my hair feel so soft and silky. I also love the deep hair mask in this line and the oil. They really do wonders to very dry or coarse hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. my hair is healthy and not tangle-y! they packaging was not yet opened and completely fun. Came in the mail very quickly! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky or greasy. The scent is fresh and clean!The product was packaged to prevent damage and arrived on time and was reasonably priced. I would recommend this product to family and friends</li>
            <li> I used this product a few times thinking that maybe I have used too much but it just leaves my hair feeling gross have and makes it look it I had brushed my hair with a ham sandwhich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself a few dollars because there is much better leave in conditioners on the market.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. It smells good but the texture is really greasy. It left my hair freezy and with a thick dirty feeling especially my ends. I was extremely hard for my to blow dry my hair whilre having this product on which usually never happens to me, it took forever. After i styled my hair it looks damage, opaque and with a lot of volume. Im not buying this product ever again.</li>
            <li> I have extrea thick n&#x27; long waist length hair. I love the way it leaves my hair so soft n&#x27; shinning.  It leaves a soft pleasant scent in my hair that doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfumes. I like to brush it through with my hair dryer on low to incorporate it in to my &amp;#34;extra thick&amp;#34; hair, it only takes a few minutes. It never leaves my hair weighted down or dirty looking like some other products. A little dab will do... just apply a little at a time or you can over do it and it will start to look greasy. This large size bottle last me a very long time at a great savings too. This works just as well on all lengths of hair, all of my four daughters love it too. It&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite hair product for years! Amazing and cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I PAYED FOR 10 OUNCES OF PRODUCT AND THE BOTTLE ARRIVED EMPTY,</li>
            <li> Bought this as my aunt sang its praises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes rough dry hair even rougher and dryer.  Had to throw it out</li>
            <li> If they would send me another pump that worked, I would be very grateful. Great product at a good price though.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I use a tiny amount and it smoothes and softens. The pump didn&#x27;t work, so I gave it a 4.</li>
            <li> Gross threw away. Very greasy and oily not a fan at all. Bad purchase on my part. Did deliver quickly!!</li>
            <li> use on freshly washed and conditioned hair before styling to retain moisture. really cuts down on breakage.</li>
            <li> This was a very good purchase. I liked the flavor and will be buying this product again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Not really liking this product. Leaves a film on your hair if you are flat ironing it. I go between curly and straight and this product doesn&#x27;t work well for either.. Not a huge fan of this.</li>
            <li> Really like this leave in cream for detangling and moisturizing my wet hair.  I mix it with the Macadamia Oil to my wet hair and the tangles just seem to fall out when I comb it.  It smells good and leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized after blow drying.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Been using for months, nothing special about this product but the price.  Will stick to Chi.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product for my dry and damaged hair that is quite thin.  Leaves hair silky and shiny and is worth every penny.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and clean smelling, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the whole Macadamia line and am in love with all of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the little extra money because it is certainly worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the Macadamia Oil Nourishing Leave-In Cream. I use it after I rinse out the deep repair masque. I also use it when I want to add a little moisturizer to my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to help. I use it occasionally. Nice and creamy without being greasy. I have thick, dry hair and it does a decent job but it expensive. What works better for me is Hask Argan oil (once weekly deep conditioner, daily conditioner and oil).</li>
            <li> We are all guilty of getting on the band wagon of the latest new thing and macademia oil is the thing now and this stuff, though a little pricey did not meet the expectation that I had for it.  I could have bought some Cantu Creamy Leave-In Conditioner for 4.99 and would have had better results.  No more band wagons for me.</li>
            <li> Just received this,shampoo, conditioner and the hair mask and they didnt have a seal on it and the products were half filled..when I tried it on my hair it made it so hard...I wont be ordering this stuff again..ive had to toss the leave in cz I cant use it...A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Is very good product I like it it&#x27;s made my hair very soft and smell very good</li>
            <li> The product is very moisturizing and non greasy. It leaves my daughters course hair soft and manageable . I&#x27;m very pleased with the results . I noticed the hair was detangled and dryness was reduced after first use.</li>
            <li> FINALLY something that smooths out my frizzy hair! I absolutely love this leave in cream, it leaves my hair smooth with no greasy residue. Will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair, which is long and thin.  I wish I could give it a better review.  I thought it would be as good as the deep repair mask in this line, but for me it just wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This Leave-in cream is soooooo good!!! It works great on my hair!! And it smells so good too! I normally don&#x27;t like to put too much on my hair. So it doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair or anything!! I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without a live-in cream or conditioner. My hair is between curly and wavy, a little dry on the ends and therefore a little frizzy. I applied this product several times to damp hair and then either let them air-dry or blow-dried with a diffuser. It does make my hair look messier and even frizzier! It doesn&#x27;t smooth them and doesn&#x27;t help with the frizz. I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feel and look after, so I stopped using this product. I don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;nourishes&amp;#34; hair either, since the ingredients include all the usual chemicals that are used by the regular cheaper brands sold in the pharmacy.</li>
