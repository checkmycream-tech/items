            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>No smudging there, either - so much better than cleaning off eyeliner!</li>
            <li>What kind of mascara do you use, your eyelashes are so pretty and perfect</li>
            <li>Removes very easy with makeup remover because of the tubes that are formed around the lashes.</li>
            <li>As far as the mascara, it is the best!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara there is!!!</li>
            <li>While the color is nice and the mascara is a good quality, don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth $20.</li>
            <li>and then I liked it just fine.  </li>
            <li>It is now my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>but now I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smear it all under my eyes.</li>
            <li>But the best part was on Monday when I went back to work</li>
            <li>I was torn about how many stars to give this review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to wear mascara on my lower lashes until finding this.</li>
            <li>I still love Amazon but will probably not be buying makeup from here any more.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love how it never smudges and comes off in tubes.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know which one I like better.</li>
            <li>I get better results with Maybelline.</li>
            <li>The red was wonderful!</li>
            <li>Absolutely stunning \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; effect which lasted ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>:) :) :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>My doughtier and I have used this for years and love the product.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t notice that it applied any better than any mascara, cheap or otherwise.</li>
            <li>I became quite skilled at applying eyeliner but always longed for a fluttery display of beautiful long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It washes off so easy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many popular brands...from drugstore to high end department stores...</li>
            <li>His mascara goes on so smoothly and comes off extremely easy with just water.</li>
            <li>It makes your lashes long and beautiful, never clumps and stays put all day.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, creates full, curly lashes and washes off so easy at night.</li>
            <li>The Kevyn Aucoin counter was doing a demonstration that day, touting this cool \\&quot;tube mascara\\&quot; which supposedly did not run and was easy to remove.</li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t run, and is super easy to get off.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>is the ONLY kind that does not give me raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li>I hope you love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>This is a really great mascura - it doesn&#x27;t smudge under the eye, which I always have a problem with using other mascuras.</li>
            <li>Dries out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Although it is a very nice mascara - applies smoothly with little to no clumping - I just can&#x27;t seem to notice a difference in the curl of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I find this type of mascara superior to the conventional type because it is so easy to wash off, no smearing or smudging.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so nice and stays in place all day long but is still so easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li>When this product first arrived in the mail I was very excited because of all the positive reviews I&#x27;d read.</li>
            <li>HONESTLY, this is just regular mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tiny, barely-there lashes, and it nicely enhanced my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Does not work any better than the pink tube of my favorite drug store brand.</li>
            <li>absolutely nothing special about this.</li>
            <li>, when you look up or down they are so long and perfectly spaced out</li>
            <li>Do be aware that when you remove it, you need to use something oil based.</li>
            <li>For this price, it should last more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, this is the first time I&#x27;ve bought Kevyn mascara off Amazon</li>
            <li>and until I find another similar product that either has more in it or is cheaper.. I&#x27;ll stick to this one.</li>
            <li>Kevyn Aucoin mascaras are my favorite and the only one I have faith in!</li>
            <li>This definitely holds up and gives great length along with curl with absolutely no smudging, ever.</li>
            <li>Later that night, the mascara came off easily with a little warm water and gentle pressure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine when you only put one layer on but after that it gets really clumpy...</li>
            <li>It stays on yet comes off so easily with just a bit of warm water on your fingers, without rubbing and pulling on the delicate eye area, and comes completely off, so bacteria and residue don&#x27;t linger in your lashes like many other kinds.</li>
            <li>It really curls as you apply it.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely doesn&#x27;t smudge or sweat off under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>But, really like it while it works, so will buy it again</li>
            <li>Everybody asks me if they are real.</li>
            <li>So I took my favorite eyeliner brush (Haukuhodo K #5) and dabbed a little excess from the tube and deposited the mascara RIGHT at the bases of my lashes using the tightline technique.</li>
            <li>I have short nothing special eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the formula was changed, but this is no longer effective.</li>
            <li>I love it and will not use any other!</li>
            <li>but, as most mascaras do, it left shadows under my eyes after only about an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>It is a decent mascara, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay $28 for it again</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this mascara since it was featured on a beauty website as my solution to problem mascaras, but I was a bit underwhelmed.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this mascara</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s going right back</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be new (who would order used mascara anyways?)</li>
            <li>And it is completely waterproof in the pool.</li>
            <li>I decided to use my old wand from the Kiss Me product to see what result I got</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 years old and a makeup junkie.</li>
            <li>I have never every gotten an eyelash compliment in my whole entire life.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be ordering directly from Kevyn Aucoin.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I can&#x27;t really get it anywhere in a regular store, so I always have to order it online.</li>
            <li>And it makes my lashes look so long and pretty.  </li>
            <li>So anyway there are a few different brands of these tube-type mascaras, but this brand is my favorite.</li>
            <li>However, as the day wore on, it did something odd to my lashes: they started not so much to curl, but to stick straight up.</li>
            <li>I could probably find a mascara that&#x27;s just as good as this in a drug store, and I regret that I spent this much to find out Kevyn Aucoin was mediocre.</li>
            <li>I re-apply once more on a regular day, twice more for a night out ( you can get crazy long Mr. Snuffleupagus lashes).</li>
            <li>I am also Asian with short straight stubby lashes.</li>
            <li>I have major problems with smudging</li>
            <li>Barely any product came off the wand.</li>
            <li>I work hard, I play hard, and I like looking good doing both.</li>
            <li>as this mascara looks a million times more natural than a thick black line.</li>
            <li>So if you want a mascara that will not flake and are willing to pay $25 for black only, it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li>But it only comes in the extreme black color, you get a smaller tube than most mascaras and it tends to glob after just a few uses.</li>

            <li> It seems to flake when its running out and has become a little dry in the tube which seems to happen pretty frequently due to the fact that it only has 0.5 Grams of product in it (so it feels like I&#x27;m constantly buying this stuff).</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes, for real.</li>
            <li> After they applied the mascara, I stunned by the effect - long fluttery lashes which seemed to reach to the skies.</li>
            <li> Result: luscious long lashes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!!  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascara; regular &amp; waterproof, but none have ever held the curl for the entire day until this mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine when you only put one layer on but after that it gets really clumpy... I like at least two layers.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara since it was featured on a beauty website as my solution to problem mascaras, but I was a bit underwhelmed. Although it is a very nice mascara - applies smoothly with little to no clumping - I just can&#x27;t seem to notice a difference in the curl of my eyelashes. While the color is nice and the mascara is a good quality, don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth $20. I have major problems with smudging and it&#x27;s not waterproof in the least. When one goes to remove the mascara at night, it peels off the lashes as though it is semi-dried paint. I could probably find a mascara that&#x27;s just as good as this in a drug store, and I regret that I spent this much to find out Kevyn Aucoin was mediocre.</li>
            <li> This is a really great mascura - it doesn&#x27;t smudge under the eye, which I always have a problem with using other mascuras. I was considering using it for my wedding makeup, but it is NOT waterproof and when water touches it, it comes off in \\&quot;little pieces/strings\\&quot;. But, great for every day use. I wear a mask and glasses at work, and by the end of the day, I still don&#x27;t have any smudges underneath my eyes, so I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> When this product first arrived in the mail I was very excited because of all the positive reviews I&#x27;d read. I was disappointed when I tried it. It was too thin. It didn&#x27;t add any fullness or length to my lashes. So, I gave up on it after a couple days. A month later I needed some waterproof mascara and this was all I had. I don&#x27;t know what happened to this stuff over the course of a month, but it miraculously improved. It is now my favorite mascara. Do be aware that when you remove it, you need to use something oil based. I use Albolene. And, it doesn&#x27;t dissolve the product, it only loosens it from your lashes, so it will come off in little flakes. I thought this was weird at first but now I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smear it all under my eyes. And it is completely waterproof in the pool. It won&#x27;t even smear if you rub it while in the water.</li>
            <li> I was used to using another brand of this type of mascara (Kiss Me) where the lashes are coated in little \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; rather than just applying color. I find this type of mascara superior to the conventional type because it is so easy to wash off, no smearing or smudging.  I did not like the result of using this mascara because it looked like it was caked on.  I decided to use my old wand from the Kiss Me product to see what result I got and then I liked it just fine.  I don&#x27;t know what it is that makes it a \\&quot;curling\\&quot; lash product but if it is the wand, it is not worth the trade off to have the lashes look curled but all heavy with product.</li>
            <li> Life changing mascara. It really curls as you apply it.  Very weird when you wash it off - comes off in little spider leg thingies.  But hey - it&#x27;s life  changing mascara!</li>
            <li> Its a good mascara and its best feature is that it DOES NOT flake. But it only comes in the extreme black color, you get a smaller tube than most mascaras and it tends to glob after just a few uses. Plus it costs $25. So if you want a mascara that will not flake and are willing to pay $25 for black only, it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara itself, best have have used.  It absolutely doesn&#x27;t smudge or sweat off under the eyes.  The packaging is not good though.  When you pull the want out of the tube it is covered in a big gloppy mess where the bristles begin.  Over time, you lose a lot of product due to this.  I think it runs out faster because of this as well.  For this price, it should last more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have every used. I&#x27;m 38 years old and a makeup junkie. I have short nothing special eyelashes. I read reviews on this product and decided to try it even though, it&#x27;s a little expensive. Tried it as soon as it came in the mail. It goes on so nice and stays in place all day long but is still so easy to remove at night. But the best part was on Monday when I went back to work I was talking to a coworker and she said.....What kind of mascara do you use, your eyelashes are so pretty and perfect, when you look up or down they are so long and perfectly spaced out it looks like a commerical.....    ......I have never every gotten an eyelash compliment in my whole entire life. :o) This is the only mascara I will ever buy again.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this so bad, but I was just disapointed. It does not curl my eyelashes enough :(</li>
            <li> I have tried many popular brands...from drugstore to high end department stores...this is the one I have been searching for...I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I was torn about how many stars to give this review. As far as the mascara, it is the best! I have been using it for quite awhile now. It is the only one I have used that doesn&#x27;t flake off, smudge under my eyes by the end of the day, or make my lashes brittle. I&#x27;ve never been able to wear mascara on my lower lashes until finding this. It stays on yet comes off so easily with just a bit of warm water on your fingers, without rubbing and pulling on the delicate eye area, and comes completely off, so bacteria and residue don&#x27;t linger in your lashes like many other kinds. HOWEVER, this is the first time I&#x27;ve bought Kevyn mascara off Amazon and I was quite disappointed. It was supposed to be new (who would order used mascara anyways?), yet was either not only used but used UP, or else completely dried out. Barely any product came off the wand. I&#x27;m not sure how this ended up packaged and sent but it&#x27;s going right back and I&#x27;ll be ordering directly from Kevyn Aucoin. I still love Amazon but will probably not be buying makeup from here any more.</li>
            <li> this is the best mascara i have ever used&lt;br /&gt;I started using it 3 yrs ago  I have long&lt;br /&gt;lashes so i use the thicking one&lt;br /&gt;y wont be sorry stays on all day&lt;br /&gt;and nite great find out get some</li>
            <li> Came with NO mascara in it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> HONESTLY, this is just regular mascara. absolutely nothing special about this. Its also water proof, and really hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> There is no mascara out there better than this one! It makes your lashes long and beautiful, never clumps and stays put all day. Removes very easy with makeup remover because of the tubes that are formed around the lashes.</li>
            <li> Immediately after application, I loved this product. I have tiny, barely-there lashes, and it nicely enhanced my eyes.  However, as the day wore on, it did something odd to my lashes: they started not so much to curl, but to stick straight up. It looked a little odd. Further, although there was no beneath-the-eye smudging, black detritus started to shed. I don&#x27;t know whether my lashes were falling out, or whether the product was flaking in lash-shaped bits. Either way, it was alarming. I won&#x27;t say I won&#x27;t ever use it again, but it&#x27;s not my fave. Still searching for the perfect smudge-free mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I work hard, I play hard, and I like looking good doing both. This definitely holds up and gives great length along with curl with absolutely no smudging, ever. It seems to flake when its running out and has become a little dry in the tube which seems to happen pretty frequently due to the fact that it only has 0.5 Grams of product in it (so it feels like I&#x27;m constantly buying this stuff). Anyway, definitely is what it says it is and until I find another similar product that either has more in it or is cheaper.. I&#x27;ll stick to this one.</li>
            <li> Kevyn Aucoin&#x27;s is a tubing mascara, which means it forms tubes around the lashes.  It does not run or flake at all.  It washes off in the small tubes it forms, so it may appear your eyelashes are falling out, but fear not! It is only the mascara.  This is the best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Nothing curls my eyelashes quite like this mascara. I receive compliments constantly when I use it. Worth every penny! Once you try this product, you won&#x27;t want to wear any other mascara again!</li>
            <li> Love how it never smudges and comes off in tubes.  Definitely worth the extra money.  Makes lashes look very long.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara. It goes on smooth, creates full, curly lashes and washes off so easy at night. I was skeptical reading reviews before purchase, but I am a believer now.</li>
            <li> This mascara is &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34;.  It tends to clump a lot, especially after you&#x27;ve been using it for a few days.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Kevyn Aucoin mascaras are my favorite and the only one I have faith in! I&#x27;ve tried this one and the volume one and I don&#x27;t know which one I like better. They&#x27;re almost the same. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of mascaras and this Japanese tube technology is the ONLY kind that does not give me raccoon eyes! I don&#x27;t understand why even the waterproof kinds smudge on me. So anyway there are a few different brands of these tube-type mascaras, but this brand is my favorite. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t really get it anywhere in a regular store, so I always have to order it online. I hope these never get discontinued!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t curl my lashes. I get better results with Maybelline. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Dries out quickly.  But, really like it while it works, so will buy it again</li>
            <li> Hard to wash off. Leaves film. It&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> His mascara goes on so smoothly and comes off extremely easy with just water. I bought the black because I can&#x27;t find the red anymore. I guess they quit making it after his death? The red was wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love it! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does not work any better than the pink tube of my favorite drug store brand. Extremely over rated and over priced. I returned immediately. What was I thinking?</li>
            <li> As someone with very very sensitive eyes (I have a dry eye medical condition), I have never worn mascara for anything except the most special of occasions, and even then I was miserable because these mascaras would irritate and run. :( I am also Asian with short straight stubby lashes. I became quite skilled at applying eyeliner but always longed for a fluttery display of beautiful long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to go shopping with my friend to Bergdorf&#x27;s on a Saturday afternoon and on a whim I decided to try this mascara. The Kevyn Aucoin counter was doing a demonstration that day, touting this cool \\&quot;tube mascara\\&quot; which supposedly did not run and was easy to remove. Needless to say I was skeptical at first. After they applied the mascara, I stunned by the effect - long fluttery lashes which seemed to reach to the skies. The makeup artist used a curler which amplified the lengthening effect. Jaw-dropping! The test would be whether or not I could last all day without tearing and smearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 hours later - *YES* it lasted all day. Even after a sweaty 1 hour elliptical session at the gym later that night. No irritation, no smearing, not even flaking. GORGEOUS lashes. I couldn&#x27;t even believe that the curl held! Later that night, the mascara came off easily with a little warm water and gentle pressure. No smudging there, either - so much better than cleaning off eyeliner! I was sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to wear this every single day. It took me a few days to finally develop a technique for proper application, as I was a mascara newbie. I deposit a bit at the base then quickly fan upward. I re-apply once more on a regular day, twice more for a night out ( you can get crazy long Mr. Snuffleupagus lashes). Then I use a lash comb to remove clumps. I let it dry, then curl with a heater culer (Eyecurl II...THE BEST, check it out - no pinching, all-day curl, can apply after mascara). I noticed that the mascara at the base of the lashes on my lid never flaked or smudged. A thought dawned on me - I could TIGHTLINE with this mascara!!! So I took my favorite eyeliner brush (Haukuhodo K #5) and dabbed a little excess from the tube and deposited the mascara RIGHT at the bases of my lashes using the tightline technique. Absolutely stunning \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; effect which lasted ALL DAY. I no longer wear eyeliner (crazy, right?) as this mascara looks a million times more natural than a thick black line. I like to dust my eyelids with a sparkly nude shadow. Result: luscious long lashes. Everybody asks me if they are real. :) :) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing this every single day for months. I can&#x27;t think of the last time a product has changed my life and look so dramatically! I hope you love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara but, as most mascaras do, it left shadows under my eyes after only about an hour or so.  I also didn&#x27;t notice that it applied any better than any mascara, cheap or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.  All mascaras run on me, even waterproof ones, and then it drives me crazy that it&#x27;s impossible to get off.  I don&#x27;t have time for make-up remover, I just want to wash my face and be done with it.  This mascara doesn&#x27;t run, and is super easy to get off.  And it makes my lashes look so long and pretty.  I seriously haven&#x27;t used any other mascara since I discovered this about 10 years ago!!  No more raccoon eyes, for real.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl and the fibers are annoying to remove.  It is a decent mascara, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay $28 for it again</li>
            <li> This mascara is AMAZING! I will never use anything else. It&#x27;s perfect for the coverage and is so easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara there is!!! I love it and will not use any other! It washes off so easy.</li>
            <li> It was awful.  I was not able to use it at all. It was dried out.</li>
            <li> My doughtier and I have used this for years and love the product.  The mascara does&amp;#34;t run and does a wonderful job of enhancing our lashes.</li>
            <li> This is used to be a great product. I would curl my lashes and then put this on, and it would hold the curl all day. The last two tubes I bought do not work as well. I&#x27;m not sure if the formula was changed, but this is no longer effective. I had to change my review from 5 stars to two.</li>
            <li> Terrible, all dried up. I had to return it.</li>
