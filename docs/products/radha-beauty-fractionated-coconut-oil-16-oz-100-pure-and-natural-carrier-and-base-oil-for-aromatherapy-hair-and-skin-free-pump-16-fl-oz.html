            <li>This is such a good value.</li>
            <li>nice thing about coconut oil is there are so many uses and the oil has a very long shelf life.</li>

            <li>just super moisture.</li>
            <li>Total thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given Fractionated coconut oil for free for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a light-weight product that is perfect for massaging as is, or adding essential oils for topical use.</li>
            <li>The oil came quickly and was packaged well (not over- or under-packaged).  </li>
            <li>I am fascinated that I had never heard of the many uses of coconut oil that can improve so many different things.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and I&#x27;ve also noticed that it does not stain clothing if I quickly use a Clorox wipe on the spot</li>

            <li>The pump sprayer is super.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>price is great for how much you get, it&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li>and I think that the push-down/pop-up cap is adequate for dispensing the oil.</li>

            <li>Just as described and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this is the best product that I have  ever bought for multiple uses on human body.  </li>
            <li>This product absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily sensation.</li>
            <li>This Fractionated Coconut Oil, by Radha Beauty is perfect for this as it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feel behind.  </li>
            <li>I love that this oil doesn&#x27;t have a scent, absorbs quickly, and makes my skin very soft!  </li>
            <li>It is clear and very easy to work with in DIY beauty/makeup recipes.</li>
            <li>More pleasant to use than ordinary coconut oil, which has a consistency like Crisco and has to be warmed in your hands to become liquid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased especially with the pump feature  </li>
            <li>but it also can be used directly on to the skin to moisturize it specially during winter when our need better hydration.</li>
            <li>It worked very well for that purpose and rubbed into the skin easily.</li>
            <li>The 16 ounce bottle is the perfect size and should last me a long time.</li>
            <li>So I was looking for a good stuff for helping dry</li>
            <li>Absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I used it all over my body as a moisturizer and went on smooth, absorbed fast and wasn&#x27;t greasy at all!</li>
            <li>Too early to tell, but so far loving it!  </li>
            <li>After the application, the oil absorbed quickly into my skin leaving no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others that are a smaller bottle for more and between the two, I&#x27;ll be reordering this one again!</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely make sure to keep this stocked in my house because of its versatility!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Love it so far and no problems!</li>
            <li>I use it for massaging on certain people leaves their skin smooth and refresh.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to using the oil with my other essential oils and am very pleased with the good price for the amount that I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I do love the coconut scent, but it is fine that there is no scent to clash with the essential oil scent.  </li>
            <li>so she can use as a quick after-shower moisturizer for skin and hair, which works really well because it is a smooth liquid right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Having to be able to put the right on the bottle makes this so easy when I want to mix it with an essential oil and use as a massage lotion on my feet, chest or anywhere on my bottle.</li>
            <li>Amazing  can be used  for  several  things  from hair to skin</li>
            <li>I then use 1 drop of this with 1 drop of Rose Hip Oil for my night moisturizer and in the morning I use 1 drop of this coconut oil for my daily moisturizer before applying my makeup, etc.  </li>
            <li>I applied  “Fractionated Coconut Oil”  which I have received recently with a nice package and start to massage my skin and also my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First try I used a full pump&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Mixing great with my young living essential oils</li>
            <li>If I wasn&#x27;t so tall ( and could it in a tub nicely) I would mix this with some essential oils and add it to the tub to relax.</li>
            <li>My biggest peeve about coconut oil is that it makes you smell like baked goods, so I love that this is completely odourless.</li>
            <li>I would tell anyone who wants a good carrier oil to use with their essential oils to purchase this any</li>
            <li>The quality of the oil is excellent, but I have it 4 stars because the pump was broken when j received my package.</li>
            <li>This cap doesn&#x27;t leak when it is closed, and it is better than many that I have tried, so I have no issues or problems with it at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I  would write a worth while review.</li>
            <li>This oil is great but the pump bottle leaks and is much messier than expected.</li>
            <li>It takes rather longer than a cream or lotion to absorb into your skin, but it will be absorbed.</li>
            <li>I was able to use a coupon code and get mine for free, but will totally but once it runs out!</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed by the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>No noticeable smell, absorbed by my skin without being overly greasy, and</li>
            <li>On top of that I applied it for an hour to my 80 year old</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle because I loved it so much I had to get another</li>
            <li>I love this light coconut oil for mixing with essential oils and making lotions.  </li>
            <li>It was nice mixed in a bath, and also as a hair serum that I would put in my hair and shampoo it out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is truly worth trying and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So nice because it doesn&#x27;t solidify like regular coconut oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to discover some really cool DIY skincare recipes, and most of them call for some type of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Very positive experience.</li>
            <li>Just mix in your favorite blend of essential oils such as lavendar lemon and mint to make your own unique blend.</li>
            <li>name implies, a fraction of the original oil, it still maintains multiple healthy benefits.</li>
            <li>I use it as a carrier oil, hair conditioner, face moisturizer &amp;&amp; many many other uses</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>I have been using the regular kind of coconut oil, the kind that has to be warmed to melt to a liquid, for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Got it right on time</li>
            <li>The oil was not greasy at all my skin ate it right up.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>This is not greasy and goes right into my skin and feels like silk.</li>
            <li>but once you put it on it soaked right in.</li>
            <li>Not too oily but just right.  </li>
            <li>You can get dressed right away or hop into bed and not muss your clothes or sheets.  </li>
            <li>It helps the lipsticks to slide right out of the mold without sticking, breaking, or losing product.</li>
            <li>I like that this oil is liquid because it is easier to apply just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>The first bottle was part of a review campaign and the 2nd time was my own purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy we ended up with the Radha one - it has been great so far, we have made fish and baked goods a number of times and it&#x27;s been a very nice complement - a nice delicate oil that is odorless/tasteless (really!) and does extremely well under high heats.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a free pump, because squeezing or pouring this oil makes a huge mess, and is a pain to do when you are doing massages.</li>
            <li>I think it works really well as a carrier oil-smoothly, and does not have a strong scent so my EO scenes really come through.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer without the heavy feeling and all the yucky additives!</li>
            <li>So I am trying to learn more about essential oils, aromatherapy and using more homemade natural products vs manmade chemicals.</li>
            <li>It sinks right in and is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very very few lines or wringles and the texture of my skin is great.  </li>
            <li>I use doTerra Essential Oil&#x27;s and this product is GREAT... can&#x27;t say enough!  </li>
            <li>Great product, mixed well as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I think coconut oil is a great idea / solution for individuals who aren&#x27;t getting the results from traditional deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>Great oil to use on the skin or mixed with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I really liked that the oil was a liquid and that my dry and brittle hair soaked it up.</li>
            <li>Very surprised by how smooth and non greasy even compared to the reg coconut oil...</li>
            <li>it was very versatile and made me skin super smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I really like this Coconut Oil because most coconut oil tend to turn solid when store in a cool area but the Radha Coconut oil stayed liquid, so</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and with a very pleasant smell very different from a typical coconut oil.</li>
            <li>But the main thing is my feet!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>This is very very premium quality product and I will buy it over over again.</li>
            <li>received Radha Beauty’s 100% Pure Argan Oil &amp; Fractionated Coconut Oil complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It mixes quickly and easily and does no solidify like the solid coconut oil does.  </li>
            <li>I am new to fractionated coconut oil, so I wanted to make sure that I received Radha brand, which is high quality, pure, and guaranteed.</li>
            <li>I am a huge believer in using products that are natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely softer and in better condition since adding this oil.</li>
            <li>It absorbs faster and more thoroughly than regular coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Comes off like a breeze and leaves face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Because it is fractionated, it is in liquid form instead of solid form, and doesn&#x27;t have any coconut scent like most coconut oils.</li>
            <li>I know many would pay extra to have an organic option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Radha Beauty Product is one of my favorite brand, and I especially like their coconut oil and retinol cream.</li>
            <li>The first time I was given a discount, and I used it up.</li>
            <li>I received this from Radha Beauty and was not quite sure what to do with it initially.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the oil that seeps through the skin keeps the skin soft, smooth, and moist by not letting moisture escape.</li>
            <li>In order to safely apply essential oils to your skin you need a barrier oil to safely dilute the essential oil.</li>
            <li>First of all, I like coconut oil...</li>
            <li>Second, I LOVE radha coconut oil.</li>
            <li>make my skin soft and smooth in seconds.</li>
            <li>it is so much better than regular coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase more products from this company.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>and it really does the job!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>

            <li>There are many different uses.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I do use this as a moisturizer when I get out of the shower and my skin feels so soft, smooth, and supple.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to be a carrier oil but have used it for so much more on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Coconut Oil for my beauty routines.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>But i still love the product and will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li>I used it for hot oil massage for my hair.</li>
            <li>Feels greasy at first</li>
            <li>There is so many recipes to make homemade personal care products.</li>
            <li>Her skin is soft and smooth without the nastiness of lotion.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this Coconut oil with my essential oils as a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li>Two on the top (on each side of my head), and one in the back.</li>
            <li>so you really get your money&#x27;s worth with the 16oz.</li>
            <li>I found the oil to be exactly what it claimed.  </li>
            <li>It is the first oil I have used that does not coat my skin with a sticky layer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>LOVE using this for my carrier oil for my DIY pain rubs made with essential oils.</li>

            <li>So far I have used it for a skin moisturizer and after a shower in my hair for a light conditioner.</li>
            <li>starting my oil craze, I did some research on the benefits of coconut oil and its many uses.</li>

            <li>It made my prone to dryness legs feel ultra-moisturized and more hydrated than with regular body lotion or body balm.</li>
            <li>first think I notice is that the oil is, indeed, colorless.</li>
            <li>The fractionated coconut oil absorbs nicely and not much is needed.</li>
            <li>You will be able to use it with your regular fragrance.</li>

            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>At first I broke out a lot</li>

            <li>I purchased this oil as a carrier oil for my new found love of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Due to the way it is processed, fractionated coconut oil has a high concentration of Capric acid and Caprylic acid, which gives it an amazing amount of antioxidant and disinfecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I really like this coconut oil.</li>
            <li>It is very COOOOOOOOOOL ITEM.</li>
            <li>but when making beauty products my one issue is that sometimes the coconut oil hardens too much to make the consistency that i&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>I used this to make a gentle shaving cream</li>
            <li>Even though my mom put it in the fridge and thought it was for cooking haha</li>
            <li>thanks</li>

            <li>I’ve been looking for a carrier oil for my essential oils and received this coconut oil free* to try and review.</li>
            <li>works really well...</li>
            <li>and i noticed that my mosquito bites on my foot heals fast because of this oil.. must buy oil..</li>
            <li>So much easier to use coconut oil in this liquid form.</li>
            <li>Received it in the mail fast.</li>
            <li>Vendor ( Rahda Beauty Products) shipped fast with no problems.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an unscented oil - very liquid.</li>
            <li>hand, so go gently until you get a feel for this pump - it is inelegant but functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like how this oil absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t give your food that real greasy feel.</li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>although I was kinda worried cause it looks really oily</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It really is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like it for my hair and hands.  </li>
            <li>It is very hydrating</li>
            <li>Really like this oil.</li>
            <li>You can do so much with this oil.</li>
            <li>The oil goes on much nicer than baby oil.</li>
            <li>That also makes the price really reasonable.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a body moisturizer straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li>It is very watery</li>
            <li>Very convenient to have in a pump style</li>
            <li>The benefits of coconut oil is no secret to beauty and skin care aficionados.</li>
            <li>We have really curly hair</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li>Something about it being completely clear is more appeasing to me than the buttery solid jar I had been using.</li>
            <li>Second try I just used a couple of drops, and it still made it look oily - and by the next morning my hair smelled kind of funky, too.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far with a couple of drops of essential oil</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>It is more convenient than the solidified oil, in that it&#x27;s not difficult to use when it gets down to the bottom.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft and smooth for an entire day, which I&#x27;ve only ever experienced with one other product, despite trying almost everything out in the market today.</li>
            <li>The first 2 bottles were leaking and the company sent me 2 new bottles.</li>
            <li>It absorbs right into my skin and feels soft.</li>
            <li>Right when I received I put on my hands and wow</li>
            <li>Very pure and natural.  </li>
            <li>Works great, a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>Generally speaking for the majority of purposes I use essential oils, coconut is my all time favorite carrier oil and Radha&#x27;s is just as beneficial as any I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>A chemist friend gave a mini &amp;#34;tutorial&amp;#34; on this oil over coffee and said that a significant reason coconut oil makes the perfect carrier oil is that it&#x27;s molecules are very small, nearly as small as the essential oils so that it doesn&#x27;t hinder the EO from being absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>We use an organic extra virgin coconut oil for pulling (the kind that liquifies in your mouth) and just thought it was really strange to use that one for cooking,</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very generous bottle of high quality FCO and I will be a fan for life.  </li>
            <li>You only have to use very little and that works very effectively.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this provided as many benefits of conventional coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I use a hot iron and ignored my natural &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my hair, and wish I would have received the free pump as advertised to save on the overall general use of it, but other than that I really like it.</li>
            <li>Radha has great quality products and I will never go back to any other brand for my fractionated coconut oil or lavender essential oil...</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for my dry skin and it does wonders.</li>
            <li>It does not have particular smell and is colorless.</li>
            <li>Given, it melts fairly quickly upon application if warmth is present.</li>
            <li>and I loved that I got a few different emails while it was shipping with extras and updated information.</li>
            <li>If left my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used the coconut oil along with Peppermint essential oil to make him a chest rub to open up his breathing without having to buy products with additional chemicals that I may not be able to pronounce.</li>
            <li>I add it in to my conditioner to make a super hydrated deep treatment.</li>
            <li>, that is Coconut Oil that is mainly for cosmetic uses and not to be used for cooking.</li>
            <li>It can be a very nice massage oil when it is mixed with lavender essential oil or any other scent &amp; does not leave a greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>Overall I feel it is good oil; see my breakdown of pros and cons below, the cons being why I marked it down a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>Seems to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to try a Fractionated Coconut Oil with no fillers or additives.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil has been used for skin care, high blood pressure, weight loss, aiding in digestion, stress relief, kidney problems, boosting the immune system and others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this coconut  oil.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a number of things, including on my skin, cooking (withstands high temperatures), and in aromatherapy sprays and massage oils.</li>
            <li>It’s not so large that I won’t be able to use it up, but it also is not so small that I will use it all up for the first or second time I make something with it.&lt;br /&gt;-Fragrance free, as carrier oil you want your essential oils to stand out and not be overpowered by it.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizes</li>
            <li>This saturation gives it a very, very long shelf life and greatly increased stability (i.e. it will not become rancid for a long long time).</li>
            <li>100% pure and natural.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>Love this product so far, using it as a essential oil carrier-- use it daily for my face because I am sensitive to like everything else!!</li>
            <li>I use this on my rough heels and with one use, they were smooth again.</li>
            <li>It works to keep my hair soft &amp; tames my frizziness on those very humid days.</li>
            <li>I have also cooked with coconut oil and find my foods taste better without that heavy oil taste.</li>
            <li>I received the product mentioned above complimentary for review and testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I will use it along with my normal organic face moisturizer and as a body lotion.</li>
            <li>Blends so nice and not the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for hair deep treatment and for using just a small amount to smooth hair with, using while hair is still wet.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and is excellent for dry or troubled skin.  </li>
            <li>At nite I put this on feet and hands as a lotion, noticed a big improvment right away.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way which makes this oil very cost effective.</li>
            <li>Also the price is very reasonable with this high quality product and the big portion.</li>
            <li>The bottle is quite large and should last quite awhile because it doesn’t take much to cover the skin.</li>
            <li>my review was not altered due to the free product.</li>
            <li>With the FCO I can use a little on damp hair, and then add more as needed and it makes my hair shiny, soft,</li>
            <li>Without me knowing, my oldest daughter, 9, started using it in the shower and now CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li>I live in TX now.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to using coconut oil</li>
            <li>My new FCO of choice</li>
            <li>I can honesty say that this oil is not only better,but it leaves less of an oily residue and it&#x27;s more reasonably priced and I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have been putting this oil directly on my skin as I live in high altitude.  </li>
            <li>There is no odor and is very clear.</li>
            <li>Very soft and velvety.</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft like never before it does wonders in my skin</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft like never before</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and stays moistened all day!</li>
            <li>The coconut oil is exactly what I wanted so that I can make my sugar scrub and essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li>I actually got my first bottle by a promo code from their face book page.</li>
            <li>This oil has no scent which surprised me, I was expecting to smell like a pina colada!</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li>Pretty big bottle!</li>
            <li>Bottle is however a little bit soft - and squeezing it even gently send oil squirting right out the pump nozzle!</li>
            <li>I was using plain old coconut oil as a massage medium, and while it smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t drip (because under A/C it starts out solid), it&#x27;s also greasy and at least for me, comodogenic (pore clogging.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the pump too because it helps me to have a mess free experience.</li>
            <li>There are many different uses for coconut oil and after purchasing I have had less mosquito bites, hair that shines and it can even be used as a suntan lotion.</li>
            <li>Just right for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>so a bit drippy, sorry to say, and I miss the unrefined coconut aroma, but it makes up for those losses by being easy to wash off whatever you need to wash it off of, it&#x27;s light on the skin (no breakouts yet), and sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react to it, if mine is any indication.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase this product again when my initial stock runs out.</li>
            <li>is a definition copied from the web: As the name implies, fractionated coconut oil is a fraction of the coconut oil from which almost all the long chain triglycerides are removed, thus leaving mainly the medium-chain triglycerides and making it an absolutely saturated oil.</li>
            <li>so if you choose to add other essential oils  you can easily do so.</li>
            <li>It works very well with my Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>Packaging:  A clear, plastic bottle with a shampoo bottle-type squeeze lid.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and clear.</li>
            <li>I have been using virgin coconut oil for years, and I really like the convenience of not having to heat and melt the oil, yet I do like an organic product when possible.</li>
            <li>Then I started to get bolder and used it as a detangler for my 7 year old&#x27;s curly mane.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended using coconut oil as a baby moisturizer since babies can have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a reason to invest that much in something when there&#x27;s quality stuff out there for a fourth of the cost.</li>
            <li>It left my hair absolutely frizz.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>And with a LIFETIME MONEY BACK GUARANTEE you have absolutely nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and can be used for lots of different things.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is a natural beauty product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it in a mixture of natural oils I use in my hair and as a moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li>and my beard is soft.</li>
            <li>Regular coconut oil can go rancid and expires much faster.  </li>
            <li>I even bought roller bottles and fixed my Mom some.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it to help my daughter&#x27;s cradle cap, clear up her diaper rash, and as a moisturizer on my legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues using it so far.</li>
            <li>has no scent,very light,all natural.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference this has made.</li>
            <li>The company offers a 100%-Make</li>
            <li>I have used it for frying (spray on pans), oil directly on skin and then rinse off while in the shower, and as a cuticle softener.  </li>
            <li>It always removes any makeup and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>makes mixing with essential oils so much easier</li>
            <li>As I have been with all of the Radha products so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft after shaving.</li>
            <li>This is among my favorites so far.</li>
            <li>I have used this coconut oil in place of dimethicone as a natural alternative for my lipstick molds.</li>
            <li>It does not clog your pores and has natural antioxidants with disinfecting properties.</li>
            <li>Really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Though I used the product only for few days I was able to see the difference.</li>
            <li>Not bad long enough to tell if it works but have been told it does</li>
            <li>It sinks right into my skin and leaves it fragrance-free</li>
            <li>The oil provides just the right amount of barrier to protect the skin from the essential oils (EO&#x27;s are typically recommended to be used with a carrier oil), yet light enough to allow the Essential Oils to penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li>Main use is for a carrier oil for my essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li>Only a small amount, about the size of a quarter at most, is needed.</li>
            <li>A lot of care is invested by the founders to not only ensure that high standards are met,  but to also educate the consumer.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality product I definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product to someone looking for coconut oil who may want to skimp on the &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; factor.</li>
            <li>Received exactly what I hoped and expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>First of all fractionated is not pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li>The hard kind tended to make my hair too greasy if I wasn&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li>I will get back to you as I discover and try new ways to use Radha Beauty Coconut Oil. .</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at all the different things you can use this for.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how big the bottle was.</li>
            <li>I received a little ebook about the product and many of its other health benefits and uses.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
            <li>Just as expected, large bottle, no damage.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>I bought this Fractionated Coconut Oil(FCO) to use with my Young Living Essential Oils in roller ball bottles as well as general application.</li>
            <li>No regrets in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>It is a completely neutral oil so that the fragrance of any essential oil added to it isn&#x27;t changed at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually used this directly on the dryest parts of my skin and it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t get any residue on my clothes.</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful trying to use it because you get so much out at once.</li>
            <li>I have been using it with multiple oils both in roller balls and direct application by hand.  </li>
            <li>My arms and legs feel soft and the skin looks younger and fresher than before.</li>
            <li>As a natural brunette, I&#x27;m about six months in on my journey to achieving white / platinum hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that this oil, was an actual oil, and I didn&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;warm</li>
            <li>I use it all over, especially on knees, elbows, and sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful trying to use it because you get so much out at once.</li>
            <li>Its an ideal carrier oil &amp; base for DIY beauty products ... like a sugar scrub.</li>
            <li>I like to put this on right out of shower while my skin is still a little damp.</li>
            <li>The slight scent of coconut oil the day after was a little more pronounced</li>
            <li>My super fried/bleached hair started feeling soft again after only a few days use!</li>
            <li>I have used a few other different brands in the past, but this is hands down the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have a mild case of psoriasis and this is very soothing, non irritating.</li>
            <li>and they said they would send one right out use a few drops in hair conditioner</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs right in, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy, and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li>My scalp it less irritated when I use this oil as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I have also been using it straight without adding any other oils as a skin soother for my leg where I burned myself.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a whole other</li>
            <li>but I am trying new things to improve my dry skin.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I did not receive my free pump as stated.</li>
            <li>It has everything you would want in a fractionated oil - while we use ours in the kitchen it can be used for tons and tons of other things and as it&#x27;s light / pure it won&#x27;t ever feel heavy or greasy/ gunky like some others with lots of other fillers can feel.</li>
            <li>Since the bottle is huge and a little goes a long way, it would be possible to put a couple ounces in a separate bottle with an essential oil blend of my choice if I wanted a scented option.</li>
            <li>I then added stress relieving essential oil to it and use it everyday after my shower and starts my day a little more relaxed.  </li>
            <li>and so it&#x27;s pretty messy when applying.</li>
            <li>This means I cannot use this oil unless I pour directly from the bottle, which can get messy if you don&#x27;t have steady hands.</li>
            <li>It really allows for absorption of other oils and additives!</li>
            <li>It does sit on the skin slightly for a bit, but ends up absorbing in.</li>
            <li>Wow I have used Almond oil in the past and non fractionated coconut oil, this really is so much smoother and silkier for use with essential oils and skin care!  </li>
            <li>Fractionated coconut oil is processed in a way that removes all the long chain fatty acids, leaving only the healthy medium chain fatty acids.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>A promotional sale led me to trying this product from Radha Beauty, and in turn helped me find some of their other skincare products that look to be very promising from other reviewers.</li>

            <li> nice thing about coconut oil is there are so many uses and the oil has a very long shelf life.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is a light-weight product that is perfect for massaging as is, or adding essential oils for topical use.</li>
            <li> The oil came quickly and was packaged well (not over- or under-packaged).  </li>
            <li> I am fascinated that I had never heard of the many uses of coconut oil that can improve so many different things.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and I&#x27;ve also noticed that it does not stain clothing if I quickly use a Clorox wipe on the spot</li>
            <li> love that it has no smell but makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t get oil all over my clothes.</li>

            <li> It quickly absorbs into your skin and not greasy.</li>
            <li> The pump sprayer is super.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> price is great for how much you get, it&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li> and I think that the push-down/pop-up cap is adequate for dispensing the oil.</li>
            <li> I use it to put on my skin and it absorbs really quick.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quick without leaving your hands feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well; absorbs into the skin without leaving a super greasy feeling behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be used for so many different things, oils , skin softening and more...</li>
            <li> Super quick.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>

            <li> It is clear and very easy to work with in DIY beauty/makeup recipes.</li>
            <li> More pleasant to use than ordinary coconut oil, which has a consistency like Crisco and has to be warmed in your hands to become liquid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased especially with the pump feature  </li>
            <li> but it also can be used directly on to the skin to moisturize it specially during winter when our need better hydration.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for that purpose and rubbed into the skin easily.</li>
            <li> The 16 ounce bottle is the perfect size and should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a good stuff for helping dry</li>
            <li> Absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I used it all over my body as a moisturizer and went on smooth, absorbed fast and wasn&#x27;t greasy at all!</li>
            <li> Too early to tell, but so far loving it!  </li>
            <li> After the application, the oil absorbed quickly into my skin leaving no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others that are a smaller bottle for more and between the two, I&#x27;ll be reordering this one again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely make sure to keep this stocked in my house because of its versatility!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love it so far and no problems!</li>
            <li> I use it for massaging on certain people leaves their skin smooth and refresh.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using the oil with my other essential oils and am very pleased with the good price for the amount that I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I do love the coconut scent, but it is fine that there is no scent to clash with the essential oil scent.  </li>
            <li> so she can use as a quick after-shower moisturizer for skin and hair, which works really well because it is a smooth liquid right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Having to be able to put the right on the bottle makes this so easy when I want to mix it with an essential oil and use as a massage lotion on my feet, chest or anywhere on my bottle.</li>
            <li> Amazing  can be used  for  several  things  from hair to skin</li>
            <li> I then use 1 drop of this with 1 drop of Rose Hip Oil for my night moisturizer and in the morning I use 1 drop of this coconut oil for my daily moisturizer before applying my makeup, etc.  </li>
            <li> I applied  “Fractionated Coconut Oil”  which I have received recently with a nice package and start to massage my skin and also my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First try I used a full pump&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Mixing great with my young living essential oils</li>
            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t so tall ( and could it in a tub nicely) I would mix this with some essential oils and add it to the tub to relax.</li>
            <li> My biggest peeve about coconut oil is that it makes you smell like baked goods, so I love that this is completely odourless.</li>
            <li> I would tell anyone who wants a good carrier oil to use with their essential oils to purchase this any</li>
            <li> The quality of the oil is excellent, but I have it 4 stars because the pump was broken when j received my package.</li>
            <li> This cap doesn&#x27;t leak when it is closed, and it is better than many that I have tried, so I have no issues or problems with it at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I  would write a worth while review.</li>
            <li> This oil is great but the pump bottle leaks and is much messier than expected.</li>
            <li> It takes rather longer than a cream or lotion to absorb into your skin, but it will be absorbed.</li>
            <li> I was able to use a coupon code and get mine for free, but will totally but once it runs out!</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed by the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> No noticeable smell, absorbed by my skin without being overly greasy, and</li>
            <li> On top of that I applied it for an hour to my 80 year old</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle because I loved it so much I had to get another</li>
            <li> I love this light coconut oil for mixing with essential oils and making lotions.  </li>
            <li> It was nice mixed in a bath, and also as a hair serum that I would put in my hair and shampoo it out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is truly worth trying and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So nice because it doesn&#x27;t solidify like regular coconut oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to discover some really cool DIY skincare recipes, and most of them call for some type of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Very positive experience.</li>
            <li> Just mix in your favorite blend of essential oils such as lavendar lemon and mint to make your own unique blend.</li>
            <li> name implies, a fraction of the original oil, it still maintains multiple healthy benefits.</li>
            <li> I use it as a carrier oil, hair conditioner, face moisturizer &amp;&amp; many many other uses</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I have been using the regular kind of coconut oil, the kind that has to be warmed to melt to a liquid, for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Got it right on time</li>
            <li> The oil was not greasy at all my skin ate it right up.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> This is not greasy and goes right into my skin and feels like silk.</li>
            <li> but once you put it on it soaked right in.</li>
            <li> Not too oily but just right.  </li>
            <li> You can get dressed right away or hop into bed and not muss your clothes or sheets.  </li>
            <li> It helps the lipsticks to slide right out of the mold without sticking, breaking, or losing product.</li>
            <li> I like that this oil is liquid because it is easier to apply just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> The first bottle was part of a review campaign and the 2nd time was my own purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happy we ended up with the Radha one - it has been great so far, we have made fish and baked goods a number of times and it&#x27;s been a very nice complement - a nice delicate oil that is odorless/tasteless (really!) and does extremely well under high heats.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a free pump, because squeezing or pouring this oil makes a huge mess, and is a pain to do when you are doing massages.</li>
            <li> I think it works really well as a carrier oil-smoothly, and does not have a strong scent so my EO scenes really come through.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer without the heavy feeling and all the yucky additives!</li>
            <li> So I am trying to learn more about essential oils, aromatherapy and using more homemade natural products vs manmade chemicals.</li>
            <li> It sinks right in and is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very very few lines or wringles and the texture of my skin is great.  </li>
            <li> I use doTerra Essential Oil&#x27;s and this product is GREAT... can&#x27;t say enough!  </li>
            <li> Great product, mixed well as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I think coconut oil is a great idea / solution for individuals who aren&#x27;t getting the results from traditional deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> Great oil to use on the skin or mixed with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I really liked that the oil was a liquid and that my dry and brittle hair soaked it up.</li>
            <li> Very surprised by how smooth and non greasy even compared to the reg coconut oil...</li>
            <li> it was very versatile and made me skin super smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I really like this Coconut Oil because most coconut oil tend to turn solid when store in a cool area but the Radha Coconut oil stayed liquid, so</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and with a very pleasant smell very different from a typical coconut oil.</li>
            <li> But the main thing is my feet!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This is very very premium quality product and I will buy it over over again.</li>
            <li> received Radha Beauty’s 100% Pure Argan Oil &amp; Fractionated Coconut Oil complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It mixes quickly and easily and does no solidify like the solid coconut oil does.  </li>
            <li> I am new to fractionated coconut oil, so I wanted to make sure that I received Radha brand, which is high quality, pure, and guaranteed.</li>
            <li> I am a huge believer in using products that are natural.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely softer and in better condition since adding this oil.</li>
            <li> It absorbs faster and more thoroughly than regular coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Comes off like a breeze and leaves face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Because it is fractionated, it is in liquid form instead of solid form, and doesn&#x27;t have any coconut scent like most coconut oils.</li>
            <li> I know many would pay extra to have an organic option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Radha Beauty Product is one of my favorite brand, and I especially like their coconut oil and retinol cream.</li>
            <li> The first time I was given a discount, and I used it up.</li>
            <li> I received this from Radha Beauty and was not quite sure what to do with it initially.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the oil that seeps through the skin keeps the skin soft, smooth, and moist by not letting moisture escape.</li>
            <li> In order to safely apply essential oils to your skin you need a barrier oil to safely dilute the essential oil.</li>
            <li> First of all, I like coconut oil...</li>
            <li> Second, I LOVE radha coconut oil.</li>
            <li> make my skin soft and smooth in seconds.</li>
            <li> it is so much better than regular coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase more products from this company.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> and it really does the job!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Have used it several times and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This has so many different uses.</li>
            <li> There are many different uses.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I do use this as a moisturizer when I get out of the shower and my skin feels so soft, smooth, and supple.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to be a carrier oil but have used it for so much more on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Coconut Oil for my beauty routines.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> But i still love the product and will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I used it for hot oil massage for my hair.</li>
            <li> Feels greasy at first</li>
            <li> There is so many recipes to make homemade personal care products.</li>
            <li> Her skin is soft and smooth without the nastiness of lotion.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this Coconut oil with my essential oils as a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li> Two on the top (on each side of my head), and one in the back.</li>
            <li> so you really get your money&#x27;s worth with the 16oz.</li>
            <li> I found the oil to be exactly what it claimed.  </li>
            <li> It is the first oil I have used that does not coat my skin with a sticky layer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> LOVE using this for my carrier oil for my DIY pain rubs made with essential oils.</li>
            <li> They also emailed me to make sure I as totally happy!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend product and company!</li>
            <li> So far I have used it for a skin moisturizer and after a shower in my hair for a light conditioner.</li>
            <li> starting my oil craze, I did some research on the benefits of coconut oil and its many uses.</li>
            <li> It’s non-staining which is important when used near clothing/bedding.</li>
            <li> healthy results to my skin the following day.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I like this oil because it&#x27;s completely fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It made my prone to dryness legs feel ultra-moisturized and more hydrated than with regular body lotion or body balm.</li>
            <li> first think I notice is that the oil is, indeed, colorless.</li>
            <li> The fractionated coconut oil absorbs nicely and not much is needed.</li>
            <li> You will be able to use it with your regular fragrance.</li>
            <li> The first thing I like this product is odorless and non greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been mixing this product with my daily body cream for more moisture.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> At first I broke out a lot</li>
            <li> It left my skin and my hair super smooth and silky, but no trace of sticky or greasy after all, when I done with massage.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle and convience of pouring out a few drops easily.</li>
            <li> Not really greasy and goes on smooth, washes off easily.</li>

            <li> The included pump is a very nice bonus to say the least.</li>
            <li> My skin and hair are very, very dry and this product has helped greatly without all the chemicals that are in commercial products.</li>
            <li> I use it with some other toner to make my own neck mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fractionated Coconut Oil it is 100% pure with no fillers and comes in a 16 ounce bottle at a very reasonable price.</li>

            <li> My skin feels so super soft!</li>

            <li> Is it OK as a cooking oil as long as the food is not ingested?  </li>

            <li> First let me say that I love when I can use natural products for multiple tasks.</li>
            <li> Radha&#x27;s Coconut Oil does not feel thick and lumpy like some, it is light and smooth, fragrance free, mixes well with my other oils to make an even better moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil as a carrier oil for my new found love of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Due to the way it is processed, fractionated coconut oil has a high concentration of Capric acid and Caprylic acid, which gives it an amazing amount of antioxidant and disinfecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I takes my skin a good half hour to completely soak in to where my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily to the touch.</li>
            <li> Great for dry or sensitive skin because it isn’t greasy and hydrates deep in your pores.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It is very COOOOOOOOOOL ITEM.</li>
            <li> but when making beauty products my one issue is that sometimes the coconut oil hardens too much to make the consistency that i&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li> I used this to make a gentle shaving cream</li>
            <li> Even though my mom put it in the fridge and thought it was for cooking haha</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> No oily build up, unscented, gentle on skin, does not cause breakouts, does not stain clothes or pillowcase.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li> I’ve been looking for a carrier oil for my essential oils and received this coconut oil free* to try and review.</li>
            <li> works really well...</li>
            <li> and i noticed that my mosquito bites on my foot heals fast because of this oil.. must buy oil..</li>
            <li> So much easier to use coconut oil in this liquid form.</li>
            <li> Received it in the mail fast.</li>
            <li> Vendor ( Rahda Beauty Products) shipped fast with no problems.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an unscented oil - very liquid.</li>
            <li> hand, so go gently until you get a feel for this pump - it is inelegant but functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like how this oil absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t give your food that real greasy feel.</li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> although I was kinda worried cause it looks really oily</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It really is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like it for my hair and hands.  </li>
            <li> It is very hydrating</li>
            <li> Really like this oil.</li>
            <li> You can do so much with this oil.</li>
            <li> The oil goes on much nicer than baby oil.</li>
            <li> That also makes the price really reasonable.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a body moisturizer straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li> It is very watery</li>
            <li> Very convenient to have in a pump style</li>
            <li> The benefits of coconut oil is no secret to beauty and skin care aficionados.</li>
            <li> We have really curly hair</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li> Something about it being completely clear is more appeasing to me than the buttery solid jar I had been using.</li>
            <li> Second try I just used a couple of drops, and it still made it look oily - and by the next morning my hair smelled kind of funky, too.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far with a couple of drops of essential oil</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> It is more convenient than the solidified oil, in that it&#x27;s not difficult to use when it gets down to the bottom.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft and smooth for an entire day, which I&#x27;ve only ever experienced with one other product, despite trying almost everything out in the market today.</li>
            <li> The first 2 bottles were leaking and the company sent me 2 new bottles.</li>
            <li> It absorbs right into my skin and feels soft.</li>
            <li> Right when I received I put on my hands and wow</li>
            <li> Very pure and natural.  </li>
            <li> Works great, a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Generally speaking for the majority of purposes I use essential oils, coconut is my all time favorite carrier oil and Radha&#x27;s is just as beneficial as any I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> A chemist friend gave a mini &amp;#34;tutorial&amp;#34; on this oil over coffee and said that a significant reason coconut oil makes the perfect carrier oil is that it&#x27;s molecules are very small, nearly as small as the essential oils so that it doesn&#x27;t hinder the EO from being absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> We use an organic extra virgin coconut oil for pulling (the kind that liquifies in your mouth) and just thought it was really strange to use that one for cooking,</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very generous bottle of high quality FCO and I will be a fan for life.  </li>
            <li> You only have to use very little and that works very effectively.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this provided as many benefits of conventional coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I use a hot iron and ignored my natural &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for my hair, and wish I would have received the free pump as advertised to save on the overall general use of it, but other than that I really like it.</li>
            <li> Radha has great quality products and I will never go back to any other brand for my fractionated coconut oil or lavender essential oil...</li>
            <li> I use it primarily for my dry skin and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> It does not have particular smell and is colorless.</li>
            <li> Given, it melts fairly quickly upon application if warmth is present.</li>
            <li> and I loved that I got a few different emails while it was shipping with extras and updated information.</li>
            <li> If left my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used the coconut oil along with Peppermint essential oil to make him a chest rub to open up his breathing without having to buy products with additional chemicals that I may not be able to pronounce.</li>
            <li> I add it in to my conditioner to make a super hydrated deep treatment.</li>
            <li> , that is Coconut Oil that is mainly for cosmetic uses and not to be used for cooking.</li>
            <li> It can be a very nice massage oil when it is mixed with lavender essential oil or any other scent &amp; does not leave a greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> Overall I feel it is good oil; see my breakdown of pros and cons below, the cons being why I marked it down a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this coconut  oil.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a number of things, including on my skin, cooking (withstands high temperatures), and in aromatherapy sprays and massage oils.</li>
            <li> It’s not so large that I won’t be able to use it up, but it also is not so small that I will use it all up for the first or second time I make something with it.&lt;br /&gt;-Fragrance free, as carrier oil you want your essential oils to stand out and not be overpowered by it.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizes</li>
            <li> This saturation gives it a very, very long shelf life and greatly increased stability (i.e. it will not become rancid for a long long time).</li>
            <li> 100% pure and natural.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> Love this product so far, using it as a essential oil carrier-- use it daily for my face because I am sensitive to like everything else!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my rough heels and with one use, they were smooth again.</li>
            <li> It works to keep my hair soft &amp; tames my frizziness on those very humid days.</li>
            <li> I have also cooked with coconut oil and find my foods taste better without that heavy oil taste.</li>
            <li> I received the product mentioned above complimentary for review and testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I will use it along with my normal organic face moisturizer and as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> Blends so nice and not the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for hair deep treatment and for using just a small amount to smooth hair with, using while hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and is excellent for dry or troubled skin.  </li>
            <li> At nite I put this on feet and hands as a lotion, noticed a big improvment right away.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way which makes this oil very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Also the price is very reasonable with this high quality product and the big portion.</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite large and should last quite awhile because it doesn’t take much to cover the skin.</li>
            <li> my review was not altered due to the free product.</li>
            <li> With the FCO I can use a little on damp hair, and then add more as needed and it makes my hair shiny, soft,</li>
            <li> Without me knowing, my oldest daughter, 9, started using it in the shower and now CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li> I live in TX now.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to using coconut oil</li>
            <li> My new FCO of choice</li>
            <li> I can honesty say that this oil is not only better,but it leaves less of an oily residue and it&#x27;s more reasonably priced and I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been putting this oil directly on my skin as I live in high altitude.  </li>
            <li> There is no odor and is very clear.</li>
            <li> Very soft and velvety.</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft like never before it does wonders in my skin</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft like never before</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and stays moistened all day!</li>
            <li> The coconut oil is exactly what I wanted so that I can make my sugar scrub and essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li> I actually got my first bottle by a promo code from their face book page.</li>
            <li> This oil has no scent which surprised me, I was expecting to smell like a pina colada!</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li> Pretty big bottle!</li>
            <li> Bottle is however a little bit soft - and squeezing it even gently send oil squirting right out the pump nozzle!</li>
            <li> I was using plain old coconut oil as a massage medium, and while it smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t drip (because under A/C it starts out solid), it&#x27;s also greasy and at least for me, comodogenic (pore clogging.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the pump too because it helps me to have a mess free experience.</li>
            <li> There are many different uses for coconut oil and after purchasing I have had less mosquito bites, hair that shines and it can even be used as a suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> Just right for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> so a bit drippy, sorry to say, and I miss the unrefined coconut aroma, but it makes up for those losses by being easy to wash off whatever you need to wash it off of, it&#x27;s light on the skin (no breakouts yet), and sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react to it, if mine is any indication.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase this product again when my initial stock runs out.</li>
            <li> is a definition copied from the web: As the name implies, fractionated coconut oil is a fraction of the coconut oil from which almost all the long chain triglycerides are removed, thus leaving mainly the medium-chain triglycerides and making it an absolutely saturated oil.</li>
            <li> so if you choose to add other essential oils  you can easily do so.</li>
            <li> It works very well with my Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> Packaging:  A clear, plastic bottle with a shampoo bottle-type squeeze lid.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and clear.</li>
            <li> I have been using virgin coconut oil for years, and I really like the convenience of not having to heat and melt the oil, yet I do like an organic product when possible.</li>
            <li> Then I started to get bolder and used it as a detangler for my 7 year old&#x27;s curly mane.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended using coconut oil as a baby moisturizer since babies can have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a reason to invest that much in something when there&#x27;s quality stuff out there for a fourth of the cost.</li>
            <li> It left my hair absolutely frizz.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> And with a LIFETIME MONEY BACK GUARANTEE you have absolutely nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and can be used for lots of different things.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is a natural beauty product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking this product so far.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li> I use it in a mixture of natural oils I use in my hair and as a moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> and my beard is soft.</li>
            <li> Regular coconut oil can go rancid and expires much faster.  </li>
            <li> I even bought roller bottles and fixed my Mom some.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it to help my daughter&#x27;s cradle cap, clear up her diaper rash, and as a moisturizer on my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues using it so far.</li>
            <li> has no scent,very light,all natural.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference this has made.</li>
            <li> The company offers a 100%-Make</li>
            <li> I have used it for frying (spray on pans), oil directly on skin and then rinse off while in the shower, and as a cuticle softener.  </li>
            <li> It always removes any makeup and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> makes mixing with essential oils so much easier</li>
            <li> As I have been with all of the Radha products so far.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft after shaving.</li>
            <li> This is among my favorites so far.</li>
            <li> I have used this coconut oil in place of dimethicone as a natural alternative for my lipstick molds.</li>
            <li> It does not clog your pores and has natural antioxidants with disinfecting properties.</li>
            <li> Really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Though I used the product only for few days I was able to see the difference.</li>
            <li> Not bad long enough to tell if it works but have been told it does</li>
            <li> It sinks right into my skin and leaves it fragrance-free</li>
            <li> The oil provides just the right amount of barrier to protect the skin from the essential oils (EO&#x27;s are typically recommended to be used with a carrier oil), yet light enough to allow the Essential Oils to penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li> Main use is for a carrier oil for my essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount, about the size of a quarter at most, is needed.</li>
            <li> A lot of care is invested by the founders to not only ensure that high standards are met,  but to also educate the consumer.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality product I definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product to someone looking for coconut oil who may want to skimp on the &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; factor.</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I hoped and expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> First of all fractionated is not pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> The hard kind tended to make my hair too greasy if I wasn&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> I will get back to you as I discover and try new ways to use Radha Beauty Coconut Oil. .</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at all the different things you can use this for.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how big the bottle was.</li>
            <li> I received a little ebook about the product and many of its other health benefits and uses.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> Just as expected, large bottle, no damage.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> I bought this Fractionated Coconut Oil(FCO) to use with my Young Living Essential Oils in roller ball bottles as well as general application.</li>
            <li> No regrets in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It is a completely neutral oil so that the fragrance of any essential oil added to it isn&#x27;t changed at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used this directly on the dryest parts of my skin and it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t get any residue on my clothes.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful trying to use it because you get so much out at once.</li>
            <li> I have been using it with multiple oils both in roller balls and direct application by hand.  </li>
            <li> My arms and legs feel soft and the skin looks younger and fresher than before.</li>
            <li> As a natural brunette, I&#x27;m about six months in on my journey to achieving white / platinum hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that this oil, was an actual oil, and I didn&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;warm</li>
            <li> I use it all over, especially on knees, elbows, and sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful trying to use it because you get so much out at once.</li>
            <li> Its an ideal carrier oil &amp; base for DIY beauty products ... like a sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> I like to put this on right out of shower while my skin is still a little damp.</li>
            <li> The slight scent of coconut oil the day after was a little more pronounced</li>
            <li> My super fried/bleached hair started feeling soft again after only a few days use!</li>
            <li> I have used a few other different brands in the past, but this is hands down the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of psoriasis and this is very soothing, non irritating.</li>
            <li> and they said they would send one right out use a few drops in hair conditioner</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs right in, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy, and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> My scalp it less irritated when I use this oil as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I have also been using it straight without adding any other oils as a skin soother for my leg where I burned myself.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a whole other</li>
            <li> but I am trying new things to improve my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I did not receive my free pump as stated.</li>
            <li> It has everything you would want in a fractionated oil - while we use ours in the kitchen it can be used for tons and tons of other things and as it&#x27;s light / pure it won&#x27;t ever feel heavy or greasy/ gunky like some others with lots of other fillers can feel.</li>
            <li> Since the bottle is huge and a little goes a long way, it would be possible to put a couple ounces in a separate bottle with an essential oil blend of my choice if I wanted a scented option.</li>
            <li> I then added stress relieving essential oil to it and use it everyday after my shower and starts my day a little more relaxed.  </li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s pretty messy when applying.</li>
            <li> This means I cannot use this oil unless I pour directly from the bottle, which can get messy if you don&#x27;t have steady hands.</li>
            <li> It really allows for absorption of other oils and additives!</li>
            <li> It does sit on the skin slightly for a bit, but ends up absorbing in.</li>
            <li> Wow I have used Almond oil in the past and non fractionated coconut oil, this really is so much smoother and silkier for use with essential oils and skin care!  </li>
            <li> Fractionated coconut oil is processed in a way that removes all the long chain fatty acids, leaving only the healthy medium chain fatty acids.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> A promotional sale led me to trying this product from Radha Beauty, and in turn helped me find some of their other skincare products that look to be very promising from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The biggest change I noticed was the lack of frizz that normally appears halfway down from my roots.</li>
            <li> Because of the purity of this oil, I find it ideal for use as a base oil combined with any other essential oils</li>
            <li> The pure oil has a long list of triglycerides that are mostly removed when the oil is fractionated, but the medium-chain triglycerides remain making it a saturated oil, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I used on my hair as well, then flat ironed it the next day.  </li>
            <li> Just slather some on your face, massage it in, then take a hot wet washcloth and steam your face a little with it then wipe off.</li>
            <li> Super dry skin and dry hair are always challenging for me and it become worse and worse day by day.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> In this time period, my hair had become dry, brittle, and damaged enough that my mom noticed through a FaceTime video call.</li>
            <li> He is constantly scratching his head because of the dry skin.</li>
            <li> Although it did not cause any break outs it made my face dry and red and did not seem to help the acne.</li>
            <li> Some have proven very helpful in fighting dry skin but as I have aged it has gotten harder and harder to find a moisturizer that truly works.  </li>
            <li> and she loves it, makes her skin very soft and moist and not all dried up and cracked.</li>
            <li> Coconut is the new black!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and would not trade my curls for anything, but I am also very active, even in the heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> Extremely hydrating when mixed with hair care, essential oils and skin care products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly not greasy and fast absorbing, leaving behind a soft feeling on the skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> I only realized this when i was looking for the bottle a few days later and realized she had left it in her bathroom and had claimed it as hers and won&#x27;t let the rest of us use it!</li>
            <li> and it has a long shelf</li>
            <li> and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I do believe this is the healthiest my hair has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my 11 month old when she gets a little dry</li>
            <li> One side benefit I&#x27;ve recently just determined is that coconut oil is the least likely to stain and not nearly as hard on sheets as other carrier oils.</li>
            <li> As such, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test it out on other things like cooking, etc</li>
            <li> One side of the bottle says &amp;#34;for external use only.&amp;#34; The other side of the bottle states that the oil can be used for cooking.</li>
            <li> but you can get coconut oil that is unflavored as well, like what I received from Radha, but I use that type for other uses outside the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ..will make other beauty products last longer..</li>
            <li> It has a very long shelf life and does not go</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry hands and my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This feather-light coconut carrier oil heals and softens damaged and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also put it in my hair once a week for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Use it on all dry skin areas .....</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from being over dry as is often the case.</li>
            <li> The next day his cold seemed better and he was less whiny, score Dany.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coconut oil is an emollient, a humectant - you can use it as a moisturizer all over your body, including your face - not slathering it on like a suntan oil - but judiciously applying it to dry areas.</li>
            <li> Just what my dry skin was craving.</li>
            <li> I have oil face and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use on my dry hands and cuticles too.</li>
            <li> I have been amazed at how much make up has been left behind with just soap and water washing.</li>
            <li> You have to use very very little of this stuff in any DIY recipe that I have found so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since only a small amount is needed for any application, this bottle is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes such a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product faithfully in the morning, they are making my stretch marks look pink prior to use they were dark brown</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this oil with my normal body lotion everyday.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the Radha Beauty Fractionated Coconut Oil because my skin has become very dry in the winter time.</li>
            <li> Very dry here.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, BUT the pump sucks on this!</li>
            <li> but you only need a little dab.</li>
            <li> and it gets real dry.</li>
            <li> The free pump was missing parts, so it was useless.  </li>
            <li> I use a few pumps of this and a couple of drops of essential oil to use as a massage oil.</li>
            <li> Oil arrived sooner than expected and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> (Big warning however for those unlucky few with nut allergies.  </li>
            <li> i can definitely tell a difference in my skin after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the pump.  </li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a rough winter</li>
            <li> I used this in a pre-shampoo treatment mixed with 2 parts fractionated coconut oil, 1 part argan oil, and a few drops of peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I also want to say that a little bit of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also use it to remove smeared eye makeup, among other things.</li>
            <li> I have been using it as a makeup remover but haven&#x27;t tried other uses for it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other uses of this product</li>
            <li> My husband thinks it tastes slightly different from the other coconut oil I usually buy</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I blended this oil with other carrier oils to be used as a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Fractionated Coconut Oil does not go rancid &amp; it can prevent other oils from going rancid as well.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount several times @ day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily like other oils.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to continuing to use this in other blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen other coconut oil bottles that are of glass or with a dispensing pop up cap.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other things with this.</li>
            <li> it mixes with other oils....</li>
            <li> I have been adding it to my green and grey clay for my body wraps</li>
            <li> It would work well as a carrier oil for any other therapeutic oils.</li>
            <li> that other oils that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It is non greasy like other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> There are a multitude of uses for this oil - it can be used alone on the hair and skin, as a massage oil, as a carrier oil, and can be used to make soaps, lotions, and other cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> I have tried other coconut oil before and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Stays liquid no matter the temp, unlike the other type of coconut oil I use (which is for food intake).</li>
            <li> I have used two other types of coconut oil and this one has no scent, unlike the others.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like any coconut smell, but he like this oil after we do massage to each other after bath.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not greasy like other coconut oils that I have used before.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it as is for moisturizing, and sometimes I mix it up with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> have very dry flaky skin in the winter , this has made a big difference no more itching and no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wear sandals everyday and my heels are normaly so dry and cracked, just a couple days</li>
            <li> I have used the oil for many things from mixing with and applying the essential oils for allergies, massage and even insect repellent.  </li>
            <li> A tiny amount covers all my hair and I have long, thick hair (at least halfway down my back).</li>
            <li> it is less than $1 an ounce, and a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it’s important to know they won’t go bad</li>
            <li> consuming this  would then become internal, which is confusing to me.  </li>
            <li> Also use the slightest amount in my hair while damp and it calmed down.</li>
            <li> I doused each part in the coconut oil, focusing halfway and moving down towards my ends.</li>
            <li> (this has only happened once and it was a very small spot.)</li>
            <li> about two and a half weeks ago I had a baby about 3 months ago, after birth I started getting stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The coconut oil is soothing, whereas the babyoil I was previously using would sting my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This coconut oil has a slight scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more dry skin!</li>
            <li> The picture attached is of the front of my hair on day two after the oil had been applied, a 3 mile walk with the dogs, and an hour and a half of working in the yard (which is why I am covered in leaves as well).</li>
            <li> But this is obviously a company that isn&#x27;t just churning out vats of this stuff for a big profit.  </li>
            <li> Makes homemade lotions and body butters much less greasy.  </li>
            <li> However, it is half the price for twice the amount of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for a friend who has very dry skin and because she is on blood thinners and cannot rub cream into her skin without breaking small blood vessels under her skin.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs in nicely as long as the skin is at least damp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of packing, the bottle was tightly sealed and had a protective foil seal to prevent leakage.</li>
            <li> I use a little to remove make up at night.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my hair a little greasy looking (not shinny looking).  </li>
            <li> but I do use it as a moisturizer I also use it as an exfoliants by mixing sugar with a little bit of the coconut oil after I&#x27;m done  cleansing my body I do use the sugar scrub I just made with the coconut oil and it leaves my skin supersoft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little runny...</li>
            <li> there were lots of small residues in the oil compare to other brand I used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so a little goes along ways.</li>
            <li> A little movement on the pump produces a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Also the fact that it doesn&#x27;t solidify in the cold makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> I left the coconut oil for about 2 hours, and rinsed it out using a standard shampoo and cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you remove all of your make up, including your mascara, take a cotton round with some of this and go over your face.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t waste the oil.</li>
            <li> A few friends do this and have the whitest teeth.  </li>
            <li> I use this coconut oil everyday to moisturize and massage.</li>
            <li> I have received a few products from Radha, and each and every one has prompted me to continue using their products.</li>
            <li> Not greasy,no heavy feel</li>
            <li> From now on, we&#x27;re using this instead of the messy baby oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also can just get a thin layer with this compared to regular coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I also use it plain, as an everyday skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The brand that I usually runs for about $30 for half of this amount.</li>
            <li> and I received it in less than 48 hours!  </li>
            <li> and so this bottle will last a crazy long time.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li> There is no oil slick left behind as you get with baby oil.</li>
            <li> but every time I became more disappointed!</li>
            <li> What a mess!  </li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> I noticed it helped a lot with ingrowns and even my waxer noticed the hair was coming out much easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> , coconut oil usually comes in a jar which makes it really messy.</li>
            <li> Neat little e-book sent by email too, thank you!</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if any girls who get brazilians will be reading this</li>
            <li> Using a small amount I worked it into my arms, elbows, knees and legs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you can cook with fractionated coconut oil</li>
            <li> I might mention the company if something out the ordinary happens.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t come with the much needed and wanted pump, disappointed.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to work with.</li>
            <li> And, the cost is minimal compared to the cost of expensive eye creams, shaving gels, body scrubs, etc.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment is the pump does not work which I suspect was damaged during shipping.</li>
            <li> No nutritional value rather use extra virgin cold pressed coconut oil</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overally greasy and didn&#x27;t make my thin hair limp.</li>
            <li> My next plan will be to use it as a carrier oil and a base for other products I make.  </li>
            <li> Fractionated Coconut Oil is very versatile and can be used for anything from bug repellent to hair serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and isn&#x27;t overly thin.</li>
            <li> I have bad dry skin.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil and hemp oil are my go-to options for body moisturizing, as it is hard and expensive to find a hypo-allergenic, cruelty-free vegan body lotion.</li>
            <li> My skin was beginning to get that thin, crepey look</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, is broken.</li>
            <li> No more!!!</li>
            <li> But unfortunately It does not come with it.</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> This is a guilty futon cover.</li>
            <li> silly as that sounds.</li>
            <li> What chore, not happy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The pump that came with the bottle was difficult to operate, in terms of use.</li>
            <li> I have very tough skin.</li>
            <li> Very thin but had not cocnut smell.</li>
            <li> It consistency is very thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue once rubbed in.    </li>
            <li> I had a cold</li>
            <li> and my husband is obsessed!  </li>
            <li> but I was afraid it would smell like coconuts (a smell that makes me sick) or not even absorb.</li>
            <li> plastic bottle which is bad for all types of oil, from the research</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave yo ugreasy or a nasty residue behind.</li>
            <li> hubby who is sick (the sickest he has ever been,like every time)</li>
            <li> have NEVER been disappointed by Radha Beauty Products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am using it as a base oil for massages etc.</li>
            <li> Lowered my rating when I remembered the shipping was outrageous.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> received the oil about two and a half weeks ago I had a baby about 3 months ago, after birth I started getting stretch marks. I&#x27;ve used the product faithfully in the morning, they are making my stretch marks look pink prior to use they were dark brown thank you so much for this amazing product and I will be buying some more very soon!</li>
            <li> great coconut oil..highly recommended</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this oil with my normal body lotion everyday. The oil gives the moisturizer/lotion an extra boost of moisture and hydration. I love this oil No smell, no greasy oil feeling.... just super moisture. My skin is definitely softer and in better condition since adding this oil. I have also used this oil in my bath for a luxurious feeling.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and the size.</li>
            <li> Yes, I got the ebooks that were sent with the product. Very informative. I love the fractionated coconut oil. My skin and hair are very, very dry and this product has helped greatly without all the chemicals that are in commercial products. It absorbs faster and more thoroughly than regular coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Very Impressive.  I use a little to remove make up at night.  Comes off like a breeze and leaves face soft and smooth.  I then use 1 drop of this with 1 drop of Rose Hip Oil for my night moisturizer and in the morning I use 1 drop of this coconut oil for my daily moisturizer before applying my makeup, etc.  The results have been marvelous.....I have very very few lines or wringles and the texture of my skin is great.  I also use this after a shower and my skin feels smooth and fresh.  This oil really penetrates the skin without the oily residue.  I have also cooked with coconut oil and find my foods taste better without that heavy oil taste. Much easier to digest.  This product is great....I highly recommend. Oh yea, did I mention I am over 65?  No regrets in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I use it on my dry hands and my daughter&#x27;s hair. It says external use only.  But the label also says it can be used for cooking.  consuming this  would then become internal, which is confusing to me.  for this reason I plan to only use it as described above (External use) as a safety precaution.</li>
            <li> Totally love it, is odorless like it says it doesn&#x27;t dry out and works wonders, use it to give a well deserved massage to my husband and he loved it... I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great product, works well, smells great goes on smooth and silky, makes my skin glow and feel moisturized without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome quality! It is really pure and can be used for just about anything. Something about it being completely clear is more appeasing to me than the buttery solid jar I had been using. I use it for cooking and it works wonderfully. My girlfriend asked me for a bottle so she can use as a quick after-shower moisturizer for skin and hair, which works really well because it is a smooth liquid right out of the bottle. A promotional sale led me to trying this product from Radha Beauty, and in turn helped me find some of their other skincare products that look to be very promising from other reviewers. Radha Beauty has my recommendation!</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 100% Fure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I have ordered Radha Beauty Coconut Oil  from Amazon. The first bottle was part of a review campaign and the 2nd time was my own purchase. I love the Radha Coconut Oil, because it is of superior quality which allows me to use it in a variety of ways. My favorite is using one table spoon coconut oil and one table spoon being soda for a facial exfoliating rub that leaves your skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moisturized. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Fractionated coconut oil is saturated oil. Fractionated coconut oil is processed in a way that removes all the long chain fatty acids, leaving only the healthy medium chain fatty acids. Due to the way it is processed, fractionated coconut oil has a high concentration of Capric acid and Caprylic acid, which gives it an amazing amount of antioxidant and disinfecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that it is the greatest thing for softening summer sandal feet. Turns out It is the greatest massage oil EVER!!! No sticky or oily residue and feels like silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used in number of ways, like Cooking, Skin, Hair, Insect bites, Sunscreen, Lip, Feet etc..... Total thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given Fractionated coconut oil for free for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with what I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s light weight&lt;br /&gt;2. Being Fractionated, it holds a liquid form making use very convenient&lt;br /&gt;3. Has zero coconut scent&lt;br /&gt;4. Cost-it is less than $1 an ounce, and a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a light-weight product that is perfect for massaging as is, or adding essential oils for topical use. The oil provides just the right amount of barrier to protect the skin from the essential oils (EO&#x27;s are typically recommended to be used with a carrier oil), yet light enough to allow the Essential Oils to penetrate the skin. Because it is fractionated, it is in liquid form instead of solid form, and doesn&#x27;t have any coconut scent like most coconut oils. It is a completely neutral oil so that the fragrance of any essential oil added to it isn&#x27;t changed at all. A little bit goes a long way which makes this oil very cost effective. Additionally, I was just pricing a competitive product at the pharmacy today that was priced much higher, so I believe this is an excellent value for the size of the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enhancements I would like to see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would personally like to see this offered in an organic or virgin organic option. I have been using virgin coconut oil for years, and I really like the convenience of not having to heat and melt the oil, yet I do like an organic product when possible. I know many would pay extra to have an organic option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would pay the extra for a glass container. Many people are removing plastic from their daily lives now, so a different container option would be awesome too.  I received this product at a reduced rate for my unbiased opinion and review.  I love this and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love that it is not greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to discover some really cool DIY skincare recipes, and most of them call for some type of coconut oil. Fractionated coconut oil has been best for me in lotions, serums, and deep conditioners for my hair. You have to use very very little of this stuff in any DIY recipe that I have found so far and so this bottle will last a crazy long time.&lt;br /&gt;Having a pump is a bonus since many bottles of coconut oil do not come with it. It&#x27;s nice to be able to just pump some out when I need it. I&#x27;ve actually used this directly on the dryest parts of my skin and it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t get any residue on my clothes. You definitely don&#x27;t want to slather it right before you lay down or put on clothes because it is much more potent than whatever you&#x27;re using now most likely.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good purchase and when you get it, just do a quick search online for recipes and you&#x27;ll find dozens and dozens that you can start preparing right away.  I received this coconut oil at a promotional price in order to test it and review, and this is my honest opinion after using this product.</li>
            <li> My bottle did not have the pump, but I think it would be a great option.  I received a coupon for testing this item.  I have been using the fractionated coconut oil to remove my eye makeup.  The coconut oil is soothing, whereas the babyoil I was previously using would sting my eyes.  My lashes also look more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;After you remove all of your make up, including your mascara, take a cotton round with some of this and go over your face.  I have been amazed at how much make up has been left behind with just soap and water washing.</li>
            <li> This is a great beauty product to add to your essential oils.This product arrived just as described , it was packaged perfectly and arrived quickly and in perfect condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a organic fractionated coconut oil of premium coconut carrier oil for massage, essential oils and aromatherapy.This feather-light coconut carrier oil heals and softens damaged and dry skin. This product is  100% pure, non GMO and batch tested for ultra purity. The result is  the worlds finest fractionated coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product I have tried it and it does as it claims , my skin is softer .I have very dry flaky skin in the winter , this has made a big difference no more itching and no more dry skin. I also had my husband give me a massage with this and oh my what a glorious experience .The feel and aroma was amazing .This is one of those perfect oils to own and add to your beauty routine .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> This coconut oil has a slight scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;I have included a full video review for this product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with everything that contains coconut. I buy snacks, milk, body and skin products that contains coconut. This oil is the best; I use it for my skin after I shower, my hair and face when going to sleep. I love the way it moisturizes my skin and leaves it so healthy and shiny. LOVE LOVE THIS OIL!</li>
            <li> The coconut oil is a very nice product to use as a massaging oil and to use with essential oils.  It has no smell and is colorless. .I have not yet used this as a cooking oil but I intend to.  I received Fractionated Coconut Oil at a reduced price for a honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Seems to be of high quality. Nice to have the pump.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I cut my essential oils with fractionated coconut and put them in roll on bottles. I have used a few other different brands in the past, but this is hands down the best I&#x27;ve used. Radha has great quality products and I will never go back to any other brand for my fractionated coconut oil or lavender essential oil...both are wonderful and I highly suggest them!</li>
            <li> Radha Beauty Product is one of my favorite brand, and I especially like their coconut oil and retinol cream. The first time I was given a discount, and I used it up. So I purchased the second bottle. I used this after bath, and it keeps my skin moisturizing. It does not have particular smell and is colorless. I recommend this great product.</li>
            <li> Love coconut oil all around my house--the liquid is great for moisturizing skin and hair.  This liquid form is great after showering!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I love when I can use natural products for multiple tasks. I happen to adore coconut oil. However, I am obviously in the minority of people who do not care for the scent of coconut oil. This is why I truly adore the fractionated coconut oil. NO SCENT!! It&#x27;s great for moisturizing my dry skin, without leaving an oily residue. It sinks right into my skin and leaves it fragrance-free so I can put on perfume without having the clash of fragrances. I also use it to remove smeared eye makeup, among other things. Love it, love it, love it!!</li>
            <li> On time and great product. Very happy</li>
            <li> Great product! Loved it!</li>
            <li> Great product, not greasy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Love the oil and easy pump is awesome</li>
            <li> Works great, a little bit goes a long way and I don&#x27;t have to reapply often</li>
            <li> Got it right on time and it&#x27;s just as advertised. I&#x27;m a happy shopper.</li>
            <li> I received this from Radha Beauty and was not quite sure what to do with it initially. I have terribly dry skin and used it as an after-shower moisturizer and absolutely loved it! My skin was soft and smooth for an entire day, which I&#x27;ve only ever experienced with one other product, despite trying almost everything out in the market today. Then I started to get bolder and used it as a detangler for my 7 year old&#x27;s curly mane. Worked like a charm! The slight scent of coconut oil the day after was a little more pronounced but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering. Without me knowing, my oldest daughter, 9, started using it in the shower and now CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT. I only realized this when i was looking for the bottle a few days later and realized she had left it in her bathroom and had claimed it as hers and won&#x27;t let the rest of us use it! As such, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test it out on other things like cooking, etc but so far, 5 Stars for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I love this product for massage therapy. It never leaves the client oily and soaks into the skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s great-not greasy. You only need a little bit, goes a long way. Leaves your skin so soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> I use coconut  oil  for everything  and this is by far my favorite! Super easy to use and get out  of  the  bottle. High quality. Love it!</li>
            <li> The oil is awesome!  It is so easy to mix drops of essential oils with it and then spread it on your body.  No greasy feel at all.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil, and this brand is just as great. I love that it comes with a free pump, because squeezing or pouring this oil makes a huge mess, and is a pain to do when you are doing massages. I use a few pumps of this and a couple of drops of essential oil to use as a massage oil. This is a great oil for making your own beauty products too. You can mix this some sugar, and essential oils and you have an amazing body scrub that helps you to have your own spa day. My favorite oil is lavender but you can use your favorite.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous carrier oil! Alone it&#x27;s also heavenly! The best I&#x27;ve purchased. Feels silky smooth on and serves its purpose. Great for massage used with Radha&#x27;s other fabulous oils! I&#x27;m totally in love with Radha Beauty!</li>
            <li> Love this oil!!! It works very well with my Young Living Essential Oils. Very soft and velvety.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed with my essential oils!</li>
            <li> First of all fractionated is not pure coconut oil. Never will I not only not purchase this item again  I will ensure that people know what fractionated means</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast. I ordered this to use with my essential oils. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell and it works wonders with my receipes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to begin with this review. This is such an amazing product that is so versatile &amp; can be used in hundreds of different ways! Having it in liquid form is much more convenient than in its natural state.&lt;br /&gt;Radha Beauty Products LLC provided me this item for me to try &amp; to review honestly. I was not paid for my review &amp; my review was not altered due to the free product.</li>
            <li> I use it as a massage oil, a carrier oil for EO, and as a moisturizer.  GREAT stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I use essential oils. The brand that I usually runs for about $30 for half of this amount. This product works just as well. I love using it as a carrier oil. Also, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. My doctor recommended using coconut oil as a baby moisturizer since babies can have extremely sensitive skin. It worked very well for that purpose and rubbed into the skin easily. Plus, it smells awesome. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This had great reviews and I agree. I mix it in with my lotion for a great feel. I read it has a lot of health benefits. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I got this product to try for free and i am in love with it. I had so many things that I wanted to use it for but so far it has become my kitchen&#x27;s best friend. I used it to cook for the last 4 days in a row. Regular coconut oil is solid. Given, it melts fairly quickly upon application if warmth is present. The fractionated oil comes in liquid form and stays in liquid form. Its perfect and a wonderful use for cooking instead of vegetable oil. I want to put it in a spray bottle with some essential oils next and try it on my hair. I only wish it had come in a larger bottle. I am trying to conserve it. I have two huge containers of coconut oil from costco but they&#x27;re not like this. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone. Regular coconut oil will never be the same after using this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of the pump that is shown in the picture ... Makes it easier to use. But unfortunately It does not come with it. Not sure why but sure makes it seem that way from the picture !</li>
            <li> I bought this Fractionated Coconut Oil(FCO) to use with my Young Living Essential Oils in roller ball bottles as well as general application. I chose the Radha FCO because of the high quality, the price and most importantly the pump attachment. I haven&#x27;t taken off the pump attachment since I got the bottle! It&#x27;s perfect for filling the small-mouth of the roller bottle. So far so good, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> Oil arrived sooner than expected and was well packaged. Love the pump that came with it. Makes it so easy to use. Mixes well with my essential oils, in my hair as leave in deep conditioner and daily on my skin. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of days, I can see an improvement in the condition of my hair.  I would definitely recommend this product for dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, Love it!!!!!!!! You can use coconut oil for so MANY things! I did get this item for free, but my opinion is 100% honest!</li>
            <li> The oil came quickly and was packaged well (not over- or under-packaged).  Can only comment on the one use I&#x27;ve had with the oil - as a skin conditioner (lotion)... and it is really nice!  Just as described, it&#x27;s not greasy and has no odor.  I&#x27;m planning to use it as a carrier oil for some aromatherapy oils and may have more comments then (and be able to give it 5 stars...?).  I think for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it - I looked at doTerra FCO, and it was *expensive*.  I don&#x27;t see a reason to invest that much in something when there&#x27;s quality stuff out there for a fourth of the cost.</li>
            <li> It’s lightweight that provides a barrier on skin that won’t clog your pores. Great for dry or sensitive skin because it isn’t greasy and hydrates deep in your pores. 100% pure and natural.I love coconut oil for everything! This is a great product that is already a liquid so you have to be careful trying to use it because you get so much out at once. best! best!best!</li>
            <li> This is a great oil at a great price.  I use it to dilute my essential oils and fill rollerballs.  I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have use this for skin and hair. So far so good for 5 days usage.</li>
            <li> Great oil. I&#x27;ve purchased it twice already.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the pump.</li>
            <li> My wife uses the product and tells me her skin feels better than anything she has ever used in her 77 years. I am fascinated that I had never heard of the many uses of coconut oil that can improve so many different things. We are both now taking it as a health suppliment.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Coconut massage oil is a marvelous gift from nature for our skin. During a massage, as the skin is rubbed with oil and the muscles are subjected to light pressure, they are agitated and the blood circulation below the skin and in the muscles is stimulated. This increased circulation brings more oxygen to tissues and the tissues are revitalized, speeding up healing and growth. This increases the rate of metabolism as well. Furthermore, the oil that seeps through the skin keeps the skin soft, smooth, and moist by not letting moisture escape. This oil collected under the skin, when it reacts with sunlight, also aids in the formation of Vitamin-D. I love this product for my massages and I also use it to clean my fresh eggs from my hens.</li>
            <li> Not Greasy! I use it with some other toner to make my own neck mask. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality coconut oil. I use it to make roller bottles with essential oils. It is a very good buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to make my Seasonal Allergy rollers to sell at my local Farmer&#x27;s Market.&lt;br /&gt;Also...I use to remove make-up, moisturize my hair, cuticles...etc.&lt;br /&gt;The pump work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Buy it!</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own fragrance for my reed diffusers. It is fantastic at holding the scent of my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Super dry skin and dry hair are always challenging for me and it become worse and worse day by day.  Having a good oil is always essential in order to fighting with dryness though. I applied  “Fractionated Coconut Oil”  which I have received recently with a nice package and start to massage my skin and also my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It was a phenomenal odorless and colorless oil, helpful for a gentle massage with a ideal absorption time. It left my skin and my hair super smooth and silky, but no trace of sticky or greasy after all, when I done with massage. It is a natural and very safe moisturizer, softener which is a multipurpose carrier oil. Best of all, it doesn’t leave any coconut smell on my skin or my hair which is nice!  I have to apply a lots of treatments before styling my hair to control its frizz and dryness. I tried all kinds of conditioner, oils, deep conditioning treatment and so on to treat my hair dryness and frangibility but every time I became more disappointed! I started out putting it on my roots and scalp and massaging it into your hair. The very best point of it was the oil has no scent and it is non greasy and my hair didn’t look oily after using it. It left my hair absolutely frizz.&lt;br /&gt;My skin and hair,both look so shinny, healthy, super-soft, and refresh now! Many thanks to “Fractionated Coconut Oil” .</li>
            <li> Very good product and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I use it as a moisturizer.  It leaves my skin smooth with no odor.  I&#x27;ve given this as a gift, too!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I use a lot of essential oils in our home, and often times we do apply them to our skin.  In order to safely apply essential oils to your skin you need a barrier oil to safely dilute the essential oil. This Fractionated Coconut Oil, by Radha Beauty is perfect for this as it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feel behind.  It has a light, silky feel and I personally like that it has no odor. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and is excellent for dry or troubled skin.  I often use it to remove make-up, and it&#x27;s perfect when my girls decide to play dress-up, I can easily remove the makeup from their face without using anything toxic.  I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to try a Fractionated Coconut Oil with no fillers or additives.  And with a LIFETIME MONEY BACK GUARANTEE you have absolutely nothing to lose.  Shipping was super quick too!  (**our product did not come with a pump, so I can&#x27;t tell you if it works or not.

            <li> I love that this oil doesn&#x27;t have a scent, absorbs quickly, and makes my skin very soft!  Pump is a must! I will definately purchase again!</li>
            <li> One side of the bottle says &amp;#34;for external use only.&amp;#34; The other side of the bottle states that the oil can be used for cooking. Which is it? Is it OK as a cooking oil as long as the food is not ingested?  update from Radha Beauty Products:  &amp;#34;While you can cook with the Fractionated Coconut Oil, the intended use for ours is for your hair and skin.  We put that it is &amp;#34;intended for external use only&amp;#34; because it is a beauty product.  We have had several of our customers say they have cooked with it and like it.  But again, we sell it as a beauty product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have locks and I am using it on my hair at the moment and I love the way it makes my hair feel.  I was having a problem with dryness but this helps a lot.  The fact that it is non greasy is a plus.</li>
            <li> good product and good price</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil.  I use it as a moisturizer all over my body.  I also put it in my hair once a week for dry hair.  It does leave my hair a little greasy looking (not shinny looking).  I use it on my hair at night and wash it in the morning.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> WOW!  I didn&#x27;t even know fractionated coconut oil (FCO for short) existed.  I have been using the regular kind of coconut oil, the kind that has to be warmed to melt to a liquid, for a long time.  When I discovered, and ordered Rhadha Beauty Fractionated Coconut Oil I had no clue at the time how it was about to change my life!  I use a hot iron and ignored my natural &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; hair until I started using fractionated oil.  The hard kind tended to make my hair too greasy if I wasn&#x27;t careful.  With the FCO I can use a little on damp hair, and then add more as needed and it makes my hair shiny, soft, and I tossed the hot iron for good!  I can finally embrace my hair!  It is healthier and looks better than it has in a long time.  Skin benefits too --  I slather it all over my body after showering and my skin has never been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are MANY uses and I plan on exploring all FCO has to offer in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very generous bottle of high quality FCO and I will be a fan for life.  THANK YOU Radha Beauty!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I like coconut oil... Second, I LOVE radha coconut oil. It&#x27;s very lightweight and can be used for lots of different things. I love using it on my hair for moisture and also my skin, it&#x27;s also a healthier choice for cooking. It comes packaged very nicely and I love the design of the bottle! An the free pump! Another winner from radha beauty!</li>
            <li> I used to buy the solid coconut oil in the jar, I was looking on Amazon and  found this great beauty product. I really like its already a liquid and comes with a pump which is a great bonus. I use this for my face, hair and skin. Coconut oil is a natural beauty product. Will definitely purchase again. Great product.</li>
            <li> Really good product great for massages.</li>
            <li> great product I will deffinatly buy it again</li>
            <li> I have been putting this oil directly on my skin as I live in high altitude.  My skin feels so smooth.  I even tried it in my hair to take frizz out, which works wonderfully although I need to put it in a spray bottle to spritz on rather than using hands so I don&#x27;t get that greasy look.</li>
            <li> First try I used a full pump&#x27;s worth.  What a mess!  I had to rewash my hair.  Second try I just used a couple of drops, and it still made it look oily - and by the next morning my hair smelled kind of funky, too.  A couple of drops on my face before I go to bed seems to be okay, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll use it for.  I guess for $10 I now own a hundred year supply!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking this product so far.  I like how it is odorless and it&#x27;s in a liquid form.  I have been using it as a makeup remover but haven&#x27;t tried other uses for it.  I really like how it comes with a pump so it&#x27;s easy to dispense.  I only use a tiny bit of amount and place it on a cotton ball/pad.  It is also not as greasy looking as the coconut oil I use, which also solidifies.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other uses of this product and I am satisfied.  Disclaimer:  This product was received for free for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Incredible !!!! Best buy ever !!! make my skin soft and smooth in seconds. I am customer for life</li>
            <li> I really like the product, BUT the pump sucks on this! It shoots all over the place so you have to hold it close to your hand! It is more convenient than the solidified oil, in that it&#x27;s not difficult to use when it gets down to the bottom. Lol... I have to use a spoon to get it out...I use coconut oil on my skin, hair, and teeth. I use the solidified one more for cooking since buying the fractionated oil! Oh I&#x27;m the queen of concoction so I added some lemongrass oil, cinnamon sticks, jasmine oil and olive oil to this!</li>
            <li> Great product at a a great price</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have used coconut oil in the jar for years and really enjoy the convenience of this product. It&#x27;s awesome and I will be purchasing time &amp; time again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product was secure and the pump works great. No coconut smell (which is great for those who want to use coconut oil but not a fan of the smell - not my issue, but I know that others feel this way). Great value for the amount of oil and love that it comes with a pump, making it easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my hair products, in my lotion use it all over my body. It is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! I have used coconut oil as a moisturizer for years now and this does not disappoint! It sinks right in and is great for my sensitive skin. A great bargain for such a large sized bottle too!</li>
            <li> Amazing  can be used  for  several  things  from hair to skin</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the Radha Beauty Fractionated Coconut Oil because my skin has become very dry in the winter time. It worked so well on my skin that i decided to use it on my dog that has a skin condition. We both received immediate relief. I was concerned that it would be greasy but it absorbed very quickly and has a pleasant smell to it. The 16 ounce bottle is the perfect size and should last me a long time. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> i was thrilled to have received my order just a day after I placed it. The pump makes using the FCO easy. This is one of the best that is available. I&#x27;ve used others that are a smaller bottle for more and between the two, I&#x27;ll be reordering this one again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.  I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now, and will be coming back.  It&#x27;s packaged perfectly, arrives quickly and you can&#x27;t beat the price .</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is a nice consistency and does a really good job with hydration.  I have been using it with multiple oils both in roller balls and direct application by hand.  I have also been using it straight without adding any other oils as a skin soother for my leg where I burned myself.  It has been protecting the area and seems to be doing a nice job soothing the spot.</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil. It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the &amp;#34;cooking&amp;#34; coconut oil I had been using. And it feels lighter and absorbs into my skin faster. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a guilty futon cover. Guick delivery. I&#x27;m gad I picked this one. The paisley is a tasteful print.</li>
            <li> I loved this coconut oil to add to my hair products and bath. Since its liquid you do not have to heat it up and it&#x27;s much more convenient.  That convenience does come at a cost. I don&#x27;t feel like this provided as many benefits of conventional coconut oil. So I will happily use this bottle till it&#x27;s gone but I do not plan on purchasing again</li>
            <li> Love it.  I use it for everything.  My husband thinks it tastes slightly different from the other coconut oil I usually buy but I don&#x27;t notice a difference.  I love the bottle and convience of pouring out a few drops easily.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Mixing great with my young living essential oils and I can use it on my hands and face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice oil. I actually like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell since I use it all the time. Also the fact that it doesn&#x27;t solidify in the cold makes it very convenient. I like the bottle, coconut oil usually comes in a jar which makes it really messy. It goes nice with flax seed gel.</li>
            <li> Great product! Received exactly what I hoped and expected. Main use is for a carrier oil for my essential oil blends.  Great communication from seller as well! Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I received a coupon code to try this product and I am so thrilled that I did. I love using coconut oil to moisturize. I am a huge believer in using products that are natural. This coconut oil goes on great and makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I also love the pump that comes with it. It makes it so easy to use whenever you need it.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with this product.  It is non-greasy and I&#x27;ve also noticed that it does not stain clothing if I quickly use a Clorox wipe on the spot (this has only happened once and it was a very small spot.)</li>
            <li> Awesome product and awesome company.  Very pure and natural.  Feel good using this on my face and body.  Goes on easy and smooth and has a ton of uses.  Makes me feel like I am doing something good for myself using a pure and natural product.  My second order!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great comments about this product and I had to try it... And it&#x27;s awesome!!!! Great product, quick shipping!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! it is so much better than regular coconut oil. This is just like a baby oil, but good for you. I use this on my rough heels and with one use, they were smooth again. I also use this as a makeup remover and it works well. Overall, this is a great product! A little goes a long way! The company is wonderful. I received the e book and I am looking forward to using it with baking soda as a tooth whitener. I would definitely purchase more products from this company. I am very happy overall. I also love that this comes with a pump. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am a tester for this brand which for me is excellent, I have been using this Coconut Oil for taking the makeup and it works, it is not greasy and excellent for my hands.</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is on the Radha Beauty Fractionated Coconut Oil that came for review this week in a 16 fl. oz bottle to try. The bottle was nice with a catching logo with coconut and palm trees that make you feel like your on a tropical island. The product is 100% pure and colorless/odorless. There are no fillers and only one ingredient. This is the real deal! The oil does not stain and is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about coconut oil is there are so many uses and the oil has a very long shelf life. I like to use it for a skin moisturizer. If you apply after a shower/bath you will see a difference in your skin’s tone and appearance as well as feel. No more dry skin! The product is great for massage oil as well. The oil is lightweight and will not clog your pores. The bottle is quite large and should last quite awhile because it doesn’t take much to cover the skin.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful!! love that it has no smell but makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> this is good stuff!  i mix my essential oils with it in roller bottles and it really does the job!</li>
            <li> This coconut oil has surpassed all of my expectations!  I have tried several different body oils - argan, marula, grapeseed.  Some have proven very helpful in fighting dry skin but as I have aged it has gotten harder and harder to find a moisturizer that truly works.  Radha coconut oil is the moisturizer I have been searching for.  It absorbs quickly without a greasy residue. It makes my skin feel like silk.  I added lavender oil and it mixed perfectly and smells great.  My skin was beginning to get that thin, crepey look but this oil has seemed to turn that around.  My arms and legs feel soft and the skin looks younger and fresher than before.</li>
            <li> I just began using essential oils and knew I needed a carrier oil. I love that coconut absorbs in so well so got this because of the price and the pump cap. Makes it very easy to throw a mix together. Tonight I did an anti-itch, anti-inflammatory for my Pet, Ruby. So far, so good. Thanks for a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I am a very satisfied customer!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product to use as a carrier oil for essential oils. Have used it several times and absolutely love it. The pump that comes with it makes it so easy to use and you don&#x27;t waste the oil. Will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This has so many different uses. I love that it stays a liquid no matter what the tempurature inside your house is. It works great in cooking, for your skin, nails, hair. There are many different uses. You can also use this as a massage oil or even a carrier oil.. This is a must have.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl and she loves it, makes her skin very soft and moist and not all dried up and cracked. Thank you very much. Matt, AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> Great Product for an amazing price and this company really cares about customer satisfaction</li>
            <li> This has been the perfect coconut oil to mix with my essential oils. I also use it plain, as an everyday skin moisturizer. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Having been using it in hair for treatment . Use it every night love it . I do recommended it so many uses</li>
            <li> This is the bomb! My wife loves it for her hair and to remove her make-up.  Great for massages!</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin to make it silky smooth and I use it as a carrier oil. It works great on your skin and hair to give it that healthy glow. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as listed on Amazon was fastly shipped and came neatly packaged. There are many different uses for coconut oil and after purchasing I have had less mosquito bites, hair that shines and it can even be used as a suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> Radha Beauty Fractionated Coconut oil is fantastic because its so versatile &amp; great for the skin and body. Its odorless, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or bedding, absorbs into the skin nicely, &amp; isn&#x27;t greasy. Its an ideal carrier oil &amp; base for DIY beauty products ... like a sugar scrub. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores &amp; can be used to remove your make up. I like using it to take off my mascara. Its great for your hair , to help give it a nice shine and tame frizz.  Just get a manicure? Use this oil to rub onto your cuticles to keep you manicure and hands looking great.  If I wasn&#x27;t so tall ( and could it in a tub nicely) I would mix this with some essential oils and add it to the tub to relax. Your skin will feel great afterwards.  I do use this as a moisturizer when I get out of the shower and my skin feels so soft, smooth, and supple.  It also works great as a massage oil , glides over skin while absorbing and doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky or greasy.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but if you mix this with baking soda and brush your teeth, it helps brighten you teeth. A few friends do this and have the whitest teeth.  This oil is great because its natural, leaves you skin feeling great, makes skin healthy, &amp; is so versatile.  I liked that Radha Beauty sent me an ebook to see some of the uses and shipping was really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great price for how versatile it is and it has a long shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for review purposes, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful! It absorbs right into my skin and feels soft. Regular coconut oil leaves a greasy feel to it, this does not. It also has no fragrance, so if you mix essential oils with it, there&#x27;s no altered smell. I would recommend this to everyone! Thanks for a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking for the majority of purposes I use essential oils, coconut is my all time favorite carrier oil and Radha&#x27;s is just as beneficial as any I&#x27;ve used.  There are so many reasons to use this oil. It&#x27;s thin and light, so absorbs rapidly. It has no smell. If it does, you&#x27;d better check the ingredients or the expiration date. It should not have a smell. If it lists fragrance as an ingredient, that&#x27;s a red flag. Almost any chemical can qualify as a fragrance. One side benefit I&#x27;ve recently just determined is that coconut oil is the least likely to stain and not nearly as hard on sheets as other carrier oils. A chemist friend gave a mini &amp;#34;tutorial&amp;#34; on this oil over coffee and said that a significant reason coconut oil makes the perfect carrier oil is that it&#x27;s molecules are very small, nearly as small as the essential oils so that it doesn&#x27;t hinder the EO from being absorbed into the skin. Pure unadulterated coconut oil has many benefits, and although fractionated coconut oil is exactly what it&#x27;s name implies, a fraction of the original oil, it still maintains multiple healthy benefits. The pure oil has a long list of triglycerides that are mostly removed when the oil is fractionated, but the medium-chain triglycerides remain making it a saturated oil, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing. It makes it a more stable oil and gives it a long shelf life. Fractionating also raises the concentration of Caprylic and Capric acids, giving it more of a disinfecting and antioxidant effect. Coconut oil has been used for skin care, high blood pressure, weight loss, aiding in digestion, stress relief, kidney problems, boosting the immune system and others. The way I look at it, using coconut oil along with the essential oil means increasing the overall benefits. Great oil, competiive price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and thought I&#x27;d try this instead of lotion.  Love it. I then added stress relieving essential oil to it and use it everyday after my shower and starts my day a little more relaxed.  And my skin has never been softer without using all the chemicals in lotions.  Doubt I&#x27;ll ever go back to lotion.  Soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t get oil all over my clothes.</li>
            <li> This is my first fractionated coconut oil to use and am really enjoying it. It&#x27;s so light and absorbs so well, which makes it nice for warmer weather.</li>
            <li> use it for lotion, my pets fur, eye make up remover</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite carrier oils. It spread on well and absorbs quickly. There is no coconut smell which I love. It is the carrier oil in all my roller ball blends.</li>
            <li> I live in TX now. Very dry here. So I was looking for a good stuff for helping dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this oil, my skin is getting better.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Loved this oil.  I use it in a mixture of natural oils I use in my hair and as a moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING moisturizer for skin &amp; hair;&lt;br /&gt;easily absorbed, no residue. Also excellent carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Goes great with my Essential Oils!</li>
            <li> So many uses!!! I purchased this to be a carrier oil but have used it for so much more on a daily basis. Most notably, I use it on my hair to help control the frizz from taking over. I have naturally curly hair and would not trade my curls for anything, but I am also very active, even in the heat and humidity. The picture attached is of the front of my hair on day two after the oil had been applied, a 3 mile walk with the dogs, and an hour and a half of working in the yard (which is why I am covered in leaves as well). The oil has been a great moisturizer for my skin as well, from head to toe!</li>
            <li> amazing! love it! use it daily. perfect for my skin. love to cook with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, and the pump works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I use this coconut oil everyday to moisturize and massage. I love that it is odorless, clear, smooth, and non-greasy. The pump included is great, and makes use and application super easy and clean. I especially love the email attachment for multiple, creative uses for the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Got it just in time, with a guide on how to take advantage of the coconut oil and its properties. Good price, nice packaging, practical pump. Loved it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the fractionated coconut oil that I ordered; it&#x27;s not at all greasy and really makes my skin feel smooth. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Grace and Frankie on Netflix have inspired me with the courage to admit that I use this to lubricate...the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, probably not for cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets talk about massage oils.  I was using plain old coconut oil as a massage medium, and while it smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t drip (because under A/C it starts out solid), it&#x27;s also greasy and at least for me, comodogenic (pore clogging.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the consistency of baby oil so a bit drippy, sorry to say, and I miss the unrefined coconut aroma, but it makes up for those losses by being easy to wash off whatever you need to wash it off of, it&#x27;s light on the skin (no breakouts yet), and sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react to it, if mine is any indication.  Yay!  (Big warning however for those unlucky few with nut allergies.  That&#x27;s a whole other thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product doesn&#x27;t damage silicone.  Hey, if you are using it to grease one of those new-tech silicone imbedded cookie sheet before baking, that&#x27;s good to know!</li>
            <li> I Love this product!! I&#x27;ve  given several bottles to friends and family. My skin is softer my nails &amp; cuticles  are in the best shape they  have ever been in. I mix the oil with sugar and it&#x27;s the best body and face scrub, I&#x27;ve  ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful carrier oil for my essential oils. It was packaged very nicely and I loved that I got a few different emails while it was shipping with extras and updated information. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is not greasy at all. I blended this oil with other carrier oils to be used as a body moisturizer. Another good thing about the product because it is odorless you can add your own essentials oils.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Coconut Oil for my beauty routines. &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m so pleased with all the different uses, this is a great facial moisturizer, and great makeup remover. Radha&#x27;s Coconut Oil does not feel thick and lumpy like some, it is light and smooth, fragrance free, mixes well with my other oils to make an even better moisturizer. Definite thumbs up. thanks for a Great Product!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> amazing - love this- will use for everything and order over and over.&lt;br /&gt;love radha products</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for so many uses!</li>
            <li> I have already tried several skincare products from Radha Beauty &amp; am still using all of them as a part of my daily skincare routine. Now I&#x27;m trying their Fractionated Coconut Oil for the purpose of testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;This is a large 16 ounce bottle &amp; is 100% Pure with no fillers. It is odorless, colorless, non-greasy &amp; non-staining. Fractionated Coconut Oil does not go rancid &amp; it can prevent other oils from going rancid as well. I use coconut oil in several ways. I use it alone as a skin moisturizer &amp; I apply it when I get out of the shower to keep moisture in. It can be a very nice massage oil when it is mixed with lavender essential oil or any other scent &amp; does not leave a greasy feeling on your skin. It works to keep my hair soft &amp; tames my frizziness on those very humid days. It can also be used in your homemade soaps, lotions &amp; scrubs. There are just so many uses for this wonderful oil &amp; everybody should keep some on hand!</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Worked great with my essential oils</li>
            <li> Great carrier for essential oils.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  This has great, smooth feel to it.  Wonderful for making your own rollers or massage oils with essential oils.  Even can work in a mist.  Nice that it comes with a pump head.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have received a few products from Radha, and each and every one has prompted me to continue using their products. I am impressed with the quality of the Coconut oil, as well as the packaging. I am just learning about essential oils and I am using the coconut oil to help me to make products to help myself and my family. I have already made a wonderful peppermint massage oil and I have used it on my cuticles as well. As I learn more about different uses, I will try them and I trust in Radha&#x27;s quality to help me to make the best oil based products I can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER been disappointed by Radha Beauty Products. Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> High quality oil. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. I am using it as a base oil for massages etc. I also use it to remove my makeup.  It is very light and absorbed pretty quickly by the skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this coconut oil. Martha Denson</li>
            <li> Best value size and it comes with a pump! Perfect.</li>
            <li> Works well with my oils.</li>
            <li> I received my coconut oil and have been using it on my skin. Really a great product, no smell even though i wouldnt mind if it did, i love the smell of coconut. The oil was not greasy at all my skin ate it right up. You feel the difference the 1st time you use it. If left my skin so soft and smooth. This is a product i will continue to use. Im goiing to try it on the ends of my hair this week. Im looking forward to reviewing more products.</li>
            <li> Works great in my daughters hair. Not greasy leaves hair smooth and shiny. I would buy this product again for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this non greasy and excellent moisturizer</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Goes on like baby oil but doesn&#x27;t leave that oil residue. My skin is soft and stays moistened all day!</li>
            <li> Great...love the pump also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything that the company purported it to be.</li>
            <li> Although oil arrived intact, every time I use the pump for the oil, a glob of oil ends up under my bottle.  I think it leaks from the bottom of the dispenser, where the spout and cap come together, each time it is used.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to give my husband a massage and he loved it</li>
            <li> My biggest peeve about coconut oil is that it makes you smell like baked goods, so I love that this is completely odourless. Makes a great muscle relaxing rub with lavender and eucalyptus oils. Bottle is however a little bit soft - and squeezing it even gently send oil squirting right out the pump nozzle!</li>
            <li> I use this in my skin and hair. My super fried/bleached hair started feeling soft again after only a few days use!</li>
            <li> The free pump was missing parts, so it was useless.  Love the oil though!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to dilute essential oils.</li>
            <li> Really liked the Product, using it on Hair &amp; Skin and noticing a Healthier Appearance!  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 &amp; not 5 Stars is because mine did not come with a Pump and so it&#x27;s pretty messy when applying.</li>
            <li> I use FCO daily with my oils, and I&#x27;m always looking around for the best deal on quality coconut oil. This is great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It is very COOOOOOOOOOL ITEM.</li>
            <li> Right when I received I put on my hands and wow what a great product</li>
            <li> Good buy.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I use doTerra Essential Oil&#x27;s and this product is GREAT... can&#x27;t say enough!  Easy to use with the pump... nicely done and oil is pure.</li>
            <li> Very clean and nice product.  Very pleased with this purchase.  I use it to dilute essential oils.  It did not affect the scent at all.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so did even days after! Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it on all dry skin areas ..... especially like it for my fingernails &amp; cuticles. I apply a small amount several times @ day.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Highly recommend. Odorless and not sticky Second time I have bought this from them. very happy</li>
            <li> Great product and I got it fast!</li>
            <li> light and absorbs nicely, don&#x27;t need to use much..i can definitely tell a difference in my skin after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a carrier oil for essential oils and it works great! I love that I can squeeze it out of the top it came on or put the pump in if needed. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I need a gallon of this stuff stat! Just within a week my skin feels so incredibly smooth and hydrated. But the main thing is my feet!! Oh my goodness my heels feel amazing! I wear sandals everyday and my heels are normaly so dry and cracked, just a couple days and it&#x27;s like I have completely different feet! I like to put this on right out of shower while my skin is still a little damp. I&#x27;m not sure if any girls who get brazilians will be reading this but after I started moisturizing with this stuff even on my bikini area I noticed it helped a lot with ingrowns and even my waxer noticed the hair was coming out much easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> I would order from this company again.  It was exactly what I was expecting.  I have used it on my skin in my hair and have used it on my horses draining wound.  My next plan will be to use it as a carrier oil and a base for other products I make.  The product arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Having to be able to put the right on the bottle makes this so easy when I want to mix it with an essential oil and use as a massage lotion on my feet, chest or anywhere on my bottle. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily like other oils. I would tell anyone who wants a good carrier oil to use with their essential oils to purchase this any they will be very happy.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF and mixes REALLY well with others</li>
            <li> This oil is great. A nice attractive pump bottle and is a good moisturizer that leaves less of the oily residual oil on the skin surface compared to regular jar coconut oil. I will use it along with my normal organic face moisturizer and as a body lotion. I do miss the coconut smell and will buy and add fragrance.</li>
            <li> love this. I LOVE coconut oil but when making beauty products my one issue is that sometimes the coconut oil hardens too much to make the consistency that i&#x27;m looking for.  Love that fractionated coconut oil remains liquid. perfect for use in roller balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a coupon for this product but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs into your skin and not greasy. Really good ! I like it.</li>
            <li> Before I begin my review, I just have to comment on the customer service. One word: amazing! It felt great knowing that my satisfaction was important to the company. Shortly after placing my order, I received an email from Radha Beauty Products thanking me for my purchase followed by a second one that included an ebook listing all the benefits of this fractionated coconut oil. At this point I hadn&#x27;t even received the product yet and was already in love! Talk about a great first impression! Upon receiving the product I immediately put it to work. Using a small amount I worked it into my arms, elbows, knees and legs.  Instant smoothess! With so many uses for this, it is definitely worthy of 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is another great product from Radha.  The coconut oil is exactly what I wanted so that I can make my sugar scrub and essential oil blends.  I love the fact that it came with a pump which just makes it that much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I really am happy to have this product as part of my health and beauty routine daily.I am pleased with my purchase. I have introduced it to my friends and family.  Will also make gifts of this amazing oil. I love it !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a carrier oil to make beard balm, but have been using it as a face and body moisturizer as well.  My skin feels amazing.  While I love the smell of coconut, I like that this is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume.  I will definitely be purchasing this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Already purchased it again!</li>
            <li> Love it fo my sins hair</li>
            <li> Amazing as a moisturizer! Love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and customer service. I use this on my skin,  hair and beard. My skin condition is so much better than before and my beard is soft. Keeps my hair from being over dry as is often the case. The pump sprayer is super.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff...I use it to make a rub with essential oils and as a carrier for mosquito spay....Will buy more...</li>
            <li> Good product and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick absorbs leaving skin soft and silky not at all greasy. Unscented so if you choose to add other essential oils  you can easily do so. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Quite nice and the quality appears to be really good. Coconut is the new black!</li>
            <li> I researched several carrier oils to use before settling on coconut oil. Radha’s oil is very smooth and clean. It fits the bill in terms of being odorless so as not to affect the combination of oils you are using in your mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this oil massages into the skin. I have used it in areas with sore muscles in Frankincense mix and worked its way into my skin nicely. I am looking forward to continuing to use this in other blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of packing, the bottle was tightly sealed and had a protective foil seal to prevent leakage. The dispensing pump came separately, so it is up to you whether or not you want to use it. It was easy to assemble and helped me to easily allot my carrier oil into the container I was using.</li>
            <li> I have been eating one teaspoon of virgin coconut oil before each meal every day or I have added it to meals instead of using butter. Lucky for me no one in my family has noticed the difference yet. I love the taste of coconut but you can get coconut oil that is unflavored as well, like what I received from Radha, but I use that type for other uses outside the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby who is sick (the sickest he has ever been,like every time) I used the coconut oil along with Peppermint essential oil to make him a chest rub to open up his breathing without having to buy products with additional chemicals that I may not be able to pronounce. The Radha Fractionated Coconut oil worked as a perfect carrier oil for the two drops of peppermint essential oil. The next day his cold seemed better and he was less whiny, score Dany. #hippiehappy</li>
            <li> Great product, mixed well as a carrier oil for my essential oils. The price is affordable &amp; the quality top notch. Will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the oil all is great</li>
            <li> This is a great carrier oil for my essential oils. It soaks right in and moisturizes.  I have used it as a masque on my hair and it works well for that too.</li>
            <li> We use an organic extra virgin coconut oil for pulling (the kind that liquifies in your mouth) and just thought it was really strange to use that one for cooking, silly as that sounds. I began looking for fractionated oil that would stay in a liquid form and have a pump to keep in the kitchen for use there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy we ended up with the Radha one - it has been great so far, we have made fish and baked goods a number of times and it&#x27;s been a very nice complement - a nice delicate oil that is odorless/tasteless (really!) and does extremely well under high heats. Exactly what we were looking for! The pump is a great thing to have (was originally not in the package by mistake but they were kind to send one right over to me when I asked)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $9.99 for 16oz it is fairly priced (this is a free review sample, but in no way affects my review) It has everything you would want in a fractionated oil - while we use ours in the kitchen it can be used for tons and tons of other things and as it&#x27;s light / pure it won&#x27;t ever feel heavy or greasy/ gunky like some others with lots of other fillers can feel. We have enjoyed all of the Radha products and their CS is always very quick to respond to emails which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this coconut oil as a carrier oil to dilute essential oils. I think this is a great brand/oil to use. It&#x27;s colorless and odorless so it doesn&#x27;t distract from the aroma of the essential oils. It is light and rubs in quickly without being greasy. The bottle is a good size and easy to pour into smaller 10 ml roller bottles, etc.</li>
            <li> Love this as a carrier oil and LOVE that it has a pump, it makes it so much easier to mix. My order arrived prompt and I will definetly order from them again</li>
            <li> Awesome Awesome product. I love radha beauty. I use coconut oil for so many things. Definitely purchasing again in future.</li>
            <li> This is so great! Coconut oil that absorbs into my skin in minutes with no smell. I use this all the time on my elbows, arms, chest and hands. It not only moisturizes but blocks out the sun. It&#x27;s great to use right before bed as there are not irritating smells or oils to get on sheets or bedspread. This is my honest opinion on this product.</li>
            <li> I used this to make a gentle shaving cream and i also use ti to put on my legs after i shave! It lasts all day and helps retain moisture!</li>
            <li> The quality of the oil is excellent, but I have it 4 stars because the pump was broken when j received my package. This means I cannot use this oil unless I pour directly from the bottle, which can get messy if you don&#x27;t have steady hands.</li>
            <li> Used this on a few things already and it helps so much. Its been great having it in the house to use. Even though my mom put it in the fridge and thought it was for cooking haha (but thankfully she didn&#x27;t use it on any food)</li>
            <li> Good quality oil..  use for my essential oil blends...Fast shipping !LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this Coconut Oil for one reason....I love it. I used baby oil for decades. No more!!!</li>
            <li> Great for skin alone and with peppermint essential oil to soothe sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Its perfect to feel moisturizing , not strong olor , and my skin feels so well i love it!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use with pump. Absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this. Makes a great massage oil with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I did not receive a pump with my order. But i still love the product and will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Ordered it for a friend who has very dry skin and because she is on blood thinners and cannot rub cream into her skin without breaking small blood vessels under her skin.  Seems to be working for her.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much thank you</li>
            <li> Packaged well which prevented linkage during shipping. Extremely hydrating when mixed with hair care, essential oils and skin care products. Has become a staple in my household.</li>
            <li> Great oil for dry Skin.Then it leave you Skin smelling so fresh !!! Also great for hair and giving massage&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I liked this Oil very much. It is non greasy and with a very pleasant smell very different from a typical coconut oil. I used it for hot oil massage for my hair.</li>
            <li> I got the product for testing purposes/ for free in exchange for an honest review I am very happy with this oil. It soaks in quickly, but if you are using it for massage purposes, you can use a little bit more and you don&#x27;t have to keep adding and adding to keep the consistency needed for a smooth muscle rubdown. There is no scent does not irritated your skin and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. Because of the purity of this oil, I find it ideal for use as a base oil combined with any other essential oils&lt;br /&gt;The price is great for how much you get, it&#x27;s a big bottle. I like that it is in a plastic bottle and not in glass and I think that the push-down/pop-up cap is adequate for dispensing the oil. I have seen other coconut oil bottles that are of glass or with a dispensing pop up cap. I use it to put on my skin and it absorbs really quick. I use for my hair before going to bed and use as a leave on hair conditioner and apply to my face. Feels greasy at first but it goes away quick without leaving your hands feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This coconut oil is wonderful at removing makeup; especially that pesky waterproof mascara that seems to hang on to your lashes. I can honesty say that this oil is not only better,but it leaves less of an oily residue and it&#x27;s more reasonably priced and I&#x27;ve used. There is so many recipes to make homemade personal care products. I made a peppermint sugar scrub. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cap doesn&#x27;t leak when it is closed, and it is better than many that I have tried, so I have no issues or problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also want to say that a little bit of the product goes a long way. I feel very satisfied that I am getting a lot of value for my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got this free for exchange for a honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been using a lot of essential oils and I need a carrier oil to work with. I love coconut oil and does just about everything. So if you are looking for a coconut oil that you don&#x27;t have to melt down into a liquid than this is perfect. The fractionated coconut oil stays in the liquid form and has a longer shelf life about 5 years. Regular coconut oil can go rancid and expires much faster.  This oil is perfect for making your own massage oils. There is no odor so its perfect for making your own blends. Adding in peppermint or grapefruit like I did is perfect for an aromatherapy effect while you are massaging. You can also use this carrier oil to make perfume rollers. Just mix in your favorite blend of essential oils such as lavendar lemon and mint to make your own unique blend. I used this oil in a perfume roller that I can fill at home. I just roll it on my wrists. I made one of pure peppermint for those times I have a headache.  This is also a great ingredient for DIY skin lotions, body washes etc.  I hear it makes a great lip balm as part of the recipe and that&#x27;s what I plan on using it for next. I was provided this sample of Radha Beauty Fractionated Coconut oil in order to provide a review. A positive review is not guaranteed and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I got this product free for the purpose of my review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to using coconut oil I know you can use coconut oil to cook I know you can use it as a moisturizer I haven&#x27;t gotten around to cooking with it I&#x27;m not sure if you can cook with fractionated coconut oil but I do use it as a moisturizer I also use it as an exfoliants by mixing sugar with a little bit of the coconut oil after I&#x27;m done  cleansing my body I do use the sugar scrub I just made with the coconut oil and it leaves my skin supersoft I do this about once a week</li>
            <li> Excellent oil. Doesn&#x27;t leave yo ugreasy or a nasty residue behind. Rubs into skin excellently. Also rubs into my two birds beaks great and leaves them shiny and healthy without making them sticky. I have also used it on my 11 month old when she gets a little dry and i love how it works. Her skin is soft and smooth without the nastiness of lotion. As for mixing with essentials, there is no problem. It has blended together well with any oils I have tried. I also gave a bunch to my mother in law who sells essentials and she says this is one of the best she has seen. Extremely happy. I know the company also loves to give out coupon codes and free promotions so it is actually really worth it to find them on face book. I actually got my first bottle by a promo code from their face book page. Definitely worth it. Find them!</li>
            <li> It really is a great product. Next time I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use it every day. Good product</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. Rubs in easy. I even bought roller bottles and fixed my Mom some. For the face the roller works great. I bought coconut oil in a jar but it is not the same as this one.</li>
            <li> Good fractionated coconut oil from this company thanks Radha will be ordering some more of your products.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this Coconut oil with my essential oils as a carrier oil.  It has a wonderful smell and very easy to use.  I like the pump too because it helps me to have a mess free experience.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love that it comes with a pump. Fast shipping and great customer service. They make sure you get your product and that you are 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It leaves my skin soft.  It&#x27;s not oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> Love it..absorbs into skin..and light</li>
            <li> Awesome...I used it as a carrier to prepare a tincture for my daughter&#x27;s swollen ankles. The oil just adds another layer of goodness to the preparation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this! Great moisturizer without the heavy feeling and all the yucky additives!</li>
            <li> The oil meets all my expectations. I added lavender oil to it and that makes it even better!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Goes great as a carrier oil.  The seller has been checking back with me and included a book about uses for coconut oil. I am very impressed</li>
            <li> I love this light, penetrating, and moisturizing oil. I use it from head to toe.😍</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t  write a review unless I am compensated with free product.All reviews  I read were from compensated users. I  would write a worth while review.</li>
            <li> Just opened it yesterday and my pump did not work, tried twist it clockwise and anticlockwise but it&#x27;s not popping out to allow pumping, any chance to get a replacement??&lt;br /&gt;The oil is great and light, no odour and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is great for using on your hair and skin. It absorbs quickly into your skin and I love that it remains liquid at room temp. Great buy! Mine did not come with a pump but the cap on it is just fine.</li>
            <li> I would like my money back because it is definittly is oily. I put it in my hair and had to wash it out.</li>
            <li> Great product! Worked wonders with my skin. Also use the slightest amount in my hair while damp and it calmed down. Wise investment.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I just got it, but my hands and legs feel wonderful. I can&#x27;t wait to try other things with this. I am really excited to use on my face to see what happens. This is not greasy and goes right into my skin and feels like silk. I think I will probably use this all the time.GREAT&lt;br /&gt;STUFF!</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil to use with essential oil for massage. I have enjoyed using with Radha lavender. Also peppermint</li>
            <li> No oily build up, unscented, gentle on skin, does not cause breakouts, does not stain clothes or pillowcase.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for more than 2 months and i have been putting it on my hair and it made my dandruff go away in 2 days! Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I just got into using essential oils and this oil is a great medium.  I do love the coconut scent, but it is fine that there is no scent to clash with the essential oil scent.  I love it...would buy it again!</li>
            <li> As a natural brunette, I&#x27;m about six months in on my journey to achieving white / platinum hair. In this time period, my hair had become dry, brittle, and damaged enough that my mom noticed through a FaceTime video call. I had used deep conditioners from pharmacies, but I never got the results I obtained from Radha Beauty&#x27;s coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sectioned off my hair into three parts: Two on the top (on each side of my head), and one in the back. I doused each part in the coconut oil, focusing halfway and moving down towards my ends. I left the coconut oil for about 2 hours, and rinsed it out using a standard shampoo and cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels significantly softer! When I run my fingers through it, there&#x27;s no breakage. The biggest change I noticed was the lack of frizz that normally appears halfway down from my roots. The pump made the dispensing process easy and minimized any clean-up. I think coconut oil is a great idea / solution for individuals who aren&#x27;t getting the results from traditional deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> Great for so many things!  I like the liquid form and the pump included.</li>
            <li> I love this fractionated coconut oil! I use it to as a moisturizer , a carrier oil with EO&#x27;s and as a make up remover . I will order this again!</li>
            <li> I used it for my daughter&#x27;s hair and it was much better than the other product I used so far, I am switching to this product for sure.</li>
            <li> THIS IS WONDERFUL....it mixes with other oils....good to use on your hair...good for your skin..will make other beauty products last longer..NOT GREASY AT ALL.  This is top quality and VERY AFFORDABLE.  I haven&#x27;t stopped smiling.  THANK YOU RADHA BEAUTY.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this coconut oil! So far I&#x27;ve used it to help my daughter&#x27;s cradle cap, clear up her diaper rash, and as a moisturizer on my legs. You don&#x27;t have to use much so you really get your money&#x27;s worth with the 16oz. I&#x27;ll definitely make sure to keep this stocked in my house because of its versatility!</li>
            <li> Love this so much! I&#x27;m using it to make rose oil for a light perfume for summer time.</li>
            <li> I loved this product it was very versatile and made me skin super smooth and soft! Look for a product review of it on my blog thejourneytomyfuture.blogspot.com in mid May 2015</li>
            <li> So I am trying to learn more about essential oils, aromatherapy and using more homemade natural products vs manmade chemicals. I’ve been looking for a carrier oil for my essential oils and received this coconut oil free* to try and review. Overall I feel it is good oil; see my breakdown of pros and cons below, the cons being why I marked it down a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Color free&lt;br /&gt;-Liquid, you don’t have to worry about heating it up to use it.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice size usable personal amount of oil in the bottle, 16oz. It’s not so large that I won’t be able to use it up, but it also is not so small that I will use it all up for the first or second time I make something with it.&lt;br /&gt;-Fragrance free, as carrier oil you want your essential oils to stand out and not be overpowered by it.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizes well; absorbs into the skin without leaving a super greasy feeling behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Clear plastic bottle which is bad for all types of oil, from the research I’ve done oils of all types are best preserved in dark glass bottles.&lt;br /&gt;-Cannot cook with it, you can find oils out there that say they are okay for ingestion and cooking but I couldn’t find anything in the description or on the bottle implying this oil is safe for anything more than on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this item for free this is my 100% honest opinion.]</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great Carrier oil for essential oils!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This oil is great but the pump bottle leaks and is much messier than expected.</li>
            <li> Like most of you,  I order what I want and review the item. I might mention the company if something out the ordinary happens.  Which is the case here.  I found the oil to be exactly what it claimed.  Therapeutic quality, well priced. Terrific!  But this is obviously a company that isn&#x27;t just churning out vats of this stuff for a big profit.  A lot of care is invested by the founders to not only ensure that high standards are met,  but to also educate the consumer.  I received a little ebook about the product and many of its other health benefits and uses.  That was a nice touch.  The title of my review says it all.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, large bottle, no damage.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! I use it from head to toe and I love that it easily absorbs and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. My only complaint is I did not receive my free pump as stated.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Works great. Not greasy and no odor.</li>
            <li> Perfect! NO smell no greasy feel and works perfect with my essential oils as a carrier oil. Used it to make lib balm and it came out amazing! One of the best fractionated oils I have purchased to date.  If you&#x27;re looking for a high quality product I definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product in exchange my own personal and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, quality made.  Works well!  I use it for cooking. I got this on a promotion to provide my experience about it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Many uses!!</li>
            <li> great,  love all the things that this oil can be used for</li>
            <li> this is a great company and product. It can be used for so many different things, oils , skin softening and more...</li>
            <li> Nice light oil. Excellent for a massage, and very good as a carrier oil for essential oils. Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product!  No mess &amp; oil is light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  I use it in combo with unrefined shea butter and pure tea tree oil, and it works very well.  I also use it alone as an after-shower moisturizer, and it works great that way, too.  It&#x27;s not greasy AT ALL, which is a definite plus, and it has no smell so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it clashing with anything you decide to add it to.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil!  It is the first oil I have used that does not coat my skin with a sticky layer.  It rubs in super easy.  My skin feels so super soft!</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic.  I used it on my hair as a deep conditioner and had great results.</li>
            <li> works really well... my husbands always giving me a fot masssage eveynight .. this coconut oil is odorless thats what he likes.. and i noticed that my mosquito bites on my foot heals fast because of this oil.. must buy oil..</li>
            <li> Coconut Oil is beyond useful! You can use it for everything from cooking oil, yum! To aromatherapy! It really allows for absorption of other oils and additives! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer lol I lather my kids up when their skin gets dry and the fact it&#x27;s odorless means I don&#x27;t get a craving to eat them up after! I highly recommend!! It&#x27;s my favorite brand and it arrived in 2 days! Super quick.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin will order more !!!</li>
            <li> At nite I put this on feet and hands as a lotion, noticed a big improvment right away.</li>
            <li> Oh My Goodness! This is so nice! So much easier to use coconut oil in this liquid form. Blends so nice and not the least bit greasy. I am using every Radha product and love them all. The company has awesome customer service.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, the pump works great.  Exactly what I expected. Lowered my rating when I remembered the shipping was outrageous.  Also, didn&#x27;t see anything regarding a free ebook.</li>
            <li> LOVE using this for my carrier oil for my DIY pain rubs made with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Love! The pump is so convenient.</li>

            <li> Ues it to mix iwth oils. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Its extremely versatile and the price is great. I paid  quite a bit more for the coconut cooking oil at the grocery store. I use it as a makeup remover, a hair treatment, take a table spoon daily and cook with it.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! Using it in a blend and the consistency is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL be ordering from your company again.</li>
            <li> Great price and a perfect oil for a carrier. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great oil to use on the skin or mixed with essential oils. I made foaming hand soap with it and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very Good for an &amp;#34;oil product&amp;#34;. Not really greasy and goes on smooth, washes off easily. Vendor ( Rahda Beauty Products) shipped fast with no problems. Good for hair use but you only need a little dab.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time. Though I used the product only for few days I was able to see the difference. With continued use it should give good results. Thank you for the product at discounted rate.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Perfect for use as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and arrived as stated.  Great massage oil and well priced.</li>

            <li> My husband uses this on his beard… he loves it!</li>
            <li> I like this as a conditioner and a bath oil.  The first 2 bottles were leaking and the company sent me 2 new bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell. It works perfect as a carrier oil for essential oils. I have used it to make many massage oils and soothing mixtures. It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky. I would recommend this brand of fractionated coconut oil to anyone looking for a good deal!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Not bad long enough to tell if it works but have been told it does so I think I will like the results I get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little runny...</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I love that is comes with a pump it makes everything easy. There is no odor and is very clear. I will for sure purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very thin but had not cocnut smell. I thought it did.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packed.  I especially like the pump.  I use this to mix with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> When Radha replaced the pump they had sent (it was too short) I told them I would write a review after I had had some  time to use the product. Here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an unscented oil - very liquid. More pleasant to use than ordinary coconut oil, which has a consistency like Crisco and has to be warmed in your hands to become liquid. The pump tends to deliver more than you need - a full stroke yields too much oil for the palm of you hand, so go gently until you get a feel for this pump - it is inelegant but functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil is an emollient, a humectant - you can use it as a moisturizer all over your body, including your face - not slathering it on like a suntan oil - but judiciously applying it to dry areas. It takes rather longer than a cream or lotion to absorb into your skin, but it will be absorbed. Some women swear by it for everything, even hair conditioning. Give it a try. Work with it, and you&#x27;ll probably end up continuing to use it as I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a definition copied from the web: As the name implies, fractionated coconut oil is a fraction of the coconut oil from which almost all the long chain triglycerides are removed, thus leaving mainly the medium-chain triglycerides and making it an absolutely saturated oil. This saturation gives it a very, very long shelf life and greatly increased stability (i.e. it will not become rancid for a long long time). In addition, fractionating raises the comparative concentration of Capric acid and Caprylic acid thus giving it more of antioxidant and disinfecting effect.</li>
            <li> I love fractionated coconut oil! It works wonders for many things. We use it as moisturizer, we use it for sore muscles, we use it to make our own beauty and bath products. It does not leave you feeling sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> Great for mixing oils.</li>
            <li> As advertised: great for aromatherapy, massage, and general skin/ hair therapy ... No greasy residue, clean and unscented. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Claimed to come with free pump but mine didn&#x27;t came with one and there were lots of small residues in the oil compare to other brand I used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And item is none returnable so I&#x27;m stuck at having to keep this bottle that I can&#x27;t use for cooking nor massage...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and amount for price</li>
            <li> I really like how this oil absorbs into the skin. I&#x27;ve had no issues using it so far. Would not hesitate to order again.</li>
            <li> Ot arrives in extra wrap so it doesnt spill. It consistency is very thin so a little goes along ways. I have been adding it to my green and grey clay for my body wraps I do once a week. I love that it has no scent and The diffence in my skin its glowing.</li>
            <li> Very surprised by how smooth and non greasy even compared to the reg coconut oil... Great for those EO blends :).. I did get a coupon for product but the review is my own</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM AND THE COMPANY! can&#x27;t wait to see what else they stay selling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil in many of my homemade products like handsoap, oil blends and whatnot. I think it works really well as a carrier oil-smoothly, and does not have a strong scent so my EO scenes really come through. I was able to use a coupon code and get mine for free, but will totally but once it runs out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product already. I use it for massaging on certain people leaves their skin smooth and refresh. I recommend this product to anybody who is looking for a great quality coconut oil.</li>
            <li> The best product ever!! Not greasy, keeps you soft and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and packaged perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love how this was a multi use tool. You can cook with it, moisturize your body, and use it in your hair. It also doesn&#x27;t give your food that real greasy feel. Its very very light.</li>
            <li> had a problem with the pump not working contacted customer service and they said they would send one right out use a few drops in hair conditioner and it really makes a difference</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I use it for homemade beauty products.  Recently, I created bath scrub with sugar and salt.  So easy and so wonderful!</li>
            <li> Radha Beauty’s Fractionated Coconut Oil comes in a plastic 16 oz bottle. Like the Argan Oil, Radha Beauty’s Fractionated Coconut Oil is odorless and they don’t add any preservatives or dilute it water. It’s 100% Fractionated Coconut Oil comes with an eBook to teach you more about the many ways you can use Coconut Oil. My favorite application is having my fiance’ use it as a massage oil. It doesn’t leave a greasy residue after application so it’s a great massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings (Out of five stars):&lt;br /&gt;Skin Moisturizing: ***** 5&lt;br /&gt;Hair Moisturizing: ***** 5&lt;br /&gt;Versatility: ***** 5&lt;br /&gt;Scent: ***** 5&lt;br /&gt;Value: ***** 5&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating:  ***** 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Versatility, Nongreasy, moisturizing and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Radha Beauty’s 100% Pure Argan Oil &amp; Fractionated Coconut Oil complimentary for testing purposes.

I always ask or read,because I also only by from crueltyfree companies,which they are!&lt;br /&gt;This has no scent,very light,all natural. I used it in with my skincare..drop.

Also cook with it and healthier than vegi or corn oil.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping,think I got next day and only used regular shipping. They also emailed me to make sure I as totally happy!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend product and company!</li>

            <li> seems of a good quality</li>
            <li> feels more like baby oil-which is cheaper by far-no coconut smell-works on skin well</li>
            <li> Great as a carrier or moisturizer, but I wish it was also edible.</li>
            <li> Love it! Ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> Great to use with essential oils,  hair and skin</li>
            <li> Great product thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use a as a carrier oil to mix with my essential oils.  I also love using it as a moisturizer.  This coconut oil is non-greasy and does not stain.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample Provided*</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product! I used it all over my body as a moisturizer and went on smooth, absorbed fast and wasn&#x27;t greasy at all! I also used it to remove makeup and moisturize my cuticles. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I must say that I am very impressed!!!  I didn&#x27;t know that coconut oil was so good for so many things.  And, the cost is minimal compared to the cost of expensive eye creams, shaving gels, body scrubs, etc.  So this is definitely a win, win in my book!  I was given this product in return for my testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> This item will arrive to you as posted here and is a great product overall. Whether it is for your skin, hair, or even cooking purposes this coconut oil will certainly fit the bill. The included pump is a very nice bonus to say the least. I will certainly purchase this product again when my initial stock runs out.</li>
            <li> I have used coconut oil before, but never in a liquid form. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this oil, was an actual oil, and I didn&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;warm it up&amp;#34; to use. I used the coconut oil as a hair mask. It&#x27;s better to use at night, on 3 day hair, but basically you just &amp;#34;pour&amp;#34; it on and massage into your hair, put on a shower cap, leave on for about 30 minutes, and then wash it out- I had to wash twice to get it all out. The next day your hair is moisturized and full, and beautiful. I really liked that the oil was a liquid and that my dry and brittle hair soaked it up. It wasn&#x27;t overally greasy and didn&#x27;t make my thin hair limp. It also didn&#x27;t leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: compensation for this review was in the form of the coconut oil via Brandbacker &amp; Radha Beauty, but opinions are all mine.</li>
            <li> love it no scent and absorbs quickly also quick shipping and no leaking when shipped</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil. I never tried using oils on my skin but I am trying new things to improve my dry skin. Wow, what a difference this has made. My skin is super silky smooth. I takes my skin a good half hour to completely soak in to where my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily to the touch. This will probably vary person to person...I have very tough skin. This oil has no scent which surprised me, I was expecting to smell like a pina colada! Very nice product. This deserves a permanent spot in my cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of this coconut oil in return for a written review of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a good sized bottle for the price. The smell is good. I was very surprised at all the different things you can use this for. I do believe this is the healthiest my hair has been in a long time. You only have to use very little and that works very effectively.  I highly recommend. I WILL be buying it again. Love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very easy to use. So far I have used it for a skin moisturizer and after a shower in my hair for a light conditioner. I have a mild case of psoriasis and this is very soothing, non irritating. Non oily/greasy. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast! Love it so far with a couple of drops of essential oil it makes a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil as a carrier oil for my new found love of essential oils. I needed a good quality oil that can be rubbed on the skin and would absorb quickly, leaving skin soft and smooth. I have used the oil for many things from mixing with and applying the essential oils for allergies, massage and even insect repellent.  It really is very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When starting my oil craze, I did some research on the benefits of coconut oil and its many uses. I was amazed at all the literature out there and the zillions of uses.  I read that it’s important to find a product that is fractionated/purified to increase the shelf life and when mixing up batches of oil remedies that wont all be used immediately, it’s important to know they won’t go bad quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has no odor, not making you smell or taste like a coconut. It’s non-staining which is important when used near clothing/bedding. It is easily absorbed by the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I would recommend this product to someone looking for a versatile product that produces good results. . I was grateful for the opportunity to be able to share my opinion on this product for a reduction in price, for the purpose of testing. The company offers a 100%-Make you Smile guarantee; it can’t hurt to try it out!</li>
            <li> Love coconut oil.  Great for multiple purposes.  Wish I had gotten with the free pump!</li>
            <li> love it the smell isnt too strong but perfect</li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this product. There is no fragrance to it which is great. I use it mostly for my hair, and wish I would have received the free pump as advertised to save on the overall general use of it, but other than that I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing oil. But let me begin by saying that ordering easy and I received it in less than 48 hours!  Now for the product:  I have heard about some of the benefits and have only tried three since I have received it.  I looked up uses on Pintrest and found loads of ideas.  I have used it for frying (spray on pans), oil directly on skin and then rinse off while in the shower, and as a cuticle softener.  I will get back to you as I discover and try new ways to use Radha Beauty Coconut Oil. .</li>
            <li> Very good oil for massage. Not greasy,no heavy feel</li>
            <li> Truly satisfied, I use it for my hair, skin and nails. Leaves my hair so soft!! Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I love this oil, but it didn&#x27;t come with a pump...</li>
            <li> very light makes the skin fell good</li>
            <li> Just right for dry skin.  Not too oily but just right.  Sometimes I mix lanolin or argan oil in since I have the skin of a 62 year oil.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, it leaves the skin moist but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Wow I have used Almond oil in the past and non fractionated coconut oil, this really is so much smoother and silkier for use with essential oils and skin care!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  Please note that this product was received with a free coupon from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. What else can I say. I have ordered 2 more. Works with my essential oils, it has no smell and softens my skin. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> no pump though, it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Does not come with pump</li>
            <li> Greaseless, silky odorless oil perfect for bath and body. I love using it after I shower. My skin has been smoother, more hydrated, and has a bit of a glow. I use it all over, especially on knees, elbows, and sensitive areas. I tend to break out and get clogged pores, but feel I have had fewer issues with that since I&#x27;ve been using the oil. I especially love that I can use it for underarm comfort without it interfering with my deodorant. It would work well as a carrier oil for any other therapeutic oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only once but like what I see!</li>
            <li> Product is great but it didn&#x27;t come with the much needed and wanted pump, disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome !!! Just what my dry skin was craving. No noticeable smell, absorbed by my skin without being overly greasy, and healthy results to my skin the following day. This is only after 1 day of application. Looking forward to total results in 30 days! This oil maybe the answer to the problems with my feet I have been looking for! Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product by Radha! I would have to say it is the best fractionated coconut oil I&#x27;ve tried. I use it on my skin, hair and as a carrier oil for essential oils. It does not leave an oily residue at all. I will definitely be buying this product again</li>
            <li> Love this! I like that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> Using for a carrier oil for essential oils. Love it so far and no problems!</li>
            <li> Nice value, love the pump! Will reorder unless the price goes way up.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is more liquid that other oils that I have tried.  I really like it for my hair and hands.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed this product. I love that there is no coconut smell and the way it blends with the essential oils that I use. Thank you Radha Beauty Products!</li>
            <li> Love it! Wish it would have came with the free pump!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product and Radha Beauty Products delilvered on time.  No problems, and will purchase more from them.</li>
            <li> No pump. Cant try until i can find a comtainer to transfer that has a pump. What chore, not happy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Absorbs perfectly and no scent, non greasy</li>
            <li> Perfect. It always removes any makeup and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Fractionated coconut oil is great in rollerball perfumes amongst other things. Just add some fragrance oil and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not receive a pump with my bottle, but not a dealbreaker for me, the product is really good quality coconut oil.</li>
            <li> using for DIY sunscreen</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is the best product that I have  ever bought for multiple uses on human body.  It does wonders in my skin my skin is very soft like never before it does wonders in my skin my skin is very soft like never before and my husband is obsessed!  I have a suntan in my body and it glows deeply and there&#x27;s no greasy feeling.  It is also the best make up remover that I ever had.  On top of that I applied it for an hour to my 80 year old mom  into her hair and he was absolutely awesome.  This is very very premium quality product and I will buy it over over again.</li>
            <li> I use this this with my essential oils and it&#x27;s wonderful. When applied to the skin it is not to greasy. A very good product.</li>
            <li> Oil is great but the pump did not work properly. I did contact through Amazon and haven&#x27;t heard anything yet.</li>
            <li> Love it! Has been amazing on my skin and my hair. I have purchased several bottles now.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome! Im so happy with this purchase! :)</li>
            <li> I really like this Coconut Oil because most coconut oil tend to turn solid when store in a cool area but the Radha Coconut oil stayed liquid, so no need to melt this oil or wait until it melts. It really nice after shower to keep the moisture in my body &amp; great for my natural hair. My scalp it less irritated when I use this oil as a hot oil treatment. The smell of this product is very nice. The bottle is nice to have and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with the product.  Just be careful with the pump.  A little movement on the pump produces a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; packaging!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes homemade lotions and body butters much less greasy.  Will order again. Thanks for a nice shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased especially with the pump feature  makes mixing with essential oils so much easier</li>
            <li> Very well packaged, love it. Thank you! Neat little e-book sent by email too, thank you!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded by expectations and I will definitely order it again.  My only disappointment is the pump does not work which I suspect was damaged during shipping.</li>
            <li> I received my product with next day delivery! The product was what I expected.  The pump that came with the bottle was difficult to operate, in terms of use. It had no instructions on how to get da pump to work. Which way to turn, what to turn, etc. Eventually I did figure it out. I love da product...</li>
            <li> Love this product, this coconut oil makes it so much easier for me to do some of my DIY&#x27;s and it has no fragrance which is awesome when mixing with essential oils. It is very hydrating when I use it as is, I even use it for my hair skin, cooking. Its always great when you can find a great quality oil and this fractionated  coconut oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great way to be able to use coconut oil!  Love it for carrier oil... Very quick shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair once a week.  Let it sit for a couple of hours then take a shower and shampoo and condition.  Love this product</li>
            <li> Great product, good price.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I loooooove love love this stuff... Very light and not thick as some oils are... N I like the fact that it can be used anywhere... Great as a cuticle oil, putting shine to my hair without making it heavy and great on my dry skin without being too slippery..... Will be ordering more</li>
            <li> &#x27;I love this product  It doesn&#x27;t  leave you&#x27;re body oily will not stain your garments.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell, but so far loving it!  Great for my hair.</li>
            <li> It is working great for hair.  Shinier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair and nails</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> No nutritional value rather use extra virgin cold pressed coconut oil</li>
            <li> Really like this oil. Excellent carrier oil for essential oils and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Love it use it twice a week in my hair. Works great</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Watery to the point of dripping on the floor! What a mess!</li>
            <li> A great oil for dry skin! Even works great on the dog!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this coconut oil! I&#x27;ve had it for  over a week now and have used it as a carrier oil and as a moisturizer for my dogs cracked pads. It&#x27;s been a rough winter ;) you will not find a better quality oil for the value. I was very surprised at how big the bottle was. As I have been with all of the Radha products so far. You&#x27;ve hot to try this one!!</li>
            <li> I Love this oil, great for adding to bath salts and perfect for blending essential oils in roller bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for a 16 ounce bottle! I like this oil because it&#x27;s completely fragrance free. I use it to massage into my scalp and leave it on for about 30 minutes before I wash it. I also love to use this to remove my makeup at night. Before I got to bed, I dab some under my eyes in lieu of eye cream. It&#x27;s all natural and so good for your skin!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle because I loved it so much I had to get another so I could share with my cousin (I know she&#x27;s gonna love it and want it all!).  It&#x27;s light but not too light and it&#x27;s unscented so it&#x27;s perfect for adding your favorite essential oil to fit your mood.  It moisturizes but you don&#x27;t get a greasy residue.  You can get dressed right away or hop into bed and not muss your clothes or sheets.  Your skin just drinks it up and any dryness is eased.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to get my coconut oil from Radha Beauty!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product- it&#x27;s multi purpose  I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t leave that oily feel on your skin. It won&#x27;t stain sheets, clothing, towels etc. You can do so much with this oil. It&#x27;s so good for you. Highly recommend this coconut  oil.</li>
            <li> I love the coconut oil! It makes my skin feel so soft after shaving. I use it primarily for my dry skin and it does wonders. You can use it for virtually anything! I like to add a drop or two of the Radha Lavendar oil (since the coconut oil has no smell).</li>
            <li> Coconut oil and hemp oil are my go-to options for body moisturizing, as it is hard and expensive to find a hypo-allergenic, cruelty-free vegan body lotion. However, trying to moisturize yourself head-to-toe with coconut oil is cumbersome, as it feels like you are rubbing Crisco all over yourself. Problem solved. This is an excellent way to use coconut oil as a body lotion, with all of the skin-loving benefits it provides. Since the bottle is huge and a little goes a long way, it would be possible to put a couple ounces in a separate bottle with an essential oil blend of my choice if I wanted a scented option. I plan to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am new to fractionated coconut oil, so I wanted to make sure that I received Radha brand, which is high quality, pure, and guaranteed. It did not disappoint. I have used it for a number of things, including on my skin, cooking (withstands high temperatures), and in aromatherapy sprays and massage oils. It doesn&#x27;t smell or taste like coconut at all, but delivers many benefits, while being affordable.</li>
            <li> What an awesome product once again from Radha! I am never disappointed! This coconut oil makes my skin feel SO smooth! I am in love with this product! I also love using it as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it is wonderful for my roller bottles and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and absorbs well!</li>
            <li> Best oil for carrier oil from Radha.  I love this light coconut oil for mixing with essential oils and making lotions.  The purity and light texture of this oil makes it great for mixing.  Even using directly on skin makes for a pleasant sensation.  It mixes quickly and easily and does no solidify like the solid coconut oil does.  I received a sample to review, and will continue to use as this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! I had a cold and I put it in the bath. I felt so refreshed that it was like medicine. It is non greasy like other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try out this Radha 100% Pure Fractioned Coconut oil along with Radha 100% Pure Argan Oil. I also applied the oil to my legs after a shower. It made my prone to dryness legs feel ultra-moisturized and more hydrated than with regular body lotion or body balm. After the application, the oil absorbed quickly into my skin leaving no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am going to use it as a carrier oil for my aromatherapy! If you want an oil that does it all, try this oil today!</li>
            <li> Packaging:  A clear, plastic bottle with a shampoo bottle-type squeeze lid. Cost: This is one of the best deals I was able to find on Amazon for fractionated coconut oil. Smell: It&#x27;s odorless. Texture: It&#x27;s very thin, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue once rubbed in.    There are a multitude of uses for this oil - it can be used alone on the hair and skin, as a massage oil, as a carrier oil, and can be used to make soaps, lotions, and other cosmetic products. I used this in a pre-shampoo treatment mixed with 2 parts fractionated coconut oil, 1 part argan oil, and a few drops of peppermint oil. It made my hair so soft!  **I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
            <li> So great in bath mixed with epsom salt.</li>
            <li> I bought this from this distributor because of the included pump. It doesn&#x27;t work, is broken. Otherwise the product was fine, but I needed the pump. If you can find it cheaper, buy it and buy a pump elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great oil for skin.  No oily residue and the no scent is nice</li>
            <li> I use fractionated coconut oil a lot.  This is among my favorites so far.</li>
            <li> Working out well for me mixing it with essential oils as a carrier</li>
            <li> Love this product so far, using it as a essential oil carrier-- use it daily for my face because I am sensitive to like everything else!!</li>
            <li> I received this for free for trying and reviewing. I need to say I love this oil! I use it on my hair, on my skin, and on my cuticles on a daily basis. I have tried other coconut oil before and didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s surprisingly not greasy and fast absorbing, leaving behind a soft feeling on the skin and hair.  I also love the package and the pump. I leave in on my vanity and always add a bit on my hands after washing them.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I use it to remove makeup, as a body oil and my hair.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Really great moisturizer for hair and body.</li>
            <li> love it, not greasy. Great for hair , body, moisturizing, etc</li>
            <li> I have bad dry skin. Really bad. People kept telling me to try coconut oil but I was afraid it would smell like coconuts (a smell that makes me sick) or not even absorb. Then I got to try Radha fractionated coconut oil in exchange for a review so took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first think I notice is that the oil is, indeed, colorless. Even better, there is no smell. None, at all. Perfect for me and my needs. The viscosity is pretty dang near perfect, too. It&#x27;s not too thick and isn&#x27;t overly thin. On skin, it absorbs well. It does sit on the skin slightly for a bit, but ends up absorbing in. Skin isn&#x27;t sticky or tacky at all. Only a small amount, about the size of a quarter at most, is needed. The oil doesn&#x27;t wash off easily when hand washing which is perfect for moms who are washing their hands constantly. There&#x27;s no need to keep applying it over and over after each wash AND hands stay protected while washing to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is great on hair and has great viscosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the fractionated coconut oil is so nice and mild with no fillers, I even use it on baby B&#x27;s head to treat his cradle cap. He is constantly scratching his head because of the dry skin. The oil goes on much nicer than baby oil. There is no oil slick left behind as you get with baby oil. The fractionated coconut oil absorbs nicely and not much is needed. Best of all, wee baby B stopped scratching all the time. From now on, we&#x27;re using this instead of the messy baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using oils on my hair. This one is no exception. A tiny amount covers all my hair and I have long, thick hair (at least halfway down my back). The oil absorbs right in, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy, and isn&#x27;t heavy. My hair ends up shiny, smooth, and so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since only a small amount is needed for any application, this bottle is going to last a long time. That also makes the price really reasonable.</li>
            <li> Very nice coconut oil. Will use in my essential oil rollers.</li>
            <li> If you want to use it for hair, this will be a perfect one. I also use it for my handmade soap.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Stays liquid no matter the temp, unlike the other type of coconut oil I use (which is for food intake). This one is ideal for beauty application. I use it for removing eye makeup. I also use it as a body moisturizer straight out of the shower. It does NOT smell like coconut. You will be able to use it with your regular fragrance. It absorbs in nicely as long as the skin is at least damp. It can be used for carrier oil for massage, too. It&#x27;s also good for hair deep treatment and for using just a small amount to smooth hair with, using while hair is still wet. It has applications for household use, too. It&#x27;s very multi-use and good to have on hand. I received a bottle of this for testing and review purposes, originally, but have since purchased a bottle myself...that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is great. I have used two other types of coconut oil and this one has no scent, unlike the others. It is clear and very easy to work with in DIY beauty/makeup recipes. I have used this coconut oil in place of dimethicone as a natural alternative for my lipstick molds. It helps the lipsticks to slide right out of the mold without sticking, breaking, or losing product. Overall, I highly recommend this product to someone looking for coconut oil who may want to skimp on the &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; factor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to hopefully get the benefits of coconut oil without the smell or it turning to solid. It is great. Lightweight and clear. I mix it with my hair gel to get a crunch free hold. It works great.</li>
            <li> The first thing I like this product is odorless and non greasy. My husband doesn&#x27;t like any coconut smell, but he like this oil after we do massage to each other after bath. It works very great on body massage. Also the price is very reasonable with this high quality product and the big portion. I will re-command my friends who love massage to try it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! This lightweight, fragrance free oil is perfect in all always!!  I use it as a carrier oil, hair conditioner, face moisturizer &amp;&amp; many many other uses</li>
            <li> I had been given the chance to try out Coconut Oil for cooking last year. I thought it was alright. I still thought my Olive Oil gave a better flavor, but after using the Coconut Oil more and more, and finding more uses for it. I was intrigued when I was asked to try Fractionated Coconut Oil, that is Coconut Oil that is mainly for cosmetic uses and not to be used for cooking. I decided to try all the different uses for it and to see what I came up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fractionated Coconut Oil it is 100% pure with no fillers and comes in a 16 ounce bottle at a very reasonable price. It is odorless, non-greasy, non-staining and colorless. It does not clog your pores and has natural antioxidants with disinfecting properties. Fractionated Coconut Oil is very versatile and can be used for anything from bug repellent to hair serum. It has a very long shelf life and does not go rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the amount of coconut oil you get in the bottle. Certainly a great value for your money, I also found it to be a great moisturizer. It is very watery so it is hard to work with. The best I found was to mix some of the Fractionated Coconut Oil with some basic lotion. It was nice mixed in a bath, and also as a hair serum that I would put in my hair and shampoo it out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the coconut oil on my face. I have very dry, sensitive and acne prone skin. Although it did not cause any break outs it made my face dry and red and did not seem to help the acne. It also did not work as well as a hair serum as my favorite Argan oil. However, it is half the price for twice the amount of Argan oil. If you are looking for bargain multipurpose cosmetic oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil is what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives Fractionated Coconut Oil 3 Stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To purchase your own bottle of Fractionated Coconut Oil you can find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Using as a massage oil on my husband&#x27;s back.  Glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Pump works well.</li>
            <li> I use every day.  Very convenient to have in a pump style</li>
            <li> Love this! Non-greasy, absorbs well, great for making lotions and such.</li>
            <li> I have oil face and dry skin. I have been mixing this product with my daily body cream for more moisture. It seems to keep my skin moistened longer than using a regular moisturizer. I love that it is scent free and contains no additional ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil for everything!  This is a great product that is already a liquid so you have to be careful trying to use it because you get so much out at once.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time.  I like that it is not greasy like other coconut oils that I have used before.  Very positive experience.</li>
            <li> As always Radha came through with a great product  along with great customer service!  I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil for a while, mostly for cooking and oil pulling..I use the fractionated coconut oil for skin care. The benifits of coconut oil are finally becoming mainstream, if you are not aware just do a quick search and you will be amazed. Thank you again Radha.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Though I wish it was organic!</li>
            <li> The benefits of coconut oil is no secret to beauty and skin care aficionados. I use Radha Beauty&#x27;s Fractionated Coconut Oil on my hair before showering and all over my body after I step out of the shower and I must say that I have noticed a significant difference on how smooth my hair and skin feels. It is all natural and does not contain harmful chemicals - which I perconally love, because I have extremely sensitive skin. This product is truly worth trying and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

            <li> It came nicely packaged. I used it after I washed my daughters hair with a dab of conditioner. Really soft and shiny. I used on my hair as well, then flat ironed it the next day.  We have really curly hair and it gets real dry. My hair came out shiny too without being greasy. I use on my dry hands and cuticles too. It&#x27;s non greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any smell to. Can&#x27;t wait to cook with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to try out oil cleansing for your face. Just slather some on your face, massage it in, then take a hot wet washcloth and steam your face a little with it then wipe off. At first I broke out a lot but now my skin is so happy! There&#x27;s no chemicals or weird ingredients like in most face cleansers (even the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones). If I feel like it still needs more cleansing I just use my homemade toner (1/4 apple cider vinegar 3/4 water, dewdrops lavender oil) and then I finish my skin with Radha rose hip oil as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s fantastic! This is such a good value. Pretty big bottle!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  Sometimes I use it as is for moisturizing, and sometimes I mix it up with other ingredients.  A little goes such a long way.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever want to be without it again.  So nice because it doesn&#x27;t solidify like regular coconut oil, so it&#x27;s much easier to work with.  Also can just get a thin layer with this compared to regular coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!  Have used it with essential oils and skin feels great!</li>
            <li> This is one of my must have beauty products, i normally use it to create my own scrubs with sugar. but it also can be used directly on to the skin to moisturize it specially during winter when our need better hydration. This product absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily sensation. I like that this oil is liquid because it is easier to apply just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> very good quality and useful for everything even hair...</li>
            <li> I love the product, my skin feels so smooth after applying it just love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is great product, I love the fact that this product is not so stick as the other Coconut oil products in the market.</li>
            <li> Very good item. I love it~~</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is a very good product, very few side effects on human health. It is a favorite of many female stars, is my favorite, I have used it to make bread, as hair oil, worth giving five stars</li>
