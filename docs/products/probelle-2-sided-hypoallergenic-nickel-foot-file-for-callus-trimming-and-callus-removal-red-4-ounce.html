            <li>/&gt;Use the “Probelle 2-Sided Hypoallergenic Nickel Foot File for Callus Trimming and Callus Removal” with great care.  </li>
            <li>she honestly says that this is the best one she&#x27;s ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one works great.</li>
            <li>you will not stop touching them!!</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, it works well!  </li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>That said, there are some good points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The medium side is more for the finishing touches which is great</li>
            <li>so I can make sure I have baby feet!</li>
            <li>It works AMAZINGLY well.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>You could feel the softness and that is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It is a really nice tool and you can feel the quality.</li>
            <li>The handle is nice, makes it easier to use than my pedi-egg....</li>
            <li>The Probelle foot file is very easy to use and there is NO discomfort.  </li>
            <li>It is more effective than some foot files, but I prefer the battery operated roller style because it works faster.</li>
            <li>This is easy, smooth, almost fun (for it still being a chore) and gives you excellent feel of control</li>
            <li>I love everything about this foot file.</li>
            <li>the best my heels have looked is after they&#x27;ve been shaved by the razor at the salon (which I gave up doing because they always manage to cut to deeply - ouch).  </li>
            <li>If you, like I, have calluses on your calluses, it may take more than one session.  </li>
            <li>This works better than any tool I&#x27;ve ever used or when getting a pedicure.</li>
            <li>This is actually better than I had anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, :)</li>
            <li>but i like my diamond foot file better.</li>
            <li>Hopefully most of the dust is from my calluses and not powdered nickel.</li>
            <li>but this did make my heels look better.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Probelle to see how it stood up against the Amope Pedi Perfect (battery) Pedicure Foot File that I recently purchased.</li>
            <li>Even though the Probelle is manually used it seemed to do a better job than the Amope.</li>
            <li>This worked much better than I ever would have imagined.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than my ped egg</li>
            <li>&#x27;s bought MANY over her</li>
            <li>Love that it is a 2 in 1 foot file.</li>
            <li>- so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have decided that I too needed to take better care of my feet.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, cleans easily, and does wonders on your feet!  </li>
            <li>Light years better than my egg-shaped foot file.</li>
            <li>But what a joy after I was done to see such lovely, healthy looking feet.</li>
            <li>Much, much better than cheap and flimsy</li>
            <li>Very effective but not harsh.</li>
            <li>file is easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>I put some lotion on after I was done and my feet looked beautiful the next</li>
            <li>The handle is smooth and fits easily in your hand.</li>
            <li>But for feet alone, it is just fine.</li>
            <li>In order for it to work, you have to apply to skin &#x27;lightly&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It would have be helpful to have a fine-sided tool or sanding tool to smooth off the roughened skin that remains after the callus has been removed.</li>
            <li>If all you need is a way to smooth your heels, this should work well.</li>
            <li>This is probably best for people with large rough patches on the heel.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and the coarse-bladed side does a quick job of callus removal.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, you can spend much, much more on &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; files so this represents a good value.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I love our new heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice-sized handle has unique rolling surface to fit to your fingers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s a good enough endorsement for me.</li>
            <li>I have only needed to use it once in two weeks, so that will tell you what a good job it does.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this footfile because I can control just how much callous to rub off at any time and the file lasts forever even with heavy use.</li>
            <li>For me this was great because I was able to smooth my feet in a matter of minutes removing some of the tough callouses that come along with being on your feet a lot during the</li>
            <li>I scraped the knuckle of my thumb and bled, but this is totally the user error; I was filing very fast (you can do it because of the good grip of the product) and touched the knuckle of my finger that was holding my toes with the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part is that you do it when your feet are dry - no long rituals of soaking and scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased!</li>
            <li>result (so far), has been a minimum amount of filing and very smooth results.</li>
            <li>Sturdily made, beautifully fashioned, and has done such a good job I recommended it to others who have reported back with similar remarks.</li>
            <li>After several weeks, my heels still have a ways to go, but the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>And the medium side actually smoothes your skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I own several foot files.  </li>
            <li>The Probelle foot file is so powerful that you might want to use it with caution.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest, I did not think my feet were in such a need for a foot file until I used this one.</li>
            <li>this product smoothed the roughness away and my feet are soft and smooth like they should be now!  </li>
            <li>In general, this is one of the more safer abrasion tools I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>First of all it is large but that just makes it better because you can get so much with one swipe of it and it is much easier to handle.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well in smoothing out my feet quickly.  </li>
            <li>This made a remarkable difference for me and cleaned up those hard areas quickly.  </li>
            <li>product is far superior to pumous stones, which require a great deal more scrubing and take off far less dead skin at one shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>though as done exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that some people are allergic to NICKEL and that it can be toxic.</li>
            <li>This foot file is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the coarse side first</li>
            <li>The only thought I had about this tool is that it might work a bit better if there were three levels of toughness instead of two.</li>
            <li>It has a long handle on it which is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The very rough grit is fine and the milder is also fine</li>
            <li>real downsides except that it costs a little more than cheap items.</li>
            <li>This item is pretty much what it is supposed to be, a two-sided foot file.</li>
            <li>and then the medium side and now my heels are super soft.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by this because of the lure of being able to do this while your feet are dry.  </li>
            <li>It seems easy to use and definitely works.</li>
            <li>While there was a mess on the bathroom floor when he was done, his feet looked and felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>The file is two sided, and when switching from coarse to medium, it really made our heels smooth.</li>
            <li>I have a persistent callus on the side of my foot from going barefoot so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>product really works fast, and I think I will be using it periodically for quite some time to come.  </li>
            <li>I also wonder if the nickel material is safe for the body especially long term.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>The handle grip is very sturdy and conforms well to my hand.  </li>
            <li>There are two sides, one is more aggressive than the other, start with that one over the roughest spots and then move to the smoother side.  </li>
            <li>I have only had to use the fine side, but the rough side would be good for harder calluses.</li>
            <li>Overall it really does a good job of getting the dead skin off your heals and the sides of your feet.  </li>
            <li>For the last several days, my knee and hip have been getting better.</li>
            <li>This can be a good file for large calluses, and possibly for some small ones, depending where on the foot they are.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you need something like this.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It has both a rough and a fine side.</li>
            <li>Well, this little file has done better than anything</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen pink, smooth skin on my heels in ages -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident this foot file will last a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really works quickly on your heels and feet, and you have to be careful to test both sides before you start.  </li>
            <li>This gently and and easily filed all the layers of cracked yellow dry skin off my heels in minutes.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps other products that I’ve used have just been too cheap, but this yields maximum results in a minimum amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>comparison, I used an original PedEgg foot file on one heel of my husband and a Probelle foot file, this product, on his other heel for three minutes each.</li>
            <li>Living in Florida our feet are exposed to a lot because we wear Flip Flops and Sandals or just go bare foot a lot, so a product like this one is a God send, and it really works well.  </li>
            <li>It does not remove any callus iwth either the coarse or medium side and after using it as instructed my skin felt uncomfortably funny while the callus is still there.</li>
            <li>The “Probelle 2-Sided Hypoallergenic Nickel Foot File for Callus Trimming and Callus Removal” may be exactly what you need to remove heavier calluses on your heels or big toes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s designed to be used on dry skin, and it makes quick work of early calluses.  </li>
            <li>I picked up this product to use from time to time to smooth down my heels and feet.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to grip onto firmly.</li>
            <li>It can be overly abrasive if your feet are soft, so take care when that is the case.  </li>
            <li>but so far it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li>Nickel is a frequent skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are two sides (medium and coarse) and rarely do I use the coarse side at all.</li>
            <li>this product works much better than any pumice stone or skin product I have used in the past!</li>
            <li>When I used it on my own heel with all my power (because I don’t have to be afraid of hurting my husband by over filing), for the shorter amount of time I got much more dead skin.</li>
            <li>It is too large, however, for small calluses because it will end up removing too much non-callused skin.</li>
            <li>have several callouses on my feet, and have used mostly cheap solutions in the past to the point of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>All winter I was very diligent using foot creams so my heel calluses are minimal</li>
            <li>The mess (skin flakes &amp; powder) was easily cleaned up but maybe next time I would have put some paper down or something to keep it contained.  </li>
            <li>It should last longer than what I usually get but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s worth it to replace it as needed.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable to hold but other than that this is pretty much useless.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I scraped the knuckle of my thumb and bled, but this is totally the user error; I was filing very fast (you can do it because of the good grip of the product) and touched the knuckle of my finger that was holding my toes with the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best part is that you do it when your feet are dry - no long rituals of soaking and scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased!</li>
            <li> result (so far), has been a minimum amount of filing and very smooth results.</li>
            <li> Sturdily made, beautifully fashioned, and has done such a good job I recommended it to others who have reported back with similar remarks.</li>
            <li> After several weeks, my heels still have a ways to go, but the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> And the medium side actually smoothes your skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I own several foot files.  </li>
            <li> The Probelle foot file is so powerful that you might want to use it with caution.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I did not think my feet were in such a need for a foot file until I used this one.</li>
            <li> this product smoothed the roughness away and my feet are soft and smooth like they should be now!  </li>
            <li> In general, this is one of the more safer abrasion tools I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> First of all it is large but that just makes it better because you can get so much with one swipe of it and it is much easier to handle.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well in smoothing out my feet quickly.  </li>
            <li> This made a remarkable difference for me and cleaned up those hard areas quickly.  </li>
            <li> product is far superior to pumous stones, which require a great deal more scrubing and take off far less dead skin at one shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though as done exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that some people are allergic to NICKEL and that it can be toxic.</li>
            <li> This foot file is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the coarse side first</li>
            <li> The only thought I had about this tool is that it might work a bit better if there were three levels of toughness instead of two.</li>
            <li> It has a long handle on it which is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The very rough grit is fine and the milder is also fine</li>
            <li> real downsides except that it costs a little more than cheap items.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty much what it is supposed to be, a two-sided foot file.</li>
            <li> and then the medium side and now my heels are super soft.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this because of the lure of being able to do this while your feet are dry.  </li>
            <li> It seems easy to use and definitely works.</li>
            <li> While there was a mess on the bathroom floor when he was done, his feet looked and felt amazing.  </li>
            <li> The file is two sided, and when switching from coarse to medium, it really made our heels smooth.</li>
            <li> I have a persistent callus on the side of my foot from going barefoot so much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> product really works fast, and I think I will be using it periodically for quite some time to come.  </li>
            <li> I also wonder if the nickel material is safe for the body especially long term.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> The handle grip is very sturdy and conforms well to my hand.  </li>
            <li> There are two sides, one is more aggressive than the other, start with that one over the roughest spots and then move to the smoother side.  </li>
            <li> I have only had to use the fine side, but the rough side would be good for harder calluses.</li>
            <li> Overall it really does a good job of getting the dead skin off your heals and the sides of your feet.  </li>
            <li> For the last several days, my knee and hip have been getting better.</li>
            <li> This can be a good file for large calluses, and possibly for some small ones, depending where on the foot they are.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you need something like this.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It has both a rough and a fine side.</li>
            <li> Well, this little file has done better than anything</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen pink, smooth skin on my heels in ages -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident this foot file will last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really works quickly on your heels and feet, and you have to be careful to test both sides before you start.  </li>
            <li> This gently and and easily filed all the layers of cracked yellow dry skin off my heels in minutes.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps other products that I’ve used have just been too cheap, but this yields maximum results in a minimum amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> comparison, I used an original PedEgg foot file on one heel of my husband and a Probelle foot file, this product, on his other heel for three minutes each.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida our feet are exposed to a lot because we wear Flip Flops and Sandals or just go bare foot a lot, so a product like this one is a God send, and it really works well.  </li>
            <li> It does not remove any callus iwth either the coarse or medium side and after using it as instructed my skin felt uncomfortably funny while the callus is still there.</li>
            <li> The “Probelle 2-Sided Hypoallergenic Nickel Foot File for Callus Trimming and Callus Removal” may be exactly what you need to remove heavier calluses on your heels or big toes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s designed to be used on dry skin, and it makes quick work of early calluses.  </li>
            <li> I picked up this product to use from time to time to smooth down my heels and feet.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to grip onto firmly.</li>
            <li> It can be overly abrasive if your feet are soft, so take care when that is the case.  </li>
            <li> but so far it hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> Nickel is a frequent skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are two sides (medium and coarse) and rarely do I use the coarse side at all.</li>
            <li> this product works much better than any pumice stone or skin product I have used in the past!</li>
            <li> When I used it on my own heel with all my power (because I don’t have to be afraid of hurting my husband by over filing), for the shorter amount of time I got much more dead skin.</li>
            <li> It is too large, however, for small calluses because it will end up removing too much non-callused skin.</li>
            <li> have several callouses on my feet, and have used mostly cheap solutions in the past to the point of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> All winter I was very diligent using foot creams so my heel calluses are minimal</li>
            <li> The mess (skin flakes &amp; powder) was easily cleaned up but maybe next time I would have put some paper down or something to keep it contained.  </li>
            <li> It should last longer than what I usually get but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s worth it to replace it as needed.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable to hold but other than that this is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> On one side it is marked medium, on the other, coarse, so you have a choice which to use.  </li>
            <li> Until then, I won&#x27;t let anyone near my heels with any other file.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long enough to reach an part of your foot without straining.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it still last.</li>
            <li> Callus shavers can be far more dangerous, and harder to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a general purpose file that compromises.</li>
            <li> I have a fear of pedicures (I&#x27;m a bad at Doing Girl, I know), and so I resort to my own such tools.  </li>
            <li> But if you are gentle, and do not scrape too hard, you will find that your calluses and corns go the way of the dinosaur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You must be careful with tools such as this.  </li>
            <li> Since your feet are dry there is less slipping action.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hit the nail salon frequently for a pedicure, so from time to time I need to tame my feet.  </li>
            <li> I have never used any  pumice tools that are supposed to just be used on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything else with limited results.  </li>
            <li> I did find that using only this side of the file left small, raised pieces of skin on my foot that caught on fabric and hosiery.  </li>
            <li> I like the complex red color of the handle, and the two-sided file, with coarse and less coarse sides.  </li>
            <li> just used the coarse side a little</li>
            <li> I was shocked how well the Probelle worked; it took more than double in amount of dead skin off his heels than the PedEgg as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The Nickel also did not cause any irritation for me, but you may want to be careful because for some it could cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know, I should have expected that this would work.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly rough heels that I&#x27;ve been trying to fix for years with all kinds of moisturizing lotions and tea tree butter</li>
            <li> Be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that leave residue when you rub the callous off, but that is not the case with this foot file.</li>
            <li> I had bad calluses on my feet on my large toes and sides and some general roughness to my heels, but not anymore!  </li>
            <li> For anyone with hard cracked feet I would definitely recommend using one of the foot creams made for cracked heels in conjunction with a file.</li>
            <li> I find it odd that something made of nickel is touted as hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> little gem</li>
            <li> I find this so frustrating and feel the Amope is a total ripe-off of my hard-earned $$!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this foot file does work well to remove heavy calluses.  </li>
            <li> but you do need to do it over a trash can since there isn&#x27;t anything to catch the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not satisfied with this tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy duty</li>
            <li> He complained of no pain or discomfort during or after the file use.  </li>
            <li> This is for smoothing thick skin and calluses on your feet.</li>
            <li> I have serious callouses on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I always thought that the process was a little painful, and maybe it is with other products.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a bit easier to maneuver and faster, although you still have to wok at those tough areas.  </li>
            <li> I was honestly shocked.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great tool. I have a persistent callus on the side of my foot from going barefoot so much. It&#x27;s a problem because it throws my gait off, and makes my knee and hip hurt. I tried this file once. It only took about a minute to reduce the callus. For the last several days, my knee and hip have been getting better. Today I have no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file is easy to use. It&#x27;s long enough to reach an part of your foot without straining. It has both a rough and a fine side. I have only had to use the fine side, but the rough side would be good for harder calluses. The handle is smooth and fits easily in your hand. This is a well designed tool.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this foot file. Works like a charm. Light years better than my egg-shaped foot file. The handle on this one makes hand fatigue almost non-existent. The coarse side dissolves callused skin lickety-split. And the medium side actually smoothes your skin nicely. The nickel metal surface looks fragile like aluminum foil, but it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m confident this foot file will last a long time. A wonderful, high-quality product.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I haven&#x27;t seen pink, smooth skin on my heels in ages - the best my heels have looked is after they&#x27;ve been shaved by the razor at the salon (which I gave up doing because they always manage to cut to deeply - ouch).  This gently and and easily filed all the layers of cracked yellow dry skin off my heels in minutes.  The best part is that you do it when your feet are dry - no long rituals of soaking and scrubbing.  I put some lotion on after I was done and my feet looked beautiful the next day.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried salon razors, pumice stones, chemical callus removers - you can stop now.  Just get this and be happy with your feet again.</li>
            <li> I own several foot files.  This is the best non mechanized file I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s designed to be used on dry skin, and it makes quick work of early calluses.  If you, like I, have calluses on your calluses, it may take more than one session.  It&#x27;s very heavy duty and I expect it to last for years.</li>
            <li> I have never used any  pumice tools that are supposed to just be used on dry skin. I got this today and I had already used a metal grater and pumice in the shower but my heels were still rough.&lt;br /&gt;I just used the coarse side a little and then the medium side and now my heels are super soft. This works better than any tool I&#x27;ve ever used or when getting a pedicure. I can&#x27;t believe how much time and money I have wasted. This is a great product at a really great price. I don&#x27;t know how long it still last. It should last longer than what I usually get but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s worth it to replace it as needed.</li>
            <li> This is actually better than I had anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;I have several callouses on my feet, and have used mostly cheap solutions in the past to the point of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;This little gem though as done exactly what I needed it to do. There are two sides (medium and coarse) and rarely do I use the coarse side at all. It’s perfect for covering a lot of area at once, but also useable to knock out one toe at a time if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result (so far), has been a minimum amount of filing and very smooth results. Perhaps other products that I’ve used have just been too cheap, but this yields maximum results in a minimum amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t be happier with this product. Highly recommend if you need something like this.</li>
            <li> I have a fear of pedicures (I&#x27;m a bad at Doing Girl, I know), and so I resort to my own such tools.  I was intrigued by this because of the lure of being able to do this while your feet are dry.  It works AMAZINGLY well.  I was honestly shocked.  It does take a modicum of patience.  You must be careful with tools such as this.  The handle helps with this factor, as it is sturdy.  Since your feet are dry there is less slipping action.  It can be overly abrasive if your feet are soft, so take care when that is the case.  In general, this is one of the more safer abrasion tools I&#x27;ve used.  Callus shavers can be far more dangerous, and harder to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a summer pedicure tool, give this a try., :)</li>
            <li> This file even works on my husband&#x27;s feet!  Since I had just had a pedicure, I convinced my husband to try this file to see how well it would work on him.  Amazingly, it works well!  My husband has never had a pedicure or any type of foot care in his life.  Short of occasional self trimming of nails, his feet are left untouched.  While there was a mess on the bathroom floor when he was done, his feet looked and felt amazing.  The mess (skin flakes &amp; powder) was easily cleaned up but maybe next time I would have put some paper down or something to keep it contained.  He complained of no pain or discomfort during or after the file use.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I picked up this product to use from time to time to smooth down my heels and feet.  Being a guy I don&#x27;t hit the nail salon frequently for a pedicure, so from time to time I need to tame my feet.  This product worked really well in smoothing out my feet quickly.  It has both a course side and a medium side so that you can somewhat control the level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works quickly on your heels and feet, and you have to be careful to test both sides before you start.  For me this was great because I was able to smooth my feet in a matter of minutes removing some of the tough callouses that come along with being on your feet a lot during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is plastic, but I didn&#x27;t have any problems with that at all.  The Nickel also did not cause any irritation for me, but you may want to be careful because for some it could cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really works fast, and I think I will be using it periodically for quite some time to come.  It&#x27;s priced well, and I think it is the only one you will need.</li>
            <li> I like the complex red color of the handle, and the two-sided file, with coarse and less coarse sides.  It seems easy to use and definitely works.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: this review was written by  my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, I used an original PedEgg foot file on one heel of my husband and a Probelle foot file, this product, on his other heel for three minutes each. I was shocked how well the Probelle worked; it took more than double in amount of dead skin off his heels than the PedEgg as shown in the picture. When I used it on my own heel with all my power (because I don’t have to be afraid of hurting my husband by over filing), for the shorter amount of time I got much more dead skin. The file is two sided, and when switching from coarse to medium, it really made our heels smooth. Both my husband and I love our new heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice-sized handle has unique rolling surface to fit to your fingers. It is easy to grip onto firmly. Among of all the foot files that I have tried, this is the best foot file for me! The Probelle foot file is so powerful that you might want to use it with caution. I scraped the knuckle of my thumb and bled, but this is totally the user error; I was filing very fast (you can do it because of the good grip of the product) and touched the knuckle of my finger that was holding my toes with the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works but i like my diamond foot file better. As always when i file my feet I used this outside and used a mask so I would not breathe in the dust. Hopefully most of the dust is from my calluses and not powdered nickel. All winter I was very diligent using foot creams so my heel calluses are minimal but this did make my heels look better. For anyone with hard cracked feet I would definitely recommend using one of the foot creams made for cracked heels in conjunction with a file. All the creams that contain Urea seemed to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that some people are allergic to NICKEL and that it can be toxic. Saying that the file does work.</li>
            <li> Aloha callus!! This foot file is the real deal! If you have callus and want it out do not think about it, this product works like a charm! Make sure you use the coarse side first and you will literally be so happy with your feet you will not stop touching them!!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I did not think my feet were in such a need for a foot file until I used this one. This product is amazing. First of all it is large but that just makes it better because you can get so much with one swipe of it and it is much easier to handle. It has a long handle on it which is very comfortable to use. On one side it is marked medium, on the other, coarse, so you have a choice which to use.  I was in awe when I saw what was coming off the bottom of my feet. Gross huh? But what a joy after I was done to see such lovely, healthy looking feet. You could feel the softness and that is amazing. Living in Florida our feet are exposed to a lot because we wear Flip Flops and Sandals or just go bare foot a lot, so a product like this one is a God send, and it really works well.  I am happy to recommend it to you. My feet look very good and yours can as well. Nice product.</li>
            <li> You know, I should have expected that this would work. It&#x27;s always the simplest solutions that work the best. I have incredibly rough heels that I&#x27;ve been trying to fix for years with all kinds of moisturizing lotions and tea tree butter and whatnot. I&#x27;ve also tried a fancy foot file. Well, this little file has done better than anything and it (of course) was the cheapest of any of the options I&#x27;ve tried. After several weeks, my heels still have a ways to go, but the difference is amazing. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This Callus removal tool powdered off my feet instantly. It is a really nice tool and you can feel the quality. I look forward to keep on using it</li>
            <li> I just received this Probelle foot file in Saturday&#x27;s mail, and I gave it a try this Monday morning. I ordered the Probelle to see how it stood up against the Amope Pedi Perfect (battery) Pedicure Foot File that I recently purchased. I was actually impressed! Even though the Probelle is manually used it seemed to do a better job than the Amope. With the Amope, I have personally found that when you press the rotating file against the skin, it stops rotating and filing. No rotating....no filing. In order for it to work, you have to apply to skin &#x27;lightly&#x27;. I find this so frustrating and feel the Amope is a total ripe-off of my hard-earned $$! The Probelle does an excellent job!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would do what the packaging claims it would do: remove foot callus.. but so far it hasn&#x27;t worked for me. The handle is comfortable to hold but other than that this is pretty much useless. It does not remove any callus iwth either the coarse or medium side and after using it as instructed my skin felt uncomfortably funny while the callus is still there. So I&#x27;m not satisfied with this tool. I also wonder if the nickel material is safe for the body especially long term.</li>
            <li> Great tool for getting rid of callouses painlessly. I&#x27;ve tried scraping them with my finger nails but that didn&#x27;t do at all. The only thought I had about this tool is that it might work a bit better if there were three levels of toughness instead of two. The very rough grit is fine and the milder is also fine but I think there should be a finer grit as well so that it could be used on hands and elbows as well as feet. But for feet alone, it is just fine.</li>
            <li> I have callouses on the sides of both of my big toes. I have used other products that leave residue when you rub the callous off, but that is not the case with this foot file. When using it you can&#x27;t even tell by looking at it that you have been using it. I really like this product because it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> This worked much better than I ever would have imagined.  I like it better than my ped egg, It&#x27;s a bit easier to maneuver and faster, although you still have to wok at those tough areas.  I am going to use this weekly after doing a foot mask - I think it will be the perfect summer maintenance routine.</li>
            <li> The “Probelle 2-Sided Hypoallergenic Nickel Foot File for Callus Trimming and Callus Removal” may be exactly what you need to remove heavier calluses on your heels or big toes.  It is comfortable to hold and the coarse-bladed side does a quick job of callus removal.  I did find that using only this side of the file left small, raised pieces of skin on my foot that caught on fabric and hosiery.  Even following up with the medium-bladed side did not entirely alleviate this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the “Probelle 2-Sided Hypoallergenic Nickel Foot File for Callus Trimming and Callus Removal” with great care.  If you use the file with any amount of pressure or vigor, regardless of which of the two sides – coarse or medium – you choose the metal portion of this foot file will tear up your skin.  Nevertheless, this foot file does work well to remove heavy calluses.  It would have be helpful to have a fine-sided tool or sanding tool to smooth off the roughened skin that remains after the callus has been removed.</li>
            <li> I agree with others here. Be careful with this product. But if you are gentle, and do not scrape too hard, you will find that your calluses and corns go the way of the dinosaur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is far superior to pumous stones, which require a great deal more scrubing and take off far less dead skin at one shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent item</li>
            <li> My 76-year-old mom is a nail file connoisseur.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s bought MANY over her life.&lt;br /&gt;And she honestly says that this is the best one she&#x27;s ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a good enough endorsement for me.</li>
            <li> Best foot file, ever! Sturdily made, beautifully fashioned, and has done such a good job I recommended it to others who have reported back with similar remarks. In my opinion, these should be standard issue in every pedicure salon. Until then, I won&#x27;t let anyone near my heels with any other file. This is easy, smooth, almost fun (for it still being a chore) and gives you excellent feel of control so you don&#x27;t damage underlying tender skin.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty much what it is supposed to be, a two-sided foot file. That said, there are some good points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Well-made and sturdy, and likely to last.&lt;br /&gt;2. Very effective but not harsh. Much, much better than cheap and flimsy files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this file is made for its purpose, working on feet. It&#x27;s not a general purpose file that compromises. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on anything but feet, but then again, that&#x27;s what you buy it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No real downsides except that it costs a little more than cheap items. On the other hand, you can spend much, much more on &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; files so this represents a good value.</li>
            <li> I have serious callouses on my feet.  This product is the best.  I&#x27;ve tried everything else with limited results.  This one works great.</li>
            <li> This foot file is the best!!! Love that it is a 2 in 1 foot file. I used the coarse side and you can literally see the callus go away! The medium side is more for the finishing touches which is great so I can make sure I have baby feet! Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is for smoothing thick skin and calluses on your feet. I find it odd that something made of nickel is touted as hypoallergenic. Nickel is a frequent skin irritant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is fairly easy to use. It is more effective than some foot files, but I prefer the battery operated roller style because it works faster. If all you need is a way to smooth your heels, this should work well.</li>
            <li> Very effective foot file!  There are two sides, one is more aggressive than the other, start with that one over the roughest spots and then move to the smoother side.  I found that i needed to run something even smoother over my foot after that just to take the edges off, that is what I gave it 4 stars.  Overall it really does a good job of getting the dead skin off your heals and the sides of your feet.  I have only needed to use it once in two weeks, so that will tell you what a good job it does.  The handle is nice, makes it easier to use than my pedi-egg....but you do need to do it over a trash can since there isn&#x27;t anything to catch the dead skin.  Overall I am pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this footfile because I can control just how much callous to rub off at any time and the file lasts forever even with heavy use.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would buy one of these, figuring they&#x27;re only for women.  Have to say - so glad I did.  This made a remarkable difference for me and cleaned up those hard areas quickly.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I have decided that I too needed to take better care of my feet.  After watching the ladies of my life help to make their feet softer by using similar products, I thought I needed to do the same.  I always thought that the process was a little painful, and maybe it is with other products.  The Probelle foot file is very easy to use and there is NO discomfort.  The handle grip is very sturdy and conforms well to my hand.  So now along with lotion to my joints to keep my skin from cracking, I have another nifty tool to help me.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This can be a good file for large calluses, and possibly for some small ones, depending where on the foot they are. It is too large, however, for small calluses because it will end up removing too much non-callused skin. This is probably best for people with large rough patches on the heel. From the photos on the packaging, it looks like that is the intent.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, cleans easily, and does wonders on your feet!  I had bad calluses on my feet on my large toes and sides and some general roughness to my heels, but not anymore!  this product smoothed the roughness away and my feet are soft and smooth like they should be now!  I would definetly recommend.. this product works much better than any pumice stone or skin product I have used in the past!</li>
