            <li>I now have beautiful, dewy lashes that look amazing with any look</li>
            <li>I read and read about how this mascara was so good.</li>
            <li>This is a superior product.  </li>
            <li>Good mascara, but often chips / rubs into my eye and irritates it.</li>
            <li>I like it because it feels good on your lashes and it stays on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake either, and by the end of the day my lashes look just as good as they did in the morning.</li>
            <li>I bought it bc of the reviews and was amazed at how much i loved it.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t realize how good you&#x27;ve got it &#x27;till its gone?</li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with a good eyelash curler, it makes your eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>I am soooo sexy!&#x27;</li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>That said, I do love this brush and I give it 5 stars because for what there is, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake off which I love!  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Will defiantly Oder more!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, beautiful wand, terrific formula!</li>
            <li>The wand is amazing.</li>
            <li>It never smudges or flakes, looks amazing for hours on end and dries quickly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Washes off in the shower in flakes with just warm water.  </li>
            <li>But for my stick straight lack-luster eyelashes, this mascara gives me the best results.</li>
            <li>It washes off nicely.</li>
            <li>it makes my lashes look so nice.</li>
            <li>According to the ratings of this product and the cost, I was expecting something spectacular.</li>
            <li>and I still like my lashes to look nice.</li>
            <li>This is one of my very favorite mascaras :-)</li>
            <li>This mascara is pretty good!</li>
            <li>While our love is still new, I think the fairy Drops is my perfect mascara for dark, beautiful, perfect lashes.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>As a fitness instructor I need my mascaranto hold up during sweaty workouts and this doesn&#x27;t budge -- but I also want it to come off easily with cleanser, and it does!</li>
            <li>Plus, comes off easily with just some warm water, so no need to worry about damaging your lashes by scrubbing or using makeup remover.</li>
            <li>The mascara separates lashes making them look fuller and longer and is easy to apply (nice wand.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li>love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am a beauty junkie, and have used Lancome Definicils for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love this product; Sephora has stopped selling it in their stores</li>
            <li>People think I&#x27;m wearing flash lashes some times when I have this mascara on.  :)</li>
            <li>LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush and how it separates my eye lashes.</li>
            <li>so I gladly gave them(I bought 2) to</li>
            <li>It separates and makes my lashes look more voluminous.</li>
            <li>I did notice the longer that I used it the better it got.</li>
            <li>I think its better than Lancome</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li>Boy, was I glad.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the regular and waterproof versions, but I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>Fairydrops does that and more.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS, thought I had to trek to Sephora to get it</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I had to review my eyelashes and use my loreal miss manga waterproof mascara on top of it....</li>
            <li>sooo retreat buying it but will try and use it once more ....</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this mascara....</li>
            <li>This product is just okay for me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried better mascaras for a lower price.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad to find it on here.</li>
            <li>Bought cheaper mascara that worked a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara...</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li>I love the name &amp;#34;Fairydrops&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Created by a Japanese TV personality and truly the best mascara I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I was so dissappointed as I have a sensitivity to most mascaras.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s on the top of my list.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it and will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I love it and shipping</li>
            <li>Still not used to the goofy wand, but I do like the way it stays on and the way it comes off.  </li>
            <li>that costs under $6 is 100x&#x27;s better than this.</li>
            <li>I was devasted &amp; order 2 more that day.</li>
            <li>Now I keep them safe at home.</li>
            <li>This oneoffers nothing more than an $8.00 brand would offer you from Walmart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Best Mascara for asian lashes!</li>
            <li>I love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mascara for a couple of years now, and it is definitely the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and I love the qualities of this brand.</li>
            <li>The length the mascara gives is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>easy to take it off with make up remover and water.&lt;br /&gt;However as much as I love this, I was not be able to wear this.</li>
            <li>IT really does make my eyelashes look amazing!</li>
            <li>I do like the nice full look that I get.</li>
            <li>Anyway about the product: I really love it, it&#x27;s probably better than any I&#x27;ve used and definitely as good as any high end department store mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li>The brush really emphasizes and creates great  big, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>It washes off super easy, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It lengthens them, but more importantly, creates a TON of volume with no clumps of mascara to contend with.</li>
            <li>This mascara once in contact with cleanser of any kind sort of shrivels off your lash and washes right off.</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy, soft beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many mascaras out there, from drug store to high end brands, and this by FAR has been the best out there.</li>
            <li>It is easy application</li>
            <li>Removed easily with eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>But it will clump easy</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no clumping (ever), and easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>However, the product is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof but comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>it is fine.  </li>
            <li>Washes off easily with cleanser &amp; warm water or coconut oil; you just need to gently rub your lashes between your fingers.</li>
            <li>I can make them HUGE if I feel like</li>
            <li>and I would brave a website in Japanese just to purchase it.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara right now</li>
            <li>though - DO NOT LEAVE THIS IN A HOT CAR!!</li>
            <li>I was sooo excited about this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure they should have figured out</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t live up to its claim of washing away with warm water.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d have spent my money more wisely.</li>
            <li>I also love how you can layer it for drama or just use one coat for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>It gums up on their specially designed brush and my eyelashes clump together...</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Not only does this mascara elongate beautifully, but it separates lashes surprisingly well, looks extremely natural, and makes your lashes feel so soft!</li>
            <li>This mascara is so hard to find now but it&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding the perfect mascara</li>
            <li>But...it tends to clump on lashes real easy if your not careful when applying.</li>
            <li>really wanted be able to use this.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>really wanted to love this product, but it just did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>I swear a lot so put it through a true test.</li>
            <li>and so I have a fair amount of experience with different types of mascara...</li>
            <li>Reviews are right on - this is my new favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be loyal to fairy drops scandal queen mascara for life.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me the sales girl suggested I check out Amizon.  </li>
            <li>Coats well, thickens lashes quickly, and stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras from drugstore to high end  </li>
            <li>But the first time I tried FairyDrops, I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Good at lengthening and being water resistant, but I was hoping that this would help to thicken and voluminise my long, sparse lashes.  </li>
            <li>so I continue to try most new mascaras that come out, at all price points.</li>
            <li>I find that it is water resistant yet removes easily with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>curls at the same time, just love it!</li>
            <li>She was pretty excited to see that she get it online.  </li>
            <li>I used to jump around and buy a different mascara every time...but not any more!</li>
            <li>I love the packaging, the name the color (nice opaque black) &amp; the wand.</li>
            <li>Not only is the brush amazing</li>
            <li>, I know all you Asian ladies out there own one).&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Gives you the look of nice long and full lashes.</li>
            <li>I love the Tubing technology; makes it really easy to remove, yet stays put on my face all day long.  </li>
            <li>Being born Chinese results in a few great genetic traits (straight hair, flawless skin) but long, curly eyelashes are not one of them.</li>
            <li>I was originally intimidated by the bulbed bush, but it somehow really elongates and distributes the microfibers.  </li>
            <li>I use two coats to get them a bit longer and thicker, it doesn&#x27;t crumble off while you&#x27;re wearing it or smudge at all, but it washes right off with H20 &amp; cleanser no need for makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Then was pretty much thrilled to find it on here for the same price and Prime eligible!!</li>
            <li>No other is better.</li>
            <li>It lengthens like no other and can be layered for more volume.</li>
            <li>If you like mascaras like Clinque&#x27;s High Impact mascara or just enjoy length and volume, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I do like it a lot, but I find myself having to check the mirror more often to make sure I don&#x27;t have black spots on my face from the flaking.</li>
            <li>Also, worth noting, this one does not have a strong smell &amp; does not irritate my sensitive, contact lens wearing eyes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge on my oily skin like many other mascaras do and is easy to remove with soap and warm water--sometimes a tiny bit of eye makeup remover is necessary for the under-eye area, but mostly I don&#x27;t find that to be the case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on top lashes, but difficult to maneuver on lower lashes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara, I&#x27;m purchasing my second one right now and thought I&#x27;d add to the reviews.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast.  </li>
            <li>My lashes looked longer, more defined and naturally curled a little without even using my handy dandy Shu Uemura lash curler (don&#x27;t lie</li>
            <li>Thicker, longer, curlier lashes that can withstand sweat dripping off my eyelashes in spin class &amp; hot yoga.</li>
            <li>and this is the first to thicken, lengthen AND not flake off at all.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara I have tried - ever - that coats the bottom lashes without marking up your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the famous brands, but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>(most recently benefits they&#x27;re real!</li>
            <li>This was first recommended to me at a retail makeup shop</li>
            <li>I go to hot yoga</li>
            <li>I used a variety of high-end, designer mascaras throughout my teenage years that were never truly satisfying.</li>
            <li>I am very picky and this one makes the cut!</li>
            <li>I love Fairydrops mascara and have bought it several times.</li>
            <li>I first bought this mascara from Sephora but they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras ranging from $30.00 at Sephora, to Mac brands and Walmart Brands...</li>
            <li>I like it, but this one seems like a thinner formula than the first one I bought.  </li>
            <li>2nd favorite Mascara...</li>
            <li>Love it lashes look natural,  smooth and long</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this purchase, there is nothing exceptional about this mascara at all.</li>
            <li>I love how long it makes my lashes.</li>
            <li>this is pretty much the equivalent of the Shu Uemura curler but in mascara form.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m getting a new one!!</li>
            <li>I get beautiful, long, natural looking lashes that don&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes even after a long day and night of work and going out afterwards.</li>
            <li>It keep my lashes seperated and curled for the full day which no other mascara has come close to doing for me...</li>
            <li>sometimes it&#x27;s great to have a little MAC fix+ spray to bring it back to life after about a month of use.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of a mascara and have tried numerous brands.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real, or just Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the mascara</li>
            <li>It causes too much mascara to build up on one part of your lashes while you&#x27;re trying to get it on to others.</li>
            <li>There was so much hype for this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li>happy!!!we b ordering agin real soon</li>
            <li>so my lashes really need help to stand out.</li>
            <li>For the $24 price tag I expected much more.</li>
            <li>Thanks to her</li>
            <li>was so fast</li>
            <li>So much money for a product that didn&#x27;t perform as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>But the reviews made it seem like it would really make your lashes pop, not so.</li>
            <li>I was very saddened when Sephora discontinued this product from their stores.  </li>
            <li>I have very blond eyelashes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have been using for years, trying samples from other brands just to see if there is anything better</li>
            <li>This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m very sad they stopped carrying it at Sephora.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is that it washes off in strands as opposed to leaving black streaks under your eyes.</li>
            <li>For the cost, I feel like I could&#x27;ve gone to a local makeup counter and purchased something of equal quality, but more product.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and love how i dont have to curl my lashes and how much length it adds without clumping.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This mascara from Japan is affordable given its high quality properties.  </li>
            <li>High hopes dashed.  </li>
            <li>Japanese cosmetics and skincare have never failed me!</li>
            <li>I find the formula to be a little better</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been clumping, which I&#x27;d say is normal in that amount of time.</li>
            <li>Just normal mascara.  </li>
            <li>For those of us too lazy to add the extra step of eye makeup remover to their nightly routine, this stuff is PERFECT: doesn&#x27;t smudge or migrate down your eyes all day, but rinses off with water.</li>
            <li>it made my eyes itches by end of a day.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s bummer that my eyes are super sensitive and I can only wear 1 or 2 kinds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Diorshow for the longest time, but I think this will be my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li>However, I have drugstore brands that do that EXACT same thing.</li>
            <li>Brush is curved to give more flexibility with the small lashes.</li>
            <li>Mascara dried out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Just be careful to work quickly if you want to put on two coats (I always do).  </li>
            <li>Seemed a little cheap.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it seems to flake off more easily than other premium mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I had spent so much money on mascara, too much money.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a make-up artist friend, and I cannot say enough how much it has changed my life.  </li>
            <li>I tried to go to another brand but came back to this one as fast as I could.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and makes lashes appear longer and thicker with just one coat.  </li>
            <li>or they actually changed the formula, but the tube I bought recently is very gloppy and does not look like it used to when on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It stays on the whole day and only comes off when I wash my face with soap at the end of the night.  </li>
            <li>get the damn thing if you read this far.</li>
            <li>And this is far from it...</li>
            <li>have sensitive eyes, and this doesn&#x27;t bother them..</li>
            <li>I though that investing in this mascara would be worth it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase after this one is empty.</li>
            <li>Good for thin Asian lashes like mine!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look fake but in a really good way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much a mascara fiend and have tried almost everything out there from the expensive to the cheap.</li>
            <li>I have short, straight, light eyelashes (typical Asian) and</li>
            <li>I will never change my mascara again, so long as Fairydrops continues to make this particular formula!</li>
            <li>With this particular Fairydrops mascara, my eyelashes stay curled and are super long without weighing them down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fortunate enough that my eyelashes are long for an Asian, but they are super straight and thin.</li>
            <li>It also lengthens and curls my lashes like no other.</li>
            <li>A Revlon, Maybelline or any other Walmart brand will give you exactly what this mascara does.</li>
            <li>Super black and big drama without the raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be no better than the mascara available at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>However, I feel it does give a natural look for the LOWER LASHES, so I will continue to use this product for my lower lashes, but will likely NOT purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I have had it for over 5 months and although it&#x27;s not empty</li>
            <li>This mascara is nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li>Very dark black which I love and</li>
            <li>Your lashes will be longer, fuller, and more dramatic.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product due to all the positive reviews and was pretty anxious to try it out.</li>
            <li>Yes, it makes your lashes pop, but the brush is so full of clumps after a few uses, that I waste half the mascara if I clean the brush enough to use it!</li>
            <li>It takes several coats to get it to go on thick and full.</li>
            <li>No other mascara has ever made my lashes look this long.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I now have beautiful, dewy lashes that look amazing with any look</li>
            <li> I read and read about how this mascara was so good.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product.  </li>
            <li> Good mascara, but often chips / rubs into my eye and irritates it.</li>
            <li> I like it because it feels good on your lashes and it stays on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake either, and by the end of the day my lashes look just as good as they did in the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought it bc of the reviews and was amazed at how much i loved it.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t realize how good you&#x27;ve got it &#x27;till its gone?</li>
            <li> When used in conjunction with a good eyelash curler, it makes your eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> I am soooo sexy!&#x27;</li>
            <li> You will love it!</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake off which I love!  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara!</li>
            <li> Will defiantly Oder more!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, beautiful wand, terrific formula!</li>
            <li> The wand is amazing.</li>
            <li> It never smudges or flakes, looks amazing for hours on end and dries quickly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Washes off in the shower in flakes with just warm water.  </li>
            <li> But for my stick straight lack-luster eyelashes, this mascara gives me the best results.</li>
            <li> It washes off nicely.</li>
            <li> it makes my lashes look so nice.</li>
            <li> According to the ratings of this product and the cost, I was expecting something spectacular.</li>
            <li> and I still like my lashes to look nice.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite mascaras :-)</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty good!</li>
            <li> While our love is still new, I think the fairy Drops is my perfect mascara for dark, beautiful, perfect lashes.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> As a fitness instructor I need my mascaranto hold up during sweaty workouts and this doesn&#x27;t budge -- but I also want it to come off easily with cleanser, and it does!</li>
            <li> Plus, comes off easily with just some warm water, so no need to worry about damaging your lashes by scrubbing or using makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The mascara separates lashes making them look fuller and longer and is easy to apply (nice wand.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty junkie, and have used Lancome Definicils for many years.  </li>
            <li> Love this product; Sephora has stopped selling it in their stores</li>
            <li> People think I&#x27;m wearing flash lashes some times when I have this mascara on.  :)</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love the brush and how it separates my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> so I gladly gave them(I bought 2) to</li>
            <li> It separates and makes my lashes look more voluminous.</li>
            <li> I did notice the longer that I used it the better it got.</li>
            <li> I think its better than Lancome</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> Boy, was I glad.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the regular and waterproof versions, but I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Fairydrops does that and more.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS, thought I had to trek to Sephora to get it</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I had to review my eyelashes and use my loreal miss manga waterproof mascara on top of it....</li>
            <li> sooo retreat buying it but will try and use it once more ....</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara....</li>
            <li> This product is just okay for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried better mascaras for a lower price.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad to find it on here.</li>
            <li> Bought cheaper mascara that worked a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara...</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li> I love the name &amp;#34;Fairydrops&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Created by a Japanese TV personality and truly the best mascara I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I was so dissappointed as I have a sensitivity to most mascaras.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s on the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it and will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I love it and shipping</li>
            <li> Still not used to the goofy wand, but I do like the way it stays on and the way it comes off.  </li>
            <li> that costs under $6 is 100x&#x27;s better than this.</li>
            <li> I was devasted &amp; order 2 more that day.</li>
            <li> Now I keep them safe at home.</li>
            <li> This oneoffers nothing more than an $8.00 brand would offer you from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Best Mascara for asian lashes!</li>
            <li> I love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for a couple of years now, and it is definitely the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and I love the qualities of this brand.</li>
            <li> The length the mascara gives is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> easy to take it off with make up remover and water.&lt;br /&gt;However as much as I love this, I was not be able to wear this.</li>
            <li> IT really does make my eyelashes look amazing!</li>
            <li> I do like the nice full look that I get.</li>
            <li> Anyway about the product: I really love it, it&#x27;s probably better than any I&#x27;ve used and definitely as good as any high end department store mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li> The brush really emphasizes and creates great  big, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> It washes off super easy, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It lengthens them, but more importantly, creates a TON of volume with no clumps of mascara to contend with.</li>
            <li> This mascara once in contact with cleanser of any kind sort of shrivels off your lash and washes right off.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy, soft beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras out there, from drug store to high end brands, and this by FAR has been the best out there.</li>
            <li> It is easy application</li>
            <li> Removed easily with eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> But it will clump easy</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no clumping (ever), and easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> However, the product is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof but comes off easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> it is fine.  </li>
            <li> Washes off easily with cleanser &amp; warm water or coconut oil; you just need to gently rub your lashes between your fingers.</li>
            <li> I can make them HUGE if I feel like</li>
            <li> and I would brave a website in Japanese just to purchase it.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara right now</li>
            <li> though - DO NOT LEAVE THIS IN A HOT CAR!!</li>
            <li> I was sooo excited about this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure they should have figured out</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t live up to its claim of washing away with warm water.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d have spent my money more wisely.</li>
            <li> I also love how you can layer it for drama or just use one coat for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> It gums up on their specially designed brush and my eyelashes clump together...</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Not only does this mascara elongate beautifully, but it separates lashes surprisingly well, looks extremely natural, and makes your lashes feel so soft!</li>
            <li> This mascara is so hard to find now but it&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding the perfect mascara</li>
            <li> But...it tends to clump on lashes real easy if your not careful when applying.</li>
            <li> really wanted be able to use this.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> really wanted to love this product, but it just did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I swear a lot so put it through a true test.</li>
            <li> and so I have a fair amount of experience with different types of mascara...</li>
            <li> Reviews are right on - this is my new favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be loyal to fairy drops scandal queen mascara for life.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me the sales girl suggested I check out Amizon.  </li>
            <li> Coats well, thickens lashes quickly, and stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras from drugstore to high end  </li>
            <li> But the first time I tried FairyDrops, I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Good at lengthening and being water resistant, but I was hoping that this would help to thicken and voluminise my long, sparse lashes.  </li>
            <li> so I continue to try most new mascaras that come out, at all price points.</li>
            <li> I find that it is water resistant yet removes easily with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> curls at the same time, just love it!</li>
            <li> She was pretty excited to see that she get it online.  </li>
            <li> I used to jump around and buy a different mascara every time...but not any more!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, the name the color (nice opaque black) &amp; the wand.</li>
            <li> Not only is the brush amazing</li>
            <li> , I know all you Asian ladies out there own one).&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Gives you the look of nice long and full lashes.</li>
            <li> I love the Tubing technology; makes it really easy to remove, yet stays put on my face all day long.  </li>
            <li> Being born Chinese results in a few great genetic traits (straight hair, flawless skin) but long, curly eyelashes are not one of them.</li>
            <li> I was originally intimidated by the bulbed bush, but it somehow really elongates and distributes the microfibers.  </li>
            <li> I use two coats to get them a bit longer and thicker, it doesn&#x27;t crumble off while you&#x27;re wearing it or smudge at all, but it washes right off with H20 &amp; cleanser no need for makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Then was pretty much thrilled to find it on here for the same price and Prime eligible!!</li>
            <li> No other is better.</li>
            <li> It lengthens like no other and can be layered for more volume.</li>
            <li> If you like mascaras like Clinque&#x27;s High Impact mascara or just enjoy length and volume, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I do like it a lot, but I find myself having to check the mirror more often to make sure I don&#x27;t have black spots on my face from the flaking.</li>
            <li> Also, worth noting, this one does not have a strong smell &amp; does not irritate my sensitive, contact lens wearing eyes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge on my oily skin like many other mascaras do and is easy to remove with soap and warm water--sometimes a tiny bit of eye makeup remover is necessary for the under-eye area, but mostly I don&#x27;t find that to be the case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on top lashes, but difficult to maneuver on lower lashes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara, I&#x27;m purchasing my second one right now and thought I&#x27;d add to the reviews.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast.  </li>
            <li> My lashes looked longer, more defined and naturally curled a little without even using my handy dandy Shu Uemura lash curler (don&#x27;t lie</li>
            <li> Thicker, longer, curlier lashes that can withstand sweat dripping off my eyelashes in spin class &amp; hot yoga.</li>
            <li> and this is the first to thicken, lengthen AND not flake off at all.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have tried - ever - that coats the bottom lashes without marking up your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the famous brands, but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> (most recently benefits they&#x27;re real!</li>
            <li> This was first recommended to me at a retail makeup shop</li>
            <li> I go to hot yoga</li>
            <li> I used a variety of high-end, designer mascaras throughout my teenage years that were never truly satisfying.</li>
            <li> I am very picky and this one makes the cut!</li>
            <li> I love Fairydrops mascara and have bought it several times.</li>
            <li> I first bought this mascara from Sephora but they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras ranging from $30.00 at Sephora, to Mac brands and Walmart Brands...</li>
            <li> I like it, but this one seems like a thinner formula than the first one I bought.  </li>
            <li> 2nd favorite Mascara...</li>
            <li> Love it lashes look natural,  smooth and long</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this purchase, there is nothing exceptional about this mascara at all.</li>
            <li> I love how long it makes my lashes.</li>
            <li> this is pretty much the equivalent of the Shu Uemura curler but in mascara form.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m getting a new one!!</li>
            <li> I get beautiful, long, natural looking lashes that don&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes even after a long day and night of work and going out afterwards.</li>
            <li> It keep my lashes seperated and curled for the full day which no other mascara has come close to doing for me...</li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s great to have a little MAC fix+ spray to bring it back to life after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of a mascara and have tried numerous brands.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real, or just Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the mascara</li>
            <li> It causes too much mascara to build up on one part of your lashes while you&#x27;re trying to get it on to others.</li>
            <li> There was so much hype for this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> happy!!!we b ordering agin real soon</li>
            <li> so my lashes really need help to stand out.</li>
            <li> For the $24 price tag I expected much more.</li>
            <li> Thanks to her</li>
            <li> was so fast</li>
            <li> So much money for a product that didn&#x27;t perform as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> But the reviews made it seem like it would really make your lashes pop, not so.</li>
            <li> I was very saddened when Sephora discontinued this product from their stores.  </li>
            <li> I have very blond eyelashes</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using for years, trying samples from other brands just to see if there is anything better</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m very sad they stopped carrying it at Sephora.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is that it washes off in strands as opposed to leaving black streaks under your eyes.</li>
            <li> For the cost, I feel like I could&#x27;ve gone to a local makeup counter and purchased something of equal quality, but more product.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love how i dont have to curl my lashes and how much length it adds without clumping.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This mascara from Japan is affordable given its high quality properties.  </li>
            <li> High hopes dashed.  </li>
            <li> Japanese cosmetics and skincare have never failed me!</li>
            <li> I find the formula to be a little better</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been clumping, which I&#x27;d say is normal in that amount of time.</li>
            <li> Just normal mascara.  </li>
            <li> For those of us too lazy to add the extra step of eye makeup remover to their nightly routine, this stuff is PERFECT: doesn&#x27;t smudge or migrate down your eyes all day, but rinses off with water.</li>
            <li> it made my eyes itches by end of a day.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s bummer that my eyes are super sensitive and I can only wear 1 or 2 kinds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Diorshow for the longest time, but I think this will be my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li> However, I have drugstore brands that do that EXACT same thing.</li>
            <li> Brush is curved to give more flexibility with the small lashes.</li>
            <li> Mascara dried out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to work quickly if you want to put on two coats (I always do).  </li>
            <li> Seemed a little cheap.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to flake off more easily than other premium mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I had spent so much money on mascara, too much money.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a make-up artist friend, and I cannot say enough how much it has changed my life.  </li>
            <li> I tried to go to another brand but came back to this one as fast as I could.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and makes lashes appear longer and thicker with just one coat.  </li>
            <li> or they actually changed the formula, but the tube I bought recently is very gloppy and does not look like it used to when on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It stays on the whole day and only comes off when I wash my face with soap at the end of the night.  </li>
            <li> get the damn thing if you read this far.</li>
            <li> And this is far from it...</li>
            <li> have sensitive eyes, and this doesn&#x27;t bother them..</li>
            <li> I though that investing in this mascara would be worth it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase after this one is empty.</li>
            <li> Good for thin Asian lashes like mine!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look fake but in a really good way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much a mascara fiend and have tried almost everything out there from the expensive to the cheap.</li>
            <li> I have short, straight, light eyelashes (typical Asian) and</li>
            <li> I will never change my mascara again, so long as Fairydrops continues to make this particular formula!</li>
            <li> With this particular Fairydrops mascara, my eyelashes stay curled and are super long without weighing them down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate enough that my eyelashes are long for an Asian, but they are super straight and thin.</li>
            <li> It also lengthens and curls my lashes like no other.</li>
            <li> A Revlon, Maybelline or any other Walmart brand will give you exactly what this mascara does.</li>
            <li> Super black and big drama without the raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be no better than the mascara available at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> However, I feel it does give a natural look for the LOWER LASHES, so I will continue to use this product for my lower lashes, but will likely NOT purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have had it for over 5 months and although it&#x27;s not empty</li>
            <li> This mascara is nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> Very dark black which I love and</li>
            <li> Your lashes will be longer, fuller, and more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to all the positive reviews and was pretty anxious to try it out.</li>
            <li> Yes, it makes your lashes pop, but the brush is so full of clumps after a few uses, that I waste half the mascara if I clean the brush enough to use it!</li>
            <li> It takes several coats to get it to go on thick and full.</li>
            <li> No other mascara has ever made my lashes look this long.</li>
            <li> It may dry out a little faster than other mascaras, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every mascara out there - from high-end tubes to the classic pink and green tube that&#x27;s been a staple for women for ages...</li>
            <li> Only thing to think about—the same fibers that make your lashes look long, are the same fibers that can potentially get in your eye.</li>
            <li> but it totally fell flat.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality, however, for being a full size mascara, I was shocked at how little product it contained.</li>
            <li> Too bad Seph doesn&#x27;t carry anymore but glad to find it here!</li>
            <li> it will make lashes so long and make eyes pops.</li>
            <li> I have really short, thin, blonde, straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes long and also</li>
            <li> I like how my lashes feel once dried completely.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my lashes curled and long, no clumps, no raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> But after a few uses the brush is hopelessly clogged and will make an absolute mess out of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> It can be difficult to remove, but overall worth it.</li>
            <li> Single.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this mascara before and loved it not sure maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> Sadly they just don&#x27;t last for ever no matter how much you spend.</li>
            <li> will admit that there was a brief period a few months ago when I ran out of FairyDrops and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I resorted to buying a Dior bottle from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find a dupe just in case this discontinues (I hope it stays around for a long time) but have had no success.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and used to buy it at Sephora and was crushed when they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few of these mascaras for my sister because it was discontinued at her local store.  </li>
            <li> Ever.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously I will never ever ever bother with other brands.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will try one more tube before I decide to give up on Fairydrops... :(</li>
            <li> I was soooo disappointed I went to Amazon to search for it and was able to find it.  </li>
            <li> This mascara was everything I expected!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it smudges within the first hour from application.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d rather buy Lash Blast or some other choice.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first bottle she used seemed to contain a lot less product than what was expected.  </li>
            <li> Heard all the hype about this product and had very high hopes for but....it was a big disappointment as soon as I put it on my eyelashes drooped down....</li>
            <li> The 1st and 2nd time I noticed a few of my natural lashes falling out, this third time I lost at least 6 lashes on one eye!!!  </li>
            <li> For the cost of this it is not worth it..</li>
            <li> and this is the ONE mascara that doesnt melt down your face in the heat.</li>
            <li> And, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your lashes.</li>
            <li> Non waterproof seems harder to find!!</li>
            <li> In fact, they all had such little impact that I honestly never saw the point in using mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black under the eyes upon washing.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats Christian Dior Blackout, and I will just have to pay for that expensive option next time.</li>
            <li> but hopefully this might be the odd one out of the batch.</li>
            <li> I can even cry a little and my lashes will look untouched.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the other bottles that were also purchase - won&#x27;t be opened until they need to be used -  </li>
            <li> All it does is gives your lashes a little curl and that is about it... if your looking for length and volume then your out of luck.</li>
            <li> Not Worth it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> As a note, I have thin asian lashes.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Usually mascaras weigh down my eyelashes, so they never stay curled.  </li>
            <li> So black!</li>
            <li> This one in particular is very thick &amp; gives a dramatic, doll-like look to your lashes.  </li>
            <li> They will NOT smudge even after a 16 hour day, or crying, or both!  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Bonus is it&#x27;s cheaper then all my usual favorites.  </li>
            <li> but was not able to wear so took 1 star out of 5.</li>
            <li> I usually use Lancome Hypnose and I wanted to try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just a fluke</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> (maybe the waterproof ingredients take away a bit?), but it NEVER smudges or smears, which is usually a problem for me even with waterproof mascaras.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with a face wipe before class but am sometimes too lazy to wash off my mascara</li>
            <li> Was no satisfied with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t flake budge or come off when it rain hard.</li>
            <li> It instantly adds volume and crazy length to each eyelash.</li>
            <li> If I had to say something negative about this</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say at all.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and thick.</li>
            <li> It gives me thick lashes</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not exactly amazing.</li>
            <li> The wax base prevents it from getting clumpy or dry like Dior Show but keeps your lashes looking thick and long all day.</li>
            <li> The wand is ridiculous and pointlessly shaped!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all to my poor eyes&#x27; puffy complaint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find, so buy it here while you can!</li>
            <li> But alas.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t happen often, but when it does, it&#x27;s only mildly annoying.</li>
            <li> People always ask if I have false lashes on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not.</li>
            <li> But the brush is weird.</li>
            <li> the wand is weird to start with, but once you figure it out...</li>
            <li> Sadly, they discontinued carrying it</li>
            <li> the brush was useless in the trials.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a horrible applicator and seems dry and thick!!</li>
            <li> It came with a hefty price tag, but I was desperate.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find in the stores these days.</li>
            <li> Too bad Sephora stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that Sephora does not carry this product anymore.  </li>
            <li> Bad tube?</li>
            <li> i too was disappointed sephora stopped selling it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so upset, wish I could return this :(</li>
            <li> and I hate that.</li>
            <li> Worst.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> The worst i´ve ever bought.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t live up to its claim of washing away with warm water. It&#x27;s black under the eyes upon washing. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> love this mascara. i too was disappointed sephora stopped selling it.  Recently went to Japan and looked for it because i thought a japanese t.v. personality created it but could not find it anywhere.  Is it marketed for sales outside of Japan?</li>
            <li> Thicker, longer, curlier lashes that can withstand sweat dripping off my eyelashes in spin class &amp; hot yoga. Washes off easily with cleanser &amp; warm water or coconut oil; you just need to gently rub your lashes between your fingers. Love it.</li>
            <li> I read and read about how this mascara was so good. It was no different than Maybelline. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all when it comes to mascara and this is the first to thicken, lengthen AND not flake off at all. I love how long it makes my lashes. It&#x27;s incredible. Washes off with water but doesn&#x27;t flake to under eyes. I love it!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a make-up artist friend, and I cannot say enough how much it has changed my life.  Your lashes will be longer, fuller, and more dramatic.  They will NOT smudge even after a 16 hour day, or crying, or both!  Washes off in the shower in flakes with just warm water.  I am a beauty junkie, and have used Lancome Definicils for many years.  But now there is no going back.  This is a superior product.  Just be careful to work quickly if you want to put on two coats (I always do).  It dries very fast.  Love this product; Sephora has stopped selling it in their stores but thankfully I found it online here.</li>
            <li> Good mascara, but often chips / rubs into my eye and irritates it. :/</li>
            <li> Amazing!  People think I&#x27;m wearing flash lashes some times when I have this mascara on.  :)</li>
            <li> Reviews are right on - this is my new favorite mascara!  Bonus is it&#x27;s cheaper then all my usual favorites.  Additional bonus is water resistant.  Rich, creamy, soft beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara.  I might be a mascara snob... and this is a great product.  I love the brush and how it separates my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.  My sister-in-law uses this brand and this brand only, but I wasn&#x27;t sold.  It is easy application but I felt like I had to apply over and over and over again to get the look I wanted, then I felt like the curl didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news: I didn&#x27;t see smudging or flakes.  Removed easily with eye makeup remover.  I wear contacts and I didn&#x27;t realize notice any irruption on the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the Only mascara I&#x27;ve used that actually stays on and looks the same at night when I take it off!</li>
            <li> Best Mascara ever!  I love the Tubing technology; makes it really easy to remove, yet stays put on my face all day long.  This one in particular is very thick &amp; gives a dramatic, doll-like look to your lashes.  Most regular mascaras will give me raccoon eyes by noon or, just be so smeary &amp; difficult to remove. Also, worth noting, this one does not have a strong smell &amp; does not irritate my sensitive, contact lens wearing eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. it will make lashes so long and make eyes pops. also it will not smudge at all even it&#x27;s not waterproof. easy to take it off with make up remover and water.&lt;br /&gt;However as much as I love this, I was not be able to wear this. it made my eyes itches by end of a day.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s bummer that my eyes are super sensitive and I can only wear 1 or 2 kinds.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted be able to use this.&lt;br /&gt;my daughter loves this mascara and she can wear it so I gladly gave them(I bought 2) to her.&lt;br /&gt;love everything about this mascara but was not able to wear so took 1 star out of 5.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I can still buy this through amazon. I was introduced to it years ago at sephora and then they stopped carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit of a makeup junky so I continue to try most new mascaras that come out, at all price points. But for my stick straight lack-luster eyelashes, this mascara gives me the best results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great mascara. It separates and makes my lashes look more voluminous. However, I have drugstore brands that do that EXACT same thing. I though that investing in this mascara would be worth it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase after this one is empty. I prefer Clinique, Benefit They&#x27;re Real, or just Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t meet my $23 expectations.</li>
            <li> Good at lengthening and being water resistant, but I was hoping that this would help to thicken and voluminise my long, sparse lashes.  Unfortunately it did not.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. But the brush is weird. It&#x27;s hard to get used to. It&#x27;s great on top lashes, but difficult to maneuver on lower lashes.</li>
            <li> I usually use Lancome Hypnose and I wanted to try this. I like it because it feels good on your lashes and it stays on. It washes off nicely. But...it tends to clump on lashes real easy if your not careful when applying. I did notice the longer that I used it the better it got. But Lacome is the same way. It takes several coats to get it to go on thick and full. But it will clump easy so you have to take care to separate with brush. I do like the nice full look that I get. I have to say that it is the best mascara I have used yet. I think its better than Lancome and it&#x27;s the same price.</li>
            <li> Good for thin Asian lashes like mine! It definitely makes a difference. Too bad Sephora stopped carrying it. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. it makes my lashes look so nice. No other is better. I&#x27;ll be loyal to fairy drops scandal queen mascara for life.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m very sad they stopped carrying it at Sephora.  It&#x27;s pricy, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever used. It instantly adds volume and crazy length to each eyelash. It doesn&#x27;t smudge at all, but since it is a tubing mascara, each eyelash gets coated. Removing this mascara is very simple. I tried to go to another brand but came back to this one as fast as I could.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara on the recommendation of a blogger. She claimed it made her eyes look like a teenage vamp. I was sold ;) So I bought it. Most expensive mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought and boy am I glad I did! Blog-lady was not lying!!!! IT really does make my eyelashes look amazing! AH-MAY-ZING!!!</li>
            <li> I have really short, thin, blonde, straight eyelashes. When I was younger, I realized that the thing I need was to use mascara. One that would lengthen, volumize, darken, and curl. But alas. In the years since the wand was invented, this is still a dream.   The closest I&#x27;ve come is revlon grow lucious and fairy drops.  While our love is still new, I think the fairy Drops is my perfect mascara for dark, beautiful, perfect lashes.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite so when I find it she is so happy. A++++ seller. Thank You</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every mascara out there - from high-end tubes to the classic pink and green tube that&#x27;s been a staple for women for ages... I read about this online on a blog about trending Asian makeups, and decided to give it a shot.  Boy, was I glad.  Best mascara EVER.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried them ALL). The wax base prevents it from getting clumpy or dry like Dior Show but keeps your lashes looking thick and long all day. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have the shortest stubbiest lashes and tiny eyes so I NEED mascara. The problem is I am allergic to them. Every. Single. One. You name it I have tried them all to my poor eyes&#x27; puffy complaint. Only I hear about this miracle mascara that a Japanese lady with the very same problem as myself has invented. It came with a hefty price tag, but I was desperate. Best. Makeup. Purchase. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously I will never ever ever bother with other brands. I recommend this to everyone who ever wears mascara. Not only is the brush amazing and it NEVER clumps, but it WORKS and I am NOT ALLERGIC! I now have beautiful, dewy lashes that look amazing with any look I could ever hope to achieve. I get length, volume, separation, definition and that dewy &#x27;OMFG I am soooo sexy!&#x27; look with literally one swipe. If I had to say something negative about this I couldn&#x27;t. It is a steal at any price for me and I would brave a website in Japanese just to purchase it. Nope- I have nothing negative to say at all. Buy it. You will love it!</li>
            <li> My friend bought this for me for my birthday from Sephora. When I went back to get it again, they were sold out and only found it on Amazon. This is the BEST mascara ever. I&#x27;m fortunate enough that my eyelashes are long for an Asian, but they are super straight and thin. Usually mascaras weigh down my eyelashes, so they never stay curled.  With this particular Fairydrops mascara, my eyelashes stay curled and are super long without weighing them down. I will never change my mascara again, so long as Fairydrops continues to make this particular formula! The best ever!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara..it doesn&#x27;t smudge, washes off well, builds on lashes well.  But after a few uses the brush is hopelessly clogged and will make an absolute mess out of my lashes.  I really like the mascara so i have tried this on 3 tubes now, i have resorted to throwing out their brush and using one for a diff tube of mascara to apply the fairy drops.  Masccara 5 stars..brush 1 star&#x3D;3 stars</li>
            <li> This mascara from Japan is affordable given its high quality properties.  It does not smudge or flake.  It looks natural and makes lashes appear longer and thicker with just one coat.  It&#x27;s too bad that Sephora does not carry this product anymore.  Thank goodness I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just a fluke or they actually changed the formula, but the tube I bought recently is very gloppy and does not look like it used to when on my eyelashes. It gums up on their specially designed brush and my eyelashes clump together... It never caused that before. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I started using this a couple of years ago and really loved it! Maybe I will try one more tube before I decide to give up on Fairydrops... :(</li>
            <li> The wand is ridiculous and pointlessly shaped! It causes too much mascara to build up on one part of your lashes while you&#x27;re trying to get it on to others. It doesn&#x27;t curl your lashes like it says. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this product. There was so much hype for this but it totally fell flat.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have tried - ever - that coats the bottom lashes without marking up your face.  The wand is amazing.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so hard to find now but it&#x27;s amazing!!! No other mascara has ever made my lashes look this long. Ordering another tube after I finish writing this!</li>
            <li> Mascara dried out very quickly. I have ordered this mascara before and loved it not sure maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> Clumpy and thick. Definitely had to go through with a comb after. Seemed a little cheap. Should have just stuck with a drug store product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake and keeps me from looking like a raccoon, while giving me great looking lashes. I&#x27;ve tried all the famous brands, but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> If you like mascaras like Clinque&#x27;s High Impact mascara or just enjoy length and volume, this is for you. I dont worry about curl because that is not an issue for me. I was hesitant&lt;br /&gt;about the wand, but it works so well! Japanese cosmetics and skincare have never failed me!</li>
            <li> Not only does this mascara elongate beautifully, but it separates lashes surprisingly well, looks extremely natural, and makes your lashes feel so soft! I was originally intimidated by the bulbed bush, but it somehow really elongates and distributes the microfibers.  I highly recommend this mascara! Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My eyelashes are like whoa. So black! Only thing to think about—the same fibers that make your lashes look long, are the same fibers that can potentially get in your eye. It doesn&#x27;t happen often, but when it does, it&#x27;s only mildly annoying.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras out there, from drug store to high end brands, and this by FAR has been the best out there. It makes me lashes thicker, longer, and holds a great curl. I have tried both the regular and waterproof versions, but I like this one the best. I find the formula to be a little better (maybe the waterproof ingredients take away a bit?), but it NEVER smudges or smears, which is usually a problem for me even with waterproof mascaras. I can even cry a little and my lashes will look untouched. It doesn&#x27;t flake either, and by the end of the day my lashes look just as good as they did in the morning. Plus, comes off easily with just some warm water, so no need to worry about damaging your lashes by scrubbing or using makeup remover. I have been using for years, trying samples from other brands just to see if there is anything better (most recently benefits they&#x27;re real! and Elizabeth Mott It&#x27;s so big), but there is not!</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations! I was looking specifically for a non-smudge, non-flake mascara. Fairydrops does that and more. I get beautiful, long, natural looking lashes that don&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes even after a long day and night of work and going out afterwards. Best chance I&#x27;ve ever taken was trying Fairydrops!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS, thought I had to trek to Sephora to get it but I can send it to my house!!! And it came the NEXT DAY!!!!! Great, non-clumpy, lashes for days!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It stays on the whole day and only comes off when I wash my face with soap at the end of the night.  This was first recommended to me at a retail makeup shop and then they stopped selling it.  I was soooo disappointed I went to Amazon to search for it and was able to find it.  This became my only place to order Fairydrops mascara and I do so every 3-4 months to replace it.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding the perfect mascara but my friend recommended this to me and these are the only mascara i use!</li>
            <li> I lovee this mascara. it gives a lot of volumee and length. I always use it after i put on my regular mascara to coat it. I would deff buy againn.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever get rid of this product.  It&#x27;s the only mascara that works for my stick-straight Asian lashes!  Easy to apply, no clumping (ever), and easy to wash off.  Super black and big drama without the raccoon eyes.  Even after running 5-8 miles it stays on my lashes, no matter how sweaty I get.</li>
            <li> Heard all the hype about this product and had very high hopes for but....it was a big disappointment as soon as I put it on my eyelashes drooped down....I had to review my eyelashes and use my loreal miss manga waterproof mascara on top of it....sooo retreat buying it but will try and use it once more ....if not will use for lower lashes only ....</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara....I bought it bc of the reviews and was amazed at how much i loved it. Ordering another one. I go to hot yoga and this actually STAYS put. I wash my face with a face wipe before class but am sometimes too lazy to wash off my mascara and this is the ONE mascara that doesnt melt down your face in the heat.</li>
            <li> Love it lashes look natural,  smooth and long</li>
            <li> It definitely is waterproof... I am asain and so I need length and volume... This did not do the job for me. Will be searching for that perfect mascara... Non waterproof seems harder to find!!</li>
            <li> Tried lots of different brands, and this one lives up to it&#x27;s name.  Makes my lashes long and also curls at the same time, just love it!</li>
            <li> This product is just okay for me.  I have tried better mascaras for a lower price.  I wish the pigment was darker.  As a note, I have thin asian lashes.  This product just did not hold up my curls even with a curler in place.  However, the product is easy to remove.  You just need water (no need for an eye make-up remover).  The lengthening of this mascara is a joke to me, I have used drugstore lengthening mascaras that work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this product, but it just did not work for me.  However, I feel it does give a natural look for the LOWER LASHES, so I will continue to use this product for my lower lashes, but will likely NOT purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty good! I like how my lashes feel once dried completely.  It keep my lashes seperated and curled for the full day which no other mascara has come close to doing for me...name brand or drug store.  I curl my lashes before applying and it lasts all day.  Very dark black which I love and the formulation is perfect.</li>
            <li> This mascara was everything I expected! They no longer sell it I. The US so I&#x27;m glad to find it on here.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!! And I got it in 2days after I order it..supper happy!!!we b ordering agin real soon</li>
            <li> I bought it for the great reviews, and it does look great. I&#x27;m 48 so my lashes really need help to stand out. The brush really emphasizes and creates great  big, beautiful lashes. My only complaint is that it seems to flake off more easily than other premium mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. I do like it a lot, but I find myself having to check the mirror more often to make sure I don&#x27;t have black spots on my face from the flaking.</li>
            <li> Being born Chinese results in a few great genetic traits (straight hair, flawless skin) but long, curly eyelashes are not one of them. I used a variety of high-end, designer mascaras throughout my teenage years that were never truly satisfying. In fact, they all had such little impact that I honestly never saw the point in using mascara. But the first time I tried FairyDrops, I noticed a HUGE difference. My lashes looked longer, more defined and naturally curled a little without even using my handy dandy Shu Uemura lash curler (don&#x27;t lie, I know all you Asian ladies out there own one).&lt;br /&gt;Well... this is pretty much the equivalent of the Shu Uemura curler but in mascara form. It&#x27;s universally awesome and works its magic on everyone. It never smudges or flakes, looks amazing for hours on end and dries quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that there was a brief period a few months ago when I ran out of FairyDrops and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I resorted to buying a Dior bottle from Sephora. Ugh. Worst. Decision. Ever. You know that saying... you don&#x27;t realize how good you&#x27;ve got it &#x27;till its gone? Well, it applies to both relationships and mascara. Once you go FairyDrops, you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> Bought cheaper mascara that worked a lot better.  Was no satisfied with this and I&#x27;ll never purchase again.  It&#x27;s got a horrible applicator and seems dry and thick!!</li>
            <li> I was sooo excited about this mascara.  It is so gunky!  when you pull the brush out of the bottle, it is caked in tons of the mascara. You have to scrape the brush off back in the bottle before you can even use it.  My lashes were flaking and were not longer.  High hopes dashed.  GUNKY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara...the wand is weird to start with, but once you figure it out...it is fine.  I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I used this 3 times.  The 1st and 2nd time I noticed a few of my natural lashes falling out, this third time I lost at least 6 lashes on one eye!!!  I am so upset, wish I could return this :(</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching online for the &amp;#34;best smudge-proof&amp;#34; mascara and this came up... Unfortunately, it smudges within the first hour from application. What a let-down..</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality, however, for being a full size mascara, I was shocked at how little product it contained. For the cost, I feel like I could&#x27;ve gone to a local makeup counter and purchased something of equal quality, but more product. That said, I do love this brush and I give it 5 stars because for what there is, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Terrible. The worst i´ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> This mascara works well. It can be difficult to remove, but overall worth it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara it doesn&#x27;t flake budge or come off when it rain hard. It also lengthens and curls my lashes like no other. I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras from drugstore to high end  but I keep coming back to this one I also use the waterproof version of this as well. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it. I&#x27;m trying to find a dupe just in case this discontinues (I hope it stays around for a long time) but have had no success. This is my HG mascara. 1 tube lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> This is one of my very favorite mascaras :-) I am very picky and this one makes the cut! Recommend.</li>
            <li> Update- I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for over a month and I am changing my rating to five stars. It gives me thick lashes and I have been using it everyday. It does stay on all day and it keeps my lashes up. No smudges or clumping.</li>
            <li> For the cost of this it is not worth it.. My cover girl clump crusher works just as well it is $8.00</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this. I love the name &amp;#34;Fairydrops&amp;#34;. I found this product to be no better than the mascara available at your local drugstore. For the $24 price tag I expected much more. I would not buy this again. I am a huge fan of a mascara and have tried numerous brands. Nothing beats Christian Dior Blackout, and I will just have to pay for that expensive option next time. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this purchase, there is nothing exceptional about this mascara at all.</li>
            <li> I love Fairydrops mascara and have bought it several times. It doesn&#x27;t flake off which I love!  I would recommend to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> Created by a Japanese TV personality and truly the best mascara I have ever tried. No smudges and stays on.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara. It doesn&#x27;t smudge on my oily skin like many other mascaras do and is easy to remove with soap and warm water--sometimes a tiny bit of eye makeup remover is necessary for the under-eye area, but mostly I don&#x27;t find that to be the case. It lengthens like no other and can be layered for more volume. Love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara. I have been using it for years and used to buy it at Sephora and was crushed when they stopped selling it. Then was pretty much thrilled to find it on here for the same price and Prime eligible!! I use this everyday and love how i dont have to curl my lashes and how much length it adds without clumping.</li>
            <li> Makes eyelashes longer and thicker.  I have used Diorshow for the longest time, but I think this will be my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara combines volume, curling, lengthening and water-resistance. It&#x27;s the perfect all in one! It may dry out a little faster than other mascaras, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Gives you the look of nice long and full lashes.</li>
            <li> I first bought this mascara from Sephora but they no longer carry it.  I was so dissappointed as I have a sensitivity to most mascaras.  Lucky for me the sales girl suggested I check out Amizon.  Thanks to her I was able to get what I consider to be one of the best mascaras you can buy.</li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s great to have a little MAC fix+ spray to bring it back to life after about a month of use. this mascara is great and one of my favorites. it gives volume and length. I use mascara for work all of the time and it&#x27;s on the top of my list. get it!</li>
            <li> Prior to Spring 2011 I had spent so much money on mascara, too much money. Then I tried this product at Sephora and I&#x27;ve never looked back. Sadly, they discontinued carrying it but Amazon.com saves the day. I really love this product. It keeps my lashes curled and long, no clumps, no raccoon eyes. I love it and will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get the damn thing if you read this far.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. It doesn&#x27;t run and removing it is a cinch. I swear a lot so put it through a true test. No racoon eyes. Used to purchase at Sephora but couldn&#x27;t find it there anymore.</li>
            <li> Works great I love it and shipping was so fast</li>
            <li> Still not used to the goofy wand, but I do like the way it stays on and the way it comes off.  Used for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to all the positive reviews and was pretty anxious to try it out. My conclusion? So much money for a product that didn&#x27;t perform as well as I thought it would. It smudged on me and I hate that. I&#x27;m pretty much a mascara fiend and have tried almost everything out there from the expensive to the cheap. My favorite mascara right now that costs under $6 is 100x&#x27;s better than this.</li>
            <li> This mascara is life changing. Seriously. My eyelashes look fake but in a really good way. I can make them HUGE if I feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice though - DO NOT LEAVE THIS IN A HOT CAR!! It will totally ruin it. I was devasted &amp; order 2 more that day. Now I keep them safe at home.</li>
            <li> This mascara is nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But it&#x27;s not exactly amazing. It washes off super easy, which is nice. But the reviews made it seem like it would really make your lashes pop, not so. For the price, I&#x27;d rather buy Lash Blast or some other choice.</li>
            <li> I realize that all women are different, so all  can say is that my wife loves this and has been using it since it came out on the market. She could buy any brand and this is what she buys.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few of these mascaras for my sister because it was discontinued at her local store.  She was pretty excited to see that she get it online.  Unfortunately, the first bottle she used seemed to contain a lot less product than what was expected.  Not sure about the other bottles that were also purchase - won&#x27;t be opened until they need to be used -  but hopefully this might be the odd one out of the batch.</li>
            <li> According to the ratings of this product and the cost, I was expecting something spectacular. And this is far from it... I have tried many different mascaras ranging from $30.00 at Sephora, to Mac brands and Walmart Brands... and so I have a fair amount of experience with different types of mascara... This oneoffers nothing more than an $8.00 brand would offer you from Walmart. All it does is gives your lashes a little curl and that is about it... if your looking for length and volume then your out of luck. Don&#x27;t waist your money... A Revlon, Maybelline or any other Walmart brand will give you exactly what this mascara does. Not Worth it!</li>
            <li> truly lengthens and thickens lashes without clumping.  I would recommend it.  Also washes off well.  Did not need a curler.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara. It doesn&#x27;t smear or flake. I find that it is water resistant yet removes easily with a gentle cleanser. People always ask if I have false lashes on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara, I&#x27;m purchasing my second one right now and thought I&#x27;d add to the reviews. I have had it for over 5 months and although it&#x27;s not empty it&#x27;s been clumping, which I&#x27;d say is normal in that amount of time. Sadly they just don&#x27;t last for ever no matter how much you spend. Anyway about the product: I really love it, it&#x27;s probably better than any I&#x27;ve used and definitely as good as any high end department store mascara I have tried. I love the packaging, the name the color (nice opaque black) &amp; the wand. The mascara separates lashes making them look fuller and longer and is easy to apply (nice wand.) I use two coats to get them a bit longer and thicker, it doesn&#x27;t crumble off while you&#x27;re wearing it or smudge at all, but it washes right off with H20 &amp; cleanser no need for makeup remover. So basically it&#x27;s awesome so I&#x27;m getting a new one!! Try it!!</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever.  Impossible to find in the stores these days.</li>
            <li> Best mascara, period.</li>
            <li> I was very saddened when Sephora discontinued this product from their stores.  BUT AMAZON, you are my life saver! This is by-far the BEST mascara I own (I have A LOT of high-end mascaras). I have short, straight, light eyelashes (typical Asian) and this product works wonders for me.  Two coats and I have length, curl, and my desired level of darkness.  It doesn&#x27;t clump or fall or smear.  MUST TRY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years and love it.  No smear and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my contacts.  I have very blond eyelashes and it makes them look great... Oh yes I&#x27;m 60 and I still like my lashes to look nice.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara for asian lashes!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! Will defiantly Oder more!</li>
            <li> Just normal mascara.  Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I like it, but this one seems like a thinner formula than the first one I bought.  Bad tube? Maybe. Cheaper product? Possibly. Only the next tube will tell.</li>
            <li> I used to jump around and buy a different mascara every time...but not any more! I love, love this mascara. It&#x27;s waterproof but comes off easily with makeup remover. And, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your lashes. It elongates well and doesn&#x27;t get clumpy. I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> Yes, it makes your lashes pop, but the brush is so full of clumps after a few uses, that I waste half the mascara if I clean the brush enough to use it! Pretty sure they should have figured out the brush was useless in the trials. I wish I&#x27;d have spent my money more wisely.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and i don&#x27;t get raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It is not flaky.&lt;br /&gt;I  have sensitive eyes, and this doesn&#x27;t bother them..</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for a couple of years now, and it is definitely the best mascara I have ever used. When used in conjunction with a good eyelash curler, it makes your eyelashes look amazing. It lengthens them, but more importantly, creates a TON of volume with no clumps of mascara to contend with. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> 2nd favorite Mascara... Only 2nd because after curling my very Asian lashes it will flatten them out almost as if I never had curled my lashes.  I use this mascara strictly on my lower lashes for that reason.  It does not make my lower lashes look over done which is what I like.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I own. Coats well, thickens lashes quickly, and stays put throughout the day. My favorite is that it washes off in strands as opposed to leaving black streaks under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, beautiful wand, terrific formula!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and I love the qualities of this brand. As a fitness instructor I need my mascaranto hold up during sweaty workouts and this doesn&#x27;t budge -- but I also want it to come off easily with cleanser, and it does! This mascara once in contact with cleanser of any kind sort of shrivels off your lash and washes right off. The length the mascara gives is phenomenal. Great definition too. Brush is curved to give more flexibility with the small lashes. Too bad Seph doesn&#x27;t carry anymore but glad to find it here!</li>
            <li> For those of us too lazy to add the extra step of eye makeup remover to their nightly routine, this stuff is PERFECT: doesn&#x27;t smudge or migrate down your eyes all day, but rinses off with water. The brush does tend to clump, but nothing a lash comb can&#x27;t fix. I also love how you can layer it for drama or just use one coat for a more natural look. It&#x27;s hard to find, so buy it here while you can!</li>
