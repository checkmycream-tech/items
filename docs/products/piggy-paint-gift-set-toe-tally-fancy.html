    <ol>
            <li>This made a great gift for my niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Bought for a friend&#x27;s kid &amp; they weren&#x27;t too happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>The polish was just great.</li>
            <li>&quot; - and it is GREAT that it is non-toxic.</li>
            <li>But that works great for us because we just paint her nails again after its mostly chipped off!</li>
            <li>I have tried another brand of non toxic nail polish by Ally Kats and it doesn&#x27;t stay on nearly as good as the piggy polish.</li>
            <li>i loved the fact it was very safe product for children</li>
            <li>that time my daughter has gone from letting me paint her nails, to learning to paint her own, to even successfully cajoling her father into a pedicure.</li>
            <li>I use Piggy Paints for myself and I love them!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The polish is in a nice assortment of colors.  </li>
            <li>Great nail polish for little girls and works as a perfect gift!  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply to my grand daughter.  </li>
            <li>Just glad it didn&#x27;t leak on any items.</li>
            <li>She loves painting her nails, and this product is safe.</li>
            <li>It was important for us to have something that would not be hazardous to her or to the environment.</li>
            <li>My girls love to do their nails and with these</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love that there are no chemicals that are harmful for their bodies.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so cute when it&#x27;s  on</li>
            <li>Overall, they&#x27;re perfect for our Friday night manicure dates.</li>
            <li>So I thought it would be a fun thing that we can do together or just as a treat for her when she is good.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s safe fr her.</li>
            <li>the expectations of it being non-toxic you&#x27;d expect it was a better product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that it is not toxic.</li>
            <li>very nice vibrant colors but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be ok with that if i had paid a dollar at the dollar store, but this stuff isnt cheap.</li>
            <li>The easy way to trim my kid&#x27;s nails is to have &amp;#34;manicures&amp;#34;, and she can&#x27;t have polish until she has a trim.  </li>
            <li>(I do recommend a bib and easily wipeable</li>
            <li>My 20 month old grand daughter loved having her toes polished.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be sure the gift I gave my young granddaughter would have nothing in it that wasn&#x27;t good for her.  </li>
            <li>but that is just fine by me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute and fun thing to do with the kids, and</li>
            <li>Fun!  </li>
            <li>This makes me quite nervous of the quality, and very reluctant to let my daughter continue to learn with something that could so easily break and cut her.</li>
            <li>gave this product five starts because it is a super fun \\&quot;toy\\</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find non toxic nail polish for my little girl.</li>
            <li>the fun colors they come in.</li>
            <li>Much fun was had.</li>
            <li>These are fun, pretty nailpolishes, great for a little girl.</li>
            <li>cute color for kids, minimal odors but easily fall off</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy this again, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good nail polish for their young lady.</li>
            <li>Great product, pricey for three bottles of paint, but worth it knowing its safe for a toddler that sucks her thumb occasionally.</li>
            <li>But it is pretty, and it is no-odor.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is really pretty, my daughter (who is not yet 2) loves it</li>
            <li>The brush also tends to fall out of the top, but I&#x27;ve noticed if I just twist the top back on then off again, it sticks back</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t wash off her clothes very well, even with Oxyclean.  </li>
            <li>So were painting nails every other day, which is just fine with her!</li>
            <li>This is a great concept but totally not worth the time it takes to polish or the money spent on this product.  </li>
            <li>There are much better brands out there, for a lot less</li>
            <li>However, it chips and comes off so easily that it only last a day or 2.</li>
            <li>This nail polish won&#x27;t stay on my girls nails for more than a few minutes!  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want adult nail polish on her little fingers and this non-toxic, kid friendly product</li>
            <li>and i love seeing there little nails painted !!</li>
            <li>While it is a great idea in concept, it is a disappointing result.</li>
            <li>Purchased for our 3-yr old granddaughter, who loves to dress up like mommy.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 7 months old Easter basket.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I put three coats on and it takes only a few minutes since it&#x27;s easy so to apply.</li>
            <li>today, as I twisted off the cap on the purple polish the whole top section of the bottle simply cracked and broke off.</li>
            <li>After I take a shower and have dried my feet well, I apply the first coat, dipping in the bottle every one or two toes, brushing the excess each dip on inside of bottle.</li>
            <li>We bought this set and a single black (black and purple are her current favorite colors).</li>
            <li>not long lasting at all.</li>

            <li> not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li> Also comes off easy without harsh removers, usually a bath takes care of it</li>
            <li> non-toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subtracted 1 star, because like the other reviewers said, it doesn&#x27;t really stay on for too long, but any nail polish that is non-toxic doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> guess because of the safer nature of this paint, it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> almost the first week the little plastic brush would become detached from the inside of the of the cap making it necessary to messily push it back into the cap.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry enough for coat number two.</li>
            <li> I put some on my self and it lasted just as long as toxic nail polish.</li>
            <li> This was a little more expensive, but the peace of mind I had made up for the cost.</li>
            <li> I even waited until they were asleep in their car seats to polish and let them dry while they were sleeping for about 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I usually sit outside to do it,</li>
            <li> It lasted through hand sucking and bath time unlike the other brand.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s cold out I just use the hair dryer on low for a second about ten inches from my feet to dry it well.</li>
            <li> Only thing &#x27;bad&#x27; about it is that it chips off the first time you get it wet.</li>
            <li> hard to remove with regular acetone polish remover.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that it rubs off after a few days</li>
            <li> given it has less chemicals to make it stay.</li>
            <li> She always bites her nails or sucks on her fingers, so I can rest well knowing that the nail polish is</li>
            <li> In my experience, it dried my nails and left them ugly.</li>
            <li> So - expensive and not worth it.</li>
            <li> bought it for my three little granddaughters !!!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tough on her hands.</li>

            <li> Mine came in a bag filled with polish from the broken bottles.  Couldn&#x27;t even send it back. Just glad it didn&#x27;t leak on any items.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find non toxic nail polish for my little girl. However, it chips and comes off so easily that it only last a day or 2. I&#x27;d be ok with that if i had paid a dollar at the dollar store, but this stuff isnt cheap. Disapointed. Dont understand what the hype is all about.</li>
            <li> This made a great gift for my niece for Christmas. She loves painting her nails, and this product is safe.</li>
            <li> Purchased for our 3-yr old granddaughter, who loves to dress up like mommy. It was important for us to have something that would not be hazardous to her or to the environment. This fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend&#x27;s kid &amp; they weren&#x27;t too happy with it. Said it came off within 30min and she couldn&#x27;t keep it on and quit trying</li>
            <li> Great nail polish for little girls and works as a perfect gift!  Fun!  Will definitely buy this again, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good nail polish for their young lady.</li>
            <li> My girls love to do their nails and with these it&#x27;s okay. I love that there are no chemicals that are harmful for their bodies.</li>
            <li> The easy way to trim my kid&#x27;s nails is to have &amp;#34;manicures&amp;#34;, and she can&#x27;t have polish until she has a trim.  She&#x27;s a thumb-sucker, so I like that it was non-toxic and lower-chemical.  But she can suck the paint off in hours, which is gross for a number of reasons, including the amount of it she&#x27;s ingesting.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t wash off her clothes very well, even with Oxyclean.  But it is pretty, and it is no-odor.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My daughter received this for her third birthday.  I agree with other reviewers that it rubs off after a few days but that is just fine by me.  I really didn&#x27;t want adult nail polish on her little fingers and this non-toxic, kid friendly product is just what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> Only last for a couple if days but it&#x27;s so cute when it&#x27;s  on</li>
            <li> The polish was just great. My 20 month old grand daughter loved having her toes polished.</li>
            <li> These are fun, pretty nailpolishes, great for a little girl. They chip off almost immediately but my daughter is two. She&#x27;s tough on her hands. I like that they&#x27;re low chemical and the fun colors they come in. Overall, they&#x27;re perfect for our Friday night manicure dates.</li>
            <li> This nail polish won&#x27;t stay on my girls nails for more than a few minutes!  I even waited until they were asleep in their car seats to polish and let them dry while they were sleeping for about 45 minutes.  Within 30 minutes of waking up, the polish was completely gone from several nails and partially gone from the rest.  This is a great concept but totally not worth the time it takes to polish or the money spent on this product.  We&#x27;ll just have to wait until they don&#x27;t stick fingers in their mouths so they can use the big girl nail polish.</li>
            <li> You never know what is in nail polish that is aimed at adults.  I wanted to be sure the gift I gave my young granddaughter would have nothing in it that wasn&#x27;t good for her.  This was a little more expensive, but the peace of mind I had made up for the cost.</li>
            <li> My niece is 2 and she loves it when I paint my nails. So I thought it would be a fun thing that we can do together or just as a treat for her when she is good. It&#x27;s a cute and fun thing to do with the kids, and I know it&#x27;s safe fr her. She always bites her nails or sucks on her fingers, so I can rest well knowing that the nail polish is non-toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subtracted 1 star, because like the other reviewers said, it doesn&#x27;t really stay on for too long, but any nail polish that is non-toxic doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> bought it for my three little granddaughters !!! for christmas ! i loved the fact it was very safe product for children and i love seeing there little nails painted !!</li>
            <li> very nice vibrant colors but not long lasting at all. basically &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; nail polish. hard to remove with regular acetone polish remover.</li>
            <li> I use Piggy Paints for myself and I love them! If they are used as instructed they stay on longer than the toxic brands. After I take a shower and have dried my feet well, I apply the first coat, dipping in the bottle every one or two toes, brushing the excess each dip on inside of bottle. I usually sit outside to do it, if it&#x27;s cold out I just use the hair dryer on low for a second about ten inches from my feet to dry it well. By the time I finish the last toe it&#x27;s dry enough for coat number two. Sometimes I put three coats on and it takes only a few minutes since it&#x27;s easy so to apply. I use my fingernail and a tissue to wipe any mistakes. I&#x27;ve never had it chip!</li>
            <li> cute color for kids, minimal odors but easily fall off which is acceptable given it has less chemicals to make it stay. However after using it once, it could not be opened anymore. I have to give this product a low rate and recommend to avoid buying this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, pricey for three bottles of paint, but worth it knowing its safe for a toddler that sucks her thumb occasionally. Also comes off easy without harsh removers, usually a bath takes care of it</li>
            <li> While it is a great idea in concept, it is a disappointing result. The polish doesn&#x27;t stay on my girls nails, at all. It is wiped off in hours and they aren&#x27;t kids that put their fingers in their mouths or suck their thumbs. It just gets rubbed off. It reminds me of using a Sharpie to color nails. With the time it takes to apply, the money you spend on 3 tiny bottles of polish and the expectations of it being non-toxic you&#x27;d expect it was a better product. It just isn&#x27;t. There are much better brands out there, for a lot less, that are non-toxic as well and can provide the results you want.</li>
            <li> This product is touted as &amp;#34;safe for kids&amp;#34;.  In my experience, it dried my nails and left them ugly. Also the darn stuff doesn&#x27;t come off even with the piggy remover. So - expensive and not worth it.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is really pretty, my daughter (who is not yet 2) loves it and I&#x27;m glad that it is not toxic. Only thing &#x27;bad&#x27; about it is that it chips off the first time you get it wet. So were painting nails every other day, which is just fine with her!</li>
            <li> I bought these at a local toy store for my daughter and we&#x27;ve had them for about 6 months. Having found non-toxic nail polish was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;In that time my daughter has gone from letting me paint her nails, to learning to paint her own, to even successfully cajoling her father into a pedicure. Much fun was had. (I do recommend a bib and easily wipeable space).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;From almost the first week the little plastic brush would become detached from the inside of the of the cap making it necessary to messily push it back into the cap.&lt;br /&gt;Then today, as I twisted off the cap on the purple polish the whole top section of the bottle simply cracked and broke off. This makes me quite nervous of the quality, and very reluctant to let my daughter continue to learn with something that could so easily break and cut her.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 months old Easter basket. I have tried another brand of non toxic nail polish by Ally Kats and it doesn&#x27;t stay on nearly as good as the piggy polish. It lasted through hand sucking and bath time unlike the other brand. Some did come off but not the entire nail. I put some on my self and it lasted just as long as toxic nail polish. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost three and used to \\&quot;paint\\&quot; her nails with a marker. So, I searched for a non-toxic paint for her and found Piggy Paint. We bought this set and a single black (black and purple are her current favorite colors). She asks to paint her nails almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess because of the safer nature of this paint, it doesn&#x27;t last that long. But that works great for us because we just paint her nails again after its mostly chipped off! The brush also tends to fall out of the top, but I&#x27;ve noticed if I just twist the top back on then off again, it sticks back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product five starts because it is a super fun \\&quot;toy\\&quot; - and it is GREAT that it is non-toxic. We totally recommend these nail paints!</li>
            <li> The polish is in a nice assortment of colors.  It is very easy to apply to my grand daughter.  She is only 18 months but she loves it.  It doesn&#x27;t have the smell of regular nail polish so we feel safer using it.</li>
