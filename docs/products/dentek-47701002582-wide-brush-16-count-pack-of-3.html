            <li> These used to be great. But suddenly without warning--and without any indication in the written ad or picture of the product--they have added mint flavoring (artificial and who knows what chemicals it contains?) and even worse by far &amp;#34;Advanced FLUORIDE coating&amp;#34; (caps theirs). YUK! poison. I&#x27;m returning them.</li>
            <li> For people who have deep pockets or wide spaces this is so much better than the regular Dentek ; worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> Perfect for that pocket or gap between teeth that you fiddle around with your tongue and can&#x27;t quite dislodge that shred of cole slaw or bit of steak. I&#x27;ve been getting a variation on these for years from my dental hygienist and finally broke down an bought some on my own.  I have a few tight teeth and this little brush will fit in near the gum line and do its magic. Because it can fit in tight places the wire is thinner than some brands.&lt;br /&gt;The little cone-shaped bristle brush comes with a cap so that you can carry one with you. I&#x27;ve bought other types over the years and these are the most satisfying.</li>
            <li> This product has changed....not for the good.  It has the same bar code, but this brush bends easily and does not do the job.  I always bought the Dentek instead of GUM products since the brush stayed firm and worked very well.  Now, no difference....will be looking for another brand.</li>
            <li> Very good product ! The Dentek brush lasts much longer than Gum brand brush. I will always buy the Dentek brand from now on.</li>
            <li> DenTeck dental brushes beat the competitor.  The competitor brushes tend to easily bend where the brush meets the handle.  I have some big spaces at my gumline and these brushes help me keep the spaces clean.  Always have good checkups at the dentist office.  I recommend these brushes which I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> I love Dentek products but this brush said WIDE and I should have paid better attention.  Went in between teeth OK and brush was fine but trying to remove it I felt like it would chip my teeth, as it got stuck.  My fault, had no idea wide would include the metal head at the end of the brush &#x3D; the part that holds the brush together.  Will go back to the normal width.</li>
            <li> These are the best!  I have been using them for weeks and none have fallen apart like that &#x27;other brand&#x27; would have after a few days.  I just wish I would have discovered these years ago.</li>
            <li> Good product. Easier to use.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping. Great price. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Great product.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> perfect and better than flossing..</li>
            <li> Good quality (like all Dentek Brushes  but, unfortunately, too large for spaces between my teeth.  Thought it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly,met expectations</li>
            <li> The metal in the middle of the brush is bothersome.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just ok. The wide brush needs to be a little more sturdier.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. I have braces and these wide brushes are my favorite.</li>
            <li> really liked this product.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Dentek Wide Brush easily cleans wider spaces between teeth. Cleaning is easier and faster. My order arrived quickly and well packed.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT , CLEANING MY TEETH MORE THAN WHAT U IMAGINE</li>
            <li> Great product. Completes teeth &amp; gum cleaning. Will use religiously.</li>
            <li> These work well.  You need a variety of sizes.  I use these every day.</li>
