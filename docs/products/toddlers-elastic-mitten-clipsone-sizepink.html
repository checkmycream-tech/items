    <ol>
            <li>perfect add on to any gloves you may be buying.</li>
            <li>They work great.  </li>
            <li>Looks like they will be great for no losing gloves</li>
            <li>Good idea, but the clips wouldn&#x27;t hold on s jacket, kept falling off.</li>
            <li>I saw the idea on Pinterest, ordered them, and, found out how nice it is for my jeans not to keep coming out of my boots.  </li>
            <li>The metal clips have a nylon lining and will do a good job of gripping the gloves without damaging the leather or fabric.  </li>
            <li>Bought them for my Grand daughter</li>
            <li>I should have done my research more with these.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was a better solution.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, I plan to order more.</li>
            <li>The gloves easily slide off.  </li>
            <li>My daughter can easily remove her gloves from it so it defeats the purpose of even having them.  </li>
            <li>Mitten clips are ok but a bit to large and heavier than I thought&lt;</li>
            <li>The reviews were right when they said you have to make sure you put the metal clip in the right place</li>
            <li>These did not hold up really well there are others here on Amazon that are way better</li>
            <li>Have come off a couple times, but overall good clilps.</li>
            <li>Still better than not having them, for a 3 year old, but I was hoping they&#x27;d hold on a bit tighter to the mitts.</li>
            <li>Despite of having these my children managed to loose a glove because the grip on those on the jacket was not really the best..</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re supposed to make sure the gloves do not get lost if they are actually getting lost..??</li>
            <li>My granddaughter really likes the pretty color and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They really help with keeping up with gloves.</li>
            <li>my daughter-in-law really likes the idea of not having to look for mittens.</li>
            <li>these are a much have.  </li>
            <li>very strong so they won&#x27;t be tearing them off on either end and means that you will have one less thing to carry for them.  </li>
            <li>My 1.5 year old toddler pulled them right off of her jacket with no trouble.</li>
            <li>The clips I picked (3&amp;#34;) were a bit too short to use as pants clips as I intended.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product was that they ware not that expensive</li>
            <li>The clips just don&#x27;t clip tight enough to really hold on to the mittens.  </li>
            <li>but they really do keep your pants down inside your boots!</li>

            <li> The plastic bag packaging was dusty, but the clips and elastic inside were sturdy and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought two pairs (pink and navy blue) of this type of clips, and then I bought two pairs of a clips from a different maker.</li>
            <li> THe only problem is that our corgis like to drag on and tug the gloves snapping them back.</li>
            <li> These pink ones only lasted 1 week.  </li>
            <li> I bought the pink ones for my daughter and my son got dark blues ones, that came from a different company.  </li>
            <li> I will not buy them again and if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I simply don&#x27;t have the time to play the &amp;#34;return this item&amp;#34; game, I totally would return them.</li>
            <li> These were used to hold socks down in boots.</li>
            <li> And what I mean by &amp;#34;don&#x27;t stay&amp;#34; is that a simple tag, pull of these clips causes them to slip off of the coat or mittens...</li>
            <li> Can be left on w/out gloves and at least our little girl doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.  </li>
            <li> These particular clips are useless.</li>
            <li> they have a little snowman on the silver part)..</li>

            <li> The clips do not stay on the coat and the grip is bad they only lasted for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Weak clip.</li>
            <li> Also, I found the metal part a bit irritating inside my boots.</li>
            <li> This is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> so my child comes home with them and always has them in this cold weather</li>

            <li> I use these to keep my jeans in my boots.  I saw the idea on Pinterest, ordered them, and, found out how nice it is for my jeans not to keep coming out of my boots.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought them for my Grand daughter She loves them.. They really help with keeping up with gloves.</li>
            <li> I should have done my research more with these.  I bought the pink ones for my daughter and my son got dark blues ones, that came from a different company.  These pink ones only lasted 1 week.  After that the grip with the teeth loosened and would no longer grip to her coat or her mittens.</li>
            <li> The clips I picked (3&amp;#34;) were a bit too short to use as pants clips as I intended. Also, I found the metal part a bit irritating inside my boots. May try again with the 5&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> Mitten clips are ok but a bit to large and heavier than I thought&lt;br /&gt;This is a hard to find item</li>
            <li> These did not hold up really well there are others here on Amazon that are way better( hint: they have a little snowman on the silver part).. Despite of having these my children managed to loose a glove because the grip on those on the jacket was not really the best..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is the point of having these? they&#x27;re supposed to make sure the gloves do not get lost if they are actually getting lost..??</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use to keep my jeans or pants from &amp;#34;oohing&amp;#34; out of my  boots.  They work great.  No discomfort from the clips.</li>
            <li> I bought two pairs (pink and navy blue) of this type of clips, and then I bought two pairs of a clips from a different maker. These particular clips are useless. They don&#x27;t stay on the coat or the gloves. And what I mean by &amp;#34;don&#x27;t stay&amp;#34; is that a simple tag, pull of these clips causes them to slip off of the coat or mittens... I will not buy them again and if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I simply don&#x27;t have the time to play the &amp;#34;return this item&amp;#34; game, I totally would return them. The only good thing about this product was that they ware not that expensive so I&#x27;ll just deal with wasting 10 bucks or so and go back to my life.</li>
            <li> These do not work at all! My daughter&#x27;s gloves keep coming detached! This is very frustrating. I wish there was a better solution.</li>
            <li> These were used to hold socks down in boots.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t use these for mittens, i use these to clip a towel wrapped around my toddler&#x27;s waist while she is eating, so she doesn&#x27;t spill food on her clothes. works like a charm!</li>
            <li> The clips just don&#x27;t clip tight enough to really hold on to the mittens.  We usually lose one or both every time we put her in the car seat.  Still better than not having them, for a 3 year old, but I was hoping they&#x27;d hold on a bit tighter to the mitts.</li>
            <li> Good idea, but the clips wouldn&#x27;t hold on s jacket, kept falling off.</li>
            <li> The clips do not stay on the coat and the grip is bad they only lasted for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Looks like they will be great for no losing gloves</li>
            <li> The reviews were right when they said you have to make sure you put the metal clip in the right place so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your ankle inside the boot.  but they really do keep your pants down inside your boots!</li>
            <li> these keep the gloves and hats on the coat so my child comes home with them and always has them in this cold weather</li>
            <li> Parents, lose those gloves no more.  The kids can&#x27;t open these clips!  Love them.  THe only problem is that our corgis like to drag on and tug the gloves snapping them back.</li>
            <li> Weak clip. My 1.5 year old toddler pulled them right off of her jacket with no trouble.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter really likes the pretty color and my daughter-in-law really likes the idea of not having to look for mittens.</li>
            <li> The gloves easily slide off.  My daughter can easily remove her gloves from it so it defeats the purpose of even having them.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> The plastic bag packaging was dusty, but the clips and elastic inside were sturdy and clean. I bought these clips on spec to clip our winter gloves together as they go in to off-season storage; I plan to use one clip for each pair of gloves. The metal clips have a nylon lining and will do a good job of gripping the gloves without damaging the leather or fabric.  Now that I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, I plan to order more.</li>
            <li> did the job that they were needed for</li>
            <li> Work well.  Have come off a couple times, but overall good clilps.</li>
            <li> If your little one likes taking off their gloves these are a much have.  very strong so they won&#x27;t be tearing them off on either end and means that you will have one less thing to carry for them.  Can be left on w/out gloves and at least our little girl doesn&#x27;t seem to mind.  perfect add on to any gloves you may be buying.</li>
