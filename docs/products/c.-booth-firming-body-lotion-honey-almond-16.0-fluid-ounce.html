            <li> Love it! Goes on evenly and absorbs quickly into your skin. Light scent. Moistureizes well</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent! Not too sicky sweet almond, with a perfectly blended touch of honey. I use 7 pumps every day for all-over coverage. Rubs on easily and evenly, absorbing beautifully into the skin in the same manner. Moisturizes all day without a hint of greasiness, even immediately after application. Get dressed right away without worry!</li>
            <li> It is very good for my dry skin,</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years all over.  It&#x27;s got such a great smell and feels so silky.  I now get it shipped overseas where I&#x27;m currently stationed.</li>
            <li> I love the C.Booth line of lotions, body butters &amp; body washes.  The scent is great.  The consistency is nice and rich without being greasy.  Living in the Southwest leaves my skin super dry and this is one of the only things that keeps it hydrated.</li>
            <li> C.Booth Firming Body Lotion is all natural and moisturizers the skin, leaving it soft and supple. It was recommended to me by a friend and I would recommend it to any one interested in achieving healthy moist skin, especially in dry climates, such as the desert. It is easily absorbed into the skin and does not remain greasy like many moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the scent of this. It doesn&#x27;t last too terribly long but it smells amazing, and sinks right in. I&#x27;m a lotion addict and this has been my favorite purchase recently.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing lotion.  It&#x27;s a great value.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was a firming body lotion when I ordered it.  I love the honey almond scent.</li>
            <li> I did not find this more firming than lotion alone.  It is light, and smells OK.</li>
            <li> I love C. Booth products and this does not disappoint. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and leaves my skin feeling smooth and healthy. Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance very much like the dry oil spray. There is the same vanilla overtone. Unlike some, I do like the fragrance of vanilla and it isn&#x27;t too much. If you want unscented, this isn&#x27;t for you! Smooth and soothing . . . dry, mature skin and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Were I to say that this is &#x27;grandchild approved,&#x27; I would expect a few &#x27;raised eyebrows!&#x27; My 6 year old granddaughter presented with her usual snuggle and then said: \\&quot;Umm, you smell just yummy!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Added benifit? It&#x27;s actually made a difference in skin tone!</li>
            <li> It has a very soft smell. Works very well as a lotion.</li>
            <li> This company can do no wrong. I&#x27;m obsessed with their lotions and the price cannot be beat for the quality :) not greasy at ALL! Love love love</li>
            <li> My skin loves it. It has a pleasnat aroma. It moisturises well. Good price available on amazon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! I have been looking forever for a firming body lotion that was natural - thank you!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, VERY REASONABLE, DON&#x27;T BUY IN RETAIL STORE YOU&#x27;LL BE PAYING A WHOLE LOT MORE</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion, it feels like silk on your skin non grease. If you have sensitive skin this lotion works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have reordered this several times,.  It smells really nice and works well.,</li>
            <li> This product works and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells and how it feels on my skin,nice and light.i also am very happy that it is free of parabens,sulfates,mineral oil and petrolatum :-)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion. I have keratosis pilaris and was testing this out to see if it helped my skin. I didn&#x27;t get any better results than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried unfortunately. But I like that it&#x27;s natural ingredients. I figure as long as it&#x27;s not making my skin worse, and it smells really good, I&#x27;m going to stick with it for a while.</li>
            <li> Its a lot lighter than expected probably better for summer time.</li>
            <li> I like it although it smelled like Cocoa butter, not honey almond.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Did not notice much of a difference in the taughtness of my skin tho.</li>
            <li> This lotion still left my skin feeling dry and flaky. St. Ives and Suave both make cheaper, more moisturizing lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It is very light to the touch and provides great moisture.  It also smell great!  What I like best is that it comes in a pump, which makes application clean and simple.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Decent lotion. It was my first time trying this brand. I paired this w the dry oil in the same Almond/Honey scent. It smelled good but not overly scented so I was happy. Some fragranced products are too overwhelming and I get headaches. I would repurchase maybe. I have a few other lotion/oil combos I want to try first.</li>
            <li> Any product by C. Booth is a 5-star product.  I have never been disappointed with any of them.</li>
            <li> My skin feels dewy and smooth. The fragrance is lovely. Nice product all the way around</li>
            <li> I like this lotion very much because of it&#x27;s ingredients &amp; it&#x27;s price.  If I could change anything, it would be the smell.</li>
            <li> Very good body lotion ,this line of products are superior in every way ,love them all .</li>
            <li> this stuff rocks for the price. mellow almond scent.</li>
