            <li>I was able to touch up my entire head with this flat iron and take out some waviness that happened on a humid day.</li>

            <li> As a hairstylist of 15 years, for 6 years I had a 3/4&#x27; flat iron that was given to me as a gift.....</li>
            <li> and so far it hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> Be warned - the overall size is roughly the length of my hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though it is very small, it heats up very well, and straightens my hair without pulling it.</li>
            <li> , really fast - so be careful if you have delicate hair.</li>
            <li> Item as describe, my daughter loves the flat irons and they are small enough for her to pack and take to college.</li>
            <li> The other I keep packed in my travel bag for business trips.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to use it properly...</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair a little.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s to little</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>

            <li> team is just too small, looks like a toy ..</li>

            <li> Miniature and not great.</li>
            <li> Even to take while travelling it is not good at all!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> smaller then i thought it was going to be but it does everything very well. It heats just pasted the rubber grip so watch out.</li>
            <li> I love how small this is! Super lightweight and compact. The only issue I have is that it snags my hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully but in a mini flat iron , 1 inch was to wide to grab the shortest hair.</li>
            <li> I have a full size BaByliss flat iron, which I love, so I was glad to find this mini iron for travel. Be warned - the overall size is roughly the length of my hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this with me overseas where there was 220v outlets only and it worked great! I have curly hair that is past my shoulders. I don&#x27;t think I could straighten all my hair with this flat iron alone, but I did find that this was really great for touch ups! My hair has a tendency to develop some curls and waves after a day or two of having it straightened and this helped me keep it straight. I was able to touch up my entire head with this flat iron and take out some waviness that happened on a humid day. This flat iron gets really hot, really fast - so be careful if you have delicate hair. I did find that I could turn it on, then shut it off and still use it briefly, as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this flat iron would replace a full size iron for people with very curly or very long hair but I think it could if you had very short hair (such as a pixie cut) or were using it just for bangs. I also think it&#x27;s great for travel touch ups when you don&#x27;t want to drag a full size flat iron. I practiced with it a bit a home before my trip to make sure it was going to work for me.</li>
            <li> This product is such both a perfect size as well and the quality of this brand is wonderful...  Perfect first of many..</li>
            <li> My hair dresser has one of these that she paid $35 for at the local beauty supply.  I was sure I could find it for less, and wound up buying 2 from Amazon.  I keep one on hand for touch ups and to straighten my bangs.  The other I keep packed in my travel bag for business trips.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recommend it to the whole world and it is much better than was waiting, and the product I come very rapidly to my house.. I recommend the seller!</li>
            <li> I love my mini Baby Liss.  I am able to get close to my scalp without burning myself.</li>
            <li> never heated up.  i love my original babybliss pro straightener so i tried this for travel, and it didnt work. thing never heated up.</li>
            <li> Though it is very small, it heats up very well, and straightens my hair without pulling it. Perfect for travel, but if you have long hair that is not easy to straighten, I would not recommend it because if its size. I however, love it! I am using it as my primary straightener while studying abroad for a year.</li>
            <li> Happy with the irons work well could not be more happy with the way they flat out hair happy happy</li>
            <li> Great product.  Gets really hot.  Its compact and heats up well.  I bought this for when I travel and so far it hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Is a good iron, excellent for travel and fix really well in my purse. Recommended,  it works for me</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist of 15 years, for 6 years I had a 3/4&#x27; flat iron that was given to me as a gift.....It just recently shorted out....and found the same brand....nothing like em&#x27;....!!!...!!!</li>
            <li> The product has one setting.It is great for taming those baby hairs and fly aways. No need to leave on your hair for more than a second or so. I strongly recommend anyone to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> my wife is happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is much more beautiful, jajajajjaja&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this team is just too small, looks like a toy ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It works very well</li>
            <li> I like the size for traveling, however, I didn&#x27;t realize how hot it gets. I damaged my hair a little.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it!...From the compact size(fits in any purse) to styling my hair in a precise manner...its great! As a matter of fact I bought a second one for my vacation home and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Works great! This is a nice way to travel in style with a carry on!</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my daughter, it is great and it came on time.</li>

            <li> Best buy ever.  It does a great job especially if your hair is layered and you have sections near root you need to defrizz!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I cannot wait to purchase the full size! It&#x27;s honestly so worth the money and you&#x27;ll never go to a salon again! My hair looks so shiny and pressed and I&#x27;m not even done.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, 100% Original and recommended. I am very happy with this product was more than I expected. Thanks to my boyfriend for this gift.</li>
            <li> I like the size but it should get hotter.</li>
            <li> Love this little flat iron, really gets the job done and very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I love the babyliss irons but this one jus doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair at all. I paid almost $40 and I really don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> No... I didn&#x27;t like it!  It is too small. Even to take while travelling it is not good at all!  I recomend it!  For the price paid, I&#x27;d rather buy another one a bit bigger!  It is hard to use it properly...</li>
            <li> It was not what was in the picture,  it was bigger and I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my Babyliss. It works great and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Miniature and not great. Couldn&#x27;t straighten a nose hair with this. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this Mini Flat Iron!  It works great and is small enough to travel well in a purse or gym bag!</li>
