            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Okay product.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it without the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It also made it look much more healthier.</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with Hawaiian Silky products.</li>
            <li>So pleased, I will continue to use their products indefinitely.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural, great smelling shampoo with argan oil and this is not it.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the kind of boost my hair needed.  </li>
            <li>The smell is awesome it lasts for a few days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>, I really like the conditioner more than shampoo.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPMENT!!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel soft (even while shampooing), and it smells exotic.</li>
            <li>I prefer this brand better than that One &amp; Only brand.</li>
            <li>BTW I have naturally curly hair that tangles easily, and the conditioner makes it much easier to comb out.  </li>
            <li>so it is hard to find a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended the Hydrating Sleek Intense Repair Mask, and it has really made a difference in my hair growth and overall feel.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>no tangles, so soft.</li>
            <li>Next day my hair was very soft and shiny yet voluminous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particularly picky when it comes to shampoo and conditioner due to my exceptionally dry hair but this has certainly made a difference!</li>
            <li>Leaves coarse gray hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and manageable.  </li>

            <li> Leaves coarse gray hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes the hair just enough for a little shine, my hair looks and feels brand new.</li>
            <li> I left it on my hair for about 15-20 mins then rinse and allow to air dry.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a black woman with natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wash my toilet with this product.</li>
            <li> I shampoo my hair once leave the conditioner on for 10 mins rinse and sit it in front of the fan to dry.</li>
            <li> i put the conditioner on my dry hair for about 30 min w/plastic cap then washed it with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought the conditioner of the brand yesterday to co-washed my Remy (Indian loose wave) hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair very dry</li>
            <li> I have been using all natural products and hair treatments, to revive it from a bad hair experience (don&#x27;t ask, but I had mid back length hair, and ended up with gobs of hair falling out that I had to gradually cut to about two inches as the new hair grew out).  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling rough .</li>
            <li> It has parfum and other chemical additives.</li>
            <li> When I applied, it my hair became extremely manageable where I could have run my fingers through without getting a tangle.</li>
            <li> con is they both are a little watery than what I&#x27;m use to with other shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li> It does hydrate the hair but no more than the other shampoos I have used.</li>
            <li> It has nothing to do with Hawaii, it looks cheap and smells worst then Irish spring soap.</li>
            <li> - I have hard water with alot of iron</li>
            <li> Ill always use this product!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awful.</li>

            <li> I love these products - was introduced by my beautician.  Leaves coarse gray hair soft and manageable Also would recommend Hawaiian Silky 14/1 conditioner also</li>
            <li> Its an OK product but I do notice that it takes a lot to build a lather, I really like the conditioner more than shampoo. It does hydrate the hair but no more than the other shampoos I have used. For the price I would say no I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I was told the Moroccan Argan Oil is nourishing for your hair. I have been using all natural products and hair treatments, to revive it from a bad hair experience (don&#x27;t ask, but I had mid back length hair, and ended up with gobs of hair falling out that I had to gradually cut to about two inches as the new hair grew out).  Anyway, I tried this by chance.  Am I glad I did!  Both the shampoo and conditioner are absolutely wonderful. It makes your hair feel soft (even while shampooing), and it smells exotic. The shampoo and conditioner go hand in hand.  For the conditioner, I use about a silver dollar amount, rub it throughout my hair, put on a plastic bag and wait about 5 minutes. BTW I have naturally curly hair that tangles easily, and the conditioner makes it much easier to comb out.  I have been wearing the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look for about two years, and this is one of the best shampoo and conditioners I have ever used.  It left my hair feeling soft and manageable.  It is exactly the kind of boost my hair needed.  I would say the Hawaiian Silky Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner put the &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; in exceptional.</li>
            <li> Not as good as true Morocan Oil shampoo but does work ok. - I have hard water with alot of iron so it is hard to find a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I recommend this because it hydrates your hair when it dries out its really good and it also is good for those who weave weave too and can restore it</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling rough . Smell stays in your hair for about a week .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particularly picky when it comes to shampoo and conditioner due to my exceptionally dry hair but this has certainly made a difference! My hair feels like SILK!</li>
            <li> Love the Hawaiian silky shampoo &amp; conditioner.. It work great and smell awesome.. Ill always use this product!! Ill most definitely refer this product to friends and family!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awful. I was looking for a natural, great smelling shampoo with argan oil and this is not it. It has parfum and other chemical additives. It has nothing to do with Hawaii, it looks cheap and smells worst then Irish spring soap. I wouldn&#x27;t wash my toilet with this product. After shampooing my hair just stuck together. The smell stayed in 2 days later.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPMENT!! I love this product, it does wonders for my hair extensions. I would definitely recommend it this product especially for Remi, Brazilian, Malaysian or Peruvian weave.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo and conditioner. I bought it because it was recommended by Hair by Belle Bre that sells hair extensions. It moisturizes the hair just enough for a little shine, my hair looks and feels brand new. I shampoo my hair once leave the conditioner on for 10 mins rinse and sit it in front of the fan to dry. The smell is awesome it lasts for a few days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is they both are a little watery than what I&#x27;m use to with other shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li> Okay product. I liked the conditioner more than the shampoo. The shampoo leaves my hair very dry and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it without the conditioner. Will not repurchase.</li>
