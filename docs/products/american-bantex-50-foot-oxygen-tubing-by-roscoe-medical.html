    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent quality and service.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully to tie up my tomato plants.</li>
            <li>Hoses for oxygen are Great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price but not the quality I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Delivered when promised  Delivered when promised in great shape.</li>
            <li>The  oxygen tubing works great its nice to be able to move around the house and still be on oxygen too</li>
            <li>Was easy to order and was just what was advertised I will use this dealer again in great shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is just like tubing you can find anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>A softer hose would have laid flatter &amp; better.</li>
            <li>Okay for the price.</li>
            <li>The tubing is okay</li>
            <li>I truly believe is more my fault the air hose</li>
            <li>Was easy to order and was just what was advertised I will use this dealer again</li>
            <li>Worked just fine...</li>
            <li>I like to change out my hose often - I can get free ones from my medical provider but the quality of this one is much better - fewer tangles and fewer problems and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Great seller super fast ship would highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li>These come in very handy for long stretches!</li>
            <li>These no kink crush proof/resistant hoses are a necessity but we keep our house on the cool size during fall/winter/spring and the hoses stiffen a bit and tangle easier.  </li>
            <li>I bought three of these hoses and found that they are very soft and that they will kink and snarl very easily.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I needed a replacement quickly.  </li>
            <li>Incidentally, I put a couple of Command super size</li>
            <li>We were very impressed with the speed of delivery -- it arrived much earlier than we expected.</li>
            <li>Use a swivel connector which helps to keep the cannula tubing and first 5 feet from twisting.  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing to find tubing which behaves itself, even when extended to the maximum medically recommended length of 50&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>but when I first purchased them it was summer</li>
            <li>Super deal on the tubing, will be using it often at our new home in the mountains</li>
            <li>However, the provider now sends us the green tubing, which is much stiffer and more easily kinked.</li>
            <li>My mom is on oxygen and needed longer tubing for her large machine.</li>
            <li>Slightly different color, but works just fine.  </li>
            <li>but these hoses are to flexible for the swivels to be of much use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for something else very soon.</li>
            <li>but it never lays straight.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I ordered I don&#x27;t know if all tubing is like this or not I am new to the oxygen accessory purchases.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for another brand as this is not adequate or safe.</li>
            <li>If you need high oxygen flow say over 6 litres then this is not the tubing for you.</li>
            <li>I have pulmonary hypertension and need high flow</li>
            <li>Starts to stiffen up at as high as 60 degrees F</li>
            <li>It did arrive on time; but this tubing has very thin caliber walls which kink VERY easily occluding the flow of oxygen and causing the oxygen concentrator to sound a warning signal throughout the night.  </li>
            <li>Tubing is stiff and stays in rolls over the floor so more trip over it.</li>
            <li>When, after a while, it does begin to tangle, it&#x27;s time to turn to new tubing anyway.  </li>
            <li>It kinks easily and isn&#x27;t as thick as higher quality tubing.</li>
            <li>I like this item was exactly as described the only problem</li>
            <li>We prefer this clear tubing.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone, when the tubing bends and nots, very little oxygen flow is available.</li>
            <li>It is not of the quality that I normally receive from my Durable Medical Equipment provider.  </li>
            <li>This tubing has a bad propensity to tangle easily, I have to untangle it far too many times daily.  </li>
            <li>Despite being on oxygen 24/7 I live a fairly active life and having a hose kink and cut off my oxygen every time I move is just unacceptable.</li>

            <li> I color and looks aged.</li>
            <li> It is also thin walled and kinks very easily, so much so that I had to discard it.</li>
            <li> and you have to be careful to lay it out</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this style of tubing due to ease in use and availability.</li>
            <li> It was just cheaper (less money)including S &amp; H then other places.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when ordering this,  but it really does work.</li>
            <li> This tubing is identical to the tubing we previously received from our oxygen equipment provider.</li>
            <li> It did seem a little flimsy, like it wasn&#x27;t quite the thickness of the tubing I replaced.</li>
            <li> It does work just a little of a hassle when rolling it up</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to aquarium airline tubing cause that stuff is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> With the tubing being narrower it hindered the oxygen flow.</li>
            <li> The tubing is narrow, does not allow max flow from my concentrator.</li>
            <li> Seems a little small when compared to their competitor.</li>
            <li> is still a little excessive in the tangled up area.</li>
            <li> The small circumference also causes the tubing to get caught on everything.  </li>
            <li> Diameter too small, tends to kink</li>
            <li> Too narrow a gauge for starters, crushes enough to obliterate flow with the least pressure, and kinks and knots up like crazy even though I&#x27;m using swivel connectors.</li>
            <li> Have to detangle at least once a day and sometimes twice..  </li>
            <li> when I say tangle, I don&#x27;t mean knot up</li>
            <li> Sadly, it does kink, not as bad as the other, but you realy must keep a close eye on it.</li>
            <li> Orderd the wrong tubing, my fault but for</li>
            <li> This tubing is very poor quality.</li>
            <li> This one did not have a smell or odor and served my purpose .The tubing I received from the oxygen supplier had an order that would make you sick while receiving oxygen..</li>
            <li> and I hate to think what it will be like when it&#x27;s exposed to even colder temps</li>
            <li> it also twists and tangles horribly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent quality and service.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you rely on oxygen you may want to avoid this tubing.  It is not of the quality that I normally receive from my Durable Medical Equipment provider.  I ordered this because I needed a replacement quickly.  It did arrive on time; but this tubing has very thin caliber walls which kink VERY easily occluding the flow of oxygen and causing the oxygen concentrator to sound a warning signal throughout the night.  I will be looking for another brand as this is not adequate or safe.</li>
            <li> The thickness could be improved on this tubing.  Seems a little small when compared to their competitor.</li>
            <li> I found this tubing to be narrower than others I have purchased. With the tubing being narrower it hindered the oxygen flow. If you need high oxygen flow say over 6 litres then this is not the tubing for you. I have pulmonary hypertension and need high flow and this tubing does not deliver.</li>
            <li> Hoses for oxygen are Great.</li>
            <li> This is a product you can get at any number of websites. It was just cheaper (less money)including S &amp; H then other places. I&#x27;m sure it is just like tubing you can find anywhere else.  Got it in a reason amount of time.</li>
            <li> It works as it should. It did seem a little flimsy, like it wasn&#x27;t quite the thickness of the tubing I replaced.</li>
            <li> It is definitely NOT &amp;#34;Non Kinking, Crush-Resistant&amp;#34; as stated in the product description.  The small circumference also causes the tubing to get caught on everything.  it also twists and tangles horribly.  Have to detangle at least once a day and sometimes twice..  Use a swivel connector which helps to keep the cannula tubing and first 5 feet from twisting.  I plan on returning the one I haven&#x27;t open.  Just to note:  It worked wonderfully to tie up my tomato plants.</li>
            <li> People who depend on portable oxygen will know how difficult it can be to find tubing which does not \\&quot;kink\\&quot;--tangling in on itself, blocking the air-flow, and really becoming a nuisance.  The manufacturers of this product describe it as \\&quot;non-kink\\&quot; and they tell the truth.  It is refreshing to find tubing which behaves itself, even when extended to the maximum medically recommended length of 50&#x27;.  When, after a while, it does begin to tangle, it&#x27;s time to turn to new tubing anyway.  I was skeptical when ordering this,  but it really does work.</li>
            <li> This tubing is very poor quality. It is yellowish I color and looks aged. It is also thin walled and kinks very easily, so much so that I had to discard it. Would not recommend unless you like throwing money away.</li>
            <li> Too narrow a gauge for starters, crushes enough to obliterate flow with the least pressure, and kinks and knots up like crazy even though I&#x27;m using swivel connectors. Starts to stiffen up at as high as 60 degrees F and I hate to think what it will be like when it&#x27;s exposed to even colder temps come Fall and Winter months. If you have the choice to not buy this, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Having been on oxygen 24/7 for 5 years now, I have always had difficulty with the tubing kinking. This product said it did not kink so I bought it. Sadly, it does kink, not as bad as the other, but you realy must keep a close eye on it.</li>
            <li> i need to use the o2 24/7 and the tubing goes with me wherever i go. it seems to get caught on all the furniture. wish there was a larger tubing.</li>
            <li> Orderd the wrong tubing, my fault but for what it does i give it 5</li>
            <li> I thought I might need an extra hose later, so I got this one to put in my stand by kit.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these hoses and found that they are very soft and that they will kink and snarl very easily. I used them with swivel connectors but these hoses are to flexible for the swivels to be of much use. Despite being on oxygen 24/7 I live a fairly active life and having a hose kink and cut off my oxygen every time I move is just unacceptable. I&#x27;ll be looking for something else very soon.</li>
            <li> This tubing has a bad propensity to tangle easily, I have to untangle it far too many times daily.  The tubing is narrow, does not allow max flow from my concentrator.</li>
            <li> Super deal on the tubing, will be using it often at our new home in the mountains</li>
            <li> A softer hose would have laid flatter &amp; better. A little too stiff to lay flat, curls up a lot (frequently tripping over it). Okay for the price.</li>
            <li> This 50-foot oxygen tubing allows me to utilize oxygen therapy while using exercise equipment at home, maximizing effectiveness of oxygen therapy.</li>
            <li> These no kink crush proof/resistant hoses are a necessity but we keep our house on the cool size during fall/winter/spring and the hoses stiffen a bit and tangle easier.  I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of this or even noticed but when I first purchased them it was summer and they worked well.  when I say tangle, I don&#x27;t mean knot up but they don&#x27;t relax when you gather/loop them up to hang them on a bed post and such.  Incidentally, I put a couple of Command super size hooks up in strategic places around the house to help manage my hose wad.  I think they&#x27;re robe hooks or something. they are two-tone in color and maybe 3-5&amp;#34; tall.  works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This tubing is identical to the tubing we previously received from our oxygen equipment provider. However, the provider now sends us the green tubing, which is much stiffer and more easily kinked. We prefer this clear tubing. We were very impressed with the speed of delivery -- it arrived much earlier than we expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price but not the quality I was looking for. It kinks easily and isn&#x27;t as thick as higher quality tubing. It does work just a little of a hassle when rolling it up and you have to be careful to lay it out so it won&#x27;t kink on you.</li>
            <li> These come in very handy for long stretches!</li>
            <li> I bought this hose for the price, what else can you can one say? A hose is a hose is a hose.</li>
            <li> Worked just fine...Fittings worked with my curent system with no problems.  Slightly different color, but works just fine.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to aquarium airline tubing cause that stuff is a little pricey. This tubing has a safety feature in it so it doesn&#x27;t get kinked and it isn&#x27;t an airtight seal with the air pumps for aquariums</li>
            <li> Diameter too small, tends to kink</li>
            <li> its not that the tubbing does not work it does. but i did not want green.and no wherewas it listed that it might come in that color.for if it did i would not of ordered it. does any oneeven wonder how this effects a person who is on oxygen?i think not.</li>
            <li> Product was wrapped and coiled neatly. Had no problems with hooking it up. I will continue to use this style of tubing due to ease in use and availability.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This tubing is very thin, it can easily get kinks and nots. When opened the packaged it already had a bend in the tubing that couldn&#x27;t be fix. I had to order another less than 2 weeks later. I would not recommend this product to anyone, when the tubing bends and nots, very little oxygen flow is available. I gave this item one star because it was delivered on time!!</li>
            <li> The tubing is okay but it never lays straight. Tubing is stiff and stays in rolls over the floor so more trip over it. I hope wit time it will lay flat. It is exactly what I ordered I don&#x27;t know if all tubing is like this or not I am new to the oxygen accessory purchases.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tubing that didn&#x27;t give of an obnoxious smell. This one did not have a smell or odor and served my purpose .The tubing I received from the oxygen supplier had an order that would make you sick while receiving oxygen..</li>
            <li> Delivered when promised  Delivered when promised in great shape. Was easy to order and was just what was advertised I will use this dealer again in great shape. Was easy to order and was just what was advertised I will use this dealer again</li>
            <li> The  oxygen tubing works great its nice to be able to move around the house and still be on oxygen too</li>
            <li> Great seller super fast ship would highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li> My mom is on oxygen and needed longer tubing for her large machine. This gave her a lot of freedom around the house and even to go outside</li>
            <li> I like to change out my hose often - I can get free ones from my medical provider but the quality of this one is much better - fewer tangles and fewer problems and that&#x27;s a good thing. I&#x27;ll keep buying these.</li>
            <li> I like this item was exactly as described the only problem was I had was is still a little excessive in the tangled up area. I truly believe is more my fault the air hose</li>
