            <li>That is amazing!</li>
            <li>the perfect finishing touch for my woman&#x27;s hair love the way it leaves her hair feeling and smelling</li>
            <li>Also, a friend of mine also uses this, and she has had better results; her hair is softer and silkier, and our best guess is because she has thinner hair, so that might be something to take into consideration.</li>
            <li>Good product but over-priced.</li>
            <li>good things about this conditioner are its price/quantity.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this conditioner along with the shampoo, because I have heard good things about Tresemme, specifically this line of product.</li>
            <li>The price was good too.</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years.</li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner for any type of hair.</li>
            <li>Not the best product to use for de tangling after shampooing, but it is a quick fix.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I just love it.!</li>
            <li>It appears that Tresemme changed the formula of this once great conditioner, and now instead of smooth</li>
            <li>It is effective and affordable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Tresemme Smooth and Silky Conditioner, 32 Ounce is a very nice conditioner for all types of hair,especially nice to get this on a subscription.</li>
            <li>I just love this Tresemme, it gives exceptional results.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as the shampoo, but it&#x27;s similar, and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Let me say this stuff is definetly the best combo you can use for hair you want to be soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner, as well as their shampoo...</li>
            <li>Mostly I&#x27;ve noticed that it helps me detangle my hair well and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of conditioner, this feels great on my hair and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to keep my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I love tresemee</li>
            <li>But after 3-5 months to using it I noticed I had many split ends, and I never had any with pantene.</li>
            <li>my curl pattern more enhanced.</li>
            <li>but I am sure I will find something on amazon to help me remedy this issue...</li>
            <li>The item I am the most picky about when it comes to my hair is what conditioner I use.</li>
            <li>One more thing, the picture does not match the product, please update it because they changed the label also.</li>
            <li>So far, Tresemme Smooth and Silky is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is my understanding, their wealthy and pampered clients expect the hyped, pricey, &amp;#34;snobbier&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li>The ads promise the moon but they are over the top cost-wise.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair...</li>
            <li>The shampoo is actually surprisingly nice, considering Tresemme is really cheap.</li>
            <li>But if you have a favorite conditioner, I would use that with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love Tresemme products and this conditioner did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>I love the Tresemme&#x27;s stuff.</li>
            <li>I would use it again, but I think there must be something better out there that is just as inexpensive as this product.</li>
            <li>Also, it works even BETTER when paired with the Shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied</li>
            <li>It works as described and at this price it is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li>Not our favorite, but not horrible either.</li>
            <li>It is nothing spectacular but it is a good condition for daily use at a good price.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw...the manicure and pedicure were very nice and the added luxury touches made me feel pampered.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw...the manicure and pedicure were very nice and the added luxury touches made me feel pampered.</li>
            <li>They work very well and smell very nice too.</li>
            <li>Again, My wife swears by this product and I find it to be pretty good myself.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it does smell pretty good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it leaves my hair softer than ever and no knots easy to brush and no friz &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I felt like I needed to use way too much of the product to cover all my hair and give it a good coating of conditioner.</li>
            <li>The tresemme Moisture rich conditioner is better.</li>
            <li>Tresemme is my go-to conditioner, and I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them on here for such a great price.</li>
            <li>My daughter used it and it left her hair in a beautiful state</li>
            <li>So I absolutly do not recommend this product because it hugely damages your hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get it to fit in my shower</li>
            <li>well, smooth and silky like the bottle indicates.</li>
            <li>sound expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>For me she used Tresemme Smooth &amp; Silky Shampoo with Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>His decision to use Tresemme was an important one for his business.</li>
            <li>have since become a Tresemme fan and also use their Smooth and Silky Conditioner.</li>
            <li>His decision to use Tresemme was an important one for his business.</li>
            <li>have since become a Tresemme fan and also use their Smooth and Silky Conditioner.</li>
            <li>smooth</li>
            <li>conditioner treated her ends and seemingly smooth the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner leaves my hair silky and tangle free</li>
            <li>Also, it smells so good and natural scented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tresemme products for a number of years and have always been able to get the larger sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I forgot how good it felt to have soft hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair nice and soft and makes it easy to brush through after a shower.</li>
            <li>I felt like I would&#x27;ve been better off not washing it in the first place since it felt almost like it was glued together with gel, and</li>
            <li>Cheaper than going to Target to get one with free shipping and quick deliver.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and leaves hair soft but not oily.</li>
            <li>Her hair was softer, shiny, fuller looking and for about ten days smelled so good and fresh.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several hair conditioners, from the lower end to more moderate pricing range, and this is now my favorite!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is really cheap, under $4 a bottle, and it seems to really make my hair smoother than the swave products that i have been using before switching to this stuff.</li>
            <li>This was a great idea for the fact that I do not have to worry about buying these items in the near future.</li>
            <li>They wash out cleanly or u can leave alittle in and it will dry nicely still.</li>
            <li>it is probably the cheapest thing you can find on the market, but It always leave your hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>It looks okay, but I don&#x27;t notice it looking better than when I use other conditioners.</li>
            <li>TRESemme Smooth &amp; Silky does what I need it to do, mainly get the tangles out of my hair.</li>
            <li>He was ready to take the risk, get good results and save money in the long run.</li>
            <li>He was ready to take the risk, get good results and save money in the long run.</li>
            <li>The after effect is clean semi- frizzy soft hair that takes days to recover from being &#x27;too clean&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I wish it left the hair smelling of a little more clean fragrance, but its still good.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, just Tresemme conditioners in general.</li>
            <li>It rinses out well but leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Speedy delivery and a nice product, good value for New York shopping, would recommend to other potential buyers.</li>
            <li>First off, i&#x27;m a guy, and i use this along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, silky and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels light and fluffy again. :)</li>
            <li>because it took me so much longer to blow dry after a period of using this conditioner my hair ended up more frizzy and damaged than before.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>silky smooth, just like the bottle says, a very big bottle.</li>
            <li>Like that you get as much as you do for the price that you pay.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;deliver intense moisturization</li>
            <li>I have used this Conditioner since i was a Freshman in High School!</li>
            <li>I actually bought this to bring my order up to the minimum required for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap, simple conditioner.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that is to give the aura of clinical strength, but I like the scent of herbs or flowers we get with most other conditioners.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t particularly smooth or silky (though it&#x27;s not like it ruined my hair or anything), and my hair gets tangled a little more easily than usual :</li>
            <li>nothing special about it, was not moisturizing enough for my bleached hair, just another conditioner</li>
            <li>have black, naturally staight, kind of oily hair.</li>
            <li>Now when I visit my usual stylist, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner with me - the Tresemme line.</li>
            <li>Now when I visit my usual stylist, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner with me - the Tresemme line.</li>
            <li>The only thing is there&#x27;s so many different types</li>
            <li>This particular bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a pump</li>
            <li>As I said, I have been using the conditioner for over two weeks, while most only last me two weeks max.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, on my last birthday, my daughter gave me the super luxurious gift of a cut, style, manicure and pedicure at one of NYC&#x27;s most famous, (and expensive), up-town &amp;#34;beauty studios.&amp;#34; Even the words, &amp;#34;beauty studio&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It works fine like any other decent brand conditioner.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and I don&#x27;t need to use much for it to work.</li>
            <li>I tried the shampoo and it did seem very moisturizing but the conditioner felt very watered down and the smell is too sweet.</li>
            <li>I got this for three dollars and change which is a fantastic price for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li>and this takes out all the tangles and leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>This advanced shampoo, with Moroccan Argan oil, really does cleanse and helps tame my unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought it with Tresemme conditioner last week,and today is the first time I tried them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have continued to use this same product since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>(for the last 6 years haha!)</li>
            <li>This conditioner is light, rinses out well and does not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>I figured I would give this conditioner a try since I am on a pretty tight budget but realized I ended up using 1/3 of a bottle the first day.</li>
            <li>It left my wig hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair freakishly soft and silky, just as it promises.</li>
            <li>Make my hair soft and</li>
            <li>I am an old man.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend buying this condition unless you can get the old 7x formula.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so touchable and soft.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know where I will go for a terrific and reasonably priced haircut when she retires.</li>
            <li>After washing, my hair did not feel sleek or soft.</li>
            <li>It makes hair soft and silky as the label says it does.</li>
            <li>While this does make my hair soft, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is to the point of being \\&quot;silky.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The stylist and owner told me that over the years he discovered that Tresemme does as much or more than other more expensive shampoos and hair product lines.</li>
            <li>doesnt work on dry hair much</li>
            <li>Too big to fit on my tiny little shelf in my shower.</li>
            <li>It was really amazing considering what her hair usually does after a few days of being shampooed and conditioned.</li>
            <li>Because it left my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>A complete disaster and is the last product I would ever recommend.</li>
            <li>Tresemme has a good product for crazy hair types.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not oily like some other conditioners that seem to stay stuck in your hair no matter how much you rinse.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair soft though you might still need to use a leave in conditioner, especially if you blow dry your hair a lot.</li>

            <li> Not our favorite, but not horrible either.</li>
            <li> It is nothing spectacular but it is a good condition for daily use at a good price.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw...the manicure and pedicure were very nice and the added luxury touches made me feel pampered.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw...the manicure and pedicure were very nice and the added luxury touches made me feel pampered.</li>
            <li> They work very well and smell very nice too.</li>
            <li> Again, My wife swears by this product and I find it to be pretty good myself.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it does smell pretty good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it leaves my hair softer than ever and no knots easy to brush and no friz &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I felt like I needed to use way too much of the product to cover all my hair and give it a good coating of conditioner.</li>
            <li> The tresemme Moisture rich conditioner is better.</li>
            <li> Tresemme is my go-to conditioner, and I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them on here for such a great price.</li>
            <li> My daughter used it and it left her hair in a beautiful state</li>
            <li> So I absolutly do not recommend this product because it hugely damages your hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get it to fit in my shower</li>
            <li> well, smooth and silky like the bottle indicates.</li>
            <li> sound expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> For me she used Tresemme Smooth &amp; Silky Shampoo with Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> His decision to use Tresemme was an important one for his business.</li>
            <li> have since become a Tresemme fan and also use their Smooth and Silky Conditioner.</li>
            <li> His decision to use Tresemme was an important one for his business.</li>
            <li> have since become a Tresemme fan and also use their Smooth and Silky Conditioner.</li>
            <li> smooth</li>
            <li> conditioner treated her ends and seemingly smooth the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner leaves my hair silky and tangle free</li>
            <li> Also, it smells so good and natural scented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tresemme products for a number of years and have always been able to get the larger sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I forgot how good it felt to have soft hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair nice and soft and makes it easy to brush through after a shower.</li>
            <li> I felt like I would&#x27;ve been better off not washing it in the first place since it felt almost like it was glued together with gel, and</li>
            <li> Cheaper than going to Target to get one with free shipping and quick deliver.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and leaves hair soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> Her hair was softer, shiny, fuller looking and for about ten days smelled so good and fresh.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several hair conditioners, from the lower end to more moderate pricing range, and this is now my favorite!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really cheap, under $4 a bottle, and it seems to really make my hair smoother than the swave products that i have been using before switching to this stuff.</li>
            <li> This was a great idea for the fact that I do not have to worry about buying these items in the near future.</li>
            <li> They wash out cleanly or u can leave alittle in and it will dry nicely still.</li>
            <li> it is probably the cheapest thing you can find on the market, but It always leave your hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It looks okay, but I don&#x27;t notice it looking better than when I use other conditioners.</li>
            <li> TRESemme Smooth &amp; Silky does what I need it to do, mainly get the tangles out of my hair.</li>
            <li> He was ready to take the risk, get good results and save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> He was ready to take the risk, get good results and save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> The after effect is clean semi- frizzy soft hair that takes days to recover from being &#x27;too clean&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I wish it left the hair smelling of a little more clean fragrance, but its still good.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, just Tresemme conditioners in general.</li>
            <li> It rinses out well but leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Speedy delivery and a nice product, good value for New York shopping, would recommend to other potential buyers.</li>
            <li> First off, i&#x27;m a guy, and i use this along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, silky and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels light and fluffy again. :)</li>
            <li> because it took me so much longer to blow dry after a period of using this conditioner my hair ended up more frizzy and damaged than before.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> silky smooth, just like the bottle says, a very big bottle.</li>
            <li> Like that you get as much as you do for the price that you pay.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;deliver intense moisturization</li>
            <li> I have used this Conditioner since i was a Freshman in High School!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to bring my order up to the minimum required for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap, simple conditioner.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that is to give the aura of clinical strength, but I like the scent of herbs or flowers we get with most other conditioners.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t particularly smooth or silky (though it&#x27;s not like it ruined my hair or anything), and my hair gets tangled a little more easily than usual :</li>
            <li> nothing special about it, was not moisturizing enough for my bleached hair, just another conditioner</li>
            <li> have black, naturally staight, kind of oily hair.</li>
            <li> Now when I visit my usual stylist, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner with me - the Tresemme line.</li>
            <li> Now when I visit my usual stylist, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner with me - the Tresemme line.</li>
            <li> The only thing is there&#x27;s so many different types</li>
            <li> This particular bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a pump</li>
            <li> As I said, I have been using the conditioner for over two weeks, while most only last me two weeks max.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, on my last birthday, my daughter gave me the super luxurious gift of a cut, style, manicure and pedicure at one of NYC&#x27;s most famous, (and expensive), up-town &amp;#34;beauty studios.&amp;#34; Even the words, &amp;#34;beauty studio&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It works fine like any other decent brand conditioner.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and I don&#x27;t need to use much for it to work.</li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo and it did seem very moisturizing but the conditioner felt very watered down and the smell is too sweet.</li>
            <li> I got this for three dollars and change which is a fantastic price for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> and this takes out all the tangles and leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> This advanced shampoo, with Moroccan Argan oil, really does cleanse and helps tame my unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought it with Tresemme conditioner last week,and today is the first time I tried them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have continued to use this same product since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> (for the last 6 years haha!)</li>
            <li> This conditioner is light, rinses out well and does not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> I figured I would give this conditioner a try since I am on a pretty tight budget but realized I ended up using 1/3 of a bottle the first day.</li>
            <li> It left my wig hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair freakishly soft and silky, just as it promises.</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft and</li>
            <li> I am an old man.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend buying this condition unless you can get the old 7x formula.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so touchable and soft.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know where I will go for a terrific and reasonably priced haircut when she retires.</li>
            <li> After washing, my hair did not feel sleek or soft.</li>
            <li> It makes hair soft and silky as the label says it does.</li>
            <li> While this does make my hair soft, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is to the point of being \\&quot;silky.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The stylist and owner told me that over the years he discovered that Tresemme does as much or more than other more expensive shampoos and hair product lines.</li>
            <li> doesnt work on dry hair much</li>
            <li> Too big to fit on my tiny little shelf in my shower.</li>
            <li> It was really amazing considering what her hair usually does after a few days of being shampooed and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Because it left my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> A complete disaster and is the last product I would ever recommend.</li>
            <li> Tresemme has a good product for crazy hair types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not oily like some other conditioners that seem to stay stuck in your hair no matter how much you rinse.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair soft though you might still need to use a leave in conditioner, especially if you blow dry your hair a lot.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that she was using Tresemme Shampoo and other Tresemme products -  various types of shampoos and conditioners depending on one&#x27;s hair type.</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing and leaves your hair feel soft as ever.</li>
            <li> Keeps long hair from becoming a tangled mess overnight - no more tears during brushing!  </li>
            <li> I have slightly dry and coarse hair and found that this low to mid-price range product did what its ads promised it would do...</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only a minor quibble.</li>
            <li> Never dyed or use flat or curl iron.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I flat iron every day...</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair once a month tops and have never used a flat iron on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It does a similar job to ThermaSilk while only charging about half the price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this along with some other personal items.</li>
            <li> bottle lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottle lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with conditioners because shampoos dry it out.</li>
            <li> I have average hair, on the dry side, probably because I wash it daily.</li>
            <li> I only use this conditioner when my hair is extremely tangled, and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> I used to use ThermaSilk conditioner for years, but when the product was discontinued, I was forced to find new product that gave that silky touch.  </li>
            <li> Takes less than other brands I&#x27;ve tried to get the same effect, really only a small dollop is enough for my fairly long and voluminous hair.</li>
            <li> It actually somewhat dried my hair out, rather than conditioned it.</li>
            <li> Paired with the shampoo of the same brand and make, my hair is fluffy as ever.</li>
            <li> I mean, this stuff isn&#x27;t as bad as a lot of the other conditioner in its price range, but I would not make this my new favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> much different than it usual is</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to those looking for a product that is not so heavy for (human hair) wigs as well as the thick, wavy, course hair of a teenager who wears clip ins, weave and braided styles as well different dyes, spray in colors and all kinds of other styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were working amazingly for a couple of weeks, but then suddenly were terrible.</li>
            <li> where your hair needs it most.&amp;#34; It did lessen the frizz and flyaways without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have followed her from hair salon to hair salon, 4 in all, over the past years and would not normally think of going to another</li>
            <li> I typically go for the pricier brands, because they make my hair feel softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this conditioner is particularly moisturizing, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s crazy is that it&#x27;s much cheaper than other brands that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> The conditioner however was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have long thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two and a half weeks, and my hair actually feels worse than it did (note:</li>
            <li> It left my hair greasy, heavy and incredibly difficult to dry.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and girls cannot keep their hands out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Once my hair dried, it did feel a bit softer, but it did not feel conditioned.</li>
            <li> I failed for several months until a friend turned me on to this.  </li>
            <li> I usually splurge and go for the high-end shampoos and conditioners also.</li>
            <li> these services at my usual salon.&lt;br /&gt;JANAhair product lines.</li>
            <li> these services at my usual salon.&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
            <li> It works with my hard water.</li>
            <li> I have hard water even with a Gulligan water system.</li>
            <li> Overall disappointing and would not purchase again</li>
            <li> I guess, in a bad way, that&#x27;s probably cause by my last haircut.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair at all, I mean at ALL.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly difficult to deal with - thick and frizzy - so I&#x27;ve tried dozens of conditioners over the years.</li>
            <li> The bottle used to say 7x smoother, and now it says 5x smoother; thus, they know that they made it worse.</li>
            <li> I believe their move to save a few cents was an extremely bad move.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> Her hair is usually tangled and very difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay mega bucks for the expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> These weird flakes started appearing on my scalp, and made my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also frizzy, which is weird</li>
            <li> unfortunately this is not it.</li>
            <li> Like all Tresemme products you will not be disappointed with this conditioner.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> TRESemme Smooth &amp; Silky does what I need it to do, mainly get the tangles out of my hair. I&#x27;d also like to keep my hair looking healthy. It looks okay, but I don&#x27;t notice it looking better than when I use other conditioners. The biggest drawback for me it a sort of medicinal scent. Perhaps that is to give the aura of clinical strength, but I like the scent of herbs or flowers we get with most other conditioners.</li>
            <li> First off, i&#x27;m a guy, and i use this along with the shampoo. Let me say this stuff is definetly the best combo you can use for hair you want to be soft and silky. I use it everyday and girls cannot keep their hands out of my hair. And i do admit, i know why. It makes my hair freakishly soft and silky, just as it promises. This stuff should be way more expensive, but let&#x27;s thank god it&#x27;s not. I 100% recommend this.</li>
            <li> Before I switched to tresemee I used Pantene, at fist I love tresemee Because it left my hair so soft and silky. But after 3-5 months to using it I noticed I had many split ends, and I never had any with pantene. I blow dry my hair once a month tops and have never used a flat iron on my hair.  So I absolutly do not recommend this product because it hugely damages your hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it leaves my hair softer than ever and no knots easy to brush and no friz &amp;#60;3 great buy thank you so much</li>
            <li> This product is great for my colored hair.  My husband uses this to for his dry/damaged hair.  Don&#x27;t pay mega bucks for the expensive stuff.  This product works great.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly difficult to deal with - thick and frizzy - so I&#x27;ve tried dozens of conditioners over the years. This is by far the worst. It left my hair greasy, heavy and incredibly difficult to dry. I felt like I would&#x27;ve been better off not washing it in the first place since it felt almost like it was glued together with gel, and because it took me so much longer to blow dry after a period of using this conditioner my hair ended up more frizzy and damaged than before. A complete disaster and is the last product I would ever recommend.</li>
            <li> Tresemme is my go-to conditioner, and I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them on here for such a great price. Cheaper than going to Target to get one with free shipping and quick deliver. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I have used Tresemme for over 15 years now. It is effective and affordable. I also recommend the shampoo as well. Then you can say &amp;#34;Oh La lah&#x27; like me.</li>
            <li> Great product and cleans well. I wish it left the hair smelling of a little more clean fragrance, but its still good. Shampoos/Conditioner seem so over priced, i would only recommend if you find a deal on it. If your happy with the price, you&#x27;ll be happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft and my curl pattern more enhanced. Buy it is your hair is set and damaged. Your hair will soak it up like sponge. Also try the keratin one. This is the only brand I use and will ever use. The only thing is there&#x27;s so many different types tresemme shampoo and conditioner you get overwhelmed by them all!</li>
            <li> I am an old man. After shampoo my hair looks like a corn patch in a drought. Gel helps but then I look like Alfalfa in the Our Gang comedies. This is the answer.</li>
            <li> Tresemme Smooth and Silky Conditioner, 32 Ounce is a very nice conditioner for all types of hair,especially nice to get this on a subscription.</li>
            <li> silky smooth, just like the bottle says, a very big bottle. Too big to fit on my tiny little shelf in my shower. I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get it to fit in my shower yet but I am sure I will find something on amazon to help me remedy this issue...</li>
            <li> Like that you get as much as you do for the price that you pay.  It lasts a long time and smells good too.</li>
            <li> the perfect finishing touch for my woman&#x27;s hair love the way it leaves her hair feeling and smelling she&#x27;s happy too.</li>
            <li> The item I am the most picky about when it comes to my hair is what conditioner I use. I figured I would give this conditioner a try since I am on a pretty tight budget but realized I ended up using 1/3 of a bottle the first day. I felt like I needed to use way too much of the product to cover all my hair and give it a good coating of conditioner. Overall disappointing and would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Not the best product to use for de tangling after shampooing, but it is a quick fix.  My hair is coarse and sometimes I need tons of product to work into the tangles. The after effect is clean semi- frizzy soft hair that takes days to recover from being &#x27;too clean&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Keeps long hair from becoming a tangled mess overnight - no more tears during brushing!  Also. This leaves your hair silky and glossy.</li>
            <li> This is conditioner.  It works.  It&#x27;s not salon-grade, but you shouldn&#x27;t expect salon-grade without paying salon-prices&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice. word.</li>
            <li> It appears that Tresemme changed the formula of this once great conditioner, and now instead of smooth it feels sticky. The bottle used to say 7x smoother, and now it says 5x smoother; thus, they know that they made it worse. They also appear to have removed the oil that made this conditioner great. I do not recommend buying this condition unless you can get the old 7x formula. I believe their move to save a few cents was an extremely bad move. Does anybody know a conditioner to recommend that is as great as this conditioner used to be? One more thing, the picture does not match the product, please update it because they changed the label also.</li>
            <li> Good product but over-priced. Same product, same size at my local supermarket for $3.99! Amazon doesn&#x27;t price match so I got ripped off.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does a great job of cleaning my hair and scalp. I wash my hair with conditioners because shampoos dry it out. So far, Tresemme Smooth and Silky is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It leaves my hair clean, silky and soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner gets plenty of use from both my wife and I. It leaves your hair feeling... well, smooth and silky like the bottle indicates. This particular bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a pump but that&#x27;s only a minor quibble. It&#x27;s also not oily like some other conditioners that seem to stay stuck in your hair no matter how much you rinse. Again, My wife swears by this product and I find it to be pretty good myself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this conditioner is particularly moisturizing, unfortunately.  I have been using this for about two and a half weeks, and my hair actually feels worse than it did (note: I didn&#x27;t change anything else in my haircare regimen) before, when I used Asience and Pantene.  My hair isn&#x27;t particularly smooth or silky (though it&#x27;s not like it ruined my hair or anything), and my hair gets tangled a little more easily than usual :/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good things about this conditioner are its price/quantity.  As I said, I have been using the conditioner for over two weeks, while most only last me two weeks max.  Also, a friend of mine also uses this, and she has had better results; her hair is softer and silkier, and our best guess is because she has thinner hair, so that might be something to take into consideration.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, just Tresemme conditioners in general. It leaves my hair so touchable and soft. I just love it.! It great for extensions and your hair as well. I use this product on both. I just love this Tresemme, it gives exceptional results. you will not be disappointed and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair at all, I mean at ALL. Also, it smells so good and natural scented.</li>
            <li> I used to use ThermaSilk conditioner for years, but when the product was discontinued, I was forced to find new product that gave that silky touch.  I failed for several months until a friend turned me on to this.  It does a similar job to ThermaSilk while only charging about half the price.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been with the same hair stylist for over 20 years now and I don&#x27;t know where I will go for a terrific and reasonably priced haircut when she retires. I have followed her from hair salon to hair salon, 4 in all, over the past years and would not normally think of going to another stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on my last birthday, my daughter gave me the super luxurious gift of a cut, style, manicure and pedicure at one of NYC&#x27;s most famous, (and expensive), up-town &amp;#34;beauty studios.&amp;#34; Even the words, &amp;#34;beauty studio&amp;#34; sound expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arriving, I was ushered into a beautifully decorated waiting room and offered a coffee, chai, cappuccino or latte. My stylist came out and introduced himself and we went back to his station. He suggested various styles and cuts and then, after making a decision, the &amp;#34;shampoo artist&amp;#34; accompanied me to her station. I was surprised to see that she was using Tresemme Shampoo and other Tresemme products -  various types of shampoos and conditioners depending on one&#x27;s hair type. For me she used Tresemme Smooth &amp; Silky Shampoo with Moroccan Argan Oil. I have slightly dry and coarse hair and found that this low to mid-price range product did what its ads promised it would do...&amp;#34;deliver intense moisturization where your hair needs it most.&amp;#34; It did lessen the frizz and flyaways without weighing my hair down. This advanced shampoo, with Moroccan Argan oil, really does cleanse and helps tame my unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for my surprise is that this prestigious salon uses such relatively inexpensive products.  It is my understanding, their wealthy and pampered clients expect the hyped, pricey, &amp;#34;snobbier&amp;#34; products. I usually splurge and go for the high-end shampoos and conditioners also. The ads promise the moon but they are over the top cost-wise. The stylist and owner told me that over the years he discovered that Tresemme does as much or more than other more expensive shampoos and hair product lines. His decision to use Tresemme was an important one for his business. He didn&#x27;t want to risk the displeasure of his customers when changing his line of hair care products. He was ready to take the risk, get good results and save money in the long run. This 32 oz. bottle lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since become a Tresemme fan and also use their Smooth and Silky Conditioner. Now when I visit my usual stylist, I bring my own shampoo and conditioner with me - the Tresemme line. Very highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw...the manicure and pedicure were very nice and the added luxury touches made me feel pampered. But the overall result was about the same as when I&lt;br /&gt;purchase these services at my usual salon.&lt;br /&gt;JANAhair product lines.

            <li> This is by far the best conditioner, as well as their shampoo...I have long hair that I flat iron every day...and it does not leave the hair greasy at all...smooth and I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair...we are on our second bottle!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were working amazingly for a couple of weeks, but then suddenly were terrible. These weird flakes started appearing on my scalp, and made my hair greasy. Also it contains sulphates. Would never buy this agin</li>
            <li> I bought this along with some other personal items. This was a great idea for the fact that I do not have to worry about buying these items in the near future.</li>
            <li> Great Value. I got this for three dollars and change which is a fantastic price for such a big bottle. It works fine like any other decent brand conditioner. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this item for my wigs. It smells so good. It left my wig hair soft and very manageable. My daughter used it and it left her hair in a beautiful state much different than it usual is when she shampoos and conditions her hair. Her hair is usually tangled and very difficult to manage. She placed the conditioner in her hair, placed a plastic bag on her head and allowed the conditioner to sit on her hair for about 20 minutes. Her hair behaved for about ten days. It was really amazing considering what her hair usually does after a few days of being shampooed and conditioned. I would recommend this product to those looking for a product that is not so heavy for (human hair) wigs as well as the thick, wavy, course hair of a teenager who wears clip ins, weave and braided styles as well different dyes, spray in colors and all kinds of other styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner treated her ends and seemingly smooth the hair shaft. Her hair was softer, shiny, fuller looking and for about ten days smelled so good and fresh.</li>
            <li> I typically go for the pricier brands, because they make my hair feel softer and healthier. I won&#x27;t name any specific brands. I have average hair, on the dry side, probably because I wash it daily. I decided to try this conditioner along with the shampoo, because I have heard good things about Tresemme, specifically this line of product. The shampoo is actually surprisingly nice, considering Tresemme is really cheap. The conditioner however was pretty disappointing. It actually somewhat dried my hair out, rather than conditioned it. After washing, my hair did not feel sleek or soft. Once my hair dried, it did feel a bit softer, but it did not feel conditioned. If you&#x27;re considering trying both the shampoo and conditioner, I suggest skipping the conditioner. I actually think my hair was softer/sleeker with just using the shampoo alone and not using conditioner. But if you have a favorite conditioner, I would use that with the shampoo. I mean, this stuff isn&#x27;t as bad as a lot of the other conditioner in its price range, but I would not make this my new favorite conditioner. On the plus side, it does smell pretty good. Not quite as good as the shampoo, but it&#x27;s similar, and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> the best shamppo I&#x27;ve ever had! I just bought it with Tresemme conditioner last week,and today is the first time I tried them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have black, naturally staight, kind of oily hair. Never dyed or use flat or curl iron. The problem is just that my hair is sort of wavy I guess, in a bad way, that&#x27;s probably cause by my last haircut. and it&#x27;s also frizzy, which is weird cause I have oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the shampoo and the conditioner, my hair is straighter and softer,I can see the  difference after just One use! That is amazing!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of conditioner, this feels great on my hair and the price is very reasonable. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Tresemme has a good product for crazy hair types. They work very well and smell very nice too. They wash out cleanly or u can leave alittle in and it will dry nicely still.</li>
            <li> Repaired my damaged hair and made it shine. Have continued to use this same product since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> doesnt work on dry hair much</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery and a nice product, good value for New York shopping, would recommend to other potential buyers. Does what it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I always buy Tressemme products because they are a great value for the price.  It works with my hard water.</li>
            <li> I love Tresemme products and this conditioner did not disappoint.  It smells nice and leaves hair soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> Takes less than other brands I&#x27;ve tried to get the same effect, really only a small dollop is enough for my fairly long and voluminous hair. Paired with the shampoo of the same brand and make, my hair is fluffy as ever. Towel-dries to the same fluffiness I would get blowdrying it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is light, rinses out well and does not weigh down my hair.  It is nothing spectacular but it is a good condition for daily use at a good price.</li>
            <li> I love the Tresemme&#x27;s stuff. it is probably the cheapest thing you can find on the market, but It always leave your hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed. It makes hair soft and silky as the label says it does. It smells really great too!</li>
            <li> Still looking for the holy grail of shampoos and conditioners...unfortunately this is not it. While this does make my hair soft, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is to the point of being \\&quot;silky.\\&quot; Mostly I&#x27;ve noticed that it helps me detangle my hair well and smells nice. I would use it again, but I think there must be something better out there that is just as inexpensive as this product.</li>
            <li> I only use this conditioner when my hair is extremely tangled, and it works wonders! Keeps my hair soft and I don&#x27;t need to use much for it to work.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really cheap, under $4 a bottle, and it seems to really make my hair smoother than the swave products that i have been using before switching to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this Conditioner since i was a Freshman in High School! (for the last 6 years haha!) It is extremely moisturizing and leaves your hair feel soft as ever. I recommend this to anyone with damaged hair. Also, it works even BETTER when paired with the Shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It rinses out well but leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.  The price was good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tresemme products for a number of years and have always been able to get the larger sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner at a good price.  Amazon had a great deal on these!</li>
            <li> nothing special about it, was not moisturizing enough for my bleached hair, just another conditioner</li>
            <li> Very good product for kinky curly hair! I&#x27;m totally satisfied</li>
            <li> Like all Tresemme products you will not be disappointed with this conditioner.  It works as described and at this price it is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li> This product is great. The 32 ounce bottle of conditione lasted me no joke about 3 or 4 months. That is with using it every day, sometimes twice a day. It makes your hair nice and soft and makes it easy to brush through after a shower. I definitely recommend, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo and it did seem very moisturizing but the conditioner felt very watered down and the smell is too sweet. The tresemme Moisture rich conditioner is better.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years. I have hard water even with a Gulligan water system. I forgot how good it felt to have soft hair. My hair feels light and fluffy again. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several hair conditioners, from the lower end to more moderate pricing range, and this is now my favorite!! What&#x27;s crazy is that it&#x27;s much cheaper than other brands that I&#x27;ve used but this one actually works. I have long thick, wavy hair and this takes out all the tangles and leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to bring my order up to the minimum required for free shipping.  I like it. It works good. Nothing special, but it works fine. I have long thick hair and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not our favorite, but not horrible either.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner for any type of hair. I bought it with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner leaves my hair silky and tangle free-that is what I look for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> It is cheap, simple conditioner. Leaves the hair soft though you might still need to use a leave in conditioner, especially if you blow dry your hair a lot.</li>
