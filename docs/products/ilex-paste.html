            <li>It was so great!</li>
            <li>Wish you the best!!</li>
            <li>Great for severe diaper rash!</li>
            <li>Great product, recommended to me by NICU nurses for my son&#x27;s severe diaper rash.</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>works great as a barrier cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I stumbled upon a comment in an online forum recommending ilex for this severe type of diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING stuff.</li>
            <li>I will tell everyone I know with kids about this amazing product.</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERY kind of cream and ointment out there for over two years.</li>
            <li>But it really is the best thing I have found for diaper rash.</li>
            <li>I tried many creams but nothing seemed to help, &#x27;till I got a hold of this MAGIC product that helped in no time...</li>
            <li>You may need to add more to any spots that did come off with wiping though and reapply vaseline.</li>
            <li>THE BEST TOPICAL OUT THERE!!!</li>
            <li>Thank u, they also should be in stores, and more people should know about it</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased 2 tubes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure your to use zinc oxide on top</li>
            <li>Please be sure to read the directions though, and make sure to put Aquaphor or Vaseline over the top of it.</li>
            <li>too many people wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it correctly, I think.</li>
            <li>Once applied, the rash looked 50% better within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much ilex!!!!  </li>
            <li>It starts working very soon after the first application and forms a very good barrier to protect the skin.</li>
            <li>and besides, you don&#x27;t need to use it for long, so it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li>totally worth making her feel better</li>
            <li>When applying, make sure to layer Vaseline on top, as this stuff is very sticky when it dries - you don&#x27;t want it sticking to the diaper or underwear.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow good hygiene with washing hands and such.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth a 20 star rating!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love this ilex paste , really helped my child with his rash</li>
            <li>Ilex has made a tremendous difference- we rarely have chafing or bleeding issues anymore.</li>
            <li>This product was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Cleared it right up after nothing else would.</li>
            <li>Over a couple months, his doctors tried many different prescription and over the counter items.</li>
            <li>My otherwise healthy one month old son developed a very very severe diaper rash that would not go away.  </li>
            <li>It would not clear up a more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; diaper rash on her bottom however.</li>
            <li>it does kind of ball up into little bits after a while but putting a coating of a&amp;d or petroleum jelly</li>
            <li>This has really helped the red,raw and sore skin around my j-tube.</li>
            <li>That did just so much</li>
            <li>This stuff really works to help his bottom heal and minimizes his pain.</li>
            <li>The reason I switch from the ilex paste to other is because I can&#x27;t decide which I like better.</li>
            <li>Air drying her first before putting on the paste really helped to clear her week old diaper rash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>For that alone I&#x27;ll be stocking this paste in the house and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I always made my own baby wipes out of saline solution and plain white paper towels.</li>
            <li>Our son had a lot of ear infections as a baby and would get tons of diaper rash from the meds and diarrhea and this always made it at least 75% better just overnight...and gone completely in two nights.</li>
            <li>and he is almost 7 months old now.  </li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t wipe it off completely in between diapers, just blot.</li>
            <li>Since the rash was still not improving at all, I took my one month old to the pediatric dermatologist.</li>
            <li>This one actually made the rash much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If a messy diaper necessitates the removal of the parts that stick, a warm wet washcloth does the job.</li>
            <li>It looks a little gross but as long as his/her bottom is now clean with no more poop coming off when you wipe, they are good to go.</li>
            <li>This paste is fantastic for the bleeding diaper rash my son has gotten in the past.</li>
            <li>My son (only 2 yrs) has LS Hirschsprung&#x27;s Disease and has very frequent bowel movements after having his pullthrough.</li>
            <li>no other cream or remedy worked, but this stuff cleared it up in a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now been almost 48 hrs and the rash is BARELY noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Other than the smell, which is like a weak Ben-Gay aroma, it does the job better than Vaseline!</li>

            <li> One of my husbands&#x27; colleagues suggested this product and while I, at first, didn&#x27;t like using it as it seemed to be awful to remove, I read more up on it online and realized that you not only have to layer a THICK layer of petroleum jelly on top of it</li>
            <li> His bottom gets extremely sore to the point it gets blisters and is a raw, open, bleeding wound - from going so much.</li>
            <li> My son seems happier and I am extremely relieved to finally see improvement after weeks of stress trying to treat this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son had a pretty bad, weeping diaper rash when he was only a few weeks old.</li>
            <li> Decitin, triple cream, butt paste, no diaper for two hours every other diaper change......</li>
            <li> My son was a preemie and his delicate skin was constantly getting severe, bleeding diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this to anyone experiencing or whom has a child experiencing very painful open rashes and wounds as result of Hirschsprung&#x27;s or any other problem.</li>
            <li> , I know it&#x27;s expensive, but I wish the company can put their price down, but the cream really works.</li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t through a million other creams (and a few prescriptions) and this cleared up her rash in 48 hours after 4 weeks of redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> little pricey but</li>
            <li> His bottom went from being the worst and most painful for him that it&#x27;s ever been to using this stuff and after two days it was no longer an open wound, after a week if was all but cleared up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this product, and it is princess to me.</li>
            <li> , it was very bad, he was crying a lot , this is a miracle cream, everyone should know about it</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product in the NICU when my son had a horrible raw diaper rash.</li>
            <li> This works in 1-2 nights at getting rid of stubborn or really bad diaper rash.</li>
            <li> When he has any teething activity, he gets really bad diaper rash and all the pediatrician&#x27;s office</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this cream!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by our Pediatrician for my child&#x27;s terrible diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Terrible rash with sores, redness, and pain for my baby was GONE 100% WITHIN 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Its works well for Baby diaper rash</li>
            <li> I tried many creams but nothing seemed to help, &#x27;till I got a hold of this MAGIC product that helped in no time...</li>
            <li> Dr recommended this for a leaking g-tube on my daughter. Stomach acid was causing a rash on her skin.  This is cleared it up immediately.  Highly recommend it.  little pricey but totally worth making her feel better</li>
            <li> hiney soreness improved</li>
            <li> My son (only 2 yrs) has LS Hirschsprung&#x27;s Disease and has very frequent bowel movements after having his pullthrough. His bottom gets extremely sore to the point it gets blisters and is a raw, open, bleeding wound - from going so much. I have tried EVERY kind of cream and ointment out there for over two years. Nothing comes close to this stuff. His bottom went from being the worst and most painful for him that it&#x27;s ever been to using this stuff and after two days it was no longer an open wound, after a week if was all but cleared up. Now I continue to use it on him and it helps to prevent his bottom from getting sore all over again. It coats the wound/rash and hardens to a rubbery consistency (almost like liquid bandage) which keeps poop from getting through to the skin and helps it to have a break and heal. When you wipe stool off, you must leave any paste that is left intact on. It looks a little gross but as long as his/her bottom is now clean with no more poop coming off when you wipe, they are good to go. You may need to add more to any spots that did come off with wiping though and reapply vaseline. When applying, make sure to layer Vaseline on top, as this stuff is very sticky when it dries - you don&#x27;t want it sticking to the diaper or underwear. I would strongly recommend this to anyone experiencing or whom has a child experiencing very painful open rashes and wounds as result of Hirschsprung&#x27;s or any other problem. This is AMAZING stuff. It WILL work when used correctly. Try it out and if you or your child is anything like mine, you&#x27;ll be praising God that you gave it a go. I&#x27;m serious. I&#x27;d give this stuff 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> My son had a pretty bad, weeping diaper rash when he was only a few weeks old. It was around his anus and this was the only product that I found that cleared it up.  It starts working very soon after the first application and forms a very good barrier to protect the skin. I always apply vaseline over it to keep the product from sticking to his diaper.  Since I started using this product he has not had another diaper rash and he is almost 7 months old now.  I only use it on him at night before he goes to sleep.</li>
            <li> THE BEST TOPICAL OUT THERE!!!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to us by people in our situation. Other than the smell, which is like a weak Ben-Gay aroma, it does the job better than Vaseline!</li>
            <li> Recommended by our Pediatrician for my child&#x27;s terrible diaper rash. It was so great! Helped to protect it so it could heal.</li>
            <li> This paste worked wonders on the open wound type diaper rash my daughter had a one point. Cleared it right up after nothing else would. It would not clear up a more &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; diaper rash on her bottom however.</li>
            <li> Love this ilex paste , really helped my child with his rash, it was very bad, he was crying a lot , this is a miracle cream, everyone should know about it, I know it&#x27;s expensive, but I wish the company can put their price down, but the cream really works. Thank u, they also should be in stores, and more people should know about it</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that solves our daughter&#x27;s skin breakdown issues. Ilex has made a tremendous difference- we rarely have chafing or bleeding issues anymore.</li>
            <li> This paste is fantastic for the bleeding diaper rash my son has gotten in the past. They showed it to us in the NICU, and we&#x27;ve been buying it ever since.</li>
            <li> This product was well worth the money. It helped to reduce the redness and bumps from my baby&#x27;s diaper rash overnight. Air drying her first before putting on the paste really helped to clear her week old diaper rash. Glad I purchased 2 tubes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. As a parent I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d be without this. It&#x27;s an essential.</li>
            <li> Great product, recommended to me by NICU nurses for my son&#x27;s severe diaper rash. This product cleared up his bum within a day!</li>
            <li> My daughter was and within one day had no skin on her bottom. We treated for 4 months and lots of tears. Went to a wound care specialist who introduced me to Ilex. This stuff is worth a 20 star rating! Healed her bottom in 24 hours, no joke. She also has NO scars.  Make sure your to use zinc oxide on top or you will glue body parts together and never use commercial baby creams that have fragrance which will continue to irritate. I always made my own baby wipes out of saline solution and plain white paper towels. Make sure you follow good hygiene with washing hands and such. Wish you the best!!</li>
            <li> Miracle cream. Terrible rash with sores, redness, and pain for my baby was GONE 100% WITHIN 24 hours. Obsessed with this cream!!</li>
            <li> Lifesaver!!!!! This is the only cream that worked for our daughters SEVERE diaper rash. We weren&#x27;t through a million other creams (and a few prescriptions) and this cleared up her rash in 48 hours after 4 weeks of redness and irritation. You definitely have to put Vaseline over it to keep it from sticking to the diaper.  Obsessed with this product, and it is princess to me. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great for severe diaper rash! We used this all the time in the NICU with my son.</li>
            <li> I use the ilex paste on a j-tube site. I use this product for several days and then change to another for several days. Both products work  equally well. The reason I switch from the ilex paste to other is because I can&#x27;t decide which I like better. lol.  This has really helped the red,raw and sore skin around my j-tube.</li>
            <li> This works in 1-2 nights at getting rid of stubborn or really bad diaper rash. Please be sure to read the directions though, and make sure to put Aquaphor or Vaseline over the top of it. And you can&#x27;t wipe it off completely in between diapers, just blot. It&#x27;ll wear off eventually, sort of peeling off in bits. I wish this were mass-marketed but I can understand why it isn&#x27;t...too many people wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it correctly, I think. But it really is the best thing I have found for diaper rash. Our son had a lot of ear infections as a baby and would get tons of diaper rash from the meds and diarrhea and this always made it at least 75% better just overnight...and gone completely in two nights.</li>
            <li> Works so well for diaper rashes!</li>
            <li> as advertised.  works great as a barrier cream.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product in the NICU when my son had a horrible raw diaper rash. no other cream or remedy worked, but this stuff cleared it up in a day. Literally. it coats and protects the area. it does kind of ball up into little bits after a while but putting a coating of a&amp;d or petroleum jelly over it helps with that. and besides, you don&#x27;t need to use it for long, so it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> My son was a preemie and his delicate skin was constantly getting severe, bleeding diaper rash. Over a couple months, his doctors tried many different prescription and over the counter items. This was the only thing that allowed his sores to heal. The hospital was back ordered for months, but Amazon saved the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to pick up Vaseline as well. Put a layer of iLEX, then a layer of Vaseline to prevent it from sticking to baby&#x27;s diaper.</li>
            <li> cured diaper rash in a hurry!</li>
            <li> My otherwise healthy one month old son developed a very very severe diaper rash that would not go away.  We tried everything.... Decitin, triple cream, butt paste, no diaper for two hours every other diaper change...... Nothing worked. So we took him to the pediatrician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pediatrician prescribed bactroban.  When that didn&#x27;t work, she prescribed an anti yeast medicine.  This also didn&#x27;t work.  Since the rash was still not improving at all, I took my one month old to the pediatric dermatologist. He prescribed a steroid cream.  This one actually made the rash much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I stumbled upon a comment in an online forum recommending ilex for this severe type of diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately purchased it on amazon. Once applied, the rash looked 50% better within 24 hours.  It&#x27;s now been almost 48 hrs and the rash is BARELY noticeable.  I wish I found this product sooner.  My son seems happier and I am extremely relieved to finally see improvement after weeks of stress trying to treat this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much ilex!!!!  I will tell everyone I know with kids about this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this multiple times for my sons&#x27; severe diaper rash. When he has any teething activity, he gets really bad diaper rash and all the pediatrician&#x27;s office ever told us to do was to use antibiotic ointment and petroleum jelly. That did just so much but he always screamed and cried in pain during diaper changing and bath time. It was awful. One of my husbands&#x27; colleagues suggested this product and while I, at first, didn&#x27;t like using it as it seemed to be awful to remove, I read more up on it online and realized that you not only have to layer a THICK layer of petroleum jelly on top of it but you also have to leave whatever sticks to the wounds on them - it allows the wounds to be &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; from the activities occurring in the diaper. If a messy diaper necessitates the removal of the parts that stick, a warm wet washcloth does the job. This stuff really works to help his bottom heal and minimizes his pain. For that alone I&#x27;ll be stocking this paste in the house and highly recommend.</li>
