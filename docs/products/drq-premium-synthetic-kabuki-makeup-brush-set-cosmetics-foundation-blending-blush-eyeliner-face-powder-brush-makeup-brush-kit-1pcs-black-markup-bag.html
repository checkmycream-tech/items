            <li>All four brushes do come in handy</li>
            <li>Their not going to be the absolute best quality.</li>
            <li>Brushes are nice but a lot of hairs fall out at the beginning</li>
            <li>I am a face and body artist, and these work nicely.</li>
            <li>Also, it would be nice if each brush was labeled or some guide came with it.</li>
            <li>I own the Sigma F80 brush that everyone talks about</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i would deft say these brushes are also beginner FRIENDLY&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>i deft recommend these brushes...</li>
            <li>All and all, these are nice for the price</li>
            <li>They did smell kind of like paint when I took them out but washed them</li>
            <li>I paid under 10$ dollars for brushes that are honestly comparable in quality to M.A.C. products.</li>
            <li>They have held up nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>i ordered this brushes i thought this are durable and nice</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of cautious about buying these brushes because of the reviews that it got.</li>
            <li>and they do result in a really nice even foundation finish.</li>
            <li>but I liked them.</li>
            <li>Kind of a bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There  really nice brushes for the price</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve remained just as nice as the day they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a set of four because if you have slacked on cleaning, you&#x27;ll always have one you could use.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes for the price</li>
            <li>High quality, perfect condition.</li>
            <li>, i honestly want to order more just cause of how much i love them!</li>

            <li>Love them, work great and the price is cheap</li>
            <li>These had a STRONG paint thinner type scent but a good washing and the smell went away.  </li>
            <li>The brushes have a very strong plastic chemical scent.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and the price even more!</li>
            <li>but they are actually pretty good quality!</li>
            <li>Great value for the price super soft and works great!</li>
            <li>luck ladies and happy holidays.seller seems stellar!</li>

            <li>Love these brushes they are so soft and help make my makeup look flawless.</li>
            <li>bristles were great quality, however the brush handle broke on 3 of the brushes within the first day.</li>
            <li>They held up great after their first cleaning.</li>
            <li>If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li>These certainly aren&#x27;t as nice as my Sigma&#x27;s, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be - I also wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be as nice as they were!</li>
            <li>but they work just fine !</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made already falling apart .</li>
            <li>I took a chance with these because i saw a youtube video saying you can get quality makeup brushes for very cheap online, so i gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I honestly considered throwing them away, but I washed them a and have then a try they were pretty good to use after leaves face even and no streaks</li>
            <li>Invest your money and something that you feel is right and worth your money as well as your WAIT!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good value and the seller seems stellar!</li>

            <li>They are full sized brushes..</li>
            <li>These brushes are good with cream products because of the dense short cut bristles.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase for the price</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase</li>
            <li>I have also have the Real Techniques brushes, which I love.</li>

            <li>I got my brushes today, super soft🙈😍</li>
            <li>I could try them out quickly.</li>
            <li>These brushes were as close to the quality of high end brushes, I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re actually better than those high end ones.</li>
            <li>Im sure this set would cost over 100 dollars for high end brands and these work just as well</li>
            <li>Love them so soft !!</li>
            <li>I just barely got my brushes in the mail and ooooh damn these brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order the sigma flat top kabuki brush, because I would like one in my collection and sigma has a better quality guarantee.</li>
            <li>I love to use the flat top or the rounded one to apply foundation with</li>
            <li>I mostly use the flat top and the concealer one</li>

            <li>Great product and the seller shipped faster then expected!!</li>
            <li>Amazing quality for the price -- these are just as amazing as any other brushes I&#x27;ve used, like real techniques or mac.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no scent, definetly my new favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>I love my new brushes .</li>
            <li>Love them!The bristles are soft and full, makes foundation and blush application process a breeze</li>
            <li>&amp; there still as good as when they first arrived, no shedding which is a big plus for the price!</li>
            <li>These are very soft set of brushes, I love the feel of it on my face.</li>
            <li>Love my brushes they have very soft bristles ,they came before the time said .well</li>
            <li>Have not been able to use them yet, they are very soft though.</li>
            <li>and they are absolutely a dupe to them!!</li>
            <li>These are super soft and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with them.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty good purchase at right price.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s zero bristles that fall out on my face, the brushes have held their shapes, they clean easily, they buff on foundation so easily, and they&#x27;ve lasted me several months.</li>
            <li>Application was a little streaky and theyre not that great for contouring.</li>
            <li>u get what u pay for after a month of use the brushes feel apart out of the four i only still have one brush left .... that one brush is very good though since it has not falling apart</li>
            <li>For easy application, you really have to go with something at least as good as this set!</li>
            <li>They are more firm than soft, so great for blending powder foundations.</li>
            <li>This brush set is an amazing option for someone just starting out withe cosmetics, someone who doesn&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money in tools, etc.</li>
            <li>Thought it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>They are worth it.</li>
            <li>The actual brush head is really soft and looks like it&#x27;s great quality</li>
            <li>They are a bit on the soft side, but as I am mostly using them for stenciling it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait</li>
            <li>I have yet to use them but for the price these are defiantly worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice but overall.</li>
            <li>but it was definitely worth it</li>
            <li>i feel they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>It takes forever to arrive but its well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>so well it almost gives me a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY</li>
            <li>I so love the soft brushes...arrived in Honolulu just in time for the cousins departure for Manila Philippines.</li>
            <li>worth what i paid .Love them .</li>
            <li>They take about 6 weeks to arrive from China, but are worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes so soft</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for short fiber as shown in picture because I was looking for a kabuki kind of brush</li>
            <li>I want to love these brushes because they are soft, sturdy, dense, and affordable.</li>
            <li>Love my makeup brushes, better quality than I expected. ...</li>
            <li>I love the brushes they are so sturdy and soft</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Love these they are so soft..</li>
            <li>So worth it .</li>
            <li>For the price, these brushes are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The only good thing was the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>My money worth spending.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really soft I love them.</li>

            <li>Love them anf a great price, hairs do not come loose like other cheap ones.</li>
            <li>i thought these brushes would be a lil bit bigger, but overall good product for the price!</li>
            <li>I thought it came pretty quick because it says that it&#x27;s going to come around Oct 21 or something.</li>
            <li>When I received it there was a strong chemical smell, but with a quick wash of cetaphil and water fixed that.</li>
            <li>super soft brushes!!!!</li>
            <li>I really recommend buying these brushes, they are so worth the money!</li>
            <li>The handles fell right off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pissed off right now.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t glued on right</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 sets and both came with the right brushes and all 4 were in each package.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a use for them right now..., maybe to baste a turkey or something....</li>
            <li>One of them wasn&#x27;t even cut right.</li>
            <li>So I received these right in time</li>
            <li>I was unsure about these brushes do to the low price, but was very pleasantly surprised by the amazing quality!</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with them is that they have a really strong odor that isn&#x27;t very pleasing, but if you wash them it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the flat top brush which is super soft and dense and apply the foundation beautifuly .</li>
            <li>They blend my foundation really well, and they were worth the money spent on them, they are such great quality!</li>
            <li>Came with a bit of smell but after a quick wash with makeup remover and pure soap, it came right out.</li>
            <li>brushes are super soft and at first smell like paint, but the smell quickly goes away!</li>
            <li>The shipping was pretty lengthy but is worth the wait</li>
            <li>But a little on the back of my hand and then dabbed the brush in and it came out flawless on my skin.</li>
            <li>My only qualm is with the flat top brush aka the one I was most excited for.</li>
            <li>they look rich and high quality.</li>
            <li>lol my bad) sooo good for foundation and powder</li>
            <li>Quality of brushes are great especially considering the low cost.</li>
            <li>If washed &amp; cared for properly, these brushes will last a great while.</li>
            <li>and they work pretty good for their price, but for contouring and blush and highlighting, these brushes are not worth the money.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft yet strong.</li>
            <li>Its okay for the price after washing cleaning them for a few times the brush top hair came apart.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll give an update after I wash them, so for now the reason I gave 4 ☆ is because 1 was loose but other than that they&#x27;re great brushes!</li>
            <li>I ordered them using prime so shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>like these very much and bought to have on hand as a back-up.</li>
            <li>Liked the quality of the brush itself, but the handles broke off of every single on I used in the first week.</li>
            <li>I use the flat stipple brush for my BareMinerals bare skin foundation and it works amazingly!</li>
            <li>Was really skeptical at first because of the reviews I had seen, but it ended up being really good, got them within 12 days, and they seem like really good quality, and incredibly soft, can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li>would definitely buy them again :)</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend these brushes :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expected such good quality in these cheap brushes</li>
            <li>Ready to use !</li>
            <li>exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
            <li>I only just received them but at first inspection, they seem to be of astonishing quality.</li>
            <li>I had to open each separately wrapped brush and let them air out for 8 days before I felt ok using them on my face with makeup.</li>
            <li>I took away one star because the hairs weren&#x27;t exactly as I thought they were some fell out</li>
            <li>I love these and use them daily in my make up routine.</li>
            <li>I have sigma brushes that are the sane as some of the brushes in the picture I decided to order them because when I first saw them they were 15.00 dollars</li>
            <li>I love the angle on the one that did stay together, but overall I would probably purchase a better quality next time.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I better get what I paid for (2 sets with each one having 4 brushes) or my money back!</li>
            <li>So overall, yes I am impress and I love them.</li>
            <li>the Brushes canes exactly 19 days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li>considering how much they cost!</li>
            <li>If you like smaller brushes, I bet you&#x27;ll love these.</li>
            <li>So soft and cheap</li>
            <li>I will buy more Bis brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>It did take a while to come it, but when they did, they were exactly as picture.</li>
            <li>They defiantly compare to higher brand makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like my brushes!</li>
            <li>First of all I got five brushes instead of four in my set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them consistently for about two weeks now</li>
            <li>LOVE these brushes especially for the price !</li>
            <li>And they came in fast, three days after I ordered them!</li>
            <li>I first got these brushes, it seemed that they were indented alot while shipping...</li>
            <li>but I can fix it with some hot glue for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li>I had been planning on getting the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush, but I figure I might as well get 4 brushes for the price of one!</li>
            <li>I love these big brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different brushes!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>O would make sure to wash them well before using and wash regularly.  </li>
            <li>After first wash the head was comming off the rod,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now and they are still in good shape after a few washes.</li>
            <li>These are super high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>They are pretty stiff, good for contouring, setting makeup, and maybe blush.</li>
            <li>Nice thick brushes and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft!!!!</li>
            <li>It has a very sturdy but smooth build and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>Love love love these brushes!!!.my only complaint</li>
            <li>Very good quality the only problem was that when I got it the glue got to hot and they broke in half, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li>They Arrived Early, I&#x27;m So Excited To Use Them 😀</li>
            <li>the flat one is the one i used most of the time in applying my liquid foubdation.</li>
            <li>I love the flat one for foundation, it buffs out liquid and cremes</li>
            <li>They are super soft and work on many different types of products!!!</li>
            <li>I showed my girlfriend who pays $40-$80 PER BRUSH was kicking herself when she saw how good quality you can get for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>I definitely did not expect that these brushes would be such good quality.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I was looking for and for the price of one name brand brush, I got four high quality brushes!</li>
            <li>Took a long time but got them after a month, first set like this , really like them:)</li>
            <li>The bristles come off so much on the flat top .</li>
            <li>&amp; it didn&#x27;t take long to receive them &amp; the price is fabulous!</li>
            <li>It shipped pretty fast and no hair have been falling out.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive eyes as far as allergies go, but this kind of concerns me because it seems like a completely synthetic fiber (as these are described to be) should not give me an allergic reaction like that.</li>
            <li>They LOOK nice but not worth enduring the smell.</li>
            <li>the texture of the brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li>These are some seriously high quality brushes that would have cost much, much more if bought in a store locally.  </li>
            <li>THEY ARE LARGER THAN PICTURED,THEY ARE FULL SIZE!</li>
            <li>Not a single bristle has dropped out and it feels smooth on the face.</li>
            <li>Super soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the handle fell off one of the brushes but that&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li>Super soft and don&#x27;t shed, even after washing.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty cheap when it comes to replacing brushes, but these definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li>I like that they&#x27;re a bit thicker and shorter than your usual makeup brushes, they seem to fit in my (fairly large) hands better.</li>
            <li>I super glued them back on and they are working pretty well now!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sooo great for the price seriously love them especially the flat brush and round pointed one (for the name</li>
            <li>These work very well and are super soft.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, full size, do not shed and incredibly soft - much softer than elf studio brushes for anyone who wants a comparison.</li>
            <li>but they were gold with black and they where the best I taught this were going to be the same but just different color.</li>
            <li>the had a light odor most likely to protect the bristles of the brushes i washed and let air dry</li>
            <li>I use the angled brush for highlighting with highlighting powder, the flat for concealer which is all I use, I&#x27;m sure you could use it for foundation too, the flat top I am going to try to use it for stippling with my concealer, and round top</li>
            <li>The one star is for the quality which was pretty decent-</li>
            <li>The shipping was crazy fast considering it was shipped from overseas and they came perfectly intact!</li>
            <li>I use the dense round brush for foundation and it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li>They seem to be very well made</li>
            <li>I got them fast</li>
            <li>They were def better than expected ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dense, and that is why a lot of make up will stick to the bristle.</li>
            <li>I was really impress with the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>Blending makeup will be much easier.</li>
            <li>The brushes work very well for the price</li>
            <li>This set was only $7.79 + free shipping</li>
            <li>I really like that they give you a variety.</li>
            <li>i love these brushes, not much fall out</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much when I ordered this set</li>
            <li>These brushes came in much sooner than the anticipated date, plus I got 5 instead of 4.</li>
            <li>i HIGHLY recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re ready for use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using these brushes daily.</li>
            <li>omg i just got them today and there better than what i expected</li>
            <li>very not put together well....</li>
            <li>I bought these for my mother, since she travels and needed some smaller brushes to fit in her travel case.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>There is no inscription on the handles and the fibers are much shorter than they appear in the photo.</li>
            <li>And cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I got an extra for free and now I have brushes for every use.</li>
            <li>highly recommend buying them because for the price they are at, theyre a steal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really satisfy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The seller is the sweetest and answered my questions very swiftly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I would have paid 5 times as much for a set like this (and I have, but never again).</li>
            <li>I really like these but one of the brushes split in two at the ferrule and handle.</li>
            <li>Better then I expected.</li>
            <li>and they work really well.</li>
            <li>and they work just as well as my high end brushes!</li>
            <li>They are not put together very well.</li>
            <li>Applies makeup up well, and is gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>They break really fast</li>
            <li>and I really like the way my foundation looks.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very flimsy and streaky when using liquid products.</li>
            <li>My makeup applies evenly and they are easy enough brushes to clean regularly.</li>
            <li>at least I have 3/4 good brushes.</li>
            <li>After over month from ordering these brushes they finally came in the mail today and besides waiting so long for them I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a great substitute for sigma brushes, it is soo thick and really soft , also the hair dont fall when cleaning it , and all over</li>
            <li>They are a good quality for their price and were larger than I expected.</li>
            <li>it is waste of money if you buy this kind of cosmetics brushes.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these brushes fantastic quality use them everyday so soft.</li>
            <li>Thick hair and a good size handle to them.</li>
            <li>They are thick and good quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>do wish that the flat top was a little more dense</li>
            <li>I have Mac, Morphe, Sigma, Real Techniques, and all other brushes inbetween and besides the NO Name on them you would not be able to tell they werent name brand.</li>
            <li>I were thinking of getting the Sigma set for $80 but wasn&#x27;t sure how I would actually like using them in my daily routine (option being beaty sponge etc.)I decided to look for an inexpensive substitute to try first</li>
            <li>But other than that I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>When i got these brushes i was so excited but the second time i used the all the handles came off.</li>
            <li>I did try to clean with a brush spray but it left an oily residue...</li>
            <li>They are sleek and professional  and are high quality in construction looking and the bristles are super soft !</li>
            <li>I bought these because I really needed new brushes fast.</li>
            <li>Wow so much better than expected and quite large.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and will not irritate your face (unless you have super sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>They are very soft and thick which allow perfect blending of foundation and other makeup products.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ridiculous , they work just as good as high end brushes</li>
            <li>When I first tried these for my foundation, I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>I enjoy putting my makeup on with it especially the flat top brush that gives a air brushed effect----</li>
            <li>The brushes are nnice and soft, but the handles fell apart in the first.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m giving them four stars because the brush itself is so soft and it puts on makeup very well!</li>
            <li>They are so soft and hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li>They blend ANYTHING down to that airbrush finish, I love &#x27;em!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the pack of 4 in black, and the matte black is beautiful.</li>
            <li>but i think they need better glue because after a week the black wood part detached from the silver part.</li>
            <li>I use my set mainly for highlighting and contouring.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone especially if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money :)</li>
            <li>The brushes were decent for the money.</li>
            <li>I have just not had one of the brushes break, but I will be super gluing it back together!</li>
            <li>I use a lot of Bobbi Brown brushes and my absolute FAVORITE foundation brush is from Kevyn Aucoin (read: not cheap).</li>
            <li>Came fast, 4 brushes are very soft and provide even application.</li>
            <li>I bought these as I needed to update my very old brushes!</li>
            <li>Was very surprised!</li>
            <li>BRUSHES, VERY SOFT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even washed these already and they have held up very well bouncing back right after.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t bet the price, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for all kinds of foundations</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly upset about the shipping.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>They look and feel high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>.. use these every day and would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of high end cosmetics (and brushes).</li>
            <li>Extremely high quality, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>flat brush is definitely my favorite for overall blending.</li>
            <li>I just received the brushes about  2 weeks early!!</li>
            <li>After opening the package, I was hit by a very strong paint like odor, but after letting them air out for a few hours, the smell completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>Also they were sturdy in my hand be a use I rubbed kind of hard to see how the would stand up to friction.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you dont want to drop the extra $ on the Sigma brushes that you give these a try, they&#x27;re definitely worth it</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast and the brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re EXTREMELY soft yet also very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Not to much shedding which surprised me</li>
            <li>but these are better than I expected thick and no shedding :)</li>
            <li>When washed on occasion some bristles will fall out, although this is relatively normal.</li>
            <li>Cool brushes and unexpensive, the pile mixed natural and synthetic.</li>
            <li>and the round top applies my liquid foundation</li>
            <li>very soft comparable to my high end make up brushes.</li>
            <li>brushes are super soft like velvet and my make up goes on like it does with an airbrush, simply</li>
            <li>they are super soft and you get an extra tapered brush.</li>
            <li>I only give it 2 stars because they are super soft.</li>
            <li>After  checking them, instantly there was shedding and the handle fell right off of one which was a bummer...</li>
            <li>They are high quality professional synthetic kabuki foundation brushes TRULY!</li>
            <li>Also i was hoping the small round top brush was more dense</li>
            <li>handles are a smooth black velvety finish and makes a deep satisfactory clonking noise when clamoring together, not hollow or cheap sounding</li>
            <li>/&gt;( i live in ny &amp; they came from china )</li>
            <li>I live in Canada, shipping took about 1 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I just had to wash them like you always do when you get new brushes.</li>
            <li>but i always wash new makeup brushes anyways.</li>
            <li>I received my brushes about 2 weeks ago &amp; upon inspection they are very soft &amp; densely packed full of bristles &amp; no fallout, but 1 of them was loose</li>
            <li>For the price these are amazing brushes, seriously.</li>
            <li>the only problem is that the move where the shinny part meets the black part, but you can push the brush back in but its a pain still works good for the price and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very densely packed and soft with almost no fall out so far.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and glide across the skin.</li>
            <li>I like a very natural look</li>
            <li>NO shedding and very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft on the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very very surprised @</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft to the touch and</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and dense how they should be.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>Just got my brushes very early.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have HIGH expectations for this set but based on the positive reviews and low cost</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>So soft and no fall out!</li>
            <li>I decided to buy them and when they arrived I touch them to feel how soft they were and to tell you the truth they are softer then sigma brush!</li>
            <li>They are SO soft!</li>
            <li>They are small, well-made and with lovely, dense bristles.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>Like, a million baby bunnies soft!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed at all and they are really soft!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft too!</li>
            <li>The brushes are big by any measure and exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li>2 of the brushes were exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I am probably going to buy the eyeshadow brushes now to complete my set!</li>
            <li>I received my brushes a day early!  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>They are a pain to clean vs other brands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I am extremely dissatisfied with these brushes, I am positive that they are not the brushes in the photo, the hair was mostly in the bag instead of the brush and the ferrels are sharp and lose.</li>
            <li>I had been wanting to buy Sigma brushes for so long but never did because I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend that much money on brushes.</li>
            <li>When I received the package, I really only wanted the flat bristle brush and was excited to get the package.</li>
            <li>Very soft, and so far durable.</li>
            <li>They did have a little smell to them when opening, but after washing them it was fine.</li>
            <li>These brushes feel great, but because they&#x27;re smaller than I anticipated, I&#x27;m a little let down.</li>
            <li>I Dropped two a few times and they were fine.</li>
            <li>These were not what I was expecting they are hard and takes most the makeup off</li>
            <li>Super soft, work extremely well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford very expensive brush sets right now, so for the price these are exceptional.</li>
            <li>Your getting professional grade brushes for only a couple dollars, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Clearly it did not work well.</li>
            <li>The shipping clearly stated(To me anyway), that I was going to receive it within 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li>The pros clearly out weigh the cons.</li>
            <li>I just received these brushes and they are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>These far surpassed any expectations I had for these &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li>Too soft to pick up makeup and forget applying it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised, soft,  </li>
            <li>These brushes are extremely soft, but they are so so dense.</li>
            <li>1 or 2 strands did stray from one brush but you really can&#x27;t give a big complain about that.</li>
            <li>Reviews had said they never received them etc, but the brushes were soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>The only thing was the pointy brush has a pinkish tint on thetop but doesnt really bother me since it does its job.</li>
            <li>Received early and no problems.</li>
            <li>It help up very well through two or three washes and now it&#x27;s entirely coming apart.</li>
            <li>The brushes are extremely soft and durable.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just surprised by how flimsy the handle was.</li>
            <li>and my clients are not prone to allergic reactions because this is a synthetic brush and ultra soft .</li>
            <li>The brushes feel really soft and do their jobs well.</li>
            <li>So far its been a month</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and I have already washed them</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with shedding.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well these brushes work</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>So surprised for the price.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it a star was for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I would totally reccomened these for starters for extras or even for those that just like to buy but buy haha like me.</li>
            <li>Soft bristle though.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li>The bristles are dualfiber, and they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li>Feel like such high quality!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft.</li>

            <li>the brushes feel soft and will work.</li>
            <li>These brushes have really surprised me.</li>
            <li>The dome brush wasn&#x27;t as soft as the others but still did what it needed to</li>
            <li>And they are really soft.</li>
            <li>They complete the job for contouring, applying foundation, powder, blush, etc.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li>very dissappointed in my second purchase</li>
            <li>Soft brushes.</li>
            <li>So soft and work well</li>
            <li>But so far I like the product</li>
            <li>I have been a professional MUA for over 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>Soft and well made.</li>
            <li>The brush is really soft and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face.</li>
            <li>You know the old saying &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Sending it back, smell really funky (like paint or gasoline)</li>
            <li>the brushes I recieved were soft, tho not dense at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes had a strange glue-like smell to them at first, but you should have no problems</li>
            <li>Brushes never came in , do not waste your time ordering them</li>
            <li>They came in about 4 days after I ordered, no smell, incredibly soft...</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li>Really soft.</li>
            <li>Yes I know that&#x27;s a pretty long time, but I decided to buy them anyway.</li>
            <li>These are dense yet beyond soft.</li>
            <li>They remain as soft as the day they arrive.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than even Real Techniques (and similar to the Expert Face Brush,</li>
            <li>Cheaper than even Real Techniques (and similar to the Expert Face Brush, imo)!</li>
            <li>So far, I cannot say that I have noticed any shedding.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised of the quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soooo soft and when u use for foundation they do not cake up at all</li>
            <li>The brushes evenly distribute make up and they are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are a good length, not travel or weird sized</li>
            <li>.. Works just as good as expensive brushes but shed when washing them.</li>
            <li>They are just as good as my expensive brushes</li>
            <li>These are just as good as expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>They do smell a little bit which I expected, but I washed them first, like I do all of my brushes and they&#x27;re just fine.  </li>
            <li>They apply the same, blend the same, clean the same...</li>
            <li>I use the flat top and the round one for buffing in my foundation</li>
            <li>But material wise it&#x27;s built very poorly.</li>
            <li>I had reviewed these on youtube and one of the review said that the handles would be loose nothing a bit of hot glue gun wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The metal part on one of the brushes was already loose before the first use.</li>
            <li>They gave me two of the same brushes, however, they offered me a new brush without returns!</li>
            <li>I have also washed these several times and they still look brand new!</li>
            <li>Decent brushes that have multiple uses.</li>
            <li>verg skeptical at buying them first but LOVE them</li>
            <li>My least favorite one has to be the flat top simply because it&#x27;s a little too flimsy.</li>
            <li>The  are not as full brisel as I thought and they shad a little.</li>
            <li>The only things that didnt make me give 5 stars is, the brushes were not as dense as I would of liked them to be, The handle on the angled brush was delivered loose and eventually fell off while washing and Amazon gave a delivery date that was not accurate</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate to buy again, and i recommend them to everyone looking for high quality at a low price!</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that the round brush doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job of applying foundation.</li>
            <li>the price is unbelievable cheap.  </li>
            <li>I wish they could&#x27;ve been a little more denser, but I am not going to complain one single bit, because like I said, my checking account barely noticed that I paid for these.</li>
            <li>It comes with a flat top, angled, pointed and a regular round tip.</li>
            <li>It seems too short so when applying powder foundation, it feels stiff even though the quality of the bristle-hair seems fine.</li>
            <li>It makes the brushes seem way more expensive than they really are.</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft and apply well but was hoping a couple of them would have a bigger brush head.</li>
            <li>This is not exactly what I expected at this price as I purchased two of Ailunce Very Useful Professional Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki Brush Single Cosmetic Makeup Brush Black</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing major</li>
            <li>I know some people have complained about the smell right out of the plastic, but it really wasn&#x27;t too bothersome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend these to anyone wanting high quality brushes @ an extremely affordable price!</li>
            <li>Overall, I do like the brushes because of the soft bristles and they arrived on time.</li>
            <li>They barely shed at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a second set for my professional kit.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was fast compared to when i expected them since shipping from over seas.</li>
            <li>The are professional quality with regular sized handles...not travel sized!  </li>
            <li>Bought a couple months ago, washed twice with baby shampoo and bare minerals brush shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using liquid/mousse formulas, but I&#x27;ve only been using them for a week so far.</li>
            <li>They are big and the brush is soft.</li>
            <li>Feels soft, but based on how it looks, they&#x27;ll probably fall apart within the first few washed.</li>
            <li>Took a little long for them to come, definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Some other reviewers found that they had an very objectionable odor.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much ordering this brush set due to the lower price tag.</li>
            <li>but they feel as soft and blend as well as more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li>(I get a new set every 3 months or so because I get lazy with cleaning them and just get new ones because c&#x27;mob their so inexpensive!) and have yet to get a set that have broken or been in any way non satisfying.</li>
            <li>These are must haves if your not ready to buy high end brushes.</li>
            <li>There is no need to spend the hefty price on the designer brand when these are the exact same brushes for less.</li>
            <li>Bristle feels soft as other reviewers said and no single one has fallen so far after a month.</li>
            <li>Not really worth the money even though they&#x27;re not that much money.</li>
            <li>At 1st touch surprisingly soft and bristles look sturdy did pull off when I tried to pull a couple of lil long bristles</li>
            <li>second pair i just recieved in the mail are the complete opposite, they are not sturdy, i took them out of the protective slips they were in and brushed it on my hands and</li>
            <li>The brushes were get full and thick.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that I wish they were just a little more soft bristled.</li>
            <li>Only - if you are extremely used to your high end brushes.</li>
            <li>Amazing brushes super soft but the smell is horrible and the shipping takes forever</li>
            <li>THE BRUSHES, the are a chestnut dark brown color, looking at them from the side you see they are synthetic on the high shine of the lower bristles.</li>

            <li> They did smell kind of like paint when I took them out but washed them</li>
            <li> I paid under 10$ dollars for brushes that are honestly comparable in quality to M.A.C. products.</li>
            <li> They have held up nicely.</li>

            <li> i ordered this brushes i thought this are durable and nice</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I was kind of cautious about buying these brushes because of the reviews that it got.</li>

            <li> but I liked them.</li>
            <li> Kind of a bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> bristles were great quality, however the brush handle broke on 3 of the brushes within the first day.</li>
            <li> They held up great after their first cleaning.</li>
            <li> If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li> These certainly aren&#x27;t as nice as my Sigma&#x27;s, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be - I also wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be as nice as they were!</li>
            <li> but they work just fine !</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made already falling apart .</li>
            <li> I took a chance with these because i saw a youtube video saying you can get quality makeup brushes for very cheap online, so i gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I honestly considered throwing them away, but I washed them a and have then a try they were pretty good to use after leaves face even and no streaks</li>
            <li> Invest your money and something that you feel is right and worth your money as well as your WAIT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good value and the seller seems stellar!</li>

            <li> and I definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a good set of face brushes!!</li>
            <li> Also, the tapered brush is definitely for use with liquid or cream foundations as the bristles of the brush itself are very \\&quot;silky.\\&quot; All in all, great product!</li>

            <li> I LOVE these brushes, I have a full Sigma Kit and these look and feel exactly like they do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to clean them often to get rid of it</li>

            <li> They are full sized brushes..</li>
            <li> These brushes are good with cream products because of the dense short cut bristles.</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase for the price</li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase</li>
            <li> I have also have the Real Techniques brushes, which I love.</li>
            <li> They arrived early and the packaging was nice and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handles on the brush keep breaking, which really disappoints me because I thought they would be better quality than that.</li>

            <li> but overall good for price.</li>
            <li> I like a full coverage look from my foundation.</li>
            <li> Just give them a good wash prior to using, because they do have a plastic/chemically smell.</li>
            <li> Not bad for starters ..</li>
            <li> the quality is not bad neither.</li>

            <li> delivery wasnt quick but it wasnt forever mayb 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I got my brushes today, super soft🙈😍</li>
            <li> I could try them out quickly.</li>
            <li> These brushes were as close to the quality of high end brushes, I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually better than those high end ones.</li>
            <li> Im sure this set would cost over 100 dollars for high end brands and these work just as well</li>
            <li> Love them so soft !!</li>
            <li> I just barely got my brushes in the mail and ooooh damn these brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order the sigma flat top kabuki brush, because I would like one in my collection and sigma has a better quality guarantee.</li>
            <li> I love to use the flat top or the rounded one to apply foundation with</li>
            <li> I mostly use the flat top and the concealer one</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding or tearing down</li>
            <li> Great product and the seller shipped faster then expected!!</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price -- these are just as amazing as any other brushes I&#x27;ve used, like real techniques or mac.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no scent, definetly my new favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes .</li>
            <li> Love them!The bristles are soft and full, makes foundation and blush application process a breeze</li>
            <li> &amp; there still as good as when they first arrived, no shedding which is a big plus for the price!</li>
            <li> These are very soft set of brushes, I love the feel of it on my face.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes they have very soft bristles ,they came before the time said .well</li>
            <li> Have not been able to use them yet, they are very soft though.</li>
            <li> and they are absolutely a dupe to them!!</li>
            <li> These are super soft and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with them.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good purchase at right price.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s zero bristles that fall out on my face, the brushes have held their shapes, they clean easily, they buff on foundation so easily, and they&#x27;ve lasted me several months.</li>
            <li> Application was a little streaky and theyre not that great for contouring.</li>
            <li> u get what u pay for after a month of use the brushes feel apart out of the four i only still have one brush left .... that one brush is very good though since it has not falling apart</li>
            <li> For easy application, you really have to go with something at least as good as this set!</li>
            <li> They are more firm than soft, so great for blending powder foundations.</li>
            <li> This brush set is an amazing option for someone just starting out withe cosmetics, someone who doesn&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money in tools, etc.</li>
            <li> Thought it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> They are worth it.</li>
            <li> The actual brush head is really soft and looks like it&#x27;s great quality</li>
            <li> They are a bit on the soft side, but as I am mostly using them for stenciling it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait</li>
            <li> I have yet to use them but for the price these are defiantly worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice but overall.</li>
            <li> but it was definitely worth it</li>
            <li> i feel they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to arrive but its well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> so well it almost gives me a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY</li>
            <li> I so love the soft brushes...arrived in Honolulu just in time for the cousins departure for Manila Philippines.</li>
            <li> worth what i paid .Love them .</li>
            <li> They take about 6 weeks to arrive from China, but are worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes so soft</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for short fiber as shown in picture because I was looking for a kabuki kind of brush</li>
            <li> I want to love these brushes because they are soft, sturdy, dense, and affordable.</li>
            <li> Love my makeup brushes, better quality than I expected. ...</li>
            <li> I love the brushes they are so sturdy and soft</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Love these they are so soft..</li>
            <li> So worth it .</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The only good thing was the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> My money worth spending.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really soft I love them.</li>
            <li> Overall it works and you get 4 of them which is nice if you lose one or forget to wash one.</li>
            <li> Love them anf a great price, hairs do not come loose like other cheap ones.</li>
            <li> i thought these brushes would be a lil bit bigger, but overall good product for the price!</li>
            <li> I thought it came pretty quick because it says that it&#x27;s going to come around Oct 21 or something.</li>
            <li> When I received it there was a strong chemical smell, but with a quick wash of cetaphil and water fixed that.</li>
            <li> super soft brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> I really recommend buying these brushes, they are so worth the money!</li>
            <li> The handles fell right off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pissed off right now.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t glued on right</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets and both came with the right brushes and all 4 were in each package.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a use for them right now..., maybe to baste a turkey or something....</li>
            <li> One of them wasn&#x27;t even cut right.</li>
            <li> So I received these right in time</li>
            <li> I was unsure about these brushes do to the low price, but was very pleasantly surprised by the amazing quality!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with them is that they have a really strong odor that isn&#x27;t very pleasing, but if you wash them it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the flat top brush which is super soft and dense and apply the foundation beautifuly .</li>
            <li> They blend my foundation really well, and they were worth the money spent on them, they are such great quality!</li>
            <li> Came with a bit of smell but after a quick wash with makeup remover and pure soap, it came right out.</li>
            <li> brushes are super soft and at first smell like paint, but the smell quickly goes away!</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty lengthy but is worth the wait</li>
            <li> But a little on the back of my hand and then dabbed the brush in and it came out flawless on my skin.</li>
            <li> My only qualm is with the flat top brush aka the one I was most excited for.</li>
            <li> they look rich and high quality.</li>
            <li> lol my bad) sooo good for foundation and powder</li>
            <li> Quality of brushes are great especially considering the low cost.</li>
            <li> If washed &amp; cared for properly, these brushes will last a great while.</li>
            <li> and they work pretty good for their price, but for contouring and blush and highlighting, these brushes are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft yet strong.</li>
            <li> Its okay for the price after washing cleaning them for a few times the brush top hair came apart.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll give an update after I wash them, so for now the reason I gave 4 ☆ is because 1 was loose but other than that they&#x27;re great brushes!</li>
            <li> I ordered them using prime so shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> like these very much and bought to have on hand as a back-up.</li>
            <li> Liked the quality of the brush itself, but the handles broke off of every single on I used in the first week.</li>
            <li> I use the flat stipple brush for my BareMinerals bare skin foundation and it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> Was really skeptical at first because of the reviews I had seen, but it ended up being really good, got them within 12 days, and they seem like really good quality, and incredibly soft, can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> would definitely buy them again :)</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend these brushes :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expected such good quality in these cheap brushes</li>
            <li> Ready to use !</li>
            <li> exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
            <li> I only just received them but at first inspection, they seem to be of astonishing quality.</li>
            <li> I had to open each separately wrapped brush and let them air out for 8 days before I felt ok using them on my face with makeup.</li>
            <li> I took away one star because the hairs weren&#x27;t exactly as I thought they were some fell out</li>
            <li> I love these and use them daily in my make up routine.</li>
            <li> I have sigma brushes that are the sane as some of the brushes in the picture I decided to order them because when I first saw them they were 15.00 dollars</li>
            <li> I love the angle on the one that did stay together, but overall I would probably purchase a better quality next time.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I better get what I paid for (2 sets with each one having 4 brushes) or my money back!</li>
            <li> So overall, yes I am impress and I love them.</li>
            <li> the Brushes canes exactly 19 days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> considering how much they cost!</li>
            <li> If you like smaller brushes, I bet you&#x27;ll love these.</li>
            <li> So soft and cheap</li>
            <li> I will buy more Bis brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> It did take a while to come it, but when they did, they were exactly as picture.</li>
            <li> They defiantly compare to higher brand makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like my brushes!</li>
            <li> First of all I got five brushes instead of four in my set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them consistently for about two weeks now</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes especially for the price !</li>
            <li> And they came in fast, three days after I ordered them!</li>
            <li> I first got these brushes, it seemed that they were indented alot while shipping...</li>
            <li> but I can fix it with some hot glue for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> I had been planning on getting the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush, but I figure I might as well get 4 brushes for the price of one!</li>
            <li> I love these big brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different brushes!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> O would make sure to wash them well before using and wash regularly.  </li>
            <li> After first wash the head was comming off the rod,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now and they are still in good shape after a few washes.</li>
            <li> These are super high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> They are pretty stiff, good for contouring, setting makeup, and maybe blush.</li>
            <li> Nice thick brushes and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft!!!!</li>
            <li> It has a very sturdy but smooth build and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes!!!.my only complaint</li>
            <li> Very good quality the only problem was that when I got it the glue got to hot and they broke in half, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> They Arrived Early, I&#x27;m So Excited To Use Them 😀</li>
            <li> the flat one is the one i used most of the time in applying my liquid foubdation.</li>
            <li> I love the flat one for foundation, it buffs out liquid and cremes</li>
            <li> They are super soft and work on many different types of products!!!</li>
            <li> I showed my girlfriend who pays $40-$80 PER BRUSH was kicking herself when she saw how good quality you can get for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> I definitely did not expect that these brushes would be such good quality.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I was looking for and for the price of one name brand brush, I got four high quality brushes!</li>
            <li> Took a long time but got them after a month, first set like this , really like them:)</li>
            <li> The bristles come off so much on the flat top .</li>
            <li> &amp; it didn&#x27;t take long to receive them &amp; the price is fabulous!</li>
            <li> It shipped pretty fast and no hair have been falling out.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive eyes as far as allergies go, but this kind of concerns me because it seems like a completely synthetic fiber (as these are described to be) should not give me an allergic reaction like that.</li>
            <li> They LOOK nice but not worth enduring the smell.</li>
            <li> the texture of the brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li> These are some seriously high quality brushes that would have cost much, much more if bought in a store locally.  </li>
            <li> THEY ARE LARGER THAN PICTURED,THEY ARE FULL SIZE!</li>
            <li> Not a single bristle has dropped out and it feels smooth on the face.</li>
            <li> Super soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the handle fell off one of the brushes but that&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li> Super soft and don&#x27;t shed, even after washing.</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty cheap when it comes to replacing brushes, but these definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li> I like that they&#x27;re a bit thicker and shorter than your usual makeup brushes, they seem to fit in my (fairly large) hands better.</li>
            <li> I super glued them back on and they are working pretty well now!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sooo great for the price seriously love them especially the flat brush and round pointed one (for the name</li>
            <li> These work very well and are super soft.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, full size, do not shed and incredibly soft - much softer than elf studio brushes for anyone who wants a comparison.</li>
            <li> but they were gold with black and they where the best I taught this were going to be the same but just different color.</li>
            <li> the had a light odor most likely to protect the bristles of the brushes i washed and let air dry</li>
            <li> I use the angled brush for highlighting with highlighting powder, the flat for concealer which is all I use, I&#x27;m sure you could use it for foundation too, the flat top I am going to try to use it for stippling with my concealer, and round top</li>
            <li> The one star is for the quality which was pretty decent-</li>
            <li> The shipping was crazy fast considering it was shipped from overseas and they came perfectly intact!</li>
            <li> I use the dense round brush for foundation and it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li> They seem to be very well made</li>
            <li> I got them fast</li>
            <li> They were def better than expected ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense, and that is why a lot of make up will stick to the bristle.</li>
            <li> I was really impress with the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Blending makeup will be much easier.</li>
            <li> The brushes work very well for the price</li>
            <li> This set was only $7.79 + free shipping</li>
            <li> I really like that they give you a variety.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes, not much fall out</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much when I ordered this set</li>
            <li> These brushes came in much sooner than the anticipated date, plus I got 5 instead of 4.</li>
            <li> i HIGHLY recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re ready for use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these brushes daily.</li>
            <li> omg i just got them today and there better than what i expected</li>
            <li> very not put together well....</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mother, since she travels and needed some smaller brushes to fit in her travel case.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> There is no inscription on the handles and the fibers are much shorter than they appear in the photo.</li>
            <li> And cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I got an extra for free and now I have brushes for every use.</li>
            <li> highly recommend buying them because for the price they are at, theyre a steal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really satisfy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The seller is the sweetest and answered my questions very swiftly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would have paid 5 times as much for a set like this (and I have, but never again).</li>
            <li> I really like these but one of the brushes split in two at the ferrule and handle.</li>
            <li> Better then I expected.</li>
            <li> and they work really well.</li>
            <li> and they work just as well as my high end brushes!</li>
            <li> They are not put together very well.</li>
            <li> Applies makeup up well, and is gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> They break really fast</li>
            <li> and I really like the way my foundation looks.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very flimsy and streaky when using liquid products.</li>
            <li> My makeup applies evenly and they are easy enough brushes to clean regularly.</li>
            <li> at least I have 3/4 good brushes.</li>
            <li> After over month from ordering these brushes they finally came in the mail today and besides waiting so long for them I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great substitute for sigma brushes, it is soo thick and really soft , also the hair dont fall when cleaning it , and all over</li>
            <li> They are a good quality for their price and were larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> it is waste of money if you buy this kind of cosmetics brushes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes fantastic quality use them everyday so soft.</li>
            <li> Thick hair and a good size handle to them.</li>
            <li> They are thick and good quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> do wish that the flat top was a little more dense</li>
            <li> I have Mac, Morphe, Sigma, Real Techniques, and all other brushes inbetween and besides the NO Name on them you would not be able to tell they werent name brand.</li>
            <li> I were thinking of getting the Sigma set for $80 but wasn&#x27;t sure how I would actually like using them in my daily routine (option being beaty sponge etc.)I decided to look for an inexpensive substitute to try first</li>
            <li> But other than that I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> When i got these brushes i was so excited but the second time i used the all the handles came off.</li>
            <li> I did try to clean with a brush spray but it left an oily residue...</li>
            <li> They are sleek and professional  and are high quality in construction looking and the bristles are super soft !</li>
            <li> I bought these because I really needed new brushes fast.</li>
            <li> Wow so much better than expected and quite large.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and will not irritate your face (unless you have super sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> They are very soft and thick which allow perfect blending of foundation and other makeup products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous , they work just as good as high end brushes</li>
            <li> When I first tried these for my foundation, I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> I enjoy putting my makeup on with it especially the flat top brush that gives a air brushed effect----</li>
            <li> The brushes are nnice and soft, but the handles fell apart in the first.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m giving them four stars because the brush itself is so soft and it puts on makeup very well!</li>
            <li> They are so soft and hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li> They blend ANYTHING down to that airbrush finish, I love &#x27;em!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the pack of 4 in black, and the matte black is beautiful.</li>
            <li> but i think they need better glue because after a week the black wood part detached from the silver part.</li>
            <li> I use my set mainly for highlighting and contouring.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone especially if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money :)</li>
            <li> The brushes were decent for the money.</li>
            <li> I have just not had one of the brushes break, but I will be super gluing it back together!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Bobbi Brown brushes and my absolute FAVORITE foundation brush is from Kevyn Aucoin (read: not cheap).</li>
            <li> Came fast, 4 brushes are very soft and provide even application.</li>
            <li> I bought these as I needed to update my very old brushes!</li>
            <li> Was very surprised!</li>
            <li> BRUSHES, VERY SOFT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even washed these already and they have held up very well bouncing back right after.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t bet the price, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for all kinds of foundations</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly upset about the shipping.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> They look and feel high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> .. use these every day and would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of high end cosmetics (and brushes).</li>
            <li> Extremely high quality, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> flat brush is definitely my favorite for overall blending.</li>
            <li> I just received the brushes about  2 weeks early!!</li>
            <li> After opening the package, I was hit by a very strong paint like odor, but after letting them air out for a few hours, the smell completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Also they were sturdy in my hand be a use I rubbed kind of hard to see how the would stand up to friction.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you dont want to drop the extra $ on the Sigma brushes that you give these a try, they&#x27;re definitely worth it</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast and the brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re EXTREMELY soft yet also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Not to much shedding which surprised me</li>
            <li> but these are better than I expected thick and no shedding :)</li>
            <li> When washed on occasion some bristles will fall out, although this is relatively normal.</li>
            <li> Cool brushes and unexpensive, the pile mixed natural and synthetic.</li>
            <li> and the round top applies my liquid foundation</li>
            <li> very soft comparable to my high end make up brushes.</li>
            <li> brushes are super soft like velvet and my make up goes on like it does with an airbrush, simply</li>
            <li> they are super soft and you get an extra tapered brush.</li>
            <li> I only give it 2 stars because they are super soft.</li>
            <li> After  checking them, instantly there was shedding and the handle fell right off of one which was a bummer...</li>
            <li> They are high quality professional synthetic kabuki foundation brushes TRULY!</li>
            <li> Also i was hoping the small round top brush was more dense</li>
            <li> handles are a smooth black velvety finish and makes a deep satisfactory clonking noise when clamoring together, not hollow or cheap sounding</li>
            <li> /&gt;( i live in ny &amp; they came from china )</li>
            <li> I live in Canada, shipping took about 1 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I just had to wash them like you always do when you get new brushes.</li>
            <li> but i always wash new makeup brushes anyways.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes about 2 weeks ago &amp; upon inspection they are very soft &amp; densely packed full of bristles &amp; no fallout, but 1 of them was loose</li>
            <li> For the price these are amazing brushes, seriously.</li>
            <li> the only problem is that the move where the shinny part meets the black part, but you can push the brush back in but its a pain still works good for the price and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very densely packed and soft with almost no fall out so far.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and glide across the skin.</li>
            <li> I like a very natural look</li>
            <li> NO shedding and very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft on the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very very surprised @</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft to the touch and</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and dense how they should be.</li>
            <li> Very soft</li>
            <li> Just got my brushes very early.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have HIGH expectations for this set but based on the positive reviews and low cost</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> So soft and no fall out!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy them and when they arrived I touch them to feel how soft they were and to tell you the truth they are softer then sigma brush!</li>
            <li> They are SO soft!</li>
            <li> They are small, well-made and with lovely, dense bristles.</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> Like, a million baby bunnies soft!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed at all and they are really soft!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft too!</li>
            <li> The brushes are big by any measure and exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li> 2 of the brushes were exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I am probably going to buy the eyeshadow brushes now to complete my set!</li>
            <li> I received my brushes a day early!  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> They are a pain to clean vs other brands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissatisfied with these brushes, I am positive that they are not the brushes in the photo, the hair was mostly in the bag instead of the brush and the ferrels are sharp and lose.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to buy Sigma brushes for so long but never did because I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend that much money on brushes.</li>
            <li> When I received the package, I really only wanted the flat bristle brush and was excited to get the package.</li>
            <li> Very soft, and so far durable.</li>
            <li> They did have a little smell to them when opening, but after washing them it was fine.</li>
            <li> These brushes feel great, but because they&#x27;re smaller than I anticipated, I&#x27;m a little let down.</li>
            <li> I Dropped two a few times and they were fine.</li>
            <li> These were not what I was expecting they are hard and takes most the makeup off</li>
            <li> Super soft, work extremely well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford very expensive brush sets right now, so for the price these are exceptional.</li>
            <li> Your getting professional grade brushes for only a couple dollars, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Clearly it did not work well.</li>
            <li> The shipping clearly stated(To me anyway), that I was going to receive it within 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> The pros clearly out weigh the cons.</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes and they are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> These far surpassed any expectations I had for these &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> Too soft to pick up makeup and forget applying it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, soft,  </li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely soft, but they are so so dense.</li>
            <li> 1 or 2 strands did stray from one brush but you really can&#x27;t give a big complain about that.</li>
            <li> Reviews had said they never received them etc, but the brushes were soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> The only thing was the pointy brush has a pinkish tint on thetop but doesnt really bother me since it does its job.</li>
            <li> Received early and no problems.</li>
            <li> It help up very well through two or three washes and now it&#x27;s entirely coming apart.</li>
            <li> The brushes are extremely soft and durable.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just surprised by how flimsy the handle was.</li>
            <li> and my clients are not prone to allergic reactions because this is a synthetic brush and ultra soft .</li>
            <li> The brushes feel really soft and do their jobs well.</li>
            <li> So far its been a month</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and I have already washed them</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with shedding.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well these brushes work</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> So surprised for the price.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a star was for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I would totally reccomened these for starters for extras or even for those that just like to buy but buy haha like me.</li>
            <li> Soft bristle though.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li> The bristles are dualfiber, and they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li> Feel like such high quality!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how soft they are</li>
            <li> The brushes are sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> the brushes feel soft and will work.</li>
            <li> These brushes have really surprised me.</li>
            <li> The dome brush wasn&#x27;t as soft as the others but still did what it needed to</li>
            <li> And they are really soft.</li>
            <li> They complete the job for contouring, applying foundation, powder, blush, etc.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li> very dissappointed in my second purchase</li>
            <li> Soft brushes.</li>
            <li> So soft and work well</li>
            <li> But so far I like the product</li>
            <li> I have been a professional MUA for over 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> Soft and well made.</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face.</li>
            <li> You know the old saying &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Sending it back, smell really funky (like paint or gasoline)</li>
            <li> the brushes I recieved were soft, tho not dense at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes had a strange glue-like smell to them at first, but you should have no problems</li>
            <li> Brushes never came in , do not waste your time ordering them</li>
            <li> They came in about 4 days after I ordered, no smell, incredibly soft...</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> Really soft.</li>
            <li> Yes I know that&#x27;s a pretty long time, but I decided to buy them anyway.</li>
            <li> These are dense yet beyond soft.</li>
            <li> They remain as soft as the day they arrive.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than even Real Techniques (and similar to the Expert Face Brush,</li>
            <li> Cheaper than even Real Techniques (and similar to the Expert Face Brush, imo)!</li>
            <li> So far, I cannot say that I have noticed any shedding.</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised of the quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft and when u use for foundation they do not cake up at all</li>
            <li> The brushes evenly distribute make up and they are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are a good length, not travel or weird sized</li>
            <li> .. Works just as good as expensive brushes but shed when washing them.</li>
            <li> They are just as good as my expensive brushes</li>
            <li> These are just as good as expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> They do smell a little bit which I expected, but I washed them first, like I do all of my brushes and they&#x27;re just fine.  </li>
            <li> They apply the same, blend the same, clean the same...</li>
            <li> I use the flat top and the round one for buffing in my foundation</li>
            <li> But material wise it&#x27;s built very poorly.</li>
            <li> I had reviewed these on youtube and one of the review said that the handles would be loose nothing a bit of hot glue gun wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The metal part on one of the brushes was already loose before the first use.</li>
            <li> They gave me two of the same brushes, however, they offered me a new brush without returns!</li>
            <li> I have also washed these several times and they still look brand new!</li>
            <li> Decent brushes that have multiple uses.</li>
            <li> verg skeptical at buying them first but LOVE them</li>
            <li> My least favorite one has to be the flat top simply because it&#x27;s a little too flimsy.</li>
            <li> The  are not as full brisel as I thought and they shad a little.</li>
            <li> The only things that didnt make me give 5 stars is, the brushes were not as dense as I would of liked them to be, The handle on the angled brush was delivered loose and eventually fell off while washing and Amazon gave a delivery date that was not accurate</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to buy again, and i recommend them to everyone looking for high quality at a low price!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the round brush doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job of applying foundation.</li>
            <li> the price is unbelievable cheap.  </li>
            <li> I wish they could&#x27;ve been a little more denser, but I am not going to complain one single bit, because like I said, my checking account barely noticed that I paid for these.</li>
            <li> It comes with a flat top, angled, pointed and a regular round tip.</li>
            <li> It seems too short so when applying powder foundation, it feels stiff even though the quality of the bristle-hair seems fine.</li>
            <li> It makes the brushes seem way more expensive than they really are.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and apply well but was hoping a couple of them would have a bigger brush head.</li>
            <li> This is not exactly what I expected at this price as I purchased two of Ailunce Very Useful Professional Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki Brush Single Cosmetic Makeup Brush Black</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing major</li>
            <li> I know some people have complained about the smell right out of the plastic, but it really wasn&#x27;t too bothersome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend these to anyone wanting high quality brushes @ an extremely affordable price!</li>
            <li> Overall, I do like the brushes because of the soft bristles and they arrived on time.</li>
            <li> They barely shed at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a second set for my professional kit.</li>
            <li> And the shipping was fast compared to when i expected them since shipping from over seas.</li>
            <li> The are professional quality with regular sized handles...not travel sized!  </li>
            <li> Bought a couple months ago, washed twice with baby shampoo and bare minerals brush shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using liquid/mousse formulas, but I&#x27;ve only been using them for a week so far.</li>
            <li> They are big and the brush is soft.</li>
            <li> Feels soft, but based on how it looks, they&#x27;ll probably fall apart within the first few washed.</li>
            <li> Took a little long for them to come, definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers found that they had an very objectionable odor.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much ordering this brush set due to the lower price tag.</li>
            <li> but they feel as soft and blend as well as more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> (I get a new set every 3 months or so because I get lazy with cleaning them and just get new ones because c&#x27;mob their so inexpensive!) and have yet to get a set that have broken or been in any way non satisfying.</li>
            <li> These are must haves if your not ready to buy high end brushes.</li>
            <li> There is no need to spend the hefty price on the designer brand when these are the exact same brushes for less.</li>
            <li> Bristle feels soft as other reviewers said and no single one has fallen so far after a month.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money even though they&#x27;re not that much money.</li>
            <li> At 1st touch surprisingly soft and bristles look sturdy did pull off when I tried to pull a couple of lil long bristles</li>
            <li> second pair i just recieved in the mail are the complete opposite, they are not sturdy, i took them out of the protective slips they were in and brushed it on my hands and</li>
            <li> The brushes were get full and thick.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I wish they were just a little more soft bristled.</li>
            <li> Only - if you are extremely used to your high end brushes.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes super soft but the smell is horrible and the shipping takes forever</li>
            <li> THE BRUSHES, the are a chestnut dark brown color, looking at them from the side you see they are synthetic on the high shine of the lower bristles.</li>
            <li> This is the price of HALF of one high end brush.</li>
            <li> They still have a mild scent to them but not anywhere near as bad as when I first received them.</li>
            <li> and the angles can be used for the same thing and blush/bronzer, the tapered for anything under the eye, and flat for foundation as well.</li>
            <li> these are cheap enough to just buy new ones when they get too dirty.</li>
            <li> I loved the old product, but the new product is awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the will hold up, but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Like I said, they kind of feel weird now and actually have a slight odor to them now, as well.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very soft BUT..When I was overlooking the quality and durability (slightly tugging on bristles) on ONE of the brushes the bristles came out in chunks.</li>
            <li> These brushes came to the rescue when I had very little very soft not rough.</li>
            <li> they are very soft and firm at the same time</li>
            <li> Ugh I was really looking forward to them too :/  </li>
            <li> well at all I was disappointed for such pretty and cheap brushes</li>
            <li> Used the flat for a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I use the flat brush to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> But one thing is that they don&#x27;t stay on to the wooden stick for too long</li>
            <li> (The flat-top one for general foundation application stippling and buffing the first round, the pointy-ish one for hard to reach places like the ridges on the sides of my nose, and the general eye area, the slanted ones I use for blush and bronzer.</li>
            <li> However, I used them a few times, and then cleaned the brushes and they are brand new.</li>
            <li> This was unfortunate but easy to fix (just a bit of glue).</li>
            <li> These brushes in the pictures look more like buffing, sense foundation brushes which I EXPECTED unfortunately</li>
            <li> They are heavy and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, yet firm .</li>
            <li> Soft bristles packed together tightly.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give five stars was because after washing them the first time mine had a little shedding,  very little</li>
            <li> Honestly, for $6 I can&#x27;t even think of anything bad to say about the brushes.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Soft yet firm.</li>
            <li> the UK, China, Japan, Australia and it never took so long to receive anything.</li>
            <li> They came way earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> There was a paint like smell to the brushes but as long as you wash them before use, it goes away and is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take long to get them either.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t like how long it took</li>
            <li> but these are too long.</li>
            <li> If it wouldn&#x27;t have taken so long to receive it</li>
            <li> My handles are too long</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time.</li>
            <li> Obviously, they arent quite as hig quality as the Sigma brushes, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> #34;They took too long to ship to me.&amp;#34;????</li>
            <li> I spent just under $7.00U.S. for something I would&#x27;ve payed triple for each individual brush retail.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so disappointed about the flat top brush!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so thick and work very well</li>
            <li> They are a bit stiff and not as soft, but they still manage to get the work done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad i spent so little on them because what I recieved was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> ferrule seems pretty standard, heavy quality but not specially nicely finished.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think they work just as well as every other one of my MAC and Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use those until I fix them, and the other two seem like they are holding on in the same spot for dear life.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to spend $$$ on other similar brushes.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship but softest brushes ever!</li>
            <li> When I finally recieved my brushes nothing was protecting them and every single one is misshapen due to the way it was shipped.</li>
            <li> then DIOR and BBrown brushes as they do not brake, loose hair, or get too soft or too harsh, this is my second time buying these brushes and they never let me down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause an allergy, perfectly dry, carry out the function for all 100%, aren&#x27;t showered, I recommend</li>
            <li> cause I only got two different angles from all 4 brushes (two angled and two round).</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than I expected and three of them are dented on the silver part and it affects the actual shape of the brush.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that they broke in 2 because the glue was not strong enough.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft, but they aren&#x27;t too fluffy like other brushes.</li>
            <li> My next stop for brushes will be Morphe brushes, the price here was not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> but i was disappointed with this kind of cosmetics brushes.</li>
            <li> The silver part on one of the brushes was loose.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the smell of them but other than that i like them!</li>
            <li> the highlighting brush) had different coloration on the tip than the other 3 brushes and did not come in a plastic sleeve like the other 3 brushes.</li>
            <li> This is the only problem ive had, when I use them on my undereye or eyelid, I have a slight allergy to them.</li>
            <li> Only \\&quot;downside\\&quot; to this set would be that the contour (or angled) brush in this set is very fluffy and a bit too dense to form a proper contour line on the cheekbones.</li>
            <li> they are so soft.. and the small hairs do not fall off like other brushes or leave them on you</li>
            <li> The only problem i have with them is that there is a scent on the brushes and they had little shedding, but after i washed them it wasn&#x27;t a problem anymore.</li>
            <li> Ones suppose to be rounded and the other one slanted but they are seriously both so jagged, two stars might be to high.</li>
            <li> They do shed , but not as bad as most brushes.</li>
            <li> Even my most expensive Mac brushes shed and it sucks.</li>
            <li> They ended up coming in before the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> Delivery date could of been a bit faster but did arrive on expected delivery dates.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected (2 days).</li>
            <li> I see a few reviews that had the same problem, hopefully I revieve them.</li>
            <li> as we&#x27;ll it only took round 2 1/2 weeks to get here</li>
            <li> 3 of the brushes was broken the tips came off while I was testing them and me giving 1star is being very generous.</li>
            <li> then I expected (:</li>
            <li> i wash my brushes correctly so the Farrell dnt get wet</li>
            <li> The handles are solid and hefty, without being too heavy or awkward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are somewhat rough too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no particular smell like I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once I gave them away, I realized some of them are just a little different from each other.</li>
            <li> This is certainly not the case with these brushes.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected due to distance and customs.</li>
            <li> Minimal shed, very thick, very soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased other makeup brushes from sephora thinking</li>
            <li> No funny chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m retiring all my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I have used them daily for the past 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am assuming it&#x27;s because if the plastic they were shipped in, but other than that</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews...</li>
            <li> I will totally repurchase after (hopefully) a few years use!</li>
            <li> Leaves your pores MINIMAL!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding and there was no odor other than the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> I have experience with other cheaper brush sets shedding...</li>
            <li> They do have a weird smell at first, but I just washed them and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too big nor small for my face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very minimal.  </li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t started to shed and the dark coloured part of the brush doesn&#x27;t leave any stain when I squeeze the excess water with a white towel (which is usually the case with cheaper brushes).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get the black part of the handles wet.</li>
            <li> The other two round ones I use for loose powder and blush.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve since washed the brushes in an effort to keep my face clean and the hair on the brushes now feels very weird.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re hard to glue back on.</li>
            <li> DONT be a victim!!!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that they smell pretty bad and</li>
            <li> (at least 12 days to short of when they were delivered).</li>
            <li> is not  worth it</li>
            <li> The brushes had a pretty weird smell but after washing them a few times it went away.</li>
            <li> Came on time, look and feel like good brushes...but haven&#x27;t used them yet because they smell so horrible</li>
            <li> I was half expecting those terrible, cheap brushes that come around during the holiday season, or worse, that come free with a product you buy.</li>
            <li> list the price kept going down unroll I saw it was 6.00 dollars</li>
            <li> I mean only 7.00 for four brushes.  </li>
            <li> Unlike a few other reviewers, I did not get any chemical or paint smell from mine.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4 piece black synthetic set</li>
            <li> Two of them were seperated where the silver and black part meet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 and a half months</li>
            <li> These fell apart in less then a week that I got them.</li>
            <li> I purchased the ones with the black handles (set of 4).</li>
            <li> They also arrived in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Brushes broke off the handle after 3rd use, no good</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was a little scared</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to come in, but.</li>
            <li> I jus got them, gabe em a little wash &amp; they work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a week now, I got my brushes a little over 2weeks after I placed the order.</li>
            <li> The hairs do fall out a little bit at the beginning, but I haven&#x27;t had any of late.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I was a little nervous that they would never come in after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> bought them a little over a month ago and have washed them twice already.</li>
            <li> It had a little scent</li>
            <li> The brush itself is kinda small compared to other ones.</li>
            <li> The handle is plain black with no logo or writing on them...</li>
            <li> The brush handle on one brush came loose, but we fixed it by applying some crazy glue (we have three girls in our house-</li>
            <li> Shedding was a big concern of mine especially buying a brush in store that was $15 &amp; shed like crazy....</li>
            <li> I was just getting into makeup and these where my everyday brushes.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time with this</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars in because one of brushes arrived broken.</li>
            <li> The round brush for blush and bronzer.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t buy this don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Not at all fluffy.</li>
            <li> and after a few washes started to fall apart....</li>
            <li> but it feels really soft, but it has like a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked them in dawn and vinegar for a few hours, and the smell did not dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had them for a few weeks</li>
            <li> handle fell off after a few months on all of them, but the brush part is usable</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> no shedding for me and the smell everyone complains about goes away after 15 minutes or less for me!</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews about people not receiving there brushes I was extremely worried.</li>
            <li> Handles didn&#x27;t have no brand name on them they look like no name plain brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so stiff and sense that all they do is rub off the foundation while trying to put blush on.</li>
            <li> Not being dramatic, they made the entire amazon order smell even though they were in plastic casing.</li>
            <li> The handles are thick, and the average length of a foundation brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> were very tight and compact, and it works well with foundation blending and blush.</li>
            <li> Alright, they smell a little like paint before you wash them (wash your brushes people!)</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint, it would be the bristles are too tight.</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to tell by the pictures.</li>
            <li> but nevertheless I did!&lt;br /&gt;It was a little hard to track my package</li>
            <li> They feel very expensive and high quality.</li>
            <li> but I washed them immediately a small they do t smell.</li>
            <li> wrote this review at first glance to help out others like me who&#x27;s unsure and searching, because I do NOT think that anyone could be disappointed with this purchase or feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> and I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s that about.  </li>
            <li> They dont have a harsh or wonky smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Con: they took almost a month to arrive, they smelled weird, and 2 of the five brushes broke instantly.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually go for these type of brushes and im a fan of bestope but they didnt have any.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes everyday!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an issue with excessive shedding.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for... :/</li>
            <li> Also, it is extremely difficult to glue them back on becuase of the glue they used (a ton) inside the handle.</li>
            <li> Broke after first use :(</li>
            <li> if not better... will recommend to everyone..</li>
            <li> I would give 5 star rating but it took so dang long to get to me (over a month) which is weird because I&#x27;ve ordered things from all over,</li>
            <li> For the price so far not so bad.</li>
            <li> (photo)**The bottom brush loses it&#x27;s bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t irritate your skin and they feel like silk as you brush it against your delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> But the contour brush sucks because the hairs fall out like nothing .</li>
            <li> Was slow getting here</li>
            <li> Shipping was kinda slow</li>
            <li> Poor quality, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> soft but seriously cut so badly</li>
            <li> but seriously they blew me away.</li>
            <li> they get serious use).</li>
            <li> Im very into makeup, and these brushes aint bad at all!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on these brushes and was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I think part of the problem when looking at low-cost cosmetic brushes we all worry they&#x27;ll be scratchy and hard, or they&#x27;ll shed terribly...or just be really, really poor applicators of makeup.</li>
            <li> Finally got my brushes after emails and bad review.</li>
            <li> The glue used for them is not good at all.</li>
            <li> Not good for a translucent powder or something you want to just dust on.</li>
            <li> Not a good quality.  </li>
            <li> but these brushes are not good.</li>
            <li> me, they are just back up brushes for when my expensive ones are dirty.</li>
            <li> The brushes when you first receive then have a horrible smell to do them</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because of the price...and after reading some of the negative reviews that kinda hindered me from buying it sooner.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid about the quality because of the price</li>
            <li> Sorry for my bad english</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reviews on here saying that their poor quality</li>
            <li> and they have not shed, lost shape or broken in any way.</li>
            <li> but they just seemed really poorly made.</li>
            <li> Took a month to arrive and they are so thin they don&#x27;t hold any makeup.  </li>
            <li> They came In the mail already broken...</li>
            <li> For only 6.50, I was expecting crap.</li>
            <li> Not great they come apart</li>
            <li> Thin brushes.</li>
            <li> But the handles are poor made.</li>
            <li> Seriously thinking about ordering another set to have as backups!</li>
            <li> Way to bug for shadow &amp; the quality is definitely not good!</li>
            <li> but now after a few months the heads are coming off of them :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;i absolutely mean that to the upmost fullest !!</li>
            <li> A review I read did say they smelled weird I. Which they do</li>
            <li> quality fail</li>
            <li> I wanted the expensive kabuki set...</li>
            <li> the price.it had a weird smell but gone after washed.</li>
            <li> Of course I was skeptical about these brushes</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!!!!</li>
            <li> They have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Came on time, the quality is mediocre.</li>
            <li> They had a weird odor and still do.</li>
            <li> I did not want a refund as they were not too expensive, but I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the expensive brushes</li>
            <li> They are ALL on par with Urban Decay, Tarts (supposed to end with an &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; but this stupid dictionary won&#x27;t let me add it), as well as Laura Gellar and Smashbox!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one of the brushes is beginning to lose it&#x27;s bristles.  </li>
            <li> They feel expensive.</li>
            <li> Took about a week and a half to get here which wasn&#x27;t bad!</li>
            <li> people comparing these to Sigma are crazy.</li>

            <li> My wife loved the product</li>
            <li> Super awesome brushes and affordable.</li>
            <li> Took forever to come but with the wait. Flawless application and easy to take care of!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!! Planning in ordering soon :)</li>
            <li> Great brushes. They look just like my sigma brushes. So soft! Amazing steal. No shedding at all! So yourself a favor and buy them. Plus I got them in literally one day. Ordered Thursday night got them Saturday morning.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes. Super soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was a little scared but they were saying they never got there brushes but I had already bought them. They ended up coming in before the expected arrival date. I am very happy with these brushes! They apply my foundation perfectly and I don&#x27;t have to use that much product. I definitely would recommend these brushes :)</li>
            <li> I ordered one month ago, still didnt get them...Don&#x27;t bother, they are just going to rob you. I wish I could fly my ass over there and whop some ass.</li>
            <li> Thought it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it but these are better than I expected thick and no shedding :)</li>
            <li> Love these, great quality and they make my makeup go on so smoothly, just like quality brushes from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I not giving it 3 stars cause this is a bad product. I gave it three stars cause I only got two different angles from all 4 brushes (two angled and two round). But the brushes themselves are exquisite. They are very soft and glide across the skin. The powder application is exceptional as well.</li>
            <li> Very soft &amp; a good quality . Airbrush finish &amp; affordable . overall great purchase</li>
            <li> Was slow getting here but they are great and also work great!!!!</li>
            <li> I finally just got these yesterday and packaging was just simple. Bubble wrap and bag. At 1st glance bigger than I thought good grip on handles sturdy. Handles didn&#x27;t have no brand name on them they look like no name plain brushes. At 1st touch surprisingly soft and bristles look sturdy did pull off when I tried to pull a couple of lil long bristles so I hope they will do the trick. For the price so far not so bad. Will come back to add to review once I have tested them out with my makeup. It def did arrive weeks than I anticipated was suppose to expect delivery dec 8th and 20 got it day after Thanksgiving besides they did get shipped from China.</li>
            <li> OMG just got these brushes. They are amaaaaaaaazing. And for the price, you ca t beat it. I did give it a 5 star even though I haven&#x27;t used them yet. A review I read did say they smelled weird I. Which they do but I washed them immediately a small they do t smell. Also they were sturdy in my hand be a use I rubbed kind of hard to see how the would stand up to friction. WINNING! !!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used these yet but they are the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever felt. I like that they&#x27;re a bit thicker and shorter than your usual makeup brushes, they seem to fit in my (fairly large) hands better.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, really love them, I hope they will stay long since most of them fall apart so soon after you clean them and the hair start to shed so I hope not so far so good very soft and great with my liquid foundation</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! I purchased other makeup brushes from sephora thinking they were pricy but worth it, well I have to say that, I used these ones every day now for 8 months and they are as good as the Sephora.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! what you expect a foundation brush to be... it IS!</li>
            <li> Good quality, but smelled funky on arrival. The brushes came in a timely manner. Happy about my overal purchase!</li>
            <li> These brushes are not quite as good as my sigma brushes but they do the trick and for the price they are worth every penny!</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for the price. I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks without any issue.</li>
            <li> Not the worst but not the greatest brushes. people comparing these to Sigma are crazy. Application was a little streaky and theyre not that great for contouring. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Itbarrived on time and its wonderful for the price</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes. I ordered them using prime so shipping was very fast. The rounded brush is my favorite. I use it to apply liquid foundation. They seem to be very well made and I&#x27;ve had no shedding. You can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes and they are extremely soft. Amazing quality. You definitely won&#x27;t regret buying them.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. Delivery date could of been a bit faster but did arrive on expected delivery dates.</li>
            <li> When I first tried these for my foundation, I was really surprised. The brushes are so soft, but they aren&#x27;t too fluffy like other brushes. I really love these!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price. Takes a little time to come in, but. worth it.</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase. I didn&#x27;t expected such good quality in these cheap brushes but i really enjoy them. TThey&#x27;re beautyfull, good quality, exellent brushes! Sorry for my bad english</li>
            <li> Never got them. Do NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> love these brushes great for foundation and blending.</li>
            <li> Received mine pretty quick ! Ready to use !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for almost a year and they r still in great condition even after cleaning and soking in cleaning stuff</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE BRUSHES !!!!!! I have no I idea how could I do without them</li>
            <li> Came fast, 4 brushes are very soft and provide even application. Love them anf a great price, hairs do not come loose like other cheap ones. Although it did not come with a case like stated.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Would recommend and buy again, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These bushes made all the different in my foundation application! Absolutely love them. At this price, you can&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li> I read all the comments about how good these brushes are, I decided to order them, and I never got them..</li>
            <li> One of the best sets of brushes I&#x27;ve bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> As a professional MUA I LOVED these brushes! Inexpensive &amp; great quality!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes😍😍😍</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made already falling apart . quality fail</li>
            <li> I love these brushes I would so buy these again, they&#x27;re so soft and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Minimal shed, very thick, very soft. These are awesome. You should always wash brushes before use because these smell like alcohol and factory. But the backs of them can even be used on a touch-screen! Ha</li>
            <li> High quality, perfect condition. Works great with a variety of different products.</li>
            <li> i got my brushes n they are awesome ! 😁😍😁</li>
            <li> tips come off easily.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price. They are a bit stiff and not as soft, but they still manage to get the work done.</li>
            <li> Very nice great price thank you</li>
            <li> This was the beat sale price and the best brushes. I was just getting into makeup and these where my everyday brushes. Bever sheded or broke. Had these about a year and again still hanging stong with no problem. I clean them about once a month to not have build up and thats it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4 piece black synthetic set and I absolutely love them. I got them fast (prime member) and tried them as soon as I got them. Used the flat for a liquid foundation. But a little on the back of my hand and then dabbed the brush in and it came out flawless on my skin. I like a very natural look and I didn&#x27;t come out looking like it was caked on. I would recommend especially at this price.</li>
            <li> they are soft and blend foundation very good</li>
            <li> Arrived on time! Two business days. Very pleased with the soft brushes. Quality, no bristles come out when using them.</li>
            <li> Get it they are amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> These are excellent both on their own, but the for the price, phenomenal. They work well, clean up nicely and do a very good job of make up placement without streaking or removing any concealer that&#x27;s already been placed.&lt;br /&gt;I like these very much and bought to have on hand as a back-up.</li>
            <li> ok so I got something similar to these brushes and they are nice and work good the only problem is that the move where the shinny part meets the black part, but you can push the brush back in but its a pain still works good for the price and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! You can use them for blush, powder, and liquid. Came fast and great quality for the price and work great!!</li>
            <li> I love them! They were def better than expected ... i was able to get a great dewy contour out of them.thus far... now i just need the smaller contouring brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I love the brushes, they work great.</li>
            <li> So soft! Love how well they blend! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes at a great price ! This is a must have</li>
            <li> Their nice but started falling apart .</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and apply well but was hoping a couple of them would have a bigger brush head.</li>
            <li> I took a chance with these because i saw a youtube video saying you can get quality makeup brushes for very cheap online, so i gave it a try. I was glad i did! These far surpassed any expectations I had for these &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brushes. I showed my girlfriend who pays $40-$80 PER BRUSH was kicking herself when she saw how good quality you can get for such a low price.  I Totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> good for the price only thing was took forever to ship</li>
            <li> Too soft to pick up makeup and forget applying it. Complete waste of money. BOOOOOOO!</li>
            <li> These are amazing brushes. I wanted the expensive kabuki set...can&#x27;t remember the brand now but decided to give these a try. They are literally the SAME thing without the name brand on them. My makeup looks so much better with these brushes.</li>
            <li> exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
            <li> I only just received them but at first inspection, they seem to be of astonishing quality. I were thinking of getting the Sigma set for $80 but wasn&#x27;t sure how I would actually like using them in my daily routine (option being beaty sponge etc.)I decided to look for an inexpensive substitute to try first and I am so glad I did. I have no actual experience with this type of synthetic brushes but this is my impression of these compared to others I have seen and touched;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are a good length, not travel or weird sized&lt;br /&gt;The handles are a smooth black velvety finish and makes a deep satisfactory clonking noise when clamoring together, not hollow or cheap sounding&lt;br /&gt;The ferrule seems pretty standard, heavy quality but not specially nicely finished. Sturdy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes.. OOOH THE BRUSHES, the are a chestnut dark brown color, looking at them from the side you see they are synthetic on the high shine of the lower bristles. They are incredibly dense and super soft. Playing with them there&#x27;s no shedding nor does it give the impression of future shedding. There were a couple of bristles sticking out, two or three, that I trimmed, but the rest is cut perfectly. The top is super smooth and luxurious to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;There is no particular smell like I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is just nothing to criticize on this purchase! I can&#x27;t imagine that they could be any cheaper considering this fantastic quality. Take the chance sisters! This is the price of HALF of one high end brush. Only - if you are extremely used to your high end brushes. Don&#x27;t buy this and complain. This is for sure an amazing value but if you think you can compare this to a set for a couple hundred dollars you are just being annoying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review at first glance to help out others like me who&#x27;s unsure and searching, because I do NOT think that anyone could be disappointed with this purchase or feel ripped off. This is a good value and the seller seems stellar! (If I encounter any problems with these brushes after cleaning and use I will for sure, update this review.)&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ladies and happy holidays.seller seems stellar! (If I encounter any problems with these brushes after cleaning and use I will for sure, update this review.)&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ladies and happy holidays.</li>
            <li> After buying these, they are the only brushes I use to apply foundation. I love them!</li>
            <li> SO IN LOVE WITH THESE !!!! I had been wanting to buy Sigma brushes for so long but never did because I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend that much money on brushes. So I was browsing the web for concelar palettes and I came across the cheap brushes so I said hey, why not. I recieved them quickly (I have Amazon prime) and I am not disappointed one bit. My least favorite one has to be the flat top simply because it&#x27;s a little too flimsy. But the other 3 are AMAZING !!!! RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE !!</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the bristle were more longer for effective brushing. It seems too short so when applying powder foundation, it feels stiff even though the quality of the bristle-hair seems fine.</li>
            <li> when I took the brushes out of the plastic bagging the wooden handles fell off!!!</li>
            <li> I Love Them ! They Arrived Early, I&#x27;m So Excited To Use Them 😀</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but not that great quality brushes; bristles keep falling out.</li>
            <li> They work really well and feel great! I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now and they are still in good shape after a few washes.</li>
            <li> Great quality of brushes for an affordable price!! love the way it blends.</li>
            <li> These are very soft set of brushes, I love the feel of it on my face. It&#x27;s very dense, and that is why a lot of make up will stick to the bristle. You need to clean it more often.</li>
            <li> in love with these....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to pay a lot for makeup brushes, so these work perfect for me. I bought the same set about 6-months ago, and they were just starting to lose hair. Would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a nice set that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about these brushes do to the low price, but was very pleasantly surprised by the amazing quality! They are exactly what I was looking for and for the price of one name brand brush, I got four high quality brushes! I did not have to settle for just one flat kabuki brush but instead got all the variety I needed for a very good price. The shipping was crazy fast considering it was shipped from overseas and they came perfectly intact! I would not hesitate to buy again, and i recommend them to everyone looking for high quality at a low price!</li>
            <li> Love these. They are really great brushes. All four brushes do come in handy</li>
            <li> I am pleased with these brushes they are good for application and have a soft feel to them. Looking back, i am dissapointed that i paid $6.60 but i do not regret my purchase. They are worth it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes. There are a lot of reviews on here saying that their poor quality but I&#x27;ve ordered about 7 of these now (I get a new set every 3 months or so because I get lazy with cleaning them and just get new ones because c&#x27;mob their so inexpensive!) and have yet to get a set that have broken or been in any way non satisfying. Ive had some wobbly handles but PEOPLE C&#x27;MON they are super cheap!! Their not going to be the absolute best quality. For the price I would recommend to EVERYONE.</li>
            <li> These brushes are of reasonably good quality, but . . . The funk when I opened the package is the reason my rating is so low. I had to open each separately wrapped brush and let them air out for 8 days before I felt ok using them on my face with makeup. I wouldn&#x27;t order them again because of it.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice but a lot of hairs fall out at the beginning but now I use them everyday and clean them without a problem!!!! I love these!!!</li>
            <li> Great just as described! They look and work perfect!</li>
            <li> Quality of brushes are great especially considering the low cost. Just wish they were an American product. Mine came from China.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected (2 days). Great quality.</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are great! Ive been using them daily for the last two-three weeks and they have not shed, lost shape or broken in any way. They are more firm than soft, so great for blending powder foundations. I use my set mainly for highlighting and contouring.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes they work great</li>
            <li> Great synthetic brushes! Personally, I think they work just as well as every other one of my MAC and Sigma brushes. Perfect for my highlighting &amp; contouring routine. If washed &amp; cared for properly, these brushes will last a great while.</li>
            <li> I was really impress with the quality of these brushes. The only downside is the smell of them but other than that i like them!</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are super affordable and have lasted me over a year at this point. They apply makeup well without streaks, and are comparable to Stila brushes at a fraction of the price. When washed on occasion some bristles will fall out, although this is relatively normal.</li>
            <li> After opening the package, I was hit by a very strong paint like odor, but after letting them air out for a few hours, the smell completely disappeared. It may have been the packaging. I&#x27;m not sure. These are super high quality brushes. They apply my foundation flawlessly. My biggest fear with cheaper brushes is shedding during use and while cleaning, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that. These are AMAZING brushes and definitely worth your time!</li>
            <li> Incredible brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Good quality and variety</li>
            <li> This was great buy for me.  I love the quality of the brushes.  I cant wait to use these items.</li>
            <li> I used standard shipping and received the brushes three days later, impressive. The quality of the brushes are great. Thick hair and a good size handle to them. Great product.</li>
            <li> Actually very nice brushes! I was surprised, soft,  zero shedding. Can&#x27;t bet the price, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Slower than most on the shipping....</li>
            <li> bristles were great quality, however the brush handle broke on 3 of the brushes within the first day. it was an easy fix, but showed cheap craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> So beautiful!!! They feel amazing!</li>
            <li> OMG these are great!! i got them for my cousin as a gift and now i am getting one set for me &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> These brushes are extremely soft, but they are so so dense. I use the flat top and the round one for buffing in my foundation and they work pretty good for their price, but for contouring and blush and highlighting, these brushes are not worth the money. At all. They&#x27;re so stiff and sense that all they do is rub off the foundation while trying to put blush on. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase these and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE these brushes. Unlike a few other reviewers, I did not get any chemical or paint smell from mine.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are super soft like velvet and my make up goes on like it does with an airbrush, simply flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a fantastic find at a great, and I mean GREAT price. The one thing to note is that these brushes do NOT&lt;br /&gt;shed. Even my most expensive Mac brushes shed and it sucks. So, if you&#x27;re wondering whether to get these or not,&lt;br /&gt;do yourself a favor and just get them. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Better than MAC&#x27;s. Will definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Great brushes!! Took a long time but got them after a month, first set like this , really like them:)</li>
            <li> Shipping took about 2 1/2 weeks for these brushes. After taking them out of the package, I was highly impressed with the brushes&#x27; quality! It has a very sturdy but smooth build and the bristles are very soft. I applied my foundation with the flat-brush and the application was very easy and effective! 1 or 2 strands did stray from one brush but you really can&#x27;t give a big complain about that. I really recommend buying these brushes, they are so worth the money!</li>
            <li> been using this brush for almost a month now and so far so good. the flat one is the one i used most of the time in applying my liquid foubdation.</li>
            <li> Best, best, best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had! Terrific quality for the price. They feel very expensive and high quality.</li>
            <li> I bought these as I needed to update my very old brushes! They are very soft and easy to use! I plan on buying more from this company.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a friend and they were great.  They didn&#x27;t have a funky smell at all.  NO shedding and very soft. She loves them!</li>
            <li> I just received these today and I only paid $8 for them and they are a great quality. They are heavy and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on these brushes and was a little skeptical. Reviews had said they never received them etc, but the brushes were soft. Once I saw it was sold by Amazon I decided to try them. For 7$ why not?&lt;br /&gt;I received them on time just like they said I would.-Fantastic&lt;br /&gt;When I received them I noticed the smell one of the reviews had mentioned. I washed them and the smell went away.&lt;br /&gt;The Bristles are very soft BUT..When I was overlooking the quality and durability (slightly tugging on bristles) on ONE of the brushes the bristles came out in chunks. (photo)**The bottom brush loses it&#x27;s bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I considered sending them back but figured for $7, at least I have 3/4 good brushes. You get what you pay for. If the rest of them start falling out like that I will be really disappointed in my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft. They are so sturdy and do not shed. Great quality brushes for such a cheap price. I am so happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> super soft brushes!!!! LOVEEEEEE</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes! So soft and no fall out!</li>
            <li> So disappointed I would recommend or buy again I have even use them because I got them as backup brushes and definably no buying again</li>
            <li> I had reviewed these on youtube and one of the review said that the handles would be loose nothing a bit of hot glue gun wouldn&#x27;t fix.well.... I took a chance and I&#x27;ve had them 5 days and I&#x27;m in love with them.the handles were fine.the bristles are very soft.nothing like the elf brushes (wich is what I was using ) and  comparing them to.these are way ,way better specially for the price.it had a weird smell but gone after washed.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. Their very good, i haven&#x27;t notice any shedding. The brushes was delivered early which was awesome. They did have a paint smell but went away when i washed them. The only thing was the pointy brush has a pinkish tint on thetop but doesnt really bother me since it does its job. Also i was hoping the small round top brush was more dense but im working with it. My favorite is the flat top brush which is super soft and dense and apply the foundation beautifuly . Great brushes i would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THESE BRUSHES ! THEY ARE REALLY GREAT ,I OWN  ALOT OF HIGH END BRUSHES AND REALLY CANT TELL THE DIFFERENCE,BESIDES A NAME ON THE HANDLE ! THEY ARE LARGER THAN PICTURED,THEY ARE FULL SIZE! VERY IMPRESSED!</li>
            <li> I took away one star because the hairs weren&#x27;t exactly as I thought they were some fell out but not too many however over all this product is very good I enjoy putting my makeup on with it especially the flat top brush that gives a air brushed effect---- great but especially at this price (:</li>
            <li> These kabuki brushes are more than I bargained for! The material of the bristles is just what I was hoping for. Soft yet firm. Blending makeup will be much easier. Defenitley recomendable!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it blends my foundation exactly the way I want it! Excellent!</li>
            <li> It works well on my face</li>
            <li> These brushes smelled like paint. It was pungent when I opened the bag. Overall, they DO work!</li>
            <li> I love these. They work awesome and are comparable to the Sigma brushes that cost a million and a half dollars.</li>
            <li> I love these and use them daily in my make up routine. My sister loves so I guess I know what I&#x27;m getting her for her birthday !</li>
            <li> The brushes work very well for the price.. Works just as good as expensive brushes but shed when washing them.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they give my foundation a flawless look and they are so soft and perfect. I highly recommend these for all kinds of foundations</li>
            <li> I recieved these brushes after about 3 days of shipping. (Mind you this is during the Holidays)&lt;br /&gt;Well they exceed my expectations by a trillion. They are full sized brushes.. Its a little hard to tell by the pictures. They are of great quality... I have Mac, Morphe, Sigma, Real Techniques, and all other brushes inbetween and besides the NO Name on them you would not be able to tell they werent name brand. They dont smell or shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the flat top was a little more dense but I am super picky! Its nothing that someone else may even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE GREAT BRUSHES!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will update if they do not hold up.</li>
            <li> The items got here a lot sooner than expected which was great but they just seemed really poorly made. Two of them were seperated where the silver and black part meet so I can&#x27;t use those until I fix them, and the other two seem like they are holding on in the same spot for dear life. The actual brush head is really soft and looks like it&#x27;s great quality I just wish everything else matched.</li>
            <li> Great brushes so soft they work amaizing great for applying foundation and make up so forth the money I will be buying again</li>
            <li> Came on time, look and feel like good brushes...but haven&#x27;t used them yet because they smell so horrible so I&#x27;m letting them air out.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes a couple of weeks ago and have been using them almost daily. They are really great at blending and distributing my makeup. I&#x27;ve read reviews about a chemical smell upon opening, but mine didn&#x27;t smell like anything. These clean well and have held their shape nicely. No shedding at all.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and the price even more! I use these to blend out foundation and concealer. These brushes are good with cream products because of the dense short cut bristles. They work okay with powder as well but I think they are meant for creams and liquids to work their best. Easy to clean and good sturdy quality. I have repurchased another set and Im likely to purchase a third if I need to.</li>
            <li> I have sigma brushes that are the sane as some of the brushes in the picture I decided to order them because when I first saw them they were 15.00 dollars I had it in my wish list the price kept going down unroll I saw it was 6.00 dollars I decided to buy them and when they arrived I touch them to feel how soft they were and to tell you the truth they are softer then sigma brush! I love them!</li>
            <li> this set of brushes definitely compare to the sigma kabuki kit that you can buy for 84.00$&lt;br /&gt;I am truly impressed with the quality and softness of these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes. Received early and no problems. Brushes look and feel like crazy expensive ones! Good deal and I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> One of my brushes started to shed a bit, kinda annoying</li>
            <li> These brushes were as close to the quality of high end brushes, I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get them and the quality isn&#x27;t all that great. There&#x27;s glue on the metal part and on the side of the brush itself. I had to remove it. Feels soft, but based on how it looks, they&#x27;ll probably fall apart within the first few washed. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! they do the job well. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, when I saw the typo I was hesitant. If they can&#x27;t catch that detail how good is their product going to be? But they were cheap, and I needed more kabuki brushes. I am a face and body artist, and these work nicely. They are a bit on the soft side, but as I am mostly using them for stenciling it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> The brushes were alright, except 2 out of 4 broke and the bristles kept coming out on my face in my makeup. I love the angle on the one that did stay together, but overall I would probably purchase a better quality next time.</li>
            <li> For the price I am VERY impressed with the quality!  Much better than some expensive brushes I have ought over the years</li>
            <li> Yet again another AMAZING amazon purchase. These brushes are LIIIIIIIIIIIIIFE! This set was only $7.79 + free shipping and I think the price dropped. They are high quality professional synthetic kabuki foundation brushes TRULY! It comes with a flat top, angled, pointed and a regular round tip. The handles are sturdy and smooth. They fit nicely in the hand. They are SO soft! They came individually wrapped in plastic and then sealed all together in plastic. No funny chemical smell. Just amazing quality. I&#x27;m retiring all my other brushes. I&#x27;m buying another set JUST for a back up.</li>
            <li> I really do love two of the brushes: the round top and slanted kabuki are great and don&#x27;t shed at all. Love for liquid or cream foundation. I haven&#x27;t really found a use for the tapered kabuki, but I&#x27;m thinking it would be great for setting the undereye area. My only qualm is with the flat top brush aka the one I was most excited for. It help up very well through two or three washes and now it&#x27;s entirely coming apart. Hairs everywhere if I try to use it for foundation application. I&#x27;m going to order the sigma flat top kabuki brush, because I would like one in my collection and sigma has a better quality guarantee. Overall a good purchase for the price but I&#x27;m so disappointed about the flat top brush!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Very nice for the money.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are amazing brushes! I really like that they give you a variety. In all honestly, I only needed one and so I gave the rest of them to my mom. I thought they were all the same but once I gave them away, I realized some of them are just a little different from each other. Dang it! I guess this just means I might have to buy another set. ;) I use mine to put on foundation. The only complaint I have is that I wish they were just a little more soft bristled. That would make it easier to apply the foundation more evenly!</li>
            <li> These brushes are a good product at the price offered.  Some other reviewers found that they had an very objectionable odor.  This was not a problem with the brushes that I received.  I ordered a second set for my daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 4 weeks and I still haven&#x27;t received anything...</li>
            <li> Great brush good quality!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 sets on these brushes and got 1 set with 5 brushes instead of 4 brushes. What a rip off! I better get what I paid for (2 sets with each one having 4 brushes) or my money back! Pissed</li>
            <li> i love these brushes, not much fall out and they work great!</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes!!!.my only complaint is they took a while to get here</li>
            <li> After over month from ordering these brushes they finally came in the mail today and besides waiting so long for them I&#x27;m very satisfied. They&#x27;re very good quality and they work just like the sigma brushes! I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone especially if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome, they look just like some from BH Cosmetics, I love these a lot!</li>
            <li> Quality was great! I have used them daily for the past 2 weeks. I washed them when I received them. There&#x27;s no scent, definetly my new favorite brushes. There hasn&#x27;t been any shedding either.</li>
            <li> best foundation brushes! excellent quality and an excellent price! If you do not have these brushes, you need to get them!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect because I did get this for only six dollars. But I&#x27;m glad it exceeded my expectations. The brushes came way before  the estimated arrival date which made me really happy. They are so soft and is easy to use. I love to use the flat top or the rounded one to apply foundation with and it gives you a flawless finish! So overall, yes I am impress and I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase! They gave me two of the same brushes, however, they offered me a new brush without returns! (The brush I didn&#x27;t receive) They are extremely friendly and replies quickly. They&#x27;re cheap in price not quality. The brushes are extremely soft and durable. The appearance is sleek and amazing! Will definitely purchase again. I would recommend this to all of my friends and family. I never review but I just had to since the seller&#x27;s extremely nice and the brushes are to die for! If anyone is debating whether to buy these or not, definitely buy them! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do like the brushes because of the soft bristles and they arrived on time. However, on the second time I was using one of the brushes to apply finishing powder, the handle broke off. I haven&#x27;t glued it back on yet but I&#x27;m just surprised by how flimsy the handle was. Also, it would be nice if each brush was labeled or some guide came with it. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend more money than I did but I think there&#x27;s better brushes out there. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using them because I do like how they feel but I doubt I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for pro or personal use. super easy to clean and my clients are not prone to allergic reactions because this is a synthetic brush and ultra soft . perfect for blending and contouring.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 brushes and got 5 so I can&#x27;t really complain. The brushes feel really soft and do their jobs well. Only complaint is that the round brush doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job of applying foundation.</li>
            <li> So far its been a month and I haven&#x27;t gotten anything, its getting annoying. I see a few reviews that had the same problem, hopefully I revieve them. If not, I&#x27;m getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a great price. I love them!!!</li>
            <li> Can someone tell me if i will recoeve these damn brushess pleaase</li>
            <li> Had to come Back a write my feedback.1st the quality of the brushes are AMAZING it leaves your makeup looking flawless and all girls want that.and the shipment was absolutely amazing as we&#x27;ll it only took round 2 1/2 weeks to get here and I it was standard shipment.the price was absolutely wonderful</li>
            <li> the Brushes canes exactly 19 days after I ordered them. they are super soft and you get an extra tapered brush.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these makeup brushes 3 of the brushes was broken the tips came off while I was testing them and me giving 1star is being very generous.</li>
            <li> They arrived a week early and they are awesome so soft and wonderful :)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. If I need more I will definitely order more. They are very soft on the face. They don&#x27;t irritate your skin and they feel like silk as you brush it against your delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I love the quality, price and my foundation looks flawless!! It did take a month for them to come but that&#x27;s to be expected due to distance and customs. Well worth the wait :D.</li>
            <li> Great brushes so far. I would give 5 star rating but it took so dang long to get to me (over a month) which is weird because I&#x27;ve ordered things from all over, the UK, China, Japan, Australia and it never took so long to receive anything. Except this time. But over all they are great brushes. I washed them as soon as I got them. Just because that&#x27;s what everyone should do.</li>
            <li> I just received the brushes about  2 weeks early!! They are extremely soft and I have already washed them an there was no fall out at all. I have yet to use them but for the price these are defiantly worth it.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes for the price. They did have a little smell to them when opening, but after washing them it was fine. Very happy with them. Love the variety of brushes included</li>
            <li> Picks up product well , no shedding , worth well your money though it took a while to arrive !</li>
            <li> Of course I was skeptical about these brushes but seriously they blew me away. They are so soft and great it&#x27;s ridiculous , they work just as good as high end brushes and I only got 2 hairs shed from 1 brush out of all of them. I&#x27;m so happy and they were packaged fantastically .</li>
            <li> i thought these brushes would be a lil bit bigger, but overall good product for the price!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much when I ordered this set but these brushes are amazing! The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the handle fell off one of the brushes but that&#x27;s an easy fix. The brushes are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with shedding. I own the Sigma F80 brush that everyone talks about but I love the rounded brush in this set more than my Sigma. It just blends everything in so effortlessly. Would definitely recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 and a half months and I still have not got them...</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I feel like I do have to cake makeup on them to work well but they are a value for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes came in much sooner than the anticipated date, plus I got 5 instead of 4. (An extra tapered brush) They look and feel high quality so that it good. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is b/c they aren&#x27;t as dense as I was expecting. Also, it has a strong chemical scent. Not sure what&#x27;s that about.  I&#x27;m not sure how long the will hold up, but for the price you really can&#x27;t complain! Nice but overall.</li>
            <li> They came earlier then I expected (: I endedcit up getting 5 instead of 4!! Thank you so much , they make my makeup look flawless and they are super soft and look high end</li>
            <li> Received after a waited while. Brushes are good!!</li>
            <li> GREAT brushes . I was surprised at how well these brushes work considering how much they cost! I am so glad that I bought these. I have also washed these several times and they still look brand new! A must buy!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing , they make my foundation look flawless and the texture is soft. Great for coverage . Love love love these brushes</li>
            <li> I never even got them.  Scam, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> i am in LOVE with these brushes!. i thought they would be a flop, i was wrong! the only thing i didn&#x27;t like, was the smell. after i shampooed them &amp; let them be out for awhile without use they&#x27;re fine. i HIGHLY recommend these brushes! im even gonna make a youtube video about them! !</li>
            <li> Great brushes! They only shed about two hairs. They came way earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered these after deciding I would never spend $80+ on makeup brushes. I placed my order on June 26 &amp; they shipped on June 27....just received them on July 16! Mind you, these shipped from China. I purchased the 4 piece &amp; was excited to find that there were 5 brushes in my package!!!! They were all individually packaged in plastic. They dont have a harsh or wonky smell whatsoever. They are incredibly soft!!!! I&#x27;m very very surprised @ the quality of these brushes as well! The handle is plain black with no logo or writing on them... Nothing fancy. Shedding was a big concern of mine especially buying a brush in store that was $15 &amp; shed like crazy.... There wasn&#x27;t any shedding @ all!!!! That&#x27;s a plus!! I&#x27;d highly recommend these to anyone wanting high quality brushes @ an extremely affordable price!</li>
            <li> Loved them.!!! Great quality dupes for sigma</li>
            <li> Never got the brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes feel great, but because they&#x27;re smaller than I anticipated, I&#x27;m a little let down. With the tips of the brushes being about as big around as a quarter, they&#x27;re too compact for me to actually get anything done with them. If you like smaller brushes, I bet you&#x27;ll love these.</li>
            <li> So dissapointed. After waiting almost 2 months I receive a packet n im so excited cuz I knew it was this. To my surprise I only received one brush. Ugh I was really looking forward to them too :/  don&#x27;t waste your time with this please you&#x27;re just gonna have a big dissapointment</li>
            <li> when i tell you these brushes are AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;i absolutely mean that to the upmost fullest !! applying makeup is flawless and beautiful..&lt;br /&gt;i would deft say these brushes are also beginner FRIENDLY&lt;br /&gt;and my ladies who are PROS i deft recommend these brushes...&lt;br /&gt;they are the perfect match to SIGMA brushes :)</li>
            <li> I received 5 brushes instead of 4..awesome. They are extremely soft.I Dropped two a few times and they were fine. No dents nothing. They held up great after their first cleaning. .Makeup application and blending is awesome with these brushes.</li>
            <li> These are the softest brushes I have ever owned. They are perfect for my make applications and I am so glad I purchased them. The price was GREAT and the quality is too. Very pleased with these.</li>
            <li> I order this brushes in the month of June. Here it is now the month of August and still havent recieved them. Not only that but the company didnt even issue out a tracking number to me. As a company you would&#x27;ve thought that someone would have contact me and told me something. DONT be a victim!!! this is a horrible sells company an will not encourage anybody to order from them. Invest your money and something that you feel is right and worth your money as well as your WAIT!!!! Thank you and have a wonderful day :)</li>
            <li> Very good quality the only problem was that when I got it the glue got to hot and they broke in half, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> These are great. Remind me a lot of sigma brushes. They are full, soft, and work amazing. So surprised for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent  black synthetic bruhes , Thanks.</li>
            <li> This brushes are not like they show them in the picture they are crap and it takes forever to receive them. I had bougth brushes but they were gold with black and they where the best I taught this were going to be the same but just different color. Im so disapointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  Took a month to arrive and they are so thin they don&#x27;t hold any makeup.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> These arrived within the shipping window and are actually really nice! The bristles are very densely packed and soft with almost no fall out so far. However, one of my brushes had the handle fall off during shipping. This was unfortunate but easy to fix (just a bit of glue). From the handle falling off though, I can confirm the handles are solid wood and the bristles are all well attached. There was a paint like smell to the brushes but as long as you wash them before use, it goes away and is not a problem. I did notice the one that fell apart (the highlighting brush) had different coloration on the tip than the other 3 brushes and did not come in a plastic sleeve like the other 3 brushes. All and all, these are nice for the price and I think they will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I would compare these brushes to the Sigma Kabuki line. I mostly use the flat top and the concealer one but they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Pro: I received 5 brushes instead of 4. Con: they took almost a month to arrive, they smelled weird, and 2 of the five brushes broke instantly. The handles fell right off. My next stop for brushes will be Morphe brushes, the price here was not worth the hassle. But whatever, it was 7 bucks.</li>
            <li> They came In the mail already broken...</li>
            <li> Hello girls can anyone tell me what are these brushes use for i know blush and powder please ????</li>
            <li> Great dupes for the sigma brushes. They&#x27;re actually better than those high end ones. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Wish there was a bit more variety, but--for this price--</li>
            <li> great! i actually received a fifth brush... not complaining!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price. Took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> It fell apart a week of having them</li>
            <li> these are great brushes, it took awhile to Get them but it was definitely worth it &amp; it came with 5 brush instead of 6!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Thick and dense.&lt;br /&gt;Great for contouring and highlighting.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! The quality is great!</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!!!! In the description it says 4 pieces and I only got one!!!! What the hell is that???!! I&#x27;m so pissed off right now.</li>
            <li> these are great brushes almost like the best brushes out there but i think they need better glue because after a week the black wood part detached from the silver part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally got my brushes. They came today. Instead of getting 4 brushes I recieved 5. The brushes are good and they don&#x27;t have a funny smell. The bristles are very soft. I&#x27;m highly upset about the shipping. It took forever to get here. Nonetheless these are good brushes.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes very sturdy and clean.</li>
            <li> They are great! Not like Sigma brushes but are totally amazing (:</li>
            <li> Waiting for this product for more than 1month still no sign of it or any reply.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes ! So soft and cheap</li>
            <li> beautiful dense cosmetic brushes all purpose liquid or powder makeup products ..the had a light odor most likely to protect the bristles of the brushes i washed and let air dry and they&#x27;re ready for use. delivery wasnt quick but it wasnt forever mayb 2 weeks i feel they&#x27;re worth it. i&#x27;ve experienced no shedding  thus far i have ordered before from seller great quality brushes NOT goat hair I have sensitive skin i havent experienced any irritation thus far</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes super soft but the smell is horrible and the shipping takes forever</li>
            <li> Brushes are really soft. It takes forever to arrive but its well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> These fell apart in less then a week that I got them. Good thing I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft yet strong. I&#x27;ve experienced NO shedding. And just GREAT brushes. Especially for the price</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality. I&#x27;ve been using on my clients as foundation and contour brushes. These are amazing. Didn&#x27;t take long to get them either. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love! Very smooth on skin and distributes makeup beautifully and evenly.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and for Such a great price you can&#x27;t pass them up! They remind me a lot of sigma brushes but these are wayyy more affordable!! Absolutely love!!</li>
            <li> Good brushes, no shedding. I purchased the ones with the black handles (set of 4). I&#x27;ve even washed these already and they have held up very well bouncing back right after. I use the angled brush for highlighting with highlighting powder, the flat for concealer which is all I use, I&#x27;m sure you could use it for foundation too, the flat top I am going to try to use it for stippling with my concealer, and round top I use for liquid tint blush.</li>
            <li> I really really love these! I jus got them, gabe em a little wash &amp; they work amazing ❤️ Very satisfied. &amp; also they came in only 6 days so thats a plus ☺️</li>
            <li> Its okay for the price after washing cleaning them for a few times the brush top hair came apart.</li>
            <li> This is a great substitute for sigma brushes, it is soo thick and really soft , also the hair dont fall when cleaning it , and all over it is cheap!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are great they are very soft and get the job done although I wish they would be more full other than that they are perfect</li>
            <li> These brushes are literally perfect. The matrial le great and the handles are shirt so their perfect to put in your purse or Togo make up bag. Their very similar to the sigma kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this product is the wait, once they arrive they are spectacular!!&lt;br /&gt;I used them to contour my face and they blend my makeup so well it almost gives me a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!!!!</li>
            <li> I so love the soft brushes...arrived in Honolulu just in time for the cousins departure for Manila Philippines. With one free brush..Good deal!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a star was for the fast shipping. HORRIBLE quality! Looks nothing like the picture. Just save yourself the ond go buy the royal care brushes, still under $20 for four brushes, which are a great dupe of the stigmas!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these brushes daily. The brushes are soft on my face and my make-up goes on beautifully. I will buy more Bis brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> omg i just got them today and there better than what i expected im really impressed i just bought the eyeshadow ones that are like this cant wait</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price!! I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Love my brushes they have very soft bristles ,they came before the time said .well worth what i paid .Love them .</li>
            <li> I love my brushes!! No fall-out, so soft, and perfect for applying my makeup. Shipping took forever though....</li>
            <li> Decent brushes that have multiple uses. Only issue is the brush comes off of the handle sometimes</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected which was a great surprise! They did smell kind of like paint when I took them out but washed them and they are totally fine. Very good quality good value! Super excited to use!</li>
            <li> I would totally reccomened these for starters for extras or even for those that just like to buy but buy haha like me. Really good for $6 something! Just don&#x27;t like how long it took but no complains about them!</li>
            <li> These have a nasty smell that does not go away after washing, it smells toxic and gave me a headache. They LOOK nice but not worth enduring the smell.</li>
            <li> There is no need to spend the hefty price on the designer brand when these are the exact same brushes for less. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Thanks good brushes , they take way to deliver but they are nice .</li>
            <li> the hairs on the brushes were falling out in massive amounts. very not put together well.... I believe more work needed to be done to these to make them not as cheap</li>
            <li> Finally got my brushes after emails and bad review. Love them but it took forever.</li>
            <li> Probably one of 4 is good . The bristles come off so much on the flat top . I had to throw it away . Two of my brushes looked like the got cut with scissors. I just don&#x27;t like them . I got one good brush. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> The brushes are nnice and soft, but the handles fell apart in the first. The glue used for them is not good at all.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes because they are exactly as they are described.  I use the flat brush to apply foundation. The pointed tip brush is used to put the setting powder under my eyes.  The other two round ones I use for loose powder and blush.  I definitely recommend.  Also, they are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Brushes DID actually come....was nervous they wouldn&#x27;t after reading the reviews. They are pretty stiff, good for contouring, setting makeup, and maybe blush. They are a good quality for their price and were larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love them, work great and the price is cheap</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them! they feel just like the sigma ones!</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE!!! verg skeptical at buying them first but LOVE them</li>
            <li> Good brushes over all but immediately one of the brushes broke. But you get what you pay for I guess. Soft bristle though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes, very good quality &amp; I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> They work so good work just as good as the kabuki brushes luv em!!!</li>
            <li> Brushes broke off the handle after 3rd use, no good</li>
            <li> These are amazing. Perfect for everything.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I really needed new brushes fast. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. I paid under 10$ dollars for brushes that are honestly comparable in quality to M.A.C. products. The bristles are dualfiber, and they&#x27;re so soft. They&#x27;re just the right amount of dense, and my foundation goes on flawlessly. I use these as stippling brushes. (The flat-top one for general foundation application stippling and buffing the first round, the pointy-ish one for hard to reach places like the ridges on the sides of my nose, and the general eye area, the slanted ones I use for blush and bronzer. These are so amazing all around. 10/10 would recommend. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! They are such great makeup brushes for the price. They barely shed at all and I have washed these a TON and they STILL hold up. I cannot say enough about these brushes. I use mine for liquid foundation and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a week now, I got my brushes a little over 2weeks after I placed the order. I use the flat stipple brush for my BareMinerals bare skin foundation and it works amazingly! I find it a lot better than there $29 brush. These bruses are super soft and a great find, I would recommend these brushes to anyone wanting to build their brush sets</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mother, since she travels and needed some smaller brushes to fit in her travel case. It did take a while to come it, but when they did, they were exactly as picture. They are small, well-made and with lovely, dense bristles. Very soft to the touch and the four different types cover all the make-up basics. Very happy with this purchase. I wish I&#x27;d gotten a set for myself.</li>
            <li> Brushes where great!! they where a gift for my fiend.. she loved them.. they are so soft.. and the small hairs do not fall off like other brushes or leave them on you face.. it is a bargain!</li>
            <li> Very dense brushes, haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding and applies my makeup beautifully....would repurchase and recommend, great for the price!  Thanks</li>
            <li> They work great... got them almost 7 months ago and still work very nice</li>
            <li> 2 words : Great Brushes</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! Feel like such high quality!</li>
            <li> OMG!  These are some seriously high quality brushes that would have cost much, much more if bought in a store locally.  Love them!  Be patient.  They take about 6 weeks to arrive from China, but are worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the synthetic brissels because they work great. Quality is good for what your paying. I love the softness of the brushes. I use them everyday! I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> The brushes were decent for the money. The only things that didnt make me give 5 stars is, the brushes were not as dense as I would of liked them to be, The handle on the angled brush was delivered loose and eventually fell off while washing and Amazon gave a delivery date that was not accurate (at least 12 days to short of when they were delivered).</li>
            <li> They are so soft and work amazing ! Beyond my expectations</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They are great at applying foundation, blush and bronzer. Good powder brushes too. The bristles are soft. 2 of them were separated from the handle when I received them, but they sent 2 more. Thank you for the great customer service!</li>
            <li> It took forever for these brushes to arrived and when they did reeked of pain. There is no inscription on the handles and the fibers are much shorter than they appear in the photo. Horrible!</li>
            <li> Love them!The bristles are soft and full, makes foundation and blush application process a breeze</li>
            <li> DID NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and seem to be of good quality but I have two complaints. They are a little smaller than I expected and three of them are dented on the silver part and it affects the actual shape of the brush. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Wow very good quality for the price..they work fantastic!</li>
            <li> Loved everything about the brushes except the handles come off and they&#x27;re hard to glue back on.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes so soft</li>
            <li> These are really good. They defiantly compare to higher brand makeup brushes. They are very soft and thick which allow perfect blending of foundation and other makeup products. I didn&#x27;t experience any shading before or after I washed these brushes. Overall a good purchase and I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in LOVE with these brushes!!!!!</li>
            <li> They got here a week earlier so that was great. Great quality for a good price , would definitely repurchase</li>
            <li> They have a weird smell. Very soft and good brushes. But the contour brush sucks because the hairs fall out like nothing .</li>
            <li> I really like my brushes! The shipment was fast and the brushes are really soft. And cleans very well. I would recommend others to try it.</li>
            <li> Ohmeegee!  These brushes are fabuloiusn. I can&#x27;t get over how soft they are and they blend product flawlessly!!  I think I&#x27;ll order a second set!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They have held up nicely. They look and feel high quality. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars in because one of brushes arrived broken. Still able to use it for blendinf.</li>
            <li> The material of this product is bad.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I absolutely love these brushes. Perfect for contouring. They had a funky smell, but once you wash then the smell goes away. Took a little long for them to come, definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t glued on right but its fixable and I love them, soft and Really GOOD!</li>
            <li> The  are not as full brisel as I thought and they shad a little. But for the price I give 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissatisfied with these brushes, I am positive that they are not the brushes in the photo, the hair was mostly in the bag instead of the brush and the ferrels are sharp and lose.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so happy with the amount of time it came in. i ordered these on September 10, 2014. The delivery was set for Monday October 6, 2014 - Thursday October 23, 2014 i received them today Friday September 19, 2014 which is amazing. The brushes are sooooo soft. The only problem i have with them is that there is a scent on the brushes and they had little shedding, but after i washed them it wasn&#x27;t a problem anymore. i would recomend these to anyone who is looking for some cheap brushes</li>
            <li> I just barely got my brushes in the mail and ooooh damn these brushes are amazing. My foundation looks so flawless. Thank you so much!!!  ❤</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I received 5 brushes instead of 4,awesome!</li>
            <li> They were received in excellent condition and smoothed on my foundation flawlessly.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really good, I likeThe product ,is excellent and very nice price ..</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! Although it took almost a month to arrive.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome!!! Not a single bristle has dropped out and it feels smooth on the face. Nice quality. I was very skeptical because of the price...and after reading some of the negative reviews that kinda hindered me from buying it sooner. But Im glad I took d chance...I love these brushes! I recommend it to anyone...</li>
            <li> the brushes feel soft and will work. One had to be repaired because it came apart during shipping.</li>
            <li> I needed some back up face brushes to last me during wash/dry days. I have also have the Real Techniques brushes, which I love. I didn&#x27;t have HIGH expectations for this set but based on the positive reviews and low cost I figured it was worth a try. First of all I got five brushes instead of four in my set. Bonus!! They seemed sturdy and after playing with the bristles a bit there wasn&#x27;t any fall out. I&#x27;ve been using them consistently for about two weeks now and I&#x27;m so pleased that I got them.</li>
            <li> I usually go for these type of brushes and im a fan of bestope but they didnt have any. After  checking them, instantly there was shedding and the handle fell right off of one which was a bummer...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these babies. I got an extra for free and now I have brushes for every use. I use the dome top for foundation it&#x27;s my favorite.  I use the others for powder, bronzers, blushes and airbrush foundations.  I highly recommend. And Ive many foundation brushes for higher prices and these are my go to&#x27;s</li>
            <li> worst product I ever order from Amazon</li>
            <li> Great value and excellent brushes. Wash well do not shed and apply foundation flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I definitely did not expect that these brushes would be such good quality. I know some people have complained about the smell right out of the plastic, but it really wasn&#x27;t too bothersome. Plus, we should always wash our make up brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Brushes were very tight and compact, and it works well with foundation blending and blush.</li>
            <li> They arrived early and the packaging was nice and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people compare these to the sigma face kabuki set and they are absolutely a dupe to them!! For the price, you get all 4 of the brushes instead of all 4 at Sigma for $80. They blend ANYTHING down to that airbrush finish, I love &#x27;em!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat brush is definitely my favorite for overall blending. I use the pointed to blend out my cream contour. The round brush for blush and bronzer. I have yet to use the angled one but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it just as much :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend buying them because for the price they are at, theyre a steal!</li>
            <li> i ordered this brushes i thought this are durable and nice but i was disappointed with this kind of cosmetics brushes. it is waste of money if you buy this kind of cosmetics brushes.</li>
            <li> The handles on the brush keep breaking, which really disappoints me because I thought they would be better quality than that. I can&#x27;t even use the brush with the handle because every time I do it breaks off. But I&#x27;m giving them four stars because the brush itself is so soft and it puts on makeup very well!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for price</li>
            <li> I received these brushes yesterday, and I was completely happy with my purchase! They came from Shanghai, so shipping took a while, but I got them about 2 weeks after ordering. I opened them up and they were in perfect condition. They are so soft! Like, a million baby bunnies soft! They are thick and good quality for the price!&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a steal! Your getting professional grade brushes for only a couple dollars, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the quality of this Brush. I&#x27;m really satisfy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> the brush for foundation not is so good</li>
            <li> These brushes have really surprised me. When I purchased them I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t be good quality or they would shed or just fall apart but they are actually pretty good quality! They don&#x27;t shed at all and they are really soft! These brushes are awesome! The only problem I have is that they smell pretty bad and I am assuming it&#x27;s because if the plastic they were shipped in, but other than that I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes fantastic quality use them everyday so soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes. They took a while to arrive but expect that since they are coming from overseas. The seller is the sweetest and answered my questions very swiftly. I will definitely order again. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these AWESOME brushes.</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes especially for the price !</li>
            <li> Perfect density. Great deal!</li>
            <li> These are some of the most amazing brushes I own (and I own a lot!) They are 100% AMAZING!!! I&#x27;ve recommended them to every makeup lover I know and raved about them on my YouTube Channel! VERY comparable to the popular Sigma brushes but a fraction of the cost! Seriously thinking about ordering another set to have as backups! Only thing is that the shipping takes forever, about 4-5 weeks!</li>
            <li> They feel just like my expensive brushes! They apply the same, blend the same, clean the same... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not the best quality. Brushes shed. Overall, not the best applicators to use on your face.</li>
            <li> the best you can get to match it cosmetic brushes</li>
            <li> I love my brushes! They came in yesterday which is before my estimated delivery date (sept. 4-20th)&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these brushes are very good for the price that u pay.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used them yet but the look and feel is great. I ordered 2 sets and both came with the right brushes and all 4 were in each package. I would definitely recommend these to anyone starting out with makeup or a pro. They&#x27;re very soft and dense how they should be. In my opinion they&#x27;re great overall ! I only waited 3 weeks total.</li>
            <li> When the brushes came, the first two things i loved were they came super fast&lt;br /&gt;( i live in ny &amp; they came from china ).&lt;br /&gt;And they were individualy wrapped into a much bigger bag. they feel like velvet on your skin, and so do the handles on them. they look rich and high quality. only thing you have to do if wash them before u use them because they come with an odor.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER. THEY WILL NEVER COME.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price produces great finish. The dome brush wasn&#x27;t as soft as the others but still did what it needed to</li>
            <li> i love them!! they are fantastic and so is the price!!</li>
            <li> Received the package and all is good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews...&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of cautious about buying these brushes because of the reviews that it got. They did come! And they are really soft. The only problem I have with them is that they have a really strong odor that isn&#x27;t very pleasing, but if you wash them it&#x27;s okay. They blend my foundation really well, and they were worth the money spent on them, they are such great quality!</li>
            <li> These brushes were huge! Way to bug for shadow &amp; the quality is definitely not good! They broke &amp; I don&#x27;t even use them!</li>
            <li> DONT BUY WAITED SINCE JUNE AND NOW ITS ALMOST OCTOBER FOR MY BRUSHES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WANT A REFUNDDDDDDDD IF I DONT GET THEM SOONNNN</li>
            <li> They have no writing on the handles. The fibers are longer that they show in picture and come off all over your face. I was hoping for short fiber as shown in picture because I was looking for a kabuki kind of brush but these are too long. I only give it 2 stars because they are super soft.</li>
            <li> These certainly aren&#x27;t as nice as my Sigma&#x27;s, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be - I also wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be as nice as they were! There&#x27;s zero bristles that fall out on my face, the brushes have held their shapes, they clean easily, they buff on foundation so easily, and they&#x27;ve lasted me several months. I highly recommend if you dont want to drop the extra $ on the Sigma brushes that you give these a try, they&#x27;re definitely worth it and they do result in a really nice even foundation finish.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get them but they are great! Soft, blend makeup perfectly, and I&#x27;ve washed them  twice and they have held up great. Im sure this set would cost over 100 dollars for high end brands and these work just as well</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They complete the job for contouring, applying foundation, powder, blush, etc. They&#x27;re EXTREMELY soft yet also very sturdy. I got the pack of 4 in black, and the matte black is beautiful. It makes the brushes seem way more expensive than they really are. I will totally repurchase after (hopefully) a few years use!</li>
            <li> I love these! And they came in fast, three days after I ordered them! They&#x27;re so soft and apply makeup well. Liquid and power.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes but it took forever for me to get them in the mail.. It&#x27;s a good buy just be prepared to wait .</li>
            <li> So cheap for such good brushes. Love it</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I have been trying to find great brushes for my foundation, blush, and contor brushes.&lt;br /&gt;When I first got these brushes, it seemed that they were indented alot while shipping... However, I used them a few times, and then cleaned the brushes and they are brand new. The hairs do fall out a little bit at the beginning, but I haven&#x27;t had any of late.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are dense and soft and perfect for buffing foundation into your face! Leaves your pores MINIMAL! they also do not abosorb alot of foundation, Meaning that if you want a good full-coverage look, you can get it with these.&lt;br /&gt;They also do not feel cheap. The handles are thick, and the average length of a foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes came within a week, (I believe 2 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and I will be purchasing more products from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy and Highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes to see if they are better than the sponges I have been using.  I found that the brush is better at distributing the liquid foundation I use.  It is a better way to make up my face and I&#x27;m very happy with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have boughten two sets of brushes at two seperate times and the first pair were absolutly wonderful, had great consistancy and thickness no starnge smells.&lt;br /&gt;The second pair i just recieved in the mail are the complete opposite, they are not sturdy, i took them out of the protective slips they were in and brushed it on my hands and all the brisslea of the brush began to fall into my hand. Not to mention they have a very awkward and almost like burnt plastic smell to them.&lt;br /&gt;Very very dissappointed in my second purchase</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. Came with a bit of smell but after a quick wash with makeup remover and pure soap, it came right out. Great quality brush however I am taking off a star since 2 of the handles were not properly secured on to the rest of the brush. The overall quality of construction isn&#x27;t there but I can fix it with some hot glue for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes! Great value for the price super soft and works great!</li>
            <li> I think they are good. Soft brushes. The price is great for the set. I&#x27;d buy again. They also arrived in less than a week.</li>
            <li> These are great for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. Held up after washing.</li>
            <li> These work very well and are super soft. The only issue for me was the glue disconnecting from the metal and wood piece on one of the brushes, but I just glued them back together.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes and I&#x27;m glad I purchased them. I was expecting some low quality for the price but I liked them. They are just as good as my expensive brushes</li>
            <li> LOVE !!! Cheap but good quality !</li>
            <li> fast delivery and really good quality.. use these every day and would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I ADORE THESE BRUSHES. My recommended brushes!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even get my item. Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t buy this don&#x27;t waste your money I had never got package and it had been waiting for months is not  worth it</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes, I have a full Sigma Kit and these look and feel exactly like they do. They are sleek and professional  and are high quality in construction looking and the bristles are super soft ! I would recommend to anyone who loves makeup. I&#x27;m buying a second set for my professional kit.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes everyday! They are perfection. great for applying foundation, Under eye highlighting, contouring. My makeup looks as if a professional did it all thanks to these amazing brushes! I will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> These are the BEST brushes I have ever used and I may buy a second set to have while the others get a once a week cleaning. They are super soft and work on many different types of products!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are great. The silver part on one of the brushes was loose. But other than that I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Really bad quality. Not at all fluffy.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing! For only 6.50, I was expecting crap. But these blew me away! The quality are as if you&#x27;ve paid 30 a piece. Definitely a must for all make-up fanatics. Will buy more. :)</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes! So soft and work well</li>
            <li> Really great brushes for their price. They are not that big so you can carry them around in your make up bag. I&#x27;m really happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I received my brushes about 2 weeks ago &amp; upon inspection they are very soft &amp; densely packed full of bristles &amp; no fallout, but 1 of them was loose so I got my husband to glue it for me. But sone far I enjoy using them they&#x27;re great. &amp; I don&#x27;t ware makeup on a daily basis only if I&#x27;m goin some where. But I&#x27;ll give an update after I wash them, so for now the reason I gave 4 ☆ is because 1 was loose but other than that they&#x27;re great brushes! &amp; it didn&#x27;t take long to receive them &amp; the price is fabulous!</li>
            <li> They are amazing. I thought they were a bit bigger but they work just fine !</li>
            <li> I think these brushes are great! I had been planning on getting the Real Techniques Expert Face Brush, but I figure I might as well get 4 brushes for the price of one! They are great. Super soft and don&#x27;t shed, even after washing. If you are getting these as a dupe for the Sigmax brushes, keep in mind that they are significantly smaller (which I don&#x27;t mind!)</li>
            <li> Gives an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> Brushes are medium size, love the softness and variety. But material wise it&#x27;s built very poorly. Handle detach from the brush</li>
            <li> For the price its ok ill rather buy different brand though and after a few washes started to fall apart.... and now months later they are stiffer.... i still use them though! Not bad for starters .. and fiy:i wash my brushes correctly so the Farrell dnt get wet</li>
            <li> I love these big brushes. Perfect for putting on foundation or BB creams. They are very soft, yet firm . So happy to have these, esp. for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes every day, but the handle has fallen off of 3 of them already. Would still recommend because of the quality of the brush bristles.</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews about people not receiving there brushes I was extremely worried. But I received mine a week before I was even supposed to. And let me just say I have been using them for a week now and I already love them,  they are amazing quality for the price you pay.  I mean only 7.00 for four brushes.  The only reason I did not give five stars was because after washing them the first time mine had a little shedding,  very little but there was still some hair off the brush on my face but it&#x27;s nothing major it&#x27;s very minimal.  Fiimh</li>
            <li> Came on time, the quality is mediocre. But so far I like the product</li>
            <li> Not great they come apart</li>
            <li> These are great! So affordable and perfect for what I need them.</li>
            <li> Love these! Good for the price. No shedding which was shocking</li>
            <li> Love my brushes! They work wonderful!They take a while but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had these brushes for almost a year and for the price they are absolutely wonderful. I haven&#x27;t had any fall out and the texture of the brushes are soft and full. I have just not had one of the brushes break, but I will be super gluing it back together!</li>
            <li> I order this product on Sept 24 2014 and I got it on Oct 14 2014. I thought it came pretty quick because it says that it&#x27;s going to come around Oct 21 or something. I haven&#x27;t tried it but it feels really soft, but it has like a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> ❤️Thank you&lt;br /&gt; I got my brushes today, super soft🙈😍</li>
            <li> If it wouldn&#x27;t have taken so long to receive it this product would have gotten  five stars</li>
            <li> Not too bad. Shipping was kinda slow but brushes aren&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> When I received the package, I really only wanted the flat bristle brush and was excited to get the package. They had a weird odor and still do. When I removed the brushes, three of the handles fell apart from the metal part that has the bristles. This is not exactly what I expected at this price as I purchased two of Ailunce Very Useful Professional Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki Brush Single Cosmetic Makeup Brush Black and they have held up well. I did not want a refund as they were not too expensive, but I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> the price is unbelievable cheap.  the quality is not bad neither. i would recommend to beginners.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  The flat top works great with foundation and the tapered one is amazing for concealer.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding and there was no odor other than the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell.  Would recommend these to anyone in need of great kabuki brushes.  And the shipping was fast compared to when i expected them since shipping from over seas.</li>
            <li> u get what u pay for after a month of use the brushes feel apart out of the four i only still have one brush left .... that one brush is very good though since it has not falling apart</li>
            <li> I absolutely love and recommend this product! I received a week earlier than the estimated date that it would be shipped to me. When I received it there was a strong chemical smell, but with a quick wash of cetaphil and water fixed that. The brushes were get full and thick. The application they provide its even and flawless! They make many of my pores disappear.</li>
            <li> The brushes had a pretty weird smell but after washing them a few times it went away. They did their job for a while but now after a few months the heads are coming off of them :(</li>
            <li> I have been a professional MUA for over 20 yrs. I&#x27;ve tried so many different brushes! These rank #1 on my list! No bristle fall out. Super soft. Great blending. Literally the best I&#x27;ve tried. I would have paid 5 times as much for a set like this (and I have, but never again). Beats out MAC, Shu Eumura, Japonesque, etc.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much ordering this brush set due to the lower price tag. I have experience with other cheaper brush sets shedding...all over my face while applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at the quality of these brushes. I haven&#x27;t had an issue with excessive shedding. They apply makeup evenly, and honestly the quality matches that of higher end sets!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any makeup lover!</li>
            <li> I really like these but one of the brushes split in two at the ferrule and handle. I glued it and it was fine. That is why they didn&#x27;t get 5 stars. The rest of the brushes are really nice and soft. I use them with liquid foundation and the slanted one for blush and contouring.</li>
            <li> These were good quality brushes! Better then I expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes around the 14th or 15th of December!! I have to admit, I was a little nervous that they would never come in after reading reviews. Well, they did come in, and very quickly may I add. I was so excited when they came in and they work really well. My foundation goes on so smoothly and I definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a good set of face brushes!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes !!!!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes they blend foundation beutyfully shipping was fast&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> love them!!! and i couldnt beat the price. i like them!</li>
            <li> Love them so soft !!❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes. You don&#x27;t need to spend $$$ on other similar brushes. I&#x27;ve washed them several times and none of the hairs have fallen out. They&#x27;re so soft too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Makeup artist I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brushes these are my favorite face brushes!  I&#x27;ve been using them for months and no fall out still in tact love them!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they came very early, they are great Quality and they are very soft! The only thing is the bush part broke of of two so I just glued them together!!! But great brushes!!!</li>
            <li> They are wonderful!  I thought they wouldn&#x27;t be here till January and I just got them.  The are professional quality with regular sized handles...not travel sized!  Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give zero stars. NEVER RECEIVED THE BRUSHES!!!!!  STUPID SCAM ARTISTS!!!</li>
            <li> Cool brushes and unexpensive, the pile mixed natural and synthetic. Doesn&#x27;t cause an allergy, perfectly dry, carry out the function for all 100%, aren&#x27;t showered, I recommend</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Soft and well made. This was my second order.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product. I shop at ultra, sephora, everywhere for beauty products. I would spend maybe $25/ each brush for what you get here, but this is 4 for cheap!? That&#x27;s insanely awesome. If you&#x27;re a beauty guru like me and looking for good powder brushes, look no further. I highly recommend. ;)</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes.. feel almost like Sigma or Mac. so happy with the purchase and the price, cant beat it!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice and they apply makeup beautifully. The only problem is that they broke in 2 because the glue was not strong enough. I used them 3 times before this happened.</li>
            <li> These had a STRONG paint thinner type scent but a good washing and the smell went away.  Not to much shedding which surprised me and they work just as well as my high end brushes! Great product and the seller shipped faster then expected!!</li>
            <li> I want to love these brushes because they are soft, sturdy, dense, and affordable. But the smell of them is awful. Like, paint thinner or acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked them in dawn and vinegar for a few hours, and the smell did not dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to soak them again in dawn, vinegar, peroxide, and tea tree oil for 24 hours.  This helped.  They still have a mild scent to them but not anywhere near as bad as when I first received them. Not being dramatic, they made the entire amazon order smell even though they were in plastic casing. Kind of a bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, they are just back up brushes for when my expensive ones are dirty.</li>
            <li> These are good quality and good for the price. I use these daily.</li>
            <li> The are cheap...... they have come apart. They are not put together very well.</li>
            <li> Great product I love using brushes to apply my makeup they just all seem to be the exact same brush and small. I like big brushes to apply my blush.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes. They are better then DIOR and BBrown brushes as they do not brake, loose hair, or get too soft or too harsh, this is my second time buying these brushes and they never let me down.</li>
            <li> Im very pleased with this product great quality brushes easily cleaned too!</li>
            <li> Love my makeup brushes, better quality than I expected. ...recommend</li>
            <li> They work great....will buy again for the price.</li>
            <li> got this in the mail and two of the brushes already broke off the stick.</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft and it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face. It shipped pretty fast and no hair have been falling out. I think it&#x27;s a really good deal for 4 good quality brushes</li>
            <li> There  really nice brushes for the price</li>
            <li> Notwithstanding all the complaints have with a particular seller, this brush set is a great value for good brushes. The brushes are big by any measure and exactly what we were looking for.  Perfect for foundation.  The brushes are really soft and will not irritate your face (unless you have super sensitive skin). Build quality is ok.  The brush handle on one brush came loose, but we fixed it by applying some crazy glue (we have three girls in our house- they get serious use). Overall, pretty good purchase at right price.</li>
            <li> These brushes came to the rescue when I had very little very soft not rough. Id say go for it buy em all,very cheap too!</li>
            <li> Bought a couple months ago, washed twice with baby shampoo and bare minerals brush shampoo. The brushes have a very strong plastic chemical scent. Have not been able to use them yet, they are very soft though.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love these brushes!</li>
            <li> I love the brushes they are so sturdy and soft I want more......you guys are great .....I dont say that often....</li>
            <li> Wow so much better than expected and quite large. I did have to wait a bit for these brushed but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> They ok , im not crazy about them, won&#x27;t buy them again!</li>
            <li> Arrived in 2 days, excellent brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> These are amazing quality brushes, they do not shed at all and are super soft. I am a makeup artist and will def be repurchasing them again!</li>
            <li> Love, Love These brushes!!</li>
            <li> Bought these for on the go, as I lose them often, nice price, quick ship.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! but when I cleaned the last set the bristles started to fall out. I did try to clean with a brush spray but it left an oily residue...these are cheap enough to just buy new ones when they get too dirty.</li>
            <li> Good brushes! You might need to glue the handle on at some point but I&#x27;ve had them for a few weeks and they&#x27;re still perfect. Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Honestly, for $6 I can&#x27;t even think of anything bad to say about the brushes.  Alright, they smell a little like paint before you wash them (wash your brushes people!) but they feel as soft and blend as well as more expensive brushes.  They don&#x27;t look or feel cheap and do a great job.</li>
            <li> Im very into makeup, and these brushes aint bad at all! Now, they arent as dense as they look, but they are dense enough! and the round top applies my liquid foundation SO WELL!  its like perfection. and the angles can be used for the same thing and blush/bronzer, the tapered for anything under the eye, and flat for foundation as well. liquid and or powder. these are great brushes!  no shedding for me and the smell everyone complains about goes away after 15 minutes or less for me! i say get these brushes!</li>
            <li> I was questioning if these were as good as the reviews. You know the old saying &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34; well that doesn&#x27;t apply to this product. I used these as soon as I received them. I was very impressed with the quality and how amazing these worked. Now to order eyeshadow brushes from the same brush line. Don&#x27;t hesitate..... BUY these.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I use them every day. They work just as well as the expensive brushes</li>
            <li> Amazing v cheaper than sigma brushes. Really I am v happy to buy this. I think we don&#x27;t need to spend more money on that xpensive brushes like sigma, sephora etc. I love all the brushes.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sooo great for the price seriously love them especially the flat brush and round pointed one (for the name lol my bad) sooo good for foundation and powder actually that&#x27;s what I use them for. Would definitely recommend for starters or people who just want nicer brushes for doing make up.</li>
            <li> For the price these are amazing brushes, seriously. I love them! I was a little afraid about the quality because of the price but I decided to get them anyway. They are so soft, perfect face brushes. I use the dense round brush for foundation and it&#x27;s AMAZING. So happy with this product. I don&#x27;t own too many brushes so this is perfect for my collection. These are must haves if your not ready to buy high end brushes. Even if you have high end brushes these are still really good.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this more stars, but honestly ... the brushes broke off of the handles after 3-5 uses. And I&#x27;ve since washed the brushes in an effort to keep my face clean and the hair on the brushes now feels very weird. I can glue the handles back on to the metal part holding the brush, but I don&#x27;t know about the texture of them. Like I said, they kind of feel weird now and actually have a slight odor to them now, as well.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th and 6th order of these brushes. I loved the old product, but the new product is awful. Thin brushes. I can&#x27;t imagine a use for them right now..., maybe to baste a turkey or something.... Simply awful,</li>
            <li> Love these they are so soft.. Apply on beautifully.. And the price is great. I just wish there were more sizes</li>
            <li> When i got these brushes i was so excited but the second time i used the all the handles came off. I super glued them back on and they are working pretty well now!</li>
            <li> These are super soft and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with them. They took a while to get here, but I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Applies makeup up well, and is gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes . There just as good as the Mac brushes. So worth it . Thank you .</li>
            <li> Real good brushes for the price good size also</li>
            <li> Sending it back, smell really funky (like paint or gasoline)</li>
            <li> handle fell off after a few months on all of them, but the brush part is usable</li>
            <li> Good price for what you get. Bristle feels soft as other reviewers said and no single one has fallen so far after a month. But the handles are poor made. The metal part on one of the brushes was already loose before the first use. Still recommend.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY YOU&#x27;LL NEVER RECEIVE YOUR BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!! You will not receive these brushes. It has been about three months since I ordered them and never got them in the mail. Don&#x27;t waste your time. You won&#x27;t get your brushes or your money back</li>
            <li> Very good brushes...nice quality for the price. I would recomend them to a friend. I even received an extra one.</li>
            <li> Love these so good !!... going to buy back ups!</li>
            <li> very soft comparable to my high end make up brushes. I can&#x27;t wait to show it to my sister. Love love love!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these! You&#x27;ll never receive them. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Very soft, and so far durable.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They&#x27;re so thick and work very well</li>
            <li> Great brushes! They are worth every penny! I think the sigma brushes are better, but these are not bad. Fast shipping I got mine 2 weeks after I purchased these.</li>
            <li> The one star is for the quality which was pretty decent-the brushes I recieved were soft, tho not dense at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, besides that-I&#x27;m livid! The pictures of the brushes I THOUGHT I ordered were NOT the brushes I recieved! These brushes in the pictures look more like buffing, sense foundation brushes which I EXPECTED unfortunately the brushes I recieved were along the lines of brushes used for setting powder! 2 of the brushes were exactly the same. Horrible. Don&#x27;t order from these thieves.</li>
            <li> great quality brushes</li>
            <li> I just got these brushes in the mail a couple days ago. I live in Canada, shipping took about 1 1/2 weeks. So impressed with the quality of them. Very sturdy, full size, do not shed and incredibly soft - much softer than elf studio brushes for anyone who wants a comparison. I was looking for sigma brush dupes and came across these. Read some reviews, and thought they wouldn&#x27;t be too bad. These brushes well over exceeded my expectations. Only \\&quot;downside\\&quot; to this set would be that the contour (or angled) brush in this set is very fluffy and a bit too dense to form a proper contour line on the cheekbones. Also, the tapered brush is definitely for use with liquid or cream foundations as the bristles of the brush itself are very \\&quot;silky.\\&quot; All in all, great product! I highly recommend these! P.S. The brushes had a strange glue-like smell to them at first, but you should have no problems w/ the smell after washing these before using.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for their price. They&#x27;re very soft and dense and are great at picking up color!&lt;br /&gt;I bought them a little over a month ago and have washed them twice already. They haven&#x27;t started to shed and the dark coloured part of the brush doesn&#x27;t leave any stain when I squeeze the excess water with a white towel (which is usually the case with cheaper brushes). All in all, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> They break really fast</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic and the seller shipped in a timely fashion.  I am very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> i love my brushes. They do shed , but not as bad as most brushes. 1 out of t10 , I&#x27;d rate it an 8</li>
            <li> I love this brushes. They do have a weird smell at first, but I just washed them and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get the black part of the handles wet. The paint will peel off.</li>
            <li> Brushes never came in , do not waste your time ordering them</li>
            <li> Gret set of brushes! Was very surprised!</li>
            <li> I dont even know where to start. I Absolutly Love These Brushes! they are amazing!! They took two weeks to get here, they do not look cheap at all, very good quality &amp; i would defiantly recommend these to anyone. ive showed all of my friends them &amp; they are all going to order some as well, i honestly want to order more just cause of how much i love them! You are NOT wasting your money, these brushes are well worth it!</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price -- these are just as amazing as any other brushes I&#x27;ve used, like real techniques or mac. I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding or tearing down and I&#x27;ve been using liquid/mousse formulas, but I&#x27;ve only been using them for a week so far. I am probably going to buy the eyeshadow brushes now to complete my set! And super fast shipping w/ such a great price, gotta love that!</li>
            <li> Super soft, work extremely well. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> the brushes have a really bad smell to them. I&#x27;ve been trying to clean them often to get rid of it but it won&#x27;t seem to work. however, the brushes are great quality, and disregarding th</li>
            <li> Good quality ,very soft brushes..</li>
            <li> A good bargain for the price.  Soft bristles packed together tightly.  Not good for a translucent powder or something you want to just dust on.</li>
            <li> Received the brushes in about three weeks. I was so HAPPY to finally get my brushes! They are ALL on par with Urban Decay, Tarts (supposed to end with an &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; but this stupid dictionary won&#x27;t let me add it), as well as Laura Gellar and Smashbox!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. They are so soft and pliable and picks up powder or liquid formula very easily with great distribution. They are easy to clean and I did this as soon as I received them, so  I could try them out quickly. I was so pleased with professional quality of the brushes and my polished look, that I will surely order more of these types of brushes. I hope that you all have the great experience with them that I did. BTW, there was no gross smell or anything that came out of the bag when I opened them nor was there any funky smell with the brushes themselves. I just had to wash them like you always do when you get new brushes. LOL!</li>
            <li> Do not buy. I never got my brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I got them in good timing lived them they are very soft and firm at the same time I&#x27;m a make up artist and in all about quality !! Awesome I would recommend ymti any one !!</li>
            <li> These brushes suck! Not really worth the money even though they&#x27;re not that much money. One of them wasn&#x27;t even cut right. It was all jaggedy and I had to cut it. I used one of them and hated them so I ended up throwing all the brushes away!</li>
            <li> These r the softest brushes ive ever felt. had a bit of a smell to them but i always wash new makeup brushes anyways. u should definitely get these!!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for ...&lt;br /&gt; After a week the wooden part broke off of the brush&lt;br /&gt; So now im left with just the brushes with out the handle</li>
            <li> Did not receive the special bonus pen. Although the brushes seems to be pretty good. I have not used them yet.</li>
            <li> This brushes are ALOT bigger than they look.  Unfortunately, one of the brushes is beginning to lose it&#x27;s bristles.  It&#x27;s quite annoying when I&#x27;m trying to use it!  I&#x27;m assuming the others will start to do that soon, too.  I guess you get what you pay for... :/</li>
            <li> i love these brushes i use all of them for my face routine foundation poeder bronzer blush they ate amazing ordering more!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews and honestly I was afraid to purchase these brushes but nevertheless I did!&lt;br /&gt;It was a little hard to track my package but I got it before time which was AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;When I got it.... It had a little scent but once you clean it up..&lt;br /&gt;YOU&#x27;RE GOOD TO GO....&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT BRUSHES, VERY SOFT!</li>
            <li> Great gift for my sister</li>
            <li> I love these blending brushes! They are great quality and they don&#x27;t fall apart!</li>
            <li> Not a good quality.  Too big</li>
            <li> Liked the quality of the brush itself, but the handles broke off of every single on I used in the first week. Also, it is extremely difficult to glue them back on becuase of the glue they used (a ton) inside the handle. Clearly it did not work well.</li>
            <li> These are not the products i recieved. My handles are too long the brushes are all the same shape don&#x27;t buy these</li>
            <li> fell apart after one month.</li>
            <li> They looked pretty and very good quality when I first sae them the problem is that they actually suck for doing anything they don&#x27;t hold the powder well at all I was disappointed for such pretty and cheap brushes</li>
            <li> I received my brushes a day early!  I have not yet used them but they&#x27;re in great packaging and great quality.  I definitely recommend buying these,  it&#x27;s an amazing deal</li>
            <li> Was really skeptical at first because of the reviews I had seen, but it ended up being really good, got them within 12 days, and they seem like really good quality, and incredibly soft, can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> These are just as good as expensive brushes. Why spend more a lot of money? If I had one complaint, it would be the bristles are too tight. Otherwise, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!! Def wasn&#x27;t about to spend 50-70 for just one from MAC.. They came in about 4 days after I ordered, no smell, incredibly soft... I&#x27;m jus in awwwe they are phenomenal😍😍</li>
            <li> I would have totally given a 5star but I only got 3 brushes. The bristles are so soft. I love how they feel against my skin. They feel expensive.</li>
            <li> Very soft and I love them</li>
            <li> Broke after first use :(</li>
            <li> This is a great set of brushes.  I have never used a stippling brush till now and I really like the way my foundation looks.  I highly recommend this set.  It is certainly a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Great brushes!!!!! and super cheap!</li>
            <li> Really soft. Really good quality👌</li>
            <li> Good material at very affordable price.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship but softest brushes ever! It also doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time. When I finally recieved my brushes nothing was protecting them and every single one is misshapen due to the way it was shipped. I&#x27;m very glad i spent so little on them because what I recieved was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love the product...great quality!</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are definitely worth it. They are full size, close to the size of the Sigma brushes, they are sturdy and the bristles are dense. I actually received an extra tapered brush so that was a bonus as well. Obviously, they arent quite as hig quality as the Sigma brushes, but that is to be expected. I love the flat one for foundation, it buffs out liquid and cremes well. I use the slanted one for bronzer and the rounded top for blush. I wanted the tapered brush for blending out my undereyes and eyelids with concealer. This is the only problem ive had, when I use them on my undereye or eyelid, I have a slight allergy to them. My eyes and nose start running and get itchy. Same thing that happens if I pet a cat and touch my face. I do have sensitive eyes as far as allergies go, but this kind of concerns me because it seems like a completely synthetic fiber (as these are described to be) should not give me an allergic reaction like that. Just something to think about before you purchase. O would make sure to wash them well before using and wash regularly.  I can&#x27;t afford very expensive brush sets right now, so for the price these are exceptional.</li>
            <li> Good brushes. Weren&#x27;t delivered to me on time all</li>
            <li> I love this brushes! They are so soft and hold up pretty well. They are 100% no shred. the only problem is it too a bit longer than it said to ship. I recommend these!</li>
            <li> Loving these brushes! They work great and I would suggest them to anyone! They are soft and blend perfectly for a flawless finish! Defiantly worth every penny and more!</li>
            <li> Really great quality brushes! I was pleasantly surprised! I&#x27;ll be purchasing more for my kit.</li>
            <li> The Delivery date was just one day off!&lt;br /&gt;these brushes are super soft and at first smell like paint, but the smell quickly goes away!</li>
            <li> These brushes are sooooo good</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! Very nice!</li>
            <li> these brushes do the job...bristles not as dense as i like...but overall good for price.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is so soft and great to use</li>
            <li> Why are people taking stars away because &amp;#34;They took too long to ship to me.&amp;#34;???? The shipping clearly stated(To me anyway), that I was going to receive it within 6-8 weeks. Yes I know that&#x27;s a pretty long time, but I decided to buy them anyway. The pros clearly out weigh the cons. I spent just under $7.00U.S. for something I would&#x27;ve payed triple for each individual brush retail. They do smell a little bit which I expected, but I washed them first, like I do all of my brushes and they&#x27;re just fine.  I wish they could&#x27;ve been a little more denser, but I am not going to complain one single bit, because like I said, my checking account barely noticed that I paid for these. VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!! :-D</li>
            <li> I think part of the problem when looking at low-cost cosmetic brushes we all worry they&#x27;ll be scratchy and hard, or they&#x27;ll shed terribly...or just be really, really poor applicators of makeup. This is certainly not the case with these brushes. I know. I looked at the price of this set and thought to myself how on Earth could they possibly be good if they are *so* inexpensive? I was half expecting those terrible, cheap brushes that come around during the holiday season, or worse, that come free with a product you buy. Not the case at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather a feat to produce brushes like this so inexpensively. These are dense yet beyond soft. I have waited over a year to do a review of these. I HATE when I read reviews when someone has the product for like a day. Sure, they&#x27;ll probably be amazing right after you get them. But how do they hold up? I&#x27;m not expecting too much for the low price, but I don&#x27;t want to waste my money, either. So. They do not shed (I&#x27;ve washed them about 10 times now with baby shampoo). They remain as soft as the day they arrive. No discoloring, no scents, etc. They&#x27;ve remained just as nice as the day they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application with these brushes is amazing. I like a full coverage look from my foundation. The best way I have found do to that is with a dense, kabuki- like brush. Yay! These fit the bill. I love applying foundation with these. I only use these for foundations. I tend to use the flat top and the rounded top most. The result is an airbrushed look. It&#x27;s nice to have a set of four because if you have slacked on cleaning, you&#x27;ll always have one you could use. The handles are solid and hefty, without being too heavy or awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of high end cosmetics (and brushes). I use a lot of Bobbi Brown brushes and my absolute FAVORITE foundation brush is from Kevyn Aucoin (read: not cheap). This brush set is an amazing option for someone just starting out withe cosmetics, someone who doesn&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money in tools, etc. They&#x27;re just...great. Cheaper than even Real Techniques (and similar to the Expert Face Brush, imo)!a lot of money in tools, etc. They&#x27;re just...great. Cheaper than even Real Techniques (and similar to the Expert Face Brush, imo)!</li>
            <li> Took a month for these to arrive! The brushes are very flimsy and streaky when using liquid products. I would suggest only using these with powder products. They smell really bad. For the price I guess I cannot complain but if you want good quality brushes don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> good value. great purchase overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a couple months now and I came here to say how great these are. I use them on a daily basis for my foundation, blush, and contouring. So far, I cannot say that I have noticed any shedding. These are an awesome price for quality brushes.</li>
            <li> They are what I was always looking for as a makeup artist and great for beginners too!</li>
            <li> soft but seriously cut so badly I can&#x27;t tell which of the rounded brushes is which. Ones suppose to be rounded and the other one slanted but they are seriously both so jagged, two stars might be to high.</li>
            <li> The brushes when you first receive then have a horrible smell to do them I honestly considered throwing them away, but I washed them a and have then a try they were pretty good to use after leaves face even and no streaks</li>
            <li> These had a strong chemical like smell. I opened the package to wash them and two of the brushes came apart as soon as I opened the packaged. The bristles are somewhat rough too. The only good thing was the shipping was fast but these brushes are not good.</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever, but the brushes are great quality and very comparable to Sigma. Just give them a good wash prior to using, because they do have a plastic/chemically smell.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE MAKEUP BRUSHES!</li>
            <li> These were REALLY nice! I was expecting something absolutely awful and I was really surprised of the quality. They are big and the brush is soft. You can tell synthetic but I don&#x27;t mind. Took about a week and a half to get here which wasn&#x27;t bad! YAY&lt;br /&gt;Def recommend.</li>
            <li> Good cuality !!! I realy like</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the price</li>
            <li> Loved it have the quality of the Mac ones great great 😃😃</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise! I was concerned because they are synthetic but these are exquisite! They feel expensive!</li>
            <li> These were not what I was expecting they are hard and takes most the makeup off</li>
            <li> For the price, these makeup brushes are amazing super soft and fluffy and make application flawless</li>
            <li> 4 star is because it doesn&#x27;t have the Kabuki label on the brush</li>
            <li> Such a great deal for all the brushes! I&#x27;m pretty cheap when it comes to replacing brushes, but these definitely do the trick. They hold up well and are great for foundation. My makeup applies evenly and they are easy enough brushes to clean regularly.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft and when u use for foundation they do not cake up at all and they give like an airbrush finish</li>
            <li> Just got my brushes very early. They are amazing. They are so soft and dense and great. My money worth spending.</li>
            <li> NOT NAME BRAND BRUSHES...BUT.... THEY DO THE JOB. THEY ARE GOOD TRAVELING SIZE BRUSHES AND GOOD QUALITY!!&lt;br /&gt;2 THUMBS UP!!! :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and it doesnt shed plus these are perfect for people who are looking for good quality brushes for a low price</li>
            <li> I used them daily and are like the highend ones.</li>
            <li> Nice thick brushes and easy to handle. I have to agree with others. They had a strong chemical smell right out of the package.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really soft I love them. It perfect for blending you foundations to perfection. If you use them correctly you can get the &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look. The shipping was pretty lengthy but is worth the wait</li>
            <li> The brushes evenly distribute make up and they are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> So I received these right in time and I love them!!! The bristles are soft so it&#x27;s easy to put the makeup on.... blending has never been better... these might be just as good as sephora.. if not better... will recommend to everyone..</li>
            <li> the softest brushes ever!! I love them so much!!</li>
            <li> I would like to say these brushes are simply amazin!!</li>
            <li> Extremely high quality, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Cheap and they do the job. They are a pain to clean vs other brands I&#x27;ve bought. After first wash the head was comming off the rod,  but it is still holding on. The brush itself is kinda small compared to other ones. Overall it works and you get 4 of them which is nice if you lose one or forget to wash one.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes I&#x27;ve had them for a year &amp; there still as good as when they first arrived, no shedding which is a big plus for the price! But one thing is that they don&#x27;t stay on to the wooden stick for too long so you&#x27;ll have to glue them back on I&#x27;ve only had to glue them once besides that they&#x27;re great &amp; soft (:</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t shed, and have washed it multiple times now. I love how they blend my foundation. They&#x27;re not too big nor small for my face.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes they are so soft and help make my makeup look flawless.</li>
            <li> For easy application, you really have to go with something at least as good as this set!</li>
            <li> it gets the job done. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
