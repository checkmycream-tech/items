            <li>If you&#x27;re on a stage or something like that, then you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this concealer.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Love this concealer.</li>
            <li>It is TOO light for my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Indian, but I have very light skin, and the tan shade was too light even for me (although it&#x27;s fine in a pinch if I have it on over BB cream or foundation).</li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing, better than MAC&#x27;s concealer and much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>Perfect to cover my very dark tattoo.</li>
            <li>because i don&#x27;t like my undereye to look a bit light Than the rest of my face , otherwise is a great product and covers enough</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light skin girl</li>
            <li>so I thought medium would work, but it ended up being way too light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way too light</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way too light and the consistency is greasy and it creases within seconds.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a great job with coverage</li>
            <li>still too light and my tattoo still showed through some.</li>
            <li>It was too light in comparison to the rest of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY AMAZAZING !!!</li>
            <li>It matches my skin perfectly which is hard to find sometimes because I tan and a lot of makeup just looks orange.  </li>
            <li>amazing coverage, only thing I don&#x27;t like is the way it smells.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews said the tan is orangish, but it always seems golden on me.</li>
            <li>I have two in my makeup drawer right now.</li>
            <li>I bought the light (was too light) and the tan (I&#x27;m mixed skin).</li>
            <li>I read about Hard Candy concealer and HAD to try it from the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>so when it was finally time to reorder I wanted to try something more affordable.</li>
            <li>IM PRETTY TAN</li>
            <li>I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE !!!</li>
            <li>applied the pencil first</li>
            <li>, it was pretty orange, but I really should have opted for a lighter shade so that isn&#x27;t why I gave it four stars, just</li>
            <li>I love it and it lasts for a very long time ..</li>
            <li>So much so, that unless you wear your make-up as a mask, you will not use this.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the color</li>
            <li>I have a very noticeable tattoo on my hand that needed to be covered up.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t set it with a powder I look very shiny if using it on my face.</li>
            <li>Very runny.</li>
            <li>This concealer is too light, this second one is too watery, couldn&#x27;t even stick in the skin.</li>
            <li>this is way to think for older skin.  </li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m going to mess around with some more powder setting, because the amount of saturation was encouraging.</li>
            <li>I tiny bit goes a long way and the quality is much better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>MY NEW JOB...</li>
            <li>I let it air dry and applied just a dab more, let it dry and applied set-in powder.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super light so on the other hand it can&#x27;t cover up the one dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li>When you put it on you have to rush and blot it and blend it with your foundation before it dries because when it does it&#x27;s like a 2 day old pedicure- set in its ways</li>
            <li>concealer is super thick and was able to completely cover a black tattoo (which was first coated in several layers of red lipstick, a trick I&#x27;d learned from a youtube video) but it didn&#x27;t set well.</li>
            <li>(As long as you don&#x27;t buy it from here) can get a bit cakey if used too much.</li>
            <li>i Feel is just a little big light for me , but</li>
            <li>I love that the little pencil can cover up the most impossible blemishes.  </li>
            <li>The color rubbed off and the red was exposed not long after applying.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s super thick, so be careful.</li>
            <li> It really is rock hard</li>
            <li> I buy it, unfortunately at Walmart, because that&#x27;s the only place I could find it, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Will last a while a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very tan</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t cover at all, and my tattoo is extremely faded as I&#x27;m in the process of laser removal.</li>
            <li> AT ALL LIKE ALL THE OTHER CONCEALERS</li>
            <li> But the average person?</li>
            <li> So imagine how it feels when you&#x27;re trying to cover your dark</li>
            <li> I have been using the same tube for at least 6 months</li>
            <li> have medium-tan skin, but when I went to Wal-Mart and saw the &amp;#34;Tan&amp;#34; version of this product I thought it looked TOO dark in the box.</li>
            <li> I wish the seller would refund me because this product does not work at all to cover my post acne dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary black circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> BLACK, TEAL,</li>
            <li> have a faded black tattoo on my body that I am dying to try and cover up without laser.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad dark circles, like I never go out without makeup on dark circles, and I have always struggled to find a concealer that covers them up without making me look like a clown.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on this..</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, so a little goes a long way, but it covers my circles so well.</li>
            <li> I may as well have been applying pale foundation to my tattoo.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all, waste of money and time, my makeup foundation can do a better job, I was disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these only come in two shades, and they seemed to be oriented toward lighter Caucasian skin tones.</li>
            <li> When they say its heavy duty, they really mean it.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want for everyone to know what I use, but couldn&#x27;t help myself after reading ridiculous negative reviews on this product!</li>
            <li> of a secret though</li>
            <li> I blend it in and apply it in thin blended layers.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money!!!!</li>
            <li> It is the only concealer I have ever had that can hide even the worst bight marks on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work well at all</li>
            <li> but i think i pick the wrong Shade for me</li>
            <li> Needless to say, disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is difficult to remove and annoying to the max.</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed, and you&#x27;ll have some money in your pocket.</li>
            <li> iM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND RETURNING</li>
            <li> Worst purchase from amazon until now!&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best concealer I have tried and great price! Will last a while a small amount goes a long way. Love!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like industrial coverage.  When they say its heavy duty, they really mean it.  So much so, that unless you wear your make-up as a mask, you will not use this.  If you&#x27;re on a stage or something like that, then you&#x27;ll love this.  But the average person? I think not.</li>
            <li> The. Worst purchase from amazon until now!&lt;br /&gt;The pacaking seemed to be already opened, the pencil that comes with the concealer was not in its proper cap and was smudged everywhere,the actual concealer was like melted and in a darker tone than spected.</li>
            <li> amazing coverage, only thing I don&#x27;t like is the way it smells. But this is the best concealer EVER!</li>
            <li> I bought this from an ad in a magazine that waxed on about how great it is!  I have used it for awhile now and NO.  It does not add any brightness, may work for sun spots but NOT FOR THE EYES with coverage.  Needless to say, disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this concealer.  It is the only concealer I have ever had that can hide even the worst bight marks on my neck.  It matches my skin perfectly which is hard to find sometimes because I tan and a lot of makeup just looks orange.  This stuff covers every imperfection perfectly.  I love that the little pencil can cover up the most impossible blemishes.  I can&#x27;t live without it I have two in my makeup drawer right now.</li>
            <li> Not everything is for everyone. I&#x27;m a light skin girl so I go for the darker shades when it comes to concealers. I purchased the &amp;#34;Deep&amp;#34; shade and it&#x27;s super light so on the other hand it can&#x27;t cover up the one dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> The best product ever!&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a secret though ;) Didn&#x27;t want for everyone to know what I use, but couldn&#x27;t help myself after reading ridiculous negative reviews on this product! This works like a wonder! Best quality &amp; coverage concealer EVER! No joke!</li>
            <li> Does not do as directed. Guess you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> Does not work at all, waste of money and time, my makeup foundation can do a better job, I was disappointed!!</li>
            <li> this is is great. however the price is too steep. after ordering and receiving this item. i found out that it goes for about $6 and the sell it at walmart. whenever i run out thats where i&#x27;ll be going</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the color, it was pretty orange, but I really should have opted for a lighter shade so that isn&#x27;t why I gave it four stars, just fyi.&lt;br /&gt;This concealer is super thick and was able to completely cover a black tattoo (which was first coated in several layers of red lipstick, a trick I&#x27;d learned from a youtube video) but it didn&#x27;t set well. The color rubbed off and the red was exposed not long after applying. I&amp;#34;m going to mess around with some more powder setting, because the amount of saturation was encouraging.</li>
            <li> I bought this in medium and tan from Walmart. I have a very noticeable tattoo on my hand that needed to be covered up. I&#x27;m not very tan so I thought medium would work, but it ended up being way too light. The tan actually matches my skin color and covers up the tattoo, but it rubs off onto everything. A lot of reviews said the tan is orangish, but it always seems golden on me. It can be quite greasy, but might be the moisturizer I use. If I don&#x27;t set it with a powder I look very shiny if using it on my face.</li>
            <li> this is way to think for older skin.  but I finally found that when I mix it with a moisturizer it thins out enough for me to apply.  Other than that - it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work well at all and it rubs off on everything!</li>
            <li> I was using Kat Von D&#x27;s version which is a lot more expensive so when it was finally time to reorder I wanted to try something more affordable. Just get the Kat Von D. I tiny bit goes a long way and the quality is much better. This didn&#x27;t cover at all, and my tattoo is extremely faded as I&#x27;m in the process of laser removal. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not glide on smoothly. It really is rock hard so it pulls your skin. So imagine how it feels when you&#x27;re trying to cover your dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;It has a smell that isn&#x27;t pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It does not blend well. When you put it on you have to rush and blot it and blend it with your foundation before it dries because when it does it&#x27;s like a 2 day old pedicure- set in its ways&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is difficult to remove and annoying to the max.It has been used once and forgotten since.</li>
            <li> I think is a good product but i think i pick the wrong Shade for me i Feel is just a little big light for me , but because i don&#x27;t like my undereye to look a bit light Than the rest of my face , otherwise is a great product and covers enough</li>
            <li> Love love love. Have had since Christmas and still going strong! The coverage is great! I have hereditary black circles under my eyes. And I do have to touch this up a time or two every day. But when I put it on, I look well rested.</li>
            <li> This says tan color but it&#x27;s way too light</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m used to paying a fortune for a good concealer. Always thought it was worth it, until i purchased this after i seen all the great reviews, it works better than anything i ever used! A little goes a long way though, it&#x27;s super thick, so be careful. I recommend this for anyone who needs a lot of coverage. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed, and you&#x27;ll have some money in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Only 6 dollars at Walmart.  Good coverage, good price. (As long as you don&#x27;t buy it from here) can get a bit cakey if used too much. Use with a good moisturizer, I use it with my Mary Kay&#x27;s moisturizer and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Best concealer ever!!!</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be the &amp;#34;darkest&amp;#34; color they come in but it&#x27;s way too light and the consistency is greasy and it creases within seconds.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZAZING !!! I BOUGHT THIS TO COVER UP MY KNUCKLE TATS FR MY NEW JOB... THEY&#x27;RE BLACK, TEAL, N ORANGE... N ITS FREAKY HOW U CANT EVEN TELL THEY ARE THERE. IM PRETTY TAN TOO N THIS MATCHED PERFECTLY... NOT ORANGE AT ALL LIKE ALL THE OTHER CONCEALERS I SEEM TO FIND. N I ACTUALLY GOT THIS AT WAL-MART FR $6.&lt;br /&gt;YAYA.&lt;br /&gt; I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE !!!&lt;br /&gt;;D</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad dark circles, like I never go out without makeup on dark circles, and I have always struggled to find a concealer that covers them up without making me look like a clown. This stuff is amazing. I buy it, unfortunately at Walmart, because that&#x27;s the only place I could find it, but it&#x27;s worth it. It is very thick, so a little goes a long way, but it covers my circles so well. I blend it in and apply it in thin blended layers. It does tend to crease if you have oily skin, so I recommend a finishing powder, which I use on my lower lash line to keep it from creasing. I have been using the same tube for at least 6 months and I still have plenty to go! I love that it is so cheap, cruelty free and covers my circles!!!! YAY!!</li>
            <li> I loooove this product! The coverage is amazing, better than MAC&#x27;s concealer and much cheaper too. I use this underneath my eyes to cover my bags. Not only does it do a great job with coverage, it brightens my eyes so well, no one will ever know my sleeping habits are getting the best of me! :)</li>
            <li> This is the NUMBER 1 Concealer I have ever owned.. I love it and it lasts for a very long time .. It cover my hickies Tattoos etc</li>
            <li> Did not cover tattoos at all. Very runny. I would say don&#x27;t bother buying. I use sephoras foundation spray and it works great!</li>
            <li> I ordered TAN... and what do i recieve LITE?!?! THE PACKAGE LITERALLY SAID TAN ON IT BUT WHEN I OPENED IT. IT WAS LITE...iM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND RETURNING</li>
            <li> Perfect to cover my very dark tattoo. Covered up with two layers.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer. Came brand new in perfect packaging. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I have a faded black tattoo on my body that I am dying to try and cover up without laser. I read about Hard Candy concealer and HAD to try it from the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-tan skin, but when I went to Wal-Mart and saw the &amp;#34;Tan&amp;#34; version of this product I thought it looked TOO dark in the box. I decided to buy it anyway. What have I got to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the pencil first, then a layer of the concealer. It is TOO light for my skin! I may as well have been applying pale foundation to my tattoo. I patted and swirled it over my tattoo and blended it against my skin..still too light and my tattoo still showed through some. I let it air dry and applied just a dab more, let it dry and applied set-in powder. It looked like I had a big patch of vitiligo on the skin where my tattoo was. It was too light in comparison to the rest of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wasted money on this..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these only come in two shades, and they seemed to be oriented toward lighter Caucasian skin tones. I&#x27;m Indian, but I have very light skin, and the tan shade was too light even for me (although it&#x27;s fine in a pinch if I have it on over BB cream or foundation). Beware if you have a tan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of makeup products and I must say that this is the best concealer that I&#x27;ve ever used!! Every girl needs this in her makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I bought the light (was too light) and the tan (I&#x27;m mixed skin). This concealer is too light, this second one is too watery, couldn&#x27;t even stick in the skin. If you have a tan or Italian/Mediterranean complexion please don&#x27;t buy this concealer</li>
            <li> I wish the seller would refund me because this product does not work at all to cover my post acne dark spots. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money!!!!</li>
