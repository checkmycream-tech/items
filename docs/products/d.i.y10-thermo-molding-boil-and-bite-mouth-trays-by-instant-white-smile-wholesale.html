            <li>Again, I had a perfect tray.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully on me.</li>
            <li>But I cant complain because they price was great for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>great deal and quality</li>
            <li>Good luck with that.  </li>
            <li>I just went to my dentist and got a perfect fit for my whitener.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, to get perfect trays the first time</li>

            <li>These worked great for me, and I got a good set of trays the first try.</li>
            <li>GOOD FOR THE PRICE MADE FROM CHEAP MATERIAL</li>
            <li>these are okay for the price you pay</li>
            <li>ordered this set to give it another shot, and got a good set of trays on the first try.</li>
            <li>These are cheap...</li>
            <li>but cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>I filled a glass measuring cup with water, and put it into the microwave for about 1 1/2 minutes until it was boiling.</li>
            <li>Its better to pay more and get the real stuff</li>
            <li>and I sort of flubbed my top tray because it got too hot</li>
            <li>In the package, I felt these were great quality because they&#x27;re nice and thick</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I was glad you go so many because if you messed up one you have extra to work with.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been busy and truthfully don&#x27;t care about my teeth</li>
            <li>I ordered the Smile Sciences kit</li>
            <li>I will never purchase generic trays again, spend the extra money and buy good ones!</li>
            <li>down it did not mold in a good way it did not set well on teeth for me and my family</li>
            <li>The product gets hot but not as soft for really strong teeth indentations.</li>
            <li>That should have been my first tip off.</li>
            <li>Mold to your mouth and teeth after soaking 5 seconds in the hot close to boiling water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how people were successful with these because I know we were doing it correctly</li>
            <li>This set looked pretty deformed.</li>
            <li>Luckily you&#x27;ll have 4 more tries to get it</li>
            <li>Too hard to get a good mold using hot boiling water.  </li>
            <li>Once you have a good fit, the instructions recommend trimming the tray down with nail clippers or sharp scissors.  </li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t really mold to my teeth</li>
            <li>all that much being sparkly</li>
            <li>Dont mold to your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>these for manythings sports molds for crafts and for us we did not like was a very cheap&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li>Make sure you do not leave them in the hot water longer than a few seconds because they will shrink and you cant use them.</li>
            <li>Tap excess water off and place mouthpiece in mouth and bite down to create a suction onto your teeth for a right fit.  </li>
            <li>My sister and I tried each mold and neither of us came out with a decent one.</li>
            <li>On my third try, I got a reasonable tray mold and didn&#x27;t trim too much off.  </li>
            <li>Then I held the first tray into the boiling water for 6-8 seconds until it was just starting to soften.</li>
            <li>I am just super careful not to get the whitening stuff on my gums!</li>
            <li>I follow instructions clearly and tried them in 3 pairs</li>
            <li>I recommend trying to fit it a few times after warming in order to get the indention of your teeth into the mold.  </li>
            <li>I believe these are a bit too &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; to really get a proper mold</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally looking into getting a professionally made mold once and just use online bought tooth gel to whiten myself at home.</li>
            <li>, do one at a time, don&#x27;t leave them in the hot water too long, don&#x27;t shake off excess water (let it run off), and suck in your cheeks to pull the forms close to your teeth.</li>
            <li>They old molded to the bottom on my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can get a decent upper mold though -</li>
            <li>I think the problems happen when the trays are left too long in the hot water.</li>

            <li>Did not get soft enough to mold</li>
            <li>You must follow the directions exactly when boiling these down</li>
            <li>I use this product to protect my teeth when I use whitening products, took a few tries to get them to mold to fit my teeth</li>

            <li> Awful!!! Waste of time and money! I used 4 of the 10 trays trying to get them to mold properly and they just wouldn&#x27;t! I will never purchase generic trays again, spend the extra money and buy good ones!</li>
            <li> I use this product to protect my teeth when I use whitening products, took a few tries to get them to mold to fit my teeth but they work as advertised.</li>
            <li> For some reason I could not mold them to my teeth. They were to hard the material and it hurt. I follow instructions clearly and tried them in 3 pairs but they did not work.</li>
            <li> these are okay for the price you pay but they didn&#x27;t really mold to my teeth well! But I cant complain because they price was great for the amount you get. Make sure you do not leave them in the hot water longer than a few seconds because they will shrink and you cant use them. That&#x27;s why I was glad you go so many because if you messed up one you have extra to work with.</li>
            <li> I bought this a long time back, before a lot of reviews were on here. I just now got around to using them (I&#x27;ve been busy and truthfully don&#x27;t care about my teeth all that much being sparkly white)&lt;br /&gt;Now that I see all the other reviews I grudgingly tried to use these. I have had some in the past that worked well enough. These however, do not work at all. The thin line between completely melted and unmoldable is pretty faint. If you do happen to find it, you will realize they do not &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; to your teeth.. they just simple give them a one armed hug like you do with an acquaintance you aren&#x27;t terribly fond of (the overly huggy kind). The material is bulky, you could trim down the extra (the part you normally shouldn&#x27;t have too because its a mouth tray.. not a mouth veneer.) Even with modification it is just unusable. Save your money. These are cheap... but cheap for a reason. 10 for 7$? That should have been my first tip off.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully on me. Made in the USA the best.</li>
            <li> Mold to your mouth and teeth after soaking 5 seconds in the hot close to boiling water</li>
            <li> Dont mold to your teeth very well. Its better to pay more and get the real stuff</li>
            <li> This is too hard to mold to your gums... completely useless.  10 tries and I couldn&#x27;t even get one to form correctly, avoid at all costs!</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  They do not mold correctly, leaving gaps.  The whole package was a waste.  Unfortunately, by the time I got around to using them the return period had expired.</li>
            <li> You must follow the directions exactly when boiling these down or you are just going to get an unusable piece of rubber/plastic. Luckily you&#x27;ll have 4 more tries to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I recommend trying to fit it a few times after warming in order to get the indention of your teeth into the mold.  Once you have a good fit, the instructions recommend trimming the tray down with nail clippers or sharp scissors.  Good luck with that.  The plastic is tough to cut and thick, so you might leave an uncomfortable jagged edge on the side close to the gumline.  On my third try, I got a reasonable tray mold and didn&#x27;t trim too much off.  I am just super careful not to get the whitening stuff on my gums!</li>
            <li> I thought these worked great for my family!  We used them to put whitening gel in to get our teeth whiter for the summer!!  Boil a small pot of water, remove pot from stove.  Place 1 mouth piece in water for about 6 seconds.  Tap excess water off and place mouthpiece in mouth and bite down to create a suction onto your teeth for a right fit.  Repeat steps! The steps provide in the package are easier to understand than my instructions!  But my kids and I had no complaints!</li>
            <li> Too hard to get a good mold using hot boiling water.  Now I know why there are eight to a pack! I just went to my dentist and got a perfect fit for my whitener.</li>
            <li> Should be no star at all. Poor quality. does not work at all.</li>
            <li> This WILL NOT mold onto your teeth as it claims to do. The mold that came with my teeth whitening kit was great!  This was a completely different material and experience. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> not for those with smaller mouth.  makes me gag.</li>
            <li> great deal and quality</li>
            <li> I ordered the Smile Sciences kit and I sort of flubbed my top tray because it got too hot so I decided to order these. My sister and I tried each mold and neither of us came out with a decent one. I&#x27;m not sure how people were successful with these because I know we were doing it correctly and we failed miserably. In the package, I felt these were great quality because they&#x27;re nice and thick but I think that ultimately was their downfall. I could hardly get my teeth to show up on these things. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these. Save your $6 and try somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Near impossible to get a lower teeth impression regardless of technique of sucking down/submerging the molds in the no-longer-boiling water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can get a decent upper mold though - I believe these are a bit too &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; to really get a proper mold from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally looking into getting a professionally made mold once and just use online bought tooth gel to whiten myself at home.</li>
            <li> Arrived i followed instructions heated in the water and each time after heated and went to&lt;br /&gt;bite down it did not mold in a good way it did not set well on teeth for me and my family we&lt;br /&gt;use these for manythings sports molds for crafts and for us we did not like was a very cheap&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> They don&#x60;t fit well in the teeth although you heat it because the staff is very tough. If you use them you&#x60;ll waste too much teeth whitening gel.</li>
            <li> I was not prepared for the sensitivity of my gums. I had to stop using this because of the pain to my teeth.It is very hard not to get this stuff on your gums and once it gets on your gums OMG! I think it may work for others but not for me.Buy at your own risk. I will be purchasing crest white strips ASAP!</li>
            <li> Bought these hoping to save a few dollars. Wound up wasting a few dollars. I followed the instructions to a &#x27;T&#x27; and still these wouldn&#x27;t mold properly. The material is very thick. It wound up jabbing into my gums and wouldn&#x27;t mold as they were supposed to. Went through 5 of the trays following the instructions before I gave up. None of the trays I tried molded as they should have.</li>
            <li> These worked great for me, and I got a good set of trays the first try. I initially bought the Shine Whitening with Zero Peroxide that came with a set of trays. I had never tried whitening my teeth before, and the directions that came with the kit were not very good. This set looked pretty deformed. Once the plastic got stuck together, there was no getting it apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this set to give it another shot, and got a good set of trays on the first try. I filled a glass measuring cup with water, and put it into the microwave for about 1 1/2 minutes until it was boiling. Then I held the first tray into the boiling water for 6-8 seconds until it was just starting to soften. I let the excess water run off of it and put into my mouth on the bottom teeth being careful that it went over the teeth. Then I sucked in my cheeks with my mouth closed. This pulled the tray up to my teeth. Then I used my fingers to make sure that the tray was formed to my teeth, took it out of my mouth, and rinsed it with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the same thing with the second tray without re-boiling the water, and put it on my upper teeth following the same procedure. Again, I had a perfect tray. I think the problems happen when the trays are left too long in the hot water. This will make them too soft and limp. If you try to shake off the excess water, the soft plastic will stick together and you will never get it apart - especially if you got it too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, to get perfect trays the first time, do one at a time, don&#x27;t leave them in the hot water too long, don&#x27;t shake off excess water (let it run off), and suck in your cheeks to pull the forms close to your teeth.</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR THE PRICE MADE FROM CHEAP MATERIAL</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone trying to whiten their teeth using a gel. The trays do not form to your teeth, they were uncomfortable, and did not allow for the gel to stay on my teeth for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> attention was excellent and responsible</li>
            <li> This is way too thick. I can&#x27;t close my mouth properly.</li>
            <li> Did not get soft enough to mold</li>
            <li> The polymer doesnt maintain its temperture well through molding procedure. The product gets hot but not as soft for really strong teeth indentations.</li>
            <li> The molds do not mold to the front teeth at all. They old molded to the bottom on my teeth. Which doesn&#x27;t help when your using the trays for whitening gel.</li>
