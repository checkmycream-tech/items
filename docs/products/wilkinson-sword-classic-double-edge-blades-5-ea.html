            <li>Best of luck to you!</li>
            <li>These Blades are the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my razor.  </li>
            <li>There is a perfect blade and razor combo for every face that is going to vary based on skin and beard type.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re an excellent quality 6/10 sharpness</li>
            <li>mine, so happy shaving!</li>
            <li>and we are extremely happy!</li>
            <li>Shipped on time and great product</li>
            <li>Great blades.</li>
            <li>a very good, close and comfortable shave-eh!!</li>
            <li>I chose to try these blades after reading a lot of good things about them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these DE blades!</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;ll sacrifice the best shave I can get for a blade that I can change out once a week and still get a great shave with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are very good blades for a reasonable amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I just couldn&#x27;t get a good comfortable shave with them.</li>
            <li>good smooth shave</li>
            <li>These give a good close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>These pull and tug as I shave, a good indication that the blade is too mild.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I was more manly and had tougher skin, it would be ok, but just not for me.</li>
            <li>These are the best double edge razor blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My new fav for sure!!</li>
            <li>Works great but will last longer if you clean after shaving and coat the edges with any kind of oil &amp;#34;mineral, olive,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, about the blade, this is a very mild edged blade.</li>
            <li>And other blades start out giving me great shaves, but they peter out quickly, leaving me with 3-4 good shaves before I have to change blades.</li>
            <li>Matter of fact, this is a fine blade.</li>
            <li>That aside, they are friendly and easy to shave with.</li>
            <li>In spite of the immediate discomfort, they leave me with smooth, irritation-free shaves, hence I don&#x27;t mind continuing to test them.</li>
            <li>so enjoy them</li>
            <li>These Wilkinson double edged razor blades are just great.</li>
            <li>Sharp, smooth shave, and great blade  longevity.  </li>
            <li>Many people really like them</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about these blades.</li>
            <li>Great value and extremely sharp.</li>
            <li>and the like are just too mild for me.</li>
            <li>The experience I get from these are very consistent from blade to blade.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the first shave with a feather blade, but after that I get snags and discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to shaving with a safety razor and these are more forgiving than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t want his first introduction to safety razor shaving to be one of those &amp;#34;starter kits&amp;#34; with subpar products!)</li>
            <li>Went back to the Wilkinson with my new razor and got a great shave.</li>
            <li>I get a great shave with little to no nicks</li>
            <li>Even if the first round isn&#x27;t great, give it a solid week, or 4-7 shaves, to really evaluate the blade fairly.</li>
            <li>These blades are okay but don&#x27;t seem to give a high quality shave or last more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Have tried numerous double edge blades and so far Wilkinson  are the best.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality , I using for long time</li>
            <li>Not sharp, Good for beginners or if you have softer facial hair.</li>
            <li>The price of the 2 &amp; 3 blade razor were getting ridiculously expensive and after some research, found that more blades does not mean the razor is more effective.</li>
            <li>I love these and think they last a 2-3 shaves longer than the Shark blades.</li>
            <li>I give them 5 stars because they&#x27;re of consistent manufacture.</li>
            <li>Have been shaving for more than 50 years, double edge, cartridges, etc.  </li>
            <li>Same quality as the ones I used to be able to find in the store.</li>
            <li>I have a small travel razor that these aren&#x27;t that great in, but my old Gillette I use every day seems like it was made for these.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend as part of a very selective men&#x27;s grooming gift basket from Yours Truly.</li>
            <li>Your first shave might be atrocious, but I&#x27;ve found with some blades that once the first shave or two passes, I get the best shaves I could ask for.</li>
            <li>These blades hold their edge and sharpness much longer than feather.  </li>
            <li>Other blades I find I can use for two weeks of daily shaves with good results, which I would not have known if I never evaluated the deterioration of the edge over time.</li>
            <li>I can always tell significant different when I shave the 4th or even 5th time without flipping the blade over.</li>
            <li>I have used other blades and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Feather razors for the past few years but these Wilkinson blades were recommended to me and they are great!!</li>
            <li>These blades last much longer, I can get at least 5 great shaves without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that you need to tailor you blade decision to your particular razor.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll highly recommend them to any and all that ask.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Sharp smooth cut throughout.  </li>
            <li>smooth shave works well with several different razors</li>
            <li>I turned back in time to the 1970&#x27;s when I first used this type of razor.</li>
            <li>Sharp enough to give a great shaving with very little to no irritation.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try using an old fashioned razor again.  </li>
            <li>The shave not as good as the expensive ones purchased today.</li>
            <li>They are exactly the way as a majority of people described: Above average sharpness, and does not tug on my boyfriend&#x27;s coarse facial hair (probably because of the special coating on these blades).</li>
            <li>With the preface that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and I&#x27;m fairly new to the DE shaving world (just got my first DE razor for Christmas, but have been wet shaving with cartridge razors for 10 years)</li>
            <li>They start sharp and stay sharp for a good while, unlike the Feathers that are very (too) sharp and then dull faster.</li>
            <li>First two Wilkinson blades each lasted over three weeks on my fairly heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>just a tip, when trying out a new blade, before passing final judgement, give it a solid week of shaves with a single blade.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to using a safety razor, please forget other inferior blades.</li>

            <li> Their coating makes them glide effortlessly, and they&#x27;re plenty sharp for my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> They last me about 5/6 shaves which is about a week and half for me.</li>
            <li> And I can use the blade for a week of daily shaves and see little or no change in the performance of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After testing out a few different brands of DE razors,  I have decided to jump on the feather bandwagon.  </li>

            <li> I have been using a double edge razor for a few months with Wilkinson blades.</li>
            <li> Much too aggressive a blade and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I should note that I have thick and coarse beard growth.</li>
            <li> , I felt these were maybe a little too sharp for my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy, stiff, or thick beard, use feather blades.</li>
            <li> If you find that Feather are too harsh, try a medium blade, like Astra SP, and if that&#x27;s also hard on you, give these a whirl.</li>
            <li> Other blades I&#x27;ve tried occasionally throw a bad blade in.</li>
            <li> dull, dull, dull.  </li>
            <li> They were too hard on my face compared to Astra SP blades.  </li>
            <li> Of all of the razor blades I have tried, this is by far the worst for me.</li>
            <li> These would rank a 2-3/10.</li>
            <li> terrible to shave with.  </li>

Left me with lots of nicks and cuts every time. Only after using the same blade for 4-5 shaves does it get dull enough that it doesn&#x27;t cut me, but then the shave is kind of poor... Maybe if I was more manly and had tougher skin, it would be ok, but just not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with feather blades for now..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Feather razors for the past few years but these Wilkinson blades were recommended to me and they are great!! They start sharp and stay sharp for a good while, unlike the Feathers that are very (too) sharp and then dull faster. I get a great shave with little to no nicks and I can shave against the grain if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new fav for sure!!</li>
            <li> Of all of the razor blades I have tried, this is by far the worst for me. Many people really like them but I just couldn&#x27;t get a good comfortable shave with them.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as part of a very selective men&#x27;s grooming gift basket from Yours Truly. (I didn&#x27;t want his first introduction to safety razor shaving to be one of those &amp;#34;starter kits&amp;#34; with subpar products!) After reading about all of the different blades and their reviews, I ordered these. They are exactly the way as a majority of people described: Above average sharpness, and does not tug on my boyfriend&#x27;s coarse facial hair (probably because of the special coating on these blades). These seem to last for two shaves on each side. Will order in bulk next time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these DE blades! Their coating makes them glide effortlessly, and they&#x27;re plenty sharp for my coarse hair. They last me about 5/6 shaves which is about a week and half for me. I&#x27;m fairly new to shaving with a safety razor and these are more forgiving than others I&#x27;ve tried. I cannot say enough good things about these blades. I will definitely be buying these again, not only that but I&#x27;ll highly recommend them to any and all that ask. Best of luck to you!</li>

            <li> After testing out a few different brands of DE razors,  I have decided to jump on the feather bandwagon.  These razors are close to feather sharpness at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> These Blades are the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try using an old fashioned razor again.  The shave not as good as the expensive ones purchased today.</li>

            <li> Great value and extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> I chose to try these blades after reading a lot of good things about them. These blades do work, I just didn&#x27;t like them. I have also used Derby Extra&#x27;s and Astra&#x27;s and prefer both of those to these blades.</li>
            <li> They were too hard on my face compared to Astra SP blades.  They left my face pretty raw and while they are sharp, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using a double edge razor for a few months with Wilkinson blades. Bought a Parker razor and it came with another brand of blade. Much too aggressive a blade and uncomfortable. Went back to the Wilkinson with my new razor and got a great shave.</li>

            <li> I give them 5 stars because they&#x27;re of consistent manufacture. I&#x27;ve tried these out for a while now, off and on, over the last year. The experience I get from these are very consistent from blade to blade. Other blades I&#x27;ve tried occasionally throw a bad blade in. I haven&#x27;t seen that with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the blade, this is a very mild edged blade. If Feather and Personna Lab are 9.5-10/10 in terms of sharpness, I would rate these somewhere in the neighborhood of Derby. These would rank a 2-3/10. Don&#x27;t be mislead by that, it speaks nothing to the quality of the blade or the shave. Matter of fact, this is a fine blade. There is a perfect blade and razor combo for every face that is going to vary based on skin and beard type. If you find that Feather are too harsh, try a medium blade, like Astra SP, and if that&#x27;s also hard on you, give these a whirl. Conversely, if these are chewing your face up, try out Astra SP. They&#x27;re an excellent quality 6/10 sharpness blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t like these blades for my face. Lord, Derby, and the like are just too mild for me. These pull and tug as I shave, a good indication that the blade is too mild. That aside, they are friendly and easy to shave with. In spite of the immediate discomfort, they leave me with smooth, irritation-free shaves, hence I don&#x27;t mind continuing to test them. And I can use the blade for a week of daily shaves and see little or no change in the performance of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just a tip, when trying out a new blade, before passing final judgement, give it a solid week of shaves with a single blade. Even if the first round isn&#x27;t great, give it a solid week, or 4-7 shaves, to really evaluate the blade fairly. Your first shave might be atrocious, but I&#x27;ve found with some blades that once the first shave or two passes, I get the best shaves I could ask for. Other blades I find I can use for two weeks of daily shaves with good results, which I would not have known if I never evaluated the deterioration of the edge over time. And other blades start out giving me great shaves, but they peter out quickly, leaving me with 3-4 good shaves before I have to change blades. Personally, I&#x27;ll sacrifice the best shave I can get for a blade that I can change out once a week and still get a great shave with. But in the end, it&#x27;s all about what pleases your senses, not mine, so happy shaving!</li>
            <li> recommends these razor blades for the double edge razors. good smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;last a number of shaves so enjoy them</li>
            <li> and go double edge with Wilkinson.  Have been shaving for more than 50 years, double edge, cartridges, etc.  Have tried numerous double edge blades and so far Wilkinson  are the best.  Sharp, smooth shave, and great blade  longevity.  First two Wilkinson blades each lasted over three weeks on my fairly heavy beard.  Sharp smooth cut throughout.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great blades. Sharp enough to give a great shaving with very little to no irritation. I have used other blades and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice quality , I using for long time</li>
            <li> I never have a problem with these blades, they do the job!</li>
            <li> Yo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very good blades for a reasonable amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give a very good, close and comfortable shave-eh!!</li>
            <li> I turned back in time to the 1970&#x27;s when I first used this type of razor. The price of the 2 &amp; 3 blade razor were getting ridiculously expensive and after some research, found that more blades does not mean the razor is more effective. Quite the opposite! So, I found a razor system on Amazon last year for my husband and I and we are extremely happy! Pennies per blade or dollars per blade? You decide...</li>
            <li> smooth shave works well with several different razors</li>
            <li> Same quality as the ones I used to be able to find in the store.</li>
            <li> These Wilkinson double edged razor blades are just great. If you&#x27;re new to using a safety razor, please forget other inferior blades. These give a good close and comfortable shave. Using these I&#x27;ve never had razor burn.</li>
            <li> These blades hold their edge and sharpness much longer than feather.  I enjoy the first shave with a feather blade, but after that I get snags and discomfort.  These blades last much longer, I can get at least 5 great shaves without any irritation.  I should note that I have thick and coarse beard growth.</li>
