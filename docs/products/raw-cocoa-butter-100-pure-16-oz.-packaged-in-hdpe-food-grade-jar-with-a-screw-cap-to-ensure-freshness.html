            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for the price.</li>

            <li>This cocoa butter is excellent quality, and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>it also makes my skin look really nice..</li>
            <li>It smells like cocoa &amp; works nicely.</li>
            <li>Now I have a very nourishing body butter that smells great!</li>
            <li>to warm it up in between my fingers.</li>
            <li>I bought it to make my own skin care products, but I had to taste it when I smelled it.</li>
            <li>I use this to make my own shea &amp; cocoa butter whipped moisturizer.</li>
            <li>used it in my chocolate, chunks which made it crunchy and nice.</li>
            <li>I am a real and happy customer and this product is good.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use; I just take a piece and place on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is also very easy to share</li>
            <li>I was impressed from when I first opened the package and smelled the strong chocolate aroma.</li>
            <li>it can be used for cooking, I have tasted it as well and it has a light, fresh cocoa taste that should be wonderful for making my own healthy chocolate.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter has an amazing smell, and I would love to try to find some additional uses for it.  </li>
            <li>I liked it and i will order more</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, however, and is great for cooking as well as moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It arrived really quickly (almost a week before the estimate) and the butter is really good.</li>
            <li>I will say that the large chunks make great lotion bars all by themselves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i absolutely love this stuff..</li>
            <li>it is truly an amazing skin care product AND a fantastic addition to my vegan chocolate protein &amp;#34;Milkshake&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started on my second batch this year and am very happy with this cocoa butter...</li>
            <li>I also thought that the form it came in (hunks) would be better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff glad i choose this one</li>
            <li>And some of the more adventuresome dessert recipes call for it.  </li>
            <li>I like shea butter better.</li>
            <li>Ok I received this at the appointed time  , and it came as described .</li>
            <li>fabulous!</li>
            <li>It smells great and is very creamy.</li>
            <li>I knew that it was destined to become more than an ingredient in skin</li>
            <li>I love how this product smells and the ease of use.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I chose this product.</li>
            <li>I combined this with some beeswax and essential oils and created a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>, mine did come in a screw top HDPE container, and was in medium sized chunks as the picture indicates.</li>
            <li>this is way better than any store bought cream or oil.</li>
            <li>Although there are many uses for it, I wanted it for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the product, the product comes in a sealable container.</li>
            <li>I love this cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with it, and like that it was in a solid HDPE container.</li>
            <li>has so many ingredients with odd-sounding names</li>
            <li>i really love the product, even tho</li>
            <li>. . . my skin got better and better . . .</li>
            <li>OK, at that time, I was trying to get a mortgageâ€”</li>
            <li>A month or two or more?</li>
            <li>I will never buy lotion again, too many chemicals.</li>
            <li>love this stuff bought to put in home made lotions.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I will be using this for my skincare too :)</li>

            <li>I love the smell and what it does to my face and skin.  </li>
            <li>No safety seal or anything to assure me it is safe to eat.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very familiar with the usage of cocoa butter , it does wonders for your skin  evens out</li>
            <li>good cocoa butter..does not have that much of a coca fragrance,its very mild but seems like a nice product</li>

            <li>I LOVED the first container</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than what I expected and at a great price!</li>
            <li>shipped SUPER fast, my cocoa butter was beautifully chopped, preserved, and aromatic.</li>
            <li>Lovely chocolate smell to this fantastic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the jar, my room filled with the lovely sent of chocolate.</li>
            <li>Fresh, just as it was stated in the description and came on a nice resealable plastic container.</li>
            <li>It has a light chocolate scent which I personally love and it melts easily between your hands.</li>
            <li>It is not always so easy to find food grade cocoa butter.  </li>

            <li>Strong chocolate smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for making soaps, lotions, and just using it in general.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first batch of this in October, and am re purchasing again as it&#x27;s a really nice product.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I received my first order of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Shipping time was fine.  </li>
            <li>I used my cocoa butter and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Smells like a more mild, earthy chocolate scent.</li>
            <li>I will be giving it to a lucky family member who was blessed with better skin so they can enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It was packaged in a huge re-usable plastic container and it came in chunky pieces.</li>
            <li>I used it to make white chocolate (we have a dairy allergy, among others, in the house) and it was honestly the best white chocolate I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Just got this today to make white chocolate and peanut butter cups,  and the quality was great.  </li>
            <li>Bought product a while ago to aid in my dream of making sugar free chocolate chips for a diabetic friend of mine.</li>
            <li>and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and very creamy.  </li>
            <li>good quality as far as I can tell, though I&#x27;m no expert.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled the wonderful chocolatey smell and have already had it straight and then melted it with equal parts coconut oil and raw cocoa powder to produce a perfect bitter-sweet chocolate (my first!)</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to add to my soaps, but I just used it to make some chocolate</li>
            <li>Smells like rich chocolate.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li>Good price, great product, very hard to find.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter melted smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li>it came in a twist top container sealed in a large Ziploc bag.can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I TRUSTED Plant Guru to do the right thing!</li>
            <li>The customer is always right, and if you donâ€™t buy them apples, then just use your noggin!</li>
            <li>the same it smells so good</li>
            <li>This was a full pound (I weighed it after it showed up),</li>
            <li>Sweet smell and works well.</li>
            <li>If you are going to go by jar size and just pack it full, then sell it by volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mixed this in my homemade leave in conditioner, it works good with my Shea butter mixture.</li>
            <li>cooktop, then let it cool for a bit.</li>
            <li>I would just open the lid, take a whiff, and know that life was good.</li>
            <li>(Sure, like that was ever going to happenâ€”what I really wanted was lots of chocolate on hand.)</li>
            <li>Returned to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and was packaged very well, I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It melted down beautifully with coconut oil and peppermint oil for an eczema treatment and with mango butter for a lip treatment.</li>
            <li>I am a very loyal, VERY long-term Amazon customer (I may be the very first Amazon customer!).</li>
            <li>Tastes very good, but the reason I left off 1 star is because the fragrance is not as strong as an earlier purchase of cocoa discs.</li>
            <li>Claiming that it is in a food grade plastic jar does not mean that it is safe to eat.  </li>
            <li>Raw, Pure, Sensational !!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and easy storage.</li>
            <li>The application was very, creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I had a whim to make my own white chocolate.</li>
            <li>The sealable container helps keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast, the cocoa butter smelled good, but it only weighed 15.6 oz</li>
            <li>This is the kind of cocoa butter my aunts would send to my mother when I was growing up, not like this commercial, diluted cocoa butters you see in some of the beauty supplies and drug stores.  </li>
            <li>and I also just rubbed it into my skin, unadulterated, so that I smelled like a huge hunk of chocolate and wanted to eat myself alive.</li>
            <li>Using to make my own body creams with essential oils.</li>
            <li>nice to only use one thing on your skin</li>
            <li>Already went back to Whole Foods for the good stuff and made my chocolate.</li>
            <li>nowhere, miles down on a dirt road, snowed in for days--I tried to whip up some chocolate treats, but I was not so successful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to as this is the first cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but the smell is intoxicating and strong, and it seems very high quality to me.</li>
            <li>It is rich, pure and fresh.</li>
            <li>(OK, maybe some people go to extremes for a free container of raw cocoa, but most people have neither the time nor the inclination.)</li>
            <li>it has a smooth buttery flavor sugar free that I like it seems natural I would say it taste pure</li>
            <li>From the first time I opened it, the scent alone was intoxicating, like pure sweet chocolate.</li>
            <li>I have yet to make my homemade body butter, but am looking forward to doing so and certainly would purchase this product again!</li>
            <li>love it all by itself your skin really drinks it up and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>No other oil used for oil pulling has ever left me with that pleasant taste before.</li>
            <li>It smells divine, melts down really well (to make body butter) and is pretty much an all around great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>And I wasnâ€™t particularly concerned because Amazon has such amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>(cuz I&#x27;m cheep ;-)</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this brand!!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>First time review ..had to speak up about this product..</li>
            <li>Great product - won&#x27;t last long in this kitchen.</li>
            <li>My next order wil definitely be for three pounds or more for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>better than any regular lotion I have used</li>
            <li>This is definitely a product you can be pleased with.</li>
            <li>and I could not get accessâ€”and all this just when the company I worked for was being taken over by a bigger company who was demanding tons of &amp;#34;onboarding&amp;#34; paperwork and training (on top of the 40</li>
            <li>I simply had not been able to do it sooner</li>
            <li>There are a lot of cocoa butter sellers on Amazon and this was my first order from this one.</li>
            <li>and she said my skin looks smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>maybe not for face though, made me break out a little but great for eye area to prevent fine lines, body and dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>and right then I had to replace my laptop because I had spilled like a teaspoon of water on it, murdering it instantly, and this became a huge ordealâ€”</li>
            <li>Ignoring the listing&#x27;s health claims actually for raw cocoa powder and concentrating on the cocoa butter (which is what this is), this appears to be very good stuff.</li>
            <li>this product smells fantastic and melts smoothly to integrate with other products.</li>
            <li>The butter arrived very quick and I couldn&#x27;t wait to open</li>
            <li>Easy to work with, I like that it is not in one big bar.</li>
            <li>It comes as large chunks in a plastic jar.  </li>
            <li>Pure unrefined product.  </li>
            <li>Smells the way pure cocoa should.</li>
            <li>You receive a large amount for the price.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild taste and very creamy texture that will work well as a dairy substitute in some vegan recipes, but I will be using this primarily for topical applications like lotion and soap making simply because of the lack of tamper evident packaging.</li>
            <li>You can tell it is very high quality from the texture and from the amount of flavor and aroma it has.</li>
            <li>I received 16oz of high quality unprocessed cocoa butter in a screw top plastic jar, exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found the company to be very responsive when I wrote to them with questions...</li>
            <li>This product came within two days and was lots more than I expected since I had no experience with what 16 oz meant.  </li>
            <li>Very floral and perfume tasting.</li>
            <li>This is very quality cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>and this really soothes it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am very displeased with the un-professionalism of this seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll absolutely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Really...</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>Then it is ready to be applied.</li>
            <li>I couldnâ€™t believe it was legal.</li>
            <li>itâ€™s too much like water boarding.</li>
            <li>I donâ€™t know much, but I know one thing: when your life is going to hell in a handbasket, Plant Guru will not be your salvation.</li>
            <li>has a very lite cocoa smell.</li>
            <li>and it does so much.</li>
            <li>and it is definitely real cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I have purchased cocoa butter from Whole Foods and it is a night and day difference</li>
            <li>but Whole Foods charges $26.99 for 1lb</li>
            <li>No, our cocoa butter is not a low grade quality neither is deodorized and its safe to eat, and lastly is is always fresh.</li>
            <li>I wish I had researched this product more carefully before I bought it, because I thought it was a food product, but it has no required food labeling.  </li>
            <li>raw enough to eat i love this product and look forward to ordering again soon :)</li>
            <li>I now have a fridge full of rich tasting sugar-free dark chocolate for those emergency &amp;#34;need chocolate&amp;#34; moments.</li>
            <li>It would be nice, and I might order again from Natural Cosmetics (seller), if I had my other two ounces.</li>
            <li>I guess it wold be good for skin care or other external uses</li>
            <li>I was looking for raw Cocoa Butter  for use to make my own body butter and had no idea where to start.</li>
            <li>This is a nice size jar of raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Better than the average.</li>
            <li>I guess it really isn&#x27;t much different than buying from the bulk section at the natural grocers, but I&#x27;d feel better buying an online product that was a little more professionally packaged.  </li>
            <li>do not put your faith in false prophets or real estate tycoons with charming demeanors.</li>
            <li>The container was not full but knowing that contents settle over time and during shipping it would not bother me (when I returned the cocoa butter to it&#x27;s original container I could barely make it fit</li>
            <li>High quality Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li>The product seems to be high quality.</li>
            <li>You can literally smell the freshness and high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for soaps and food creations</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope it stays as high quality as the batch I received.</li>
            <li>This morning just for fun I even tried it for &amp;#34;Oil Pulling&amp;#34; and when I was done I had a pleasant taste of chocolate left behind.</li>
            <li>It was so fresh and the smell was utterly divine.</li>
            <li>I have ordered hundreds of things and NEVER complained.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into making your own raw chocolate candies, this is the best I&#x27;ve found to start my base</li>
            <li>I live in a ski town in Oregon.  </li>
            <li>If you try it you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am primarily using it on eczema that has been plaguing me on my calves and unlike any other butter (including raw shea butter)</li>
            <li>This is my first cocoa butter purchase, so I have nothing to compare it to, but the product itself was exactly what I expected it to be like after researching cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I added organic coconut oil and melted down some of this yummy cocoa to make it palatable, and then it tasted fine</li>
            <li>Upon opening the rather generic plastic bottle the entire house began to smell like fresh baked cookies!</li>
            <li>Rich coca smell,  just as other reviews stated.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to use it in my other body products.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product-as I did-if you want the HDPE food grade far with a screw cap to ensure freshness- because you won&#x27;t get it!</li>
            <li>This product was not packed in a HDPE Food Grade jar with a screw top lid - to preserve freshness- as advertised, it came in a very flimsy thin plastic container with a thin lid taped on top, marked if you are pregnant to consult with a doctor before using this</li>
            <li>However, the price seemed reasonable and was the best price I found at the time, so I feel less annoyed by the lack of some ounces since I was not paying the premium I might through other sites.</li>
            <li>Directly from jar onto skin and melted a bit for my hair.  </li>
            <li>As far as the product goes, I like it.</li>
            <li>I whipped the mixture with a hand held beater and it didn&#x27;t melt, so I continued beating for 3 minutes until it was light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>To re-order, I pulled out my old oder and this Plant Guru stuff</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old.</li>
            <li>And the really sad thing was, it didnâ€™t even smell good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other raw cocoa butters, but this is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>short, I highly recommend the product and will continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li>In researching cocoa butters I found it nearly impossible to pick one out without seeing or [more importantly] smelling it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not stoked about paying this much for half as much product</li>
            <li>I have eaten some of it because I was curious, but because it had no tamper evident packaging, I am hesitant to give it to my children.</li>
            <li>Then she broke off little chips of the cocoa butter and wiped it on the back of our hands, saying &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so smooth, feel it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It smells so much like chocolate, I use this to make home made body butter, this is so moisturizing, and smells terrific, I added peppermint essential oil to my mix and now my body butter smells like mint chocolate!</li>
            <li>It came up nearly two ounces short!</li>
            <li>I do not know if it was old or had done this because of the heat outside.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my skin is extremely sensitive to change, so it didn&#x27;t do anything to heal my eczema, but it made the parts of my skin that were already healthy so soft.</li>
            <li>but I do not photograph everything I eat and Ihad more urgent things to do than photograph and email dusty chunks of cocoa to customer service reps who do not even know what customer service means.)</li>
            <li>I nibble it like candy - a small piece before bedtime - and find it has improved my sleep tremendously..</li>
            <li>Bursting with ambition, I ordered a second round even before finishing the first container!</li>
            <li>I really dont know why anyone would give this product a bad review its amazing and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>story short, good product but disappointing to come up short on ounces when I rely on those weighted amounts to make my products.</li>
            <li>A yogi friend recommended raw cocoa butter to me as it has the highest content of magnesium which our society seems to be deficient in - hence all the heart disease..and this one tastes particularly good...</li>
            <li>and it melts down very well.</li>
            <li>I left it on the countertop all day long, it did not become soft at all.</li>
            <li>I am a first time buyer as well as user of raw cocoa butter ....</li>
            <li>First of all this product does not smell nor look like raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I have bought cocoa butter from another seller, but did not have the same type of product arrive, smell was bitter and not rich and fresh like this one.</li>
            <li>High Desert weather can be extreme - 80  degree temp changes in the summer and today, as I write it is 10 degrees and snowing!  </li>
            <li>So then Plant Guru asks me to send them photos of the bad cocoa and the good cocoa I still had, even though photos would prove nothing.</li>

            <li> Love the smell, great on my skin</li>
            <li> When I opened the container I was very, pleased.</li>
            <li> Because it smells so good, it gives a really nice scent to the items I make/  </li>
            <li> Nice aroma, good color.</li>
            <li> It seems to be of good quality and certainly made wonderful chocolate!</li>
            <li> The strong fresh aroma is breathtaking and a great product to use in homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> (As if YOU ever let chocolate sit around for more than two minutes!)</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> is my amazing &amp;#34;Milkshake&amp;#34; recipe, you have to try it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance of cocoa is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I have started making my own soaps and the mixture of oils and butters are amazing.  </li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is excellent quality, and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> it also makes my skin look really nice..</li>
            <li> It smells like cocoa &amp; works nicely.</li>
            <li> Now I have a very nourishing body butter that smells great!</li>
            <li> to warm it up in between my fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought it to make my own skin care products, but I had to taste it when I smelled it.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own shea &amp; cocoa butter whipped moisturizer.</li>
            <li> used it in my chocolate, chunks which made it crunchy and nice.</li>
            <li> I am a real and happy customer and this product is good.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use; I just take a piece and place on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is also very easy to share</li>
            <li> I was impressed from when I first opened the package and smelled the strong chocolate aroma.</li>
            <li> it can be used for cooking, I have tasted it as well and it has a light, fresh cocoa taste that should be wonderful for making my own healthy chocolate.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter has an amazing smell, and I would love to try to find some additional uses for it.  </li>
            <li> I liked it and i will order more</li>
            <li> This butter smells so nice, and I love you can use this cocoa butter for food as well as for skincare.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, however, and is great for cooking as well as moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It arrived really quickly (almost a week before the estimate) and the butter is really good.</li>
            <li> I will say that the large chunks make great lotion bars all by themselves.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i absolutely love this stuff..</li>
            <li> it is truly an amazing skin care product AND a fantastic addition to my vegan chocolate protein &amp;#34;Milkshake&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started on my second batch this year and am very happy with this cocoa butter...</li>
            <li> I also thought that the form it came in (hunks) would be better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this stuff glad i choose this one</li>
            <li> And some of the more adventuresome dessert recipes call for it.  </li>
            <li> I like shea butter better.</li>
            <li> Ok I received this at the appointed time  , and it came as described .</li>
            <li> fabulous!</li>
            <li> It smells great and is very creamy.</li>
            <li> I knew that it was destined to become more than an ingredient in skin</li>
            <li> I love how this product smells and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I chose this product.</li>
            <li> I combined this with some beeswax and essential oils and created a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> , mine did come in a screw top HDPE container, and was in medium sized chunks as the picture indicates.</li>
            <li> this is way better than any store bought cream or oil.</li>
            <li> Although there are many uses for it, I wanted it for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the product, the product comes in a sealable container.</li>
            <li> I love this cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with it, and like that it was in a solid HDPE container.</li>
            <li> has so many ingredients with odd-sounding names</li>
            <li> i really love the product, even tho</li>
            <li> . . . my skin got better and better . . .</li>
            <li> OK, at that time, I was trying to get a mortgageâ€”</li>
            <li> A month or two or more?</li>
            <li> I will never buy lotion again, too many chemicals.</li>
            <li> love this stuff bought to put in home made lotions.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for my skincare too :)</li>
            <li> (nice light scent)</li>
            <li> I love the smell and what it does to my face and skin.  </li>
            <li> No safety seal or anything to assure me it is safe to eat.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am glad it came in a container.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> Love love love love.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter-in-law, who was very excited with this gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very familiar with the usage of cocoa butter , it does wonders for your skin  evens out</li>
            <li> good cocoa butter..does not have that much of a coca fragrance,its very mild but seems like a nice product</li>
            <li> Texture is good, no weird or suspicious bits of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVED the first container</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than what I expected and at a great price!</li>
            <li> shipped SUPER fast, my cocoa butter was beautifully chopped, preserved, and aromatic.</li>
            <li> Lovely chocolate smell to this fantastic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the jar, my room filled with the lovely sent of chocolate.</li>
            <li> Fresh, just as it was stated in the description and came on a nice resealable plastic container.</li>
            <li> It has a light chocolate scent which I personally love and it melts easily between your hands.</li>
            <li> It is not always so easy to find food grade cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> They melt easily and then can be used in crafting your candies, pastries, or cakes.</li>
            <li> It can then be easily rubbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> Easy packaging.  </li>
            <li> Grates easily with the finest grating side of the grater.  </li>
            <li> The scent is delectable and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Be advised that this has a strong cocoa butter aroma.</li>
            <li> Strong chocolate smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for making soaps, lotions, and just using it in general.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first batch of this in October, and am re purchasing again as it&#x27;s a really nice product.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I received my first order of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was fine.  </li>
            <li> I used my cocoa butter and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Smells like a more mild, earthy chocolate scent.</li>
            <li> I will be giving it to a lucky family member who was blessed with better skin so they can enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It was packaged in a huge re-usable plastic container and it came in chunky pieces.</li>
            <li> I used it to make white chocolate (we have a dairy allergy, among others, in the house) and it was honestly the best white chocolate I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Just got this today to make white chocolate and peanut butter cups,  and the quality was great.  </li>
            <li> Bought product a while ago to aid in my dream of making sugar free chocolate chips for a diabetic friend of mine.</li>
            <li> and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and very creamy.  </li>
            <li> good quality as far as I can tell, though I&#x27;m no expert.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled the wonderful chocolatey smell and have already had it straight and then melted it with equal parts coconut oil and raw cocoa powder to produce a perfect bitter-sweet chocolate (my first!)</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to add to my soaps, but I just used it to make some chocolate</li>
            <li> Smells like rich chocolate.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> Good price, great product, very hard to find.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter melted smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li> it came in a twist top container sealed in a large Ziploc bag.can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I TRUSTED Plant Guru to do the right thing!</li>
            <li> The customer is always right, and if you donâ€™t buy them apples, then just use your noggin!</li>
            <li> the same it smells so good</li>
            <li> This was a full pound (I weighed it after it showed up),</li>
            <li> Sweet smell and works well.</li>
            <li> If you are going to go by jar size and just pack it full, then sell it by volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mixed this in my homemade leave in conditioner, it works good with my Shea butter mixture.</li>
            <li> cooktop, then let it cool for a bit.</li>
            <li> I would just open the lid, take a whiff, and know that life was good.</li>
            <li> (Sure, like that was ever going to happenâ€”what I really wanted was lots of chocolate on hand.)</li>
            <li> Returned to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was packaged very well, I love the smell.</li>
            <li> It melted down beautifully with coconut oil and peppermint oil for an eczema treatment and with mango butter for a lip treatment.</li>
            <li> I am a very loyal, VERY long-term Amazon customer (I may be the very first Amazon customer!).</li>
            <li> Tastes very good, but the reason I left off 1 star is because the fragrance is not as strong as an earlier purchase of cocoa discs.</li>
            <li> Claiming that it is in a food grade plastic jar does not mean that it is safe to eat.  </li>
            <li> Raw, Pure, Sensational !!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and easy storage.</li>
            <li> The application was very, creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I had a whim to make my own white chocolate.</li>
            <li> The sealable container helps keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast, the cocoa butter smelled good, but it only weighed 15.6 oz</li>
            <li> This is the kind of cocoa butter my aunts would send to my mother when I was growing up, not like this commercial, diluted cocoa butters you see in some of the beauty supplies and drug stores.  </li>
            <li> and I also just rubbed it into my skin, unadulterated, so that I smelled like a huge hunk of chocolate and wanted to eat myself alive.</li>
            <li> Using to make my own body creams with essential oils.</li>
            <li> nice to only use one thing on your skin</li>
            <li> Already went back to Whole Foods for the good stuff and made my chocolate.</li>
            <li> nowhere, miles down on a dirt road, snowed in for days--I tried to whip up some chocolate treats, but I was not so successful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to as this is the first cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but the smell is intoxicating and strong, and it seems very high quality to me.</li>
            <li> It is rich, pure and fresh.</li>
            <li> (OK, maybe some people go to extremes for a free container of raw cocoa, but most people have neither the time nor the inclination.)</li>
            <li> it has a smooth buttery flavor sugar free that I like it seems natural I would say it taste pure</li>
            <li> From the first time I opened it, the scent alone was intoxicating, like pure sweet chocolate.</li>
            <li> I have yet to make my homemade body butter, but am looking forward to doing so and certainly would purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> love it all by itself your skin really drinks it up and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> No other oil used for oil pulling has ever left me with that pleasant taste before.</li>
            <li> It smells divine, melts down really well (to make body butter) and is pretty much an all around great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> And I wasnâ€™t particularly concerned because Amazon has such amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> (cuz I&#x27;m cheep ;-)</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this brand!!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> First time review ..had to speak up about this product..</li>
            <li> Great product - won&#x27;t last long in this kitchen.</li>
            <li> My next order wil definitely be for three pounds or more for sure.</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> better than any regular lotion I have used</li>
            <li> This is definitely a product you can be pleased with.</li>
            <li> and I could not get accessâ€”and all this just when the company I worked for was being taken over by a bigger company who was demanding tons of &amp;#34;onboarding&amp;#34; paperwork and training (on top of the 40</li>
            <li> I simply had not been able to do it sooner</li>
            <li> There are a lot of cocoa butter sellers on Amazon and this was my first order from this one.</li>
            <li> and she said my skin looks smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> maybe not for face though, made me break out a little but great for eye area to prevent fine lines, body and dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> and right then I had to replace my laptop because I had spilled like a teaspoon of water on it, murdering it instantly, and this became a huge ordealâ€”</li>
            <li> Ignoring the listing&#x27;s health claims actually for raw cocoa powder and concentrating on the cocoa butter (which is what this is), this appears to be very good stuff.</li>
            <li> this product smells fantastic and melts smoothly to integrate with other products.</li>
            <li> The butter arrived very quick and I couldn&#x27;t wait to open</li>
            <li> Easy to work with, I like that it is not in one big bar.</li>
            <li> It comes as large chunks in a plastic jar.  </li>
            <li> Pure unrefined product.  </li>
            <li> Smells the way pure cocoa should.</li>
            <li> You receive a large amount for the price.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild taste and very creamy texture that will work well as a dairy substitute in some vegan recipes, but I will be using this primarily for topical applications like lotion and soap making simply because of the lack of tamper evident packaging.</li>
            <li> You can tell it is very high quality from the texture and from the amount of flavor and aroma it has.</li>
            <li> I received 16oz of high quality unprocessed cocoa butter in a screw top plastic jar, exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found the company to be very responsive when I wrote to them with questions...</li>
            <li> This product came within two days and was lots more than I expected since I had no experience with what 16 oz meant.  </li>
            <li> Very floral and perfume tasting.</li>
            <li> This is very quality cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> and this really soothes it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am very displeased with the un-professionalism of this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll absolutely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Really...</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> Then it is ready to be applied.</li>
            <li> I couldnâ€™t believe it was legal.</li>
            <li> itâ€™s too much like water boarding.</li>
            <li> I donâ€™t know much, but I know one thing: when your life is going to hell in a handbasket, Plant Guru will not be your salvation.</li>
            <li> has a very lite cocoa smell.</li>
            <li> and it does so much.</li>
            <li> and it is definitely real cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I have purchased cocoa butter from Whole Foods and it is a night and day difference</li>
            <li> but Whole Foods charges $26.99 for 1lb</li>
            <li> No, our cocoa butter is not a low grade quality neither is deodorized and its safe to eat, and lastly is is always fresh.</li>
            <li> I wish I had researched this product more carefully before I bought it, because I thought it was a food product, but it has no required food labeling.  </li>
            <li> raw enough to eat i love this product and look forward to ordering again soon :)</li>
            <li> I now have a fridge full of rich tasting sugar-free dark chocolate for those emergency &amp;#34;need chocolate&amp;#34; moments.</li>
            <li> It would be nice, and I might order again from Natural Cosmetics (seller), if I had my other two ounces.</li>
            <li> I guess it wold be good for skin care or other external uses</li>
            <li> I was looking for raw Cocoa Butter  for use to make my own body butter and had no idea where to start.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size jar of raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Better than the average.</li>
            <li> I guess it really isn&#x27;t much different than buying from the bulk section at the natural grocers, but I&#x27;d feel better buying an online product that was a little more professionally packaged.  </li>
            <li> do not put your faith in false prophets or real estate tycoons with charming demeanors.</li>
            <li> The container was not full but knowing that contents settle over time and during shipping it would not bother me (when I returned the cocoa butter to it&#x27;s original container I could barely make it fit</li>
            <li> High quality Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li> The product seems to be high quality.</li>
            <li> You can literally smell the freshness and high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for soaps and food creations</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope it stays as high quality as the batch I received.</li>
            <li> This morning just for fun I even tried it for &amp;#34;Oil Pulling&amp;#34; and when I was done I had a pleasant taste of chocolate left behind.</li>
            <li> It was so fresh and the smell was utterly divine.</li>
            <li> I have ordered hundreds of things and NEVER complained.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into making your own raw chocolate candies, this is the best I&#x27;ve found to start my base</li>
            <li> I live in a ski town in Oregon.  </li>
            <li> If you try it you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am primarily using it on eczema that has been plaguing me on my calves and unlike any other butter (including raw shea butter)</li>
            <li> This is my first cocoa butter purchase, so I have nothing to compare it to, but the product itself was exactly what I expected it to be like after researching cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I added organic coconut oil and melted down some of this yummy cocoa to make it palatable, and then it tasted fine</li>
            <li> Upon opening the rather generic plastic bottle the entire house began to smell like fresh baked cookies!</li>
            <li> Rich coca smell,  just as other reviews stated.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to use it in my other body products.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product-as I did-if you want the HDPE food grade far with a screw cap to ensure freshness- because you won&#x27;t get it!</li>
            <li> This product was not packed in a HDPE Food Grade jar with a screw top lid - to preserve freshness- as advertised, it came in a very flimsy thin plastic container with a thin lid taped on top, marked if you are pregnant to consult with a doctor before using this</li>
            <li> However, the price seemed reasonable and was the best price I found at the time, so I feel less annoyed by the lack of some ounces since I was not paying the premium I might through other sites.</li>
            <li> Directly from jar onto skin and melted a bit for my hair.  </li>
            <li> As far as the product goes, I like it.</li>
            <li> I whipped the mixture with a hand held beater and it didn&#x27;t melt, so I continued beating for 3 minutes until it was light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> To re-order, I pulled out my old oder and this Plant Guru stuff</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old.</li>
            <li> And the really sad thing was, it didnâ€™t even smell good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other raw cocoa butters, but this is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> short, I highly recommend the product and will continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li> In researching cocoa butters I found it nearly impossible to pick one out without seeing or [more importantly] smelling it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not stoked about paying this much for half as much product</li>
            <li> I have eaten some of it because I was curious, but because it had no tamper evident packaging, I am hesitant to give it to my children.</li>
            <li> Then she broke off little chips of the cocoa butter and wiped it on the back of our hands, saying &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so smooth, feel it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It smells so much like chocolate, I use this to make home made body butter, this is so moisturizing, and smells terrific, I added peppermint essential oil to my mix and now my body butter smells like mint chocolate!</li>
            <li> It came up nearly two ounces short!</li>
            <li> I do not know if it was old or had done this because of the heat outside.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin is extremely sensitive to change, so it didn&#x27;t do anything to heal my eczema, but it made the parts of my skin that were already healthy so soft.</li>
            <li> but I do not photograph everything I eat and Ihad more urgent things to do than photograph and email dusty chunks of cocoa to customer service reps who do not even know what customer service means.)</li>
            <li> I nibble it like candy - a small piece before bedtime - and find it has improved my sleep tremendously..</li>
            <li> Bursting with ambition, I ordered a second round even before finishing the first container!</li>
            <li> I really dont know why anyone would give this product a bad review its amazing and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> story short, good product but disappointing to come up short on ounces when I rely on those weighted amounts to make my products.</li>
            <li> A yogi friend recommended raw cocoa butter to me as it has the highest content of magnesium which our society seems to be deficient in - hence all the heart disease..and this one tastes particularly good...</li>
            <li> and it melts down very well.</li>
            <li> I left it on the countertop all day long, it did not become soft at all.</li>
            <li> I am a first time buyer as well as user of raw cocoa butter ....</li>
            <li> First of all this product does not smell nor look like raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I have bought cocoa butter from another seller, but did not have the same type of product arrive, smell was bitter and not rich and fresh like this one.</li>
            <li> High Desert weather can be extreme - 80  degree temp changes in the summer and today, as I write it is 10 degrees and snowing!  </li>
            <li> So then Plant Guru asks me to send them photos of the bad cocoa and the good cocoa I still had, even though photos would prove nothing.</li>
            <li> I will CONTINUE to buy RAW 100% PURE COCOA BUTTER...</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with other natural products to make a nite cream.</li>
            <li> the next batch of cocoa was dryer, flakier, covered with white powder and white spots--you know, the way chocolate gets if you let it sit around for a long time.</li>
            <li> Usually I get it in large chunks.  </li>
            <li> I was worried with all the bad reviews for other products being rancid when received, but this butter is really sweet and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Cocoa butter has been a staple in my life for a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with chocolate making, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I would recommend this product to someone looking for raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Faint cocoa scent that dissipates quickly if applied topically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it with other organic oil such as Almond oil and olive oil, I&#x27;m well prepared for the winter coming up and summer</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Mine was dry and cracked when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> It remained dry and lumpy and I used an electric hand mixer to add in.</li>
            <li> So I did look at a few brands on Amazon and at first thought I wanted to buy the small discs.</li>
            <li> I can give my daughter a few, and it will last her awhile(long lasting).</li>
            <li> Made white and dark chocolates that my husband raved about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this jar is an old jar of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> The previous order I placed (in March 2014), the butter came in a similar jar, but it was from Earth Tone Essentials.</li>
            <li> Only complaint about this product is that it&#x27;s not organic, but it&#x27;s not advertised as such so still gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> firm organic extra virgin coconut oil and 2 Tbsp organic jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Thatâ€™s the problem with Gurusâ€”they always think they are right and everyone else is wrong.</li>
            <li> In this case, all the reviewers have a handful of reviews posted within a few months of each other (and none of them have a track record of reviews that goes back over a</li>
            <li> I understand now why lotions that advertise that they have cocoa butter in them actually barely have any; at room temp, it&#x27;s hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried any other brand</li>
            <li> the other was 15.4 oz.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve just started experimenting with DIY body butters and other skin recipes.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to compare this with any other product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter to use on my granddaughter for her skin due to an accident.  </li>
            <li> I knew I was using food grade raw cocoa butter, and Amazon was the only seller to offer food grade in an amount less than 50 lbs.</li>
            <li> Careful to keep hidden or animals will eat it.</li>
            <li> The jar was half empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m having trouble keeping it whipped, it begins to solidify again after only few minutes.</li>
            <li> In all fairness, as soon as you started acting all smarmy with me, I told you I would write a bad review if you did not do the right thing.</li>
            <li> This is not good for cooking with (bad flavor), but would be ok to use in skin care products!</li>
            <li> Wow, sorry it took so long.</li>
            <li> It seems it is not fresh</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort for $15 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I melt it down and mix it with coconut oil and use it as lotion.</li>
            <li> Once that chunk melts down I start on another one..</li>
            <li> Since I use it for my skin, I melted it down and whipped it</li>
            <li> Actually, these chunks make it easier to get out of the jar, because if it was solid, it would be tough to remove it since each chunk is so hard at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the second was no good.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and skin in the winter that is hard to manage at times (cracked</li>
            <li> My little boy has a bit of eczema to deal with and this plus a bit of avocado oil works wonders.  </li>
            <li> Having little to compare it with, however, this is subjective.</li>
            <li> Comes in large cubes that are a little awkward to work with but manageable.</li>
            <li> And here as Plant Guru wanting photos of their dried out cocoa from me.</li>
            <li> This way I can avoid all the unhealthy additives in commercially produced products.</li>
            <li> jar is not filled with melted cocoa butter but with the chunks you see pictured.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a slight difference in a week!</li>
            <li> I usually use pure coconut oil as lotion, but now that it&#x27;s getting cold</li>
            <li> it was dry and very hard.</li>
            <li> I used this to make raw, all-natural chocolate and have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I melted about 2 Tbsp of this raw cocoa butter at 100 degrees using a &amp;#34;Mr. Induction&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ingredients include ground roasted hazelnuts (500g), cacao butter (50g), raw organic cacao powder (50g), organic cane brown sugar (90g) and vanilla extract (1/2 tsp).</li>
            <li> In the meantime, it&#x27;s raw, it&#x27;s cocoa butter</li>
            <li> It is misleading to claim that it is a raw product and doesn&#x27;t have to meet FDA food labeling requirements, because of course cocoa butter has to be processed.</li>
            <li> and I had a very tight deadline to do itâ€”</li>
            <li> it is a little hard have to softer by warming it up</li>
            <li> Terrific product - was initially skeptical about using cocoa butter, but am now sold on it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This makes me wary (and it should make any real person not employed by a web-marketing company wary as well.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to thin dark chocolate for dipping and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Plant Guru Raw Cocoa Butter is a pure,&lt;br /&gt;quality product and their customer service can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> For skin, raw foods etc...I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> RAW cocoa Butter!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to tell what one is using.</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the actual product yet (almost afraid to)</li>
            <li> But what I made was actually edible--at least for a desperate palate--in spite of my reprehensible approach.</li>
            <li> I took some of this (according to my research, it has 0 carbs), melted it slowly in the microwave, and added cocoa powder and liquid no calorie sweetener.</li>
            <li> (I have serious reverse trust issues.)</li>
            <li> it is a little difficult to get it out of the container.</li>
            <li> it did me no good.</li>
            <li> This product is useable, but not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> dusty cocoa?</li>
            <li> but I had been duped into a terrible real estate deal, so</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect after reading other horrible reviews for cocoa butter from other brands</li>
            <li> it gets difficult to work with</li>
            <li> If you want refined, in any sense of the word, you&#x27;re looking at the wrong product.</li>
            <li> It looks like a cocoa brick was shattered, and random shards were stuffed into a jar until it weighed 1 pound.</li>
            <li> everything went wrong for a week</li>
            <li> Now if it was by volume, I would not be mad.</li>
            <li> When the terrible chocolate craving struck, late at night</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t see any bad reviews.</li>
            <li> (Of course the cocoa could have gone bad after it arrived.)</li>
            <li> This has been a bad experence since the moment this product arrived.</li>
            <li> heels and fingers are painful).  </li>
            <li> so it is not grainy :-(</li>
            <li> and I was unhappy with being cheated!</li>
            <li> I know I read tons of reviews on here, and this def was one of those products you like or hate the smell.</li>
            <li> I hated the smell.</li>
            <li> It was not at all disgusting as I had feared.</li>
            <li> but it stung and tasted disgusting, so</li>

            <li> shipped SUPER fast, my cocoa butter was beautifully chopped, preserved, and aromatic. will be buying again! can&#x27;t wait for my mango and kokum butter to arrive.</li>
            <li> LLLLLLLOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i absolutely love this stuff.. i put this stuff on my body, i put this stuff IN my body, i put this stuff on my hair.. it is truly an amazing skin care product AND a fantastic addition to my vegan chocolate protein &amp;#34;Milkshake&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my amazing &amp;#34;Milkshake&amp;#34; recipe, you have to try it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;banana&lt;br /&gt;protein powder&lt;br /&gt;ice&lt;br /&gt;dark chocolate almond milk (silk)&lt;br /&gt;flax oil&lt;br /&gt;almond butter&lt;br /&gt;cocoa butter&lt;br /&gt;hemp seeds</li>
            <li> This was the ingredient my recipe asked for. It was not the shape the recipe required, so I had to guess at the quantity to use. These healthy chocolate squares turned out great anyway! I knew I was using food grade raw cocoa butter, and Amazon was the only seller to offer food grade in an amount less than 50 lbs.</li>
            <li> It smells off . . . hoping it still had the same healing properties.</li>
            <li> It came in chunks.  Smelled delicious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started on my second batch this year and am very happy with this cocoa butter...A yogi friend recommended raw cocoa butter to me as it has the highest content of magnesium which our society seems to be deficient in - hence all the heart disease..and this one tastes particularly good... I nibble it like candy - a small piece before bedtime - and find it has improved my sleep tremendously..and I no longer have leg cramps either...I&#x27;ve also found the company to be very responsive when I wrote to them with questions...</li>
            <li> I use this in my coconut milk based chocolate mousse.  Yum.</li>
            <li> I was looking for raw Cocoa Butter  for use to make my own body butter and had no idea where to start. So I did look at a few brands on Amazon and at first thought I wanted to buy the small discs. However, this product received a lot of great feedback on scent, quality, and packaging. I also thought that the form it came in (hunks) would be better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was excellent, packaging was excellent and the product itself is amazing! From the first time I opened it, the scent alone was intoxicating, like pure sweet chocolate. The pieces alone can be used on your skin or even lips as a lip balm. I have yet to make my homemade body butter, but am looking forward to doing so and certainly would purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> This product came within two days and was lots more than I expected since I had no experience with what 16 oz meant.  I will have enough cocoa butter for months!  It worked perfectly in the recipe I was using, as well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into making your own raw chocolate candies, this is the best I&#x27;ve found to start my base</li>
            <li> Looked and smelled great.  I used it for my homemade lotion.</li>
            <li> Very floral and perfume tasting. Would not recommend as food grade.</li>
            <li> I live in a ski town in Oregon.  High Desert weather can be extreme - 80  degree temp changes in the summer and today, as I write it is 10 degrees and snowing!  I have dry hair and skin in the winter that is hard to manage at times (cracked heels and fingers are painful).  I purchased my first batch of this in October, and am re purchasing again as it&#x27;s a really nice product.  It smells divine, melts down really well (to make body butter) and is pretty much an all around great moisturizer.  My little boy has a bit of eczema to deal with and this plus a bit of avocado oil works wonders.  I am a real and happy customer and this product is good.  I have bought cocoa butter from another seller, but did not have the same type of product arrive, smell was bitter and not rich and fresh like this one.</li>
            <li> This is great Cocoa, love it. Smells and tastes great! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff glad i choose this one</li>
            <li> Received this purchase rapidly set it out on my night table to use on my hands and arms nightly. Well good thing it is food grade as my cats and dogs decided it tasted so good they had to eat it. Careful to keep hidden or animals will eat it. Smell is heavenly.</li>
            <li> I use it to do chocolate,and it is good</li>
            <li> This is my first cocoa butter purchase, so I have nothing to compare it to, but the product itself was exactly what I expected it to be like after researching cocoa butter. I have eaten some of it because I was curious, but because it had no tamper evident packaging, I am hesitant to give it to my children. It has a very mild taste and very creamy texture that will work well as a dairy substitute in some vegan recipes, but I will be using this primarily for topical applications like lotion and soap making simply because of the lack of tamper evident packaging. I guess it really isn&#x27;t much different than buying from the bulk section at the natural grocers, but I&#x27;d feel better buying an online product that was a little more professionally packaged.  The label was a hand cut ink jet printed label. I will say that the large chunks make great lotion bars all by themselves.  Just warm one in the palm of your hand and rub it over cuticles or elbows for some great non-greasy intensive moisture.</li>
            <li> I was thrown off with the already shredded product in the packaging.  Usually I get it in large chunks.  Smells and tastes great.  Made white and dark chocolates that my husband raved about.</li>
            <li> It is not always so easy to find food grade cocoa butter.  And some of the more adventuresome dessert recipes call for it.  This cocoa butter is excellent quality, and reasonably priced.  It comes as large chunks in a plastic jar.  They melt easily and then can be used in crafting your candies, pastries, or cakes.</li>
            <li> Great quality food grade cocoa butter. I used it to make white chocolate (we have a dairy allergy, among others, in the house) and it was honestly the best white chocolate I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Smells good. But in my case i didn&#x27;t like it as a Chapstick. It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my dry skin. I like shea butter better.</li>
            <li> Arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I know u can eat it but that is not y I got it. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;I got this to make a body butter with again it is a little hard have to softer by warming it up but that is no big deal for me just won&#x27;t make a very good body butter. Still trying to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;All the same it smells so good I use it as is.&lt;br /&gt;Such a tasty smell. ^_^ &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Smells great works the way I needed it to.  Pure unrefined product.  Smells the way pure cocoa should. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter-in-law, who was very excited with this gift. She immediately opened it up and tasted it. Then she broke off little chips of the cocoa butter and wiped it on the back of our hands, saying &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so smooth, feel it!&amp;#34; Plus, it smelled and tasted just like chocolate, which of course it is. She&#x27;s going to make some chocolate confections with it.&lt;br /&gt;So, based on the recipient&#x27;s reaction, I&#x27;d have to say this product is a winner!</li>
            <li> Lovely chocolate smell to this fantastic cocoa butter. Works great in all the homemade lotions, creams lip balms etc.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any other brand and I don&#x27;t know if I would this one is great!</li>
            <li> if you like chocolate you will be in heaven.  The strong fresh aroma is breathtaking and a great product to use in homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> I had a whim to make my own white chocolate. In researching cocoa butters I found it nearly impossible to pick one out without seeing or [more importantly] smelling it. I chose this brand for the price (cuz I&#x27;m cheep ;-) And I didn&#x27;t see any bad reviews. Upon opening the rather generic plastic bottle the entire house began to smell like fresh baked cookies! And the chocolate smell was awesome! I will definitely buy more of this brand!!&lt;br /&gt;Now if I can only figure out how to make the white chocolate so it is not grainy :-(</li>
            <li> works great in my body butter I made and smells so good!</li>
            <li> Just for the record, I think it&#x27;s wise to suspect any seller&#x27;s product that has all 5-star reviews.  In this case, all the reviewers have a handful of reviews posted within a few months of each other (and none of them have a track record of reviews that goes back over a year.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes me wary (and it should make any real person not employed by a web-marketing company wary as well.)  So, in this post-modern era, all these 5-star reviews have definitely convinced me not to buy this product, or any product from this company. (And when they all 9 of the &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34; down-rate this review, that&#x27;ll just be final confirmation...)</li>
            <li> This was a full pound (I weighed it after it showed up), good quality as far as I can tell, though I&#x27;m no expert.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what this would look like or how it would work. I trusted the candy recipe and dove in. It was easy and delicious. I now have a fridge full of rich tasting sugar-free dark chocolate for those emergency &amp;#34;need chocolate&amp;#34; moments. It takes just a taste to satisfy. The cocoa butter melted smoothly and quickly. It was not at all disgusting as I had feared. It looks like chunks of some sort of candy. Which it soon becomes.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was fine.  i opened it up and the quality is great.  The only problem i have is that it is not 16 oz as described.  I ordered two jars.  I always weigh products to ensure I am not getting ripped off.  Well the contents of one of the 16 oz jars was 15.2 oz the other was 15.4 oz.  So if you don&#x27;t mind being shorted I would recommend them otherwise I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Just got this today to make white chocolate and peanut butter cups,  and the quality was great.  Rich coca smell,  just as other reviews stated.  Packed in white, hand labeled,  plastic container,  no problems.  Great flavor for chocolate making,  recipe here: [...]</li>
            <li> Smells so wonderful. The sealable container helps keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> The butter arrived very quick and I couldn&#x27;t wait to open try it out. It is a very good product, it smells fantastic and is very good quality. I will definitely buy from this seller again!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> Good quality and really great smell.  Easy to work with, I like that it is not in one big bar.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it. It have to be mixed. Seems like chocolate!</li>
            <li> Smell is so good!!! Very good product if you are making body butters. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> just used it once did a good job</li>
            <li> Ok I received this at the appointed time  , and it came as described . I&#x27;m very familiar with the usage of cocoa butter , it does wonders for your skin  evens out your skin tone removes  darken spots ... it&#x27;s a great product to have and a good investment to buy in bulk from this company.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve just started experimenting with DIY body butters and other skin recipes. Plant Guru Raw Cocoa Butter is a pure,&lt;br /&gt;quality product and their customer service can&#x27;t be beat! (they sent Mango Butter to me in error, but immediately responded to my communication regarding this and sent me Cocoa Butter at no charge- the Mango Butter is awesome too!)&lt;br /&gt; this product smells fantastic and melts smoothly to integrate with other products. fabulous!</li>
            <li> just as described. thanks!</li>
            <li> Mmm-mmm. As soon as I opened the jar, my room filled with the lovely sent of chocolate. Used it to make some body butter. Turned out perfect.</li>
            <li> Terrific product - was initially skeptical about using cocoa butter, but am now sold on it.  It is very easy to use; I just take a piece and place on my skin.  The warmth of my skin &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; the butter as I move it over my skin.  It can then be easily rubbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> Makes me salivate to smell this stuff! It smells great and is very creamy. We use it a lotion bar, rubbing it all over our skin.</li>
            <li> First time review ..had to speak up about this product..It just arrived and when I opened it the smell was to die for! Smells like a chocolate bar its intoxicating. The scent is seeming to last after an hour..it also makes my skin look really nice..it came in a twist top container sealed in a large Ziploc bag.can&#x27;t wait to share chunks of it with friends and family because there is a lot of it</li>
            <li> Sweet smell and works well. I&#x27;ve used it on some stretch marks and I&#x27;ve seen a slight difference in a week!</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the jar and got a good whiff of these chunks of cocoa butter I knew that it was destined to become more than an ingredient in skin lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocoa Butter Cookies !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion bars and skin lotion turned out wonderfully with the rich cocoa scent no essential oils were necessary.  Directly from jar onto skin and melted a bit for my hair.  Great product - won&#x27;t last long in this kitchen.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! I originally bought it to add to my soaps, but I just used it to make some chocolate and it was HEAVENLY!!! Would definitely recommend and purchase again!</li>
            <li> As far as the product goes, I like it. Smells like a more mild, earthy chocolate scent. Texture is good, no weird or suspicious bits of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am a bit dissatisfied about the amount of product. The ad says net weight. I emptied the contents of mine into a bowl that had be tared to 0 on my scale. It came up nearly two ounces short! Now if it was by volume, I would not be mad. The container was not full but knowing that contents settle over time and during shipping it would not bother me (when I returned the cocoa butter to it&#x27;s original container I could barely make it fit so I know they filled it best they could). If you are going to go by jar size and just pack it full, then sell it by volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, good product but disappointing to come up short on ounces when I rely on those weighted amounts to make my products. However, the price seemed reasonable and was the best price I found at the time, so I feel less annoyed by the lack of some ounces since I was not paying the premium I might through other sites. It would be nice, and I might order again from Natural Cosmetics (seller), if I had my other two ounces.</li>
            <li> It works great.  Easy packaging.  Love it!  For skin, raw foods etc...I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I used this to make raw, all-natural chocolate and have no complaints whatsoever. The smell alone was wonderful and it made great chocolate. I don&#x27;t have much experience with chocolate making, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I would recommend this product to someone looking for raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality Cocoa Butter. Be advised that this has a strong cocoa butter aroma. If you don&#x27;t want this in your finished product, you may was to consider the de-odorized version.</li>
            <li> This is very quality cocoa butter. It can be used for body butters, hair products and even for cooking!!! My next order wil definitely be for three pounds or more for sure.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast, the cocoa butter smelled good, but it only weighed 15.6 oz and I was unhappy with being cheated!</li>
            <li> This is the kind of cocoa butter my aunts would send to my mother when I was growing up, not like this commercial, diluted cocoa butters you see in some of the beauty supplies and drug stores.  I will CONTINUE to buy RAW 100% PURE COCOA BUTTER...</li>
            <li> Delicious! I bought this to make some homemade chocolate. I&#x27;m on a low carb diet but wanted a treat. I took some of this (according to my research, it has 0 carbs), melted it slowly in the microwave, and added cocoa powder and liquid no calorie sweetener. I bought a peanut butter cup mold and made my own peanut butter cups! I also made chocolates with orange extract added in. The package it came in says it&#x27;s good until Sep 2014 (so about 11 months from order date) and that it&#x27;s food grade. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> High quality Cocoa Butter.  Smells great and works great in lip balms and soaps.  Because it smells so good, it gives a really nice scent to the items I make/  I will definitely purchase again from this seller</li>
            <li> This product was not packed in a HDPE Food Grade jar with a screw top lid - to preserve freshness- as advertised, it came in a very flimsy thin plastic container with a thin lid taped on top, marked if you are pregnant to consult with a doctor before using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was part of the reason I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Mine was dry and cracked when I opened it. I do not know if it was old or had done this because of the heat outside.</li>
            <li> The jar was half empty when I received it. I&#x27;m not stoked about paying this much for half as much product as I thought I&#x27;d get.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling cocoa butter I have ever used! I use it to make homemade body butters and sunscreens. Really, really good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love how this product smells and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> Wow, sorry it took so long. Bought product a while ago to aid in my dream of making sugar free chocolate chips for a diabetic friend of mine. Product is great! Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells so good, makes you want to bite into it. I melt it down and mix it with coconut oil and use it as lotion. I have extremely dry skin and this really soothes it.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect after reading other horrible reviews for cocoa butter from other brands but I&#x27;m glad I chose this product. It arrived in the jar sealed in a ziplock which was great and the contents were perfect.</li>
            <li> Used this in some lotions and body butters I&#x27;ve made. It smells like cocoa &amp; works nicely. My skin is softer than ever since using it. I love it and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be high quality. Comes in large cubes that are a little awkward to work with but manageable.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a whipped body butter I make and I was so happy when it arrived and I smelled the cocoa butter. It smells amazing works beautiful in my whipped body butter and I&#x27;m excited to use it in my other body products. I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Amazing texture and scent! Perfect for my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> Mixed this in my homemade leave in conditioner, it works good with my Shea butter mixture. Will order again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as an ingredient in some Beard Balm I was going to make, and it has worked great.  I combined this with some beeswax and essential oils and created a wonderful product.  The cocoa butter has an amazing smell, and I would love to try to find some additional uses for it.  Great price for a lot of good product!</li>
            <li> This smells great and was packaged as advertised. I usually use pure coconut oil as lotion, but now that it&#x27;s getting cold it gets difficult to work with so I decided to make some whipped body butter, and added cocoa butter to help diminish scars. I melted about 2 Tbsp of this raw cocoa butter at 100 degrees using a &amp;#34;Mr. Induction&amp;#34; cooktop, then let it cool for a bit. Next I combined it with 12 oz. firm organic extra virgin coconut oil and 2 Tbsp organic jojoba oil. I whipped the mixture with a hand held beater and it didn&#x27;t melt, so I continued beating for 3 minutes until it was light and fluffy. Now I have a very nourishing body butter that smells great! Only complaint about this product is that it&#x27;s not organic, but it&#x27;s not advertised as such so still gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I rub this on my skin, but it is food grade so I could eat it.  I haven&#x27;t yet, but may use it in recipes someday.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  Smells wonderful !</li>
            <li> I just got my cocoa butter and it is fabulous. If you try it you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am primarily using it on eczema that has been plaguing me on my calves and unlike any other butter (including raw shea butter) it alleviates any recurrent itching, makes my skin feel wonderful, all with the wonderful smell of cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;As it can be used for cooking, I have tasted it as well and it has a light, fresh cocoa taste that should be wonderful for making my own healthy chocolate. This morning just for fun I even tried it for &amp;#34;Oil Pulling&amp;#34; and when I was done I had a pleasant taste of chocolate left behind. No other oil used for oil pulling has ever left me with that pleasant taste before.</li>
            <li> When I got this product in I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it. You can literally smell the freshness and high quality. It&#x27;s more than what I expected and at a great price!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product-as I did-if you want the HDPE food grade far with a screw cap to ensure freshness- because you won&#x27;t get it! At least I didn&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t tried the actual product yet (almost afraid to) because how am I to know it is what I was supposed to be buying? Seller-you need to contact your buyer-if you want to switch something up!  I am very displeased with the un-professionalism of this seller. I won&#x27;t buy from you again.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. I&#x27;ve been using it for everything from lotion bars to chaptstick to nibbling on because it&#x27;s so delicious!. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to as this is the first cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased, but the smell is intoxicating and strong, and it seems very high quality to me. I&#x27;ll absolutely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, mine did come in a screw top HDPE container, and was in medium sized chunks as the picture indicates. I purchased from the seller Natural-Cosmetics, fulfilled through amazon.</li>
            <li> better than any regular lotion I have used</li>
            <li> Recived bottle in a cylindrical shape .. Coca butter&#x27;s scent was great .. I liked it and i will order more</li>
            <li> RAW cocoa Butter! Good for scars and skin</li>
            <li> I received 16oz of high quality unprocessed cocoa butter in a screw top plastic jar, exactly as I ordered. I use it to make lip balms and body butters, works just great.  I experimented with doing some cooking with it too (pro tip: use in place of butter for baking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and packaged very well. The cocoa butter smells awesome and feels great on my skin. I am a first time buyer as well as user of raw cocoa butter ....but I am hooked this is way better than any store bought cream or oil. Although there are many uses for it, I wanted it for my skin. Really...Really great stuff!!! I&#x27;m VERY happy</li>
            <li> I know I read tons of reviews on here, and this def was one of those products you like or hate the smell. I hated the smell. I had bought multiple jars and sent all the un-opened jars back because I disliked the smell so much.</li>
            <li> If you want refined, in any sense of the word, you&#x27;re looking at the wrong product. It looks like a cocoa brick was shattered, and random shards were stuffed into a jar until it weighed 1 pound. I understand now why lotions that advertise that they have cocoa butter in them actually barely have any; at room temp, it&#x27;s hard as a rock. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, however, and is great for cooking as well as moisturizing. Although a saturated fat, my research had led me to believe it is one of the best lipids around for health, and it tastes great with both sweet and savory dishes. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, great on my skin I&#x27;ll use it with other organic oil such as Almond oil and olive oil, I&#x27;m well prepared for the winter coming up and summer next year caz every year my skin suffer drastically the texture is wonderful it melts in my mouth it has a smooth buttery flavor sugar free that I like it seems natural I would say it taste pure this is the taste of a virgin product.....lol.....I&#x27;m inlove!</li>
            <li> Fresh, just as it was stated in the description and came on a nice resealable plastic container. Smells wonderful and rich!</li>
            <li> I love the product, the product comes in a sealable container. When I opened the container I was very, pleased. There were chunks of the product in various sizes. I picked out a chunk and began rubbing it on my face, arm, neck. The application was very, creamy and smooth. Once that chunk melts down I start on another one.. This product is also very easy to share I can give my daughter a few, and it will last her awhile(long lasting). This is definitely a product you can be pleased with.</li>
            <li> I love this cocoa butter. It is rich, pure and fresh. I have used it for two purposes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I use it to moisturize/massage my scar after a surgery. It worked very well. It takes about 1 min. to warm it up in between my fingers. Then it is ready to be applied. As it is so pleasant, I also intend to make body butter with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) We use it to make chocolate hazelnut spread. Ingredients include ground roasted hazelnuts (500g), cacao butter (50g), raw organic cacao powder (50g), organic cane brown sugar (90g) and vanilla extract (1/2 tsp). The result is addictive and heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I highly recommend the product and will continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size jar of raw cocoa butter. I used it to make a moisturizing body butter and it worked perfectly. Saved me a trip to a specialty store also.</li>
            <li> I was worried with all the bad reviews for other products being rancid when received, but this butter is really sweet and fresh.  I highly recommend it for soaps and food creations</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is wonderful. Faint cocoa scent that dissipates quickly if applied topically. Tastes delicious and melts quickly and evenly. A winner!</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with it, and like that it was in a solid HDPE container. Used for making chocolate at home.</li>
            <li> I made a batch of white chocolate last evening using this cocoa butter. Tastes very good, but the reason I left off 1 star is because the fragrance is not as strong as an earlier purchase of cocoa discs. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find their company any more. I use the discs as vaginal suppositories. Works great. I don&#x27;t like using Premarin cream and Replens has so many ingredients with odd-sounding names, it&#x27;s hard to tell what one is using.</li>
            <li> raw enough to eat i love this product and look forward to ordering again soon :)</li>
            <li> I use this when I make lotion and its awesome. I do not have to add fragrance and it melts down very well.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is wonderful. It was packaged in a huge re-usable plastic container and it came in chunky pieces. It has a light chocolate scent which I personally love and it melts easily between your hands. Since I use it for my skin, I melted it down and whipped it but I&#x27;m having trouble keeping it whipped, it begins to solidify again after only few minutes.Other than that, I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> i really love the product, even tho it is a little difficult to get it out of the container.</li>
            <li> The day I received this jar of cocoa butter it was dry and very hard. I left it on the countertop all day long, it did not become soft at all. I had to chizel off a piece to mix into my Shea butter and coconut oils. It remained dry and lumpy and I used an electric hand mixer to add in. I&#x27;m displeased with this product. I&#x27;m not sure if this jar is an old jar of cocoa butter. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Good price, great product, very hard to find. Smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I received my first order of this stuff. It was so fresh and the smell was utterly divine. I couldnâ€™t believe it was legal. I would just open the lid, take a whiff, and know that life was good. I used it for all sorts of concoctions. When I was having gum issues I wanted to use baking soda and turmeric to brush my teeth but it stung and tasted disgusting, so I added organic coconut oil and melted down some of this yummy cocoa to make it palatable, and then it tasted fine and I cured the bleeding gums in no time. (I also gargled with licorice root.) I made skin treatments (facial scrubs and masks and lotions) adding all kinds of oils, vitamin C powder, herbs, and extracts . . . . my skin got better and better . . . and I also just rubbed it into my skin, unadulterated, so that I smelled like a huge hunk of chocolate and wanted to eat myself alive. When the terrible chocolate craving struck, late at night and I was in the middle of freakin nowhere, miles down on a dirt road, snowed in for days--I tried to whip up some chocolate treats, but I was not so successful. But what I made was actually edible--at least for a desperate palate--in spite of my reprehensible approach. (I didnâ€™t bother to follow instructions.) Bursting with ambition, I ordered a second round even before finishing the first container! I thought I might make some cocoa lotions for friends! (Sure, like that was ever going to happenâ€”what I really wanted was lots of chocolate on hand.) But lo and behold! the next batch of cocoa was dryer, flakier, covered with white powder and white spots--you know, the way chocolate gets if you let it sit around for a long time. (As if YOU ever let chocolate sit around for more than two minutes!) And the really sad thing was, it didnâ€™t even smell good. OK, at that time, I was trying to get a mortgageâ€”and I had a very tight deadline to do itâ€”and right then I had to replace my laptop because I had spilled like a teaspoon of water on it, murdering it instantly, and this became a huge ordealâ€”everything went wrong for a week and I could not get accessâ€”and all this just when the company I worked for was being taken over by a bigger company who was demanding tons of &amp;#34;onboarding&amp;#34; paperwork and training (on top of the 40+ hours work I had to do anyway). I don&#x27;t even like the word &amp;#34;onboarding&amp;#34;â€“never haveâ€”itâ€™s too much like water boarding. And this was Christmas/New Yearâ€™s Eve week and what I am saying is who the heck had time to call Amazon and ask for a replacement of my cocoa that I didnâ€™t even need to begin with? And I wasnâ€™t particularly concerned because Amazon has such amazing customer service. I TRUSTED Plant Guru to do the right thing! (I have serious reverse trust issues.) So, time passed. Weeks maybe? A month or two or more? WHO CARES! I am a very loyal, VERY long-term Amazon customer (I may be the very first Amazon customer!). I have ordered hundreds of things and NEVER complained. Read my dossier! Do your homework Plant Guru! I have written good reviews for products I didnâ€™t even try yet! I am a dream customer! Donâ€™t just treat me like some lying, cheating no-good piece of . . . dusty cocoa? Haven&#x27;t you heard? The customer is always right, and if you donâ€™t buy them apples, then just use your noggin! I told you I LOVED the first container but the second was no good. Why would I make this up? (OK, maybe some people go to extremes for a free container of raw cocoa, but most people have neither the time nor the inclination.) In all fairness, as soon as you started acting all smarmy with me, I told you I would write a bad review if you did not do the right thing. This IS Amazon.com! (What are you thinking?) So then Plant Guru asks me to send them photos of the bad cocoa and the good cocoa I still had, even though photos would prove nothing. (Of course the cocoa could have gone bad after it arrived.) (Call me a luddite but I do not photograph everything I eat and Ihad more urgent things to do than photograph and email dusty chunks of cocoa to customer service reps who do not even know what customer service means.) But, regardless, why treat me with suspicion? Why make me jump through hoops? They kept asking me why I had not contacted them sooner, which is a legitimate question. I told them the truth: I meant to, but a LOT was going on in my life at that time. I simply had not been able to do it sooner but hello! Here I am! No time like the present! Now, by this time, I was losing my home and everything I had invested in it, which was everything I had. I was approved for the mortgage but I had been duped into a terrible real estate deal, so it did me no good. I was trying to figure out where I would go and how I would pay for it. And here as Plant Guru wanting photos of their dried out cocoa from me. I decided that this was one dysfunctional relationship I could end immediately. Friends, do not choose the path I traveled . . . do not put your faith in false prophets or real estate tycoons with charming demeanors. I donâ€™t know much, but I know one thing: when your life is going to hell in a handbasket, Plant Guru will not be your salvation. In fact, in your darkest hour, this Guru will take your money and run. And when you give them the chance to make amends? They will treat you with distrust and disdain. Thatâ€™s the problem with Gurusâ€”they always think they are right and everyone else is wrong.</li>
            <li> Perfect for lotion heavenly smell great for skin :) i heard that cocoa butter has 3 times more antioxidents than in blueberries :)</li>
            <li> There are a lot of cocoa butter sellers on Amazon and this was my first order from this one. It arrived really quickly (almost a week before the estimate) and the butter is really good. Better than the average. Nice aroma, good color. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it with the lavender oil and coconut oil to make wonderful body butter. I will never buy lotion again, too many chemicals.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve used it to thin dark chocolate for dipping and as a moisturizer. This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> Great amount, and great product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of cocoa is amazing. Guru is of great qualityâ˜º. I have added the cocoa to my lotions and serums and even put a lil on my wrist and wear it as perfume.</li>
            <li> Using to make my own body creams with essential oils. This way I can avoid all the unhealthy additives in commercially produced products.</li>
            <li> What can you say about 100% cocoa butter?  I&#x27;ve made chocolate with it twice and both times have been successful.  I have not had a chance to compare this with any other product.  If I do, I&#x27;ll let you know.  In the meantime, it&#x27;s raw, it&#x27;s cocoa butter and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This is not to be consumed. I guess it wold be good for skin care or other external uses but it is not food quality. The description was misleading. Returned to Amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Have used this cocoa butter for making home products (lotions and stuff). It smells great and has made some great lotions. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this in making body products.  It smells amazing and sometimes I just rub it into my skin.  It&#x27;s great for making soaps, lotions, and just using it in general.</li>
            <li> What happened to it? The previous order I placed (in March 2014), the butter came in a similar jar, but it was from Earth Tone Essentials. The butter was delicious and the smell was intoxicating! To re-order, I pulled out my old oder and this Plant Guru stuff came: similar, but not the same, quite inferior, actually. I&#x27;m wondering how one product not just simply disappeared, but also got substituted for something else in my order history. What&#x27;s up with that, Amazon Prime? Bait and switch? I&#x27;m attaching pictures of what I got before. Again, I went back to my old orders to get the same stuff and got this not-so-good unknown to me brand. Baffled. This product is useable, but not nearly as good. Anyone knows what happened here?</li>
            <li> love this stuff bought to put in home made lotions. has a very lite cocoa smell. love it all by itself your skin really drinks it up and makes your skin so soft. nice to only use one thing on your skin and it does so much. will buy again.</li>
            <li> It seems it is not fresh</li>
            <li> good cocoa butter..does not have that much of a coca fragrance,its very mild but seems like a nice product</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I use this to mix with other natural products to make a nite cream. I have been using this cocoa butter for about 4 weeks now. I seen my daughter this weekend and she said my skin looks smooth and soft I am 56 years old.</li>
            <li> This butter smells so nice, and I love you can use this cocoa butter for food as well as for skincare. I have already used it for some chocolate candy I made. I will be using this for my skincare too :)</li>
            <li> This is not good for cooking with (bad flavor), but would be ok to use in skin care products! (nice light scent)</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can make this into great lotion.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering this again.  I love the smell and what it does to my face and skin.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Smells like rich chocolate. Absolutely worth it! Good amount and it is definitely real cocoa butter. I will order again. I use it for body butter recipes! So good</li>
            <li> Great container. Great quality. Fast shipping and easy storage. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for the price. I will always buy this brand.  I use it in food recipes and it is smooth and delicious with a very strong chocolate flavor and aroma -- just wonderful!</li>
            <li> This has been a bad experence since the moment this product arrived. First of all this product does not smell nor look like raw cocoa butter. I have purchased cocoa butter from Whole Foods and it is a night and day difference but Whole Foods charges $26.99 for 1lb so that&#x27;s why I took a chance with this company. Second, I bought this product to use to make chocolate. The cocoa butter comes in a plastic container with a screw cap. No safety seal or anything to assure me it is safe to eat. So I contacted the seller with my concerns and although they disagreed with me, they stated in the email:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;  No, our cocoa butter is not a low grade quality neither is deodorized and its safe to eat, and lastly is is always fresh. Not a problem we will send you a prepaid label today for you to return the item back us. As soon as we get the product back we will issue you a refund.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HA! Riiight! 20 min later I get an email from Amazon with a link to print the return label and a note the I had to PAY the return shipping charges...... Not worth the effort for $15 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will keep this stuff.and figure something to do with it. Already went back to Whole Foods for the good stuff and made my chocolate. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Ignoring the listing&#x27;s health claims actually for raw cocoa powder and concentrating on the cocoa butter (which is what this is), this appears to be very good stuff. Having little to compare it with, however, this is subjective. I&#x27;ve smelled the wonderful chocolatey smell and have already had it straight and then melted it with equal parts coconut oil and raw cocoa powder to produce a perfect bitter-sweet chocolate (my first!) and plan to do lots more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is not filled with melted cocoa butter but with the chunks you see pictured. Actually, these chunks make it easier to get out of the jar, because if it was solid, it would be tough to remove it since each chunk is so hard at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to have this source. Let&#x27;s hope it stays as high quality as the batch I received.</li>
            <li> I was impressed from when I first opened the package and smelled the strong chocolate aroma. I bought it to make my own skin care products, but I had to taste it when I smelled it. It tastes like unsweetened chocolate to me. You can tell it is very high quality from the texture and from the amount of flavor and aroma it has. It melted down beautifully with coconut oil and peppermint oil for an eczema treatment and with mango butter for a lip treatment. Unfortunately, my skin is extremely sensitive to change, so it didn&#x27;t do anything to heal my eczema, but it made the parts of my skin that were already healthy so soft. I will be giving it to a lucky family member who was blessed with better skin so they can enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Strong chocolate smell.  Grates easily with the finest grating side of the grater.  This is a part of my whipped body butter concoction,</li>
            <li> This was just the cocoa butter that I was looking for.  Perfect. thank you thank you thank you thank you.</li>
            <li> perfect for making homemade chocolate bars. Great flavor.</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated. I am happy.</li>
            <li> Smells incredible, can&#x27;t wait to start using</li>
            <li> I wish I had researched this product more carefully before I bought it, because I thought it was a food product, but it has no required food labeling.  It is misleading to claim that it is a raw product and doesn&#x27;t have to meet FDA food labeling requirements, because of course cocoa butter has to be processed. Claiming that it is in a food grade plastic jar does not mean that it is safe to eat.  I don&#x27;t want to give my family e. coli from this.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  I am glad it came in a container.</li>
            <li> I have started making my own soaps and the mixture of oils and butters are amazing.  Cocoa butter has been a staple in my life for a long time.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a safety seal of some sort but since I cook with it all bacteria does die.  Great smell of cacao too.</li>
            <li> I used my cocoa butter and it worked just fine. I would order again</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells so much like chocolate, I use this to make home made body butter, this is so moisturizing, and smells terrific, I added peppermint essential oil to my mix and now my body butter smells like mint chocolate! Delish!</li>
            <li> Smells like chocolate and if you melt it for a minute in the microwave makes a great moisturizer. maybe not for face though, made me break out a little but great for eye area to prevent fine lines, body and dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying raw cocoa butter. I bought this one because it seemed to be packaged well for mailing. It seems to be of good quality and certainly made wonderful chocolate!</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and turns out to be very smooth when melted.</li>
            <li> Great product. Raw, Pure, Sensational !!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was packaged very well, I love the smell. I love the quality of the product.  I would definitely recommend this cocoa butter for use in lip balms, body butters, and lotions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter to use on my granddaughter for her skin due to an accident.  It has a nice scent and very creamy.  I even purchased a jar for myself.  You receive a large amount for the price.</li>
            <li> love this smells wonderful used to make theething gel .its great</li>
            <li> I really dont know why anyone would give this product a bad review its amazing and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other raw cocoa butters, but this is my favorite!  I use this to make my own shea &amp; cocoa butter whipped moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love love love love. I am in heaven. I am defeating the purpose but I almost would up to 4 showers a day just so I could use this. I made some of the best body lotion ever and it&#x27;s working well in this fall weather. The scent is delectable and it&#x27;s easy to use. Was delivered quickly and packaged perfectly. Thank you.</li>
            <li> used it in my chocolate, chunks which made it crunchy and nice.</li>
