            <li>Totally love this soothing night cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK moisturizer for night time.  </li>
            <li>After speaking with dermatologist, I bought the Equate brand from Walmart and have seen better results from using it.</li>
            <li>I love them all</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>If you look closely at a lot of the movie actresses, their hands sure do give away their age.</li>
            <li>Also so many people forget that they should put cream on their ear lobes, as they show wrinkle.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better now than it has in years ..</li>
            <li>Love these Roc products.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this cream as the lines around my mouth have really softened a lot.  </li>
            <li>Goes on non greasy, and has helped fine lines.</li>
            <li>Few words; just wonderful!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and has no smell - which I like in a face cream - but I have not seen any visable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>that is fabulous</li>
            <li>It is a very light cream &amp; is absorbed into the skin quickly</li>
            <li>I think creams which make these claims rely on the customer&#x27;s wish for it to be true.</li>
            <li>In two weeks, there is a tremendous improvement in my skin.</li>

            <li>Have had large brown spots on side of my face.  </li>
            <li>, you get a fair amount (probably enough for several months of use every night), it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and it prevents my face from getting dry.</li>
            <li>Fine lines weren&#x27;t as noticeable &amp; deeper wrinkles weren&#x27;t as deep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and I have not broken out from it.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell any difference from this product and the ones I purchase on the store shelf.</li>
            <li>&amp; you don&#x27;t have to use that much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;that one really does the job.</li>
            <li>This product is very soothing when you put it on.</li>
            <li>When taking from jar, it feels a bit thick, but it glides on the skin very smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried many other brands(mainly Olay ProX &amp; Regenerist) and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the results(I hardly noticed any).</li>
            <li>If I get up to go to the bathroom at night, I&#x27;ll put a little more cream around my mouth.</li>
            <li>Used twice caused major breakout every where using the day mosturizer.not good for me wish I could return it.going back to not uding heavy night crteam.</li>
            <li>I found my first jar of this product on the clearance rack of my local store and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This cream has a different feel than the Brilliance kit - it is much thicker and doesn&#x27;t feel as silky when you put it on but for me it works just as well.  </li>

            <li>and it does seem to calm my skin down and keep irritation at bay.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not for my skin.  It burned on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as others and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I just bought this cream at Walmart today.  I tried it tonight and it feels great on my skin.  I keep wanting to reapply it because it feels like water on my face.  It is so cooling it feels like it pulls the heat out of my skin and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face.  I will see how it does over time.  Oh yeah, it was $24.95 at Walmart.  I&#x27;ll probably come back in about less than a week and give you an update.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Great for winter time. Couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores this year. Glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream 3 weeks ago, and have been using it every night.  It feels good going on.  It&#x27;s not greasy and I have not broken out from it.  The scent is very pleasant.  I don&#x27;t know if it does anything for wrinkles, but is is definitely a good moisturizer and it does seem to calm my skin down and keep irritation at bay.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Totally love this soothing night cream.  Can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> Thick night cream from RoC.  Every product I&#x27;ve ever tried from RoC is made well; this one is no exception. I use this on my hands at bedtime as well as on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review after I already used to entire jar.  It&#x27;s an OK moisturizer for night time.  I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic changes in my skin.  Be careful when applying this product right before bed, you will need some time to let it &amp;#34;soak in.&amp;#34; If you don&#x27;t it could bleach your pillowcases like it did mine.</li>
            <li> Thought better results would have come from using this product, I was disappointed to say the least.  After speaking with dermatologist, I bought the Equate brand from Walmart and have seen better results from using it.</li>
            <li> i like it.  smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every night!</li>
            <li> What a great buy! The product Arrived on time, the product is authentic and offered me great results. I already used Roc products before. I love them all</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product. It&#x27;s very easy on the skin. When taking from jar, it feels a bit thick, but it glides on the skin very smoothly and absorbs quickly. I was very impressed. After using it for a week, my skin has improved in softness and brightness. However, I do not see any visble changes towards the wrinkle repair.</li>
            <li> Few words; just wonderful!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell any difference from this product and the ones I purchase on the store shelf. I have a Loreal brand that does just as good.</li>
            <li> This is the second ROC night cream I have used.  I started using [[ASIN:B00387F41W RoC BRILLIANCE Night Recharging Moisturizer, Activating Serum &amp; Recharging Creme]] because I was able to get it for a reasonable price, but after the price went up significantly I decided to try something new.  This cream has a different feel than the Brilliance kit - it is much thicker and doesn&#x27;t feel as silky when you put it on but for me it works just as well.  I live where it is very dry and this cream does a good job moisturizing my face.  When I wash my face in the morning I can actually feel that some of the cream is still on the surface.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cakey or sticky once it dries but it does seem to form a layer on your face which I assume keeps the moisture in and prevents your skin from drying.  Overall I really like the cream - the price was right, you get a fair amount (probably enough for several months of use every night), it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and it prevents my face from getting dry.</li>
            <li> I was using the other Roc night cream, but I bought 2 of the Multi Correxion Night cream.  I am very pleased with this cream as the lines around my mouth have really softened a lot.  If I get up to go to the bathroom at night, I&#x27;ll put a little more cream around my mouth. It is a very light cream &amp; is absorbed into the skin quickly &amp; you don&#x27;t have to use that much.  I also use it on my hands &amp; ear lobes at night. If you look closely at a lot of the movie actresses, their hands sure do give away their age. Also so many people forget that they should put cream on their ear lobes, as they show wrinkle. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and has no smell - which I like in a face cream - but I have not seen any visable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the claims will hold up. I think creams which make these claims rely on the customer&#x27;s wish for it to be true.</li>
            <li> this product is not worth a penny....get the one in a red jar...that is fabulous&lt;br /&gt;that one really does the job.</li>
            <li> Have had large brown spots on side of my face.  Listening to dermatologists, I had heard that AHA (alpha hydroxy) goes below the skins surface to help soften the underlying tissue.  It worked great for me.  Been using about a month now &amp; while I still have spots, they have been minimized &amp; lightened.  My skin looks better now than it has in years .. I am very happy with this product &amp; look forward to putting it on every night.  Feels &amp; smells great to me.  Don&#x27;t know if it will work for everyone, but happy I tried it.</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this cream. Goes on non greasy, and has helped fine lines. Will never use any other night cream again!</li>
            <li> Love these Roc products.  They actually do what they are advertised to do.  In two weeks, there is a tremendous improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I found my first jar of this product on the clearance rack of my local store and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;d tried many other brands(mainly Olay ProX &amp; Regenerist) and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the results(I hardly noticed any). After just a couple of weeks of using this product, there was noticeable improvement. Fine lines weren&#x27;t as noticeable &amp; deeper wrinkles weren&#x27;t as deep. My pores were smaller &amp; the tone of my skin had evened out as well. In fact, after about a month of use, one of the ladies on staff at my dentist office stopped mid-sentence and blurted out &amp;#34;You have really beautiful skin,You know that? I bet you hear that all the time.&amp;#34; The reality was that I had NEVER heard that before, prior to using this product. I&#x27;m thrilled with it.:-)</li>
            <li> I had tried other products by Roc which are quite good. I thought this cream would meet the same standards, but it didn´t.</li>
            <li> I toned &amp; make my skin feel refresh in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product is very soothing when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I saw much marked improvement from this product because I was unable to use it for very long. My biggest complaint was the smell. It wasn&#x27;t a bad smell just a highly fragrant product and I personally don&#x27;t like strong smells on my face while I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> Used twice caused major breakout every where using the day mosturizer.not good for me wish I could return it.going back to not uding heavy night crteam.</li>
