            <li>I love this product, it has made my skin feel so good</li>
            <li>I have to honestly question the sellers morals.  </li>
            <li>got carried away and took some of the skin off my nose (healing nicely).</li>
            <li>Nice durable hemp fibers used to make this.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful product, so soft!</li>
            <li>Good follow-up from the seller who genuinely cares about their customer.  </li>

            <li>I love the body scrubber too.  </li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of these for the rest of the family.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its an awesome product, just give it time to lose the gassy odor which is not left on your body at all.  </li>
            <li>I hesitated to pay the price but was glad I did.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing and you&#x27;ll swear you&#x27;ve never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>You can feel it working to exfoliate, yet it is very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is my first time of using a hemp product and I am delighted with the quality of the product and also the quickness of the service.  </li>
            <li>Great product, no harsh smells.</li>
            <li>I like how much softer my skin feels with a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li>The size was good however the material was much rougher than the one we had before.</li>
            <li>I really like using the glove its alot lighter and soaps up as good as the scrubber.</li>
            <li>When pairing this scrubber with a safe vegetable based unscented soap and using coconut oil as a moisturizer after the shower, the acne on my back has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>In fact, I liked it so much; I ordered three more as gifts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also so great to be able to throw it in the washing machine and dry it in the drier</li>
            <li>leaving your skin smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>I wanted my skin to have a smooth look and</li>
            <li>feel!I have been happy with prior purchases from DeLaine&#x27;s Kitchen and Bath..</li>
            <li>Excellent at exfoliating dead skin cells too.</li>
            <li>This feels SO great, especially the glove.</li>
            <li>All natural hemp product is washable and good for the earth.  </li>
            <li>Wow, by far the best item I bought for myself.</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t get musty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This back scrubber is amazing!</li>
            <li>Excited to see what else De Laines comes up with.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for an earth friendly exfoliate</li>
            <li>Body Scrubber, Exfoliating, All Natural Hemp,... , would have given five star, as it is the best back scrubber I have bought; the loss of a star is the odor.  </li>
            <li>i have dry skin works great</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin clean and tingly.</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin &amp; this hemp body scrubber feels very good on my skin, not irritable or scratchy really give me a good scrub, especially after a day at the construction site in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>So Wonderful I could hardly believe it.</li>
            <li>The scrubber works great without being scratchy or rough on skin, my arms, elbows and knees feel noticeably softer.  </li>
            <li>It feels so good massaging my back &amp; &#x27;backside&#x27;..</li>
            <li>Does the job.l Feels good on your back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good back scrubber for  years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also got extremely sensitive skin and have many skin allergies, so I always make sure whatever touches my skin is safe and natural.</li>
            <li>You hang it in the shower and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The hand mitt makes cleaning the rest of your body quickly, and you can feel the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>Works very well -- easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So they were my first choice!</li>
            <li>Great to have such attention to professional service!</li>
            <li>I saw this scrubber on Amazon liked that it fit my criteria...#1 not to rough or scratchy</li>
            <li>So far my husband i and both enjoy them!</li>
            <li>Much better than those old sponge things that I used to use</li>
            <li>with fresh cut oranges and lemon.  </li>
            <li>It is so worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money now</li>
            <li>I work in the customer service industry at a high end fine dining restaurant.  </li>
            <li>First use, this scrubber seemed almost *too* rough, but for subsequent showers it has been perfect.  </li>
            <li>I am able to exfoliate with this long item and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I washed this in the washing machine before use (with free &amp; clear natural laundry detergent :) ).</li>
            <li>So far the handles are still attached, but I have been more gentle with them since.</li>
            <li>These seem very durable and do a good job of scrubbing without being too rough.  </li>
            <li>And my heals are so much softer!  </li>
            <li>Ready for summer sandals!  </li>
            <li>Supporting this business is a crime.</li>
            <li>I really love how this scrubber feels on my back.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does have a gas smell to it at first</li>
            <li>but it gets more use than the back scrubber now.</li>
            <li>Would be better for a foot scrubber only.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to be as drawn to the hand mitt as I have been, and find myself using it even more than the back scrubber.  </li>
            <li>First time using hemp to exfoliate - works very well!  </li>
            <li>It is such a strong smell I gagged.  </li>
            <li>It is very well constructed and the mitt is large and roomy.  </li>
            <li>The back scrubber stretches, and gets kind of narrow (still works fine)</li>
            <li>Really cleans hard to get to areas good.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Jerry.</li>
            <li>Holds it&#x27;s body and really does the job of exfoliating and massaging.  </li>
            <li>Really well made.</li>
            <li>I feel so much cleaner using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is just what I was looking for it works perfectly thanks</li>
            <li>There is no way the 5 star reviews are real.  </li>
            <li>They both hold liquid soap very well, lather up well.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it to men.</li>
            <li>Received the product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are very well made, sturdy &amp; durable.</li>
            <li>Ticks and other things love to bite me, this helps me not allow them to attach.  </li>
            <li>The length is also adequate for this rather large and no-longer-flexible male, though I will say that one time I heard some stitches rip as I maneuvered the scrubber into position.</li>
            <li>My skin has recently became very sensitive, so I needed to find something to use in the shower that works without inflaming my skin that I can keep germ free.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and feel so much cleaner!  </li>
            <li>Smells funny though because of the natural fibers</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>He likes the large back scrubber, he has problem skin in hot weather</li>
            <li>Update: 10/17/15, still performs nicely with little, if any, apparent wear.</li>
            <li>My new luxury ... sitting in the tub massaging my feet with my new scrubber mitten!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s held up very well thus far.</li>
            <li>#2 long enough to be able to hold in both hands</li>
            <li>Natural Hemp is an outstanding and long lasting fiber!</li>
            <li>Having both a mitten and scrubber with handles helps to soften hard to reach places and feels so good across your back...</li>
            <li>This scrubber is big and long and easy to grip to use without the handles.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>so I gave it to her and the fabric is rough which is awesome so that I can reach the itch behind my back while I&#x27;m showering.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My back thanks you!</li>
            <li>The small one would be better if thinner</li>
            <li>i am sorry to say i am not happy with it, i don&#x27;t like how long and loose the scrubber gets, it stretches way too much and looses the ability to really give a good scrub, i was really hoping i would be great</li>
            <li>The back scrubber is soft enough that I use it dry with no water and it does a wonderful job exfoliating those hard to reach places on my back.  </li>
            <li>They are not overly abrasive, i teally like that because i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves me soft to the touch from head to toe.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 86 year old mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li>and my youngest has really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s a natural product and that it survived a run through the wash, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>This hemp scrubber gets the job done &amp; leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; renewed.</li>
            <li>So far these have held up well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I felt it so rough on my skin, and I was about to return it.</li>
            <li>To let it dry, I hang them both by my window, and my whole room will smell like lavender body wash.</li>
            <li>It provides circulation and leaves my back soft.</li>
            <li>I have arthritis and just couldn&#x27;t get enough pressure with my back brush to really scrub my back.</li>
            <li>I have owned other body scrubbers that were scatchy and uncomfortable, but this one is gentle and effective.</li>

            <li> Its an awesome product, just give it time to lose the gassy odor which is not left on your body at all.  </li>
            <li> I hesitated to pay the price but was glad I did.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing and you&#x27;ll swear you&#x27;ve never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working to exfoliate, yet it is very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is my first time of using a hemp product and I am delighted with the quality of the product and also the quickness of the service.  </li>
            <li> Great product, no harsh smells.</li>
            <li> I like how much softer my skin feels with a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li> The size was good however the material was much rougher than the one we had before.</li>
            <li> I really like using the glove its alot lighter and soaps up as good as the scrubber.</li>
            <li> When pairing this scrubber with a safe vegetable based unscented soap and using coconut oil as a moisturizer after the shower, the acne on my back has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> In fact, I liked it so much; I ordered three more as gifts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so great to be able to throw it in the washing machine and dry it in the drier</li>
            <li> leaving your skin smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> I wanted my skin to have a smooth look and</li>
            <li> feel!I have been happy with prior purchases from DeLaine&#x27;s Kitchen and Bath..</li>
            <li> Excellent at exfoliating dead skin cells too.</li>
            <li> This feels SO great, especially the glove.</li>
            <li> All natural hemp product is washable and good for the earth.  </li>
            <li> Wow, by far the best item I bought for myself.</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t get musty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This back scrubber is amazing!</li>
            <li> Excited to see what else De Laines comes up with.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for an earth friendly exfoliate</li>
            <li> Body Scrubber, Exfoliating, All Natural Hemp,... , would have given five star, as it is the best back scrubber I have bought; the loss of a star is the odor.  </li>
            <li> i have dry skin works great</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin clean and tingly.</li>
            <li> very sensitive skin &amp; this hemp body scrubber feels very good on my skin, not irritable or scratchy really give me a good scrub, especially after a day at the construction site in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> So Wonderful I could hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> The scrubber works great without being scratchy or rough on skin, my arms, elbows and knees feel noticeably softer.  </li>
            <li> It feels so good massaging my back &amp; &#x27;backside&#x27;..</li>
            <li> Does the job.l Feels good on your back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good back scrubber for  years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also got extremely sensitive skin and have many skin allergies, so I always make sure whatever touches my skin is safe and natural.</li>
            <li> You hang it in the shower and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The hand mitt makes cleaning the rest of your body quickly, and you can feel the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well -- easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So they were my first choice!</li>
            <li> Great to have such attention to professional service!</li>
            <li> I saw this scrubber on Amazon liked that it fit my criteria...#1 not to rough or scratchy</li>
            <li> So far my husband i and both enjoy them!</li>
            <li> Much better than those old sponge things that I used to use</li>
            <li> with fresh cut oranges and lemon.  </li>
            <li> It is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money now</li>
            <li> I work in the customer service industry at a high end fine dining restaurant.  </li>
            <li> First use, this scrubber seemed almost *too* rough, but for subsequent showers it has been perfect.  </li>
            <li> I am able to exfoliate with this long item and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I washed this in the washing machine before use (with free &amp; clear natural laundry detergent :) ).</li>
            <li> So far the handles are still attached, but I have been more gentle with them since.</li>
            <li> These seem very durable and do a good job of scrubbing without being too rough.  </li>
            <li> And my heals are so much softer!  </li>
            <li> Ready for summer sandals!  </li>
            <li> Supporting this business is a crime.</li>
            <li> I really love how this scrubber feels on my back.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a gas smell to it at first</li>
            <li> but it gets more use than the back scrubber now.</li>
            <li> Would be better for a foot scrubber only.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to be as drawn to the hand mitt as I have been, and find myself using it even more than the back scrubber.  </li>
            <li> First time using hemp to exfoliate - works very well!  </li>
            <li> It is such a strong smell I gagged.  </li>
            <li> It is very well constructed and the mitt is large and roomy.  </li>
            <li> The back scrubber stretches, and gets kind of narrow (still works fine)</li>
            <li> Really cleans hard to get to areas good.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Jerry.</li>
            <li> Holds it&#x27;s body and really does the job of exfoliating and massaging.  </li>
            <li> Really well made.</li>
            <li> I feel so much cleaner using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is just what I was looking for it works perfectly thanks</li>
            <li> There is no way the 5 star reviews are real.  </li>
            <li> They both hold liquid soap very well, lather up well.  </li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend it to men.</li>
            <li> Received the product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are very well made, sturdy &amp; durable.</li>
            <li> Ticks and other things love to bite me, this helps me not allow them to attach.  </li>
            <li> The length is also adequate for this rather large and no-longer-flexible male, though I will say that one time I heard some stitches rip as I maneuvered the scrubber into position.</li>
            <li> My skin has recently became very sensitive, so I needed to find something to use in the shower that works without inflaming my skin that I can keep germ free.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and feel so much cleaner!  </li>
            <li> Smells funny though because of the natural fibers</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> He likes the large back scrubber, he has problem skin in hot weather</li>
            <li> Update: 10/17/15, still performs nicely with little, if any, apparent wear.</li>
            <li> My new luxury ... sitting in the tub massaging my feet with my new scrubber mitten!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s held up very well thus far.</li>
            <li> #2 long enough to be able to hold in both hands</li>
            <li> Natural Hemp is an outstanding and long lasting fiber!</li>
            <li> Having both a mitten and scrubber with handles helps to soften hard to reach places and feels so good across your back...</li>
            <li> This scrubber is big and long and easy to grip to use without the handles.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> so I gave it to her and the fabric is rough which is awesome so that I can reach the itch behind my back while I&#x27;m showering.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My back thanks you!</li>
            <li> The small one would be better if thinner</li>
            <li> i am sorry to say i am not happy with it, i don&#x27;t like how long and loose the scrubber gets, it stretches way too much and looses the ability to really give a good scrub, i was really hoping i would be great</li>
            <li> The back scrubber is soft enough that I use it dry with no water and it does a wonderful job exfoliating those hard to reach places on my back.  </li>
            <li> They are not overly abrasive, i teally like that because i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves me soft to the touch from head to toe.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 86 year old mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> and my youngest has really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a natural product and that it survived a run through the wash, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> This hemp scrubber gets the job done &amp; leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; renewed.</li>
            <li> So far these have held up well.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I felt it so rough on my skin, and I was about to return it.</li>
            <li> To let it dry, I hang them both by my window, and my whole room will smell like lavender body wash.</li>
            <li> It provides circulation and leaves my back soft.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and just couldn&#x27;t get enough pressure with my back brush to really scrub my back.</li>
            <li> I have owned other body scrubbers that were scatchy and uncomfortable, but this one is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> its plenty long enough that I don&#x27;t even use the strings, I just grab each end of the scrubber itself and scrub away.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m don&#x27;t with it, I wring it out and hang it to dry for the next time.  </li>
            <li> THE MITTEN IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO COVER MY HAND AND THE OTHER ITEM IS NOT LONG ENOUGH</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and yet firm.  </li>
            <li> I do not really know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m appalled someone thinks it is a good idea to sell this product.  </li>
            <li> I struggle with acne, and recently it spread down my back.</li>
            <li> no funny smell when left to dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> I like this scrubber because I can wash and dry it.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> , this has helped my dry skin a lot, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my youngest&#x27;s skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li> and it takes awhile for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Goodbye dry or itchy skin!</li>
            <li> I found them to be fairly rough</li>
            <li> She said it is too rough on her skin.  </li>
            <li> The one we received is well made and performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really felt compelled to write a review before.</li>
            <li> But, I had read a review that this was too rough.</li>
            <li> A little scratchy, not much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; with average arm length and have found this to be just about the correct size.</li>
            <li> Its heavy when wet</li>
            <li> I use it very carefully because it can be a little scratchy.</li>
            <li> While there is a slight odor to start, it goes away with washing and continual use.  </li>
            <li> A previous reviewer mentioned a smell, there is a slight odor</li>
            <li> All those little nerve endings are screaming ...</li>
            <li> but it goes away after using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> however be careful if you have a patch of skin that is already irritated it will make it worse.</li>
            <li> Usually the handles break on scrubbers.</li>
            <li> Really not able to soften up with water or use.</li>
            <li> Helps you get to all those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far with mildew or bad smell on either.</li>
            <li> I fully understand how detrimental reviews mean to a business.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> By the way, if you leave it wet, it doesn&#x27;t get bad smell.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing glove is, to me, merely icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> , boy am i sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve promised myself to never give a terrible review even if they deserved it.  </li>

            <li> I saw this scrubber on Amazon liked that it fit my criteria...#1 not to rough or scratchy #2 long enough to be able to hold in both hands so I could scrub my back! I love the scrubber and the mitt is an added bonus!  Now that summertime is quickly approaching I wanted my skin to have a smooth look and feel!I have been happy with prior purchases from DeLaine&#x27;s Kitchen and Bath.. So they were my first choice!</li>
            <li> I have only used it once since receiving it but I can tell it&#x27;s just what I needed for my back, Thanks, Jerry.</li>
            <li> Wow! I love it.  Makes my skin so soft and feel so much cleaner!  Super easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t get musty.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great gift for friends and family too.</li>
            <li> It is the best body scrubber I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Excellent at exfoliating dead skin cells too.</li>
            <li> So far my husband i and both enjoy them! He likes the large back scrubber, he has problem skin in hot weather so it helps keep the dirt out. I like how much softer my skin feels with a good scrubbing. They are not overly abrasive, i teally like that because i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Washes up well. The smell is off putting but it is made of hemp. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> These worked great.  Spouse liked the glove so I gave it to her and the fabric is rough which is awesome so that I can reach the itch behind my back while I&#x27;m showering.  Smells funny though because of the natural fibers but it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> My new luxury ... sitting in the tub massaging my feet with my new scrubber mitten!  All those little nerve endings are screaming ... MORE!  And my heals are so much softer!  Ready for summer sandals!  I love the body scrubber too.  It feels so good massaging my back &amp; &#x27;backside&#x27;..but being a bath person the mitten is best for me.  My husband is enjoying the body scrubber!  The material is amazing.  It&#x27;s soft and yet firm.  Holds it&#x27;s body and really does the job of exfoliating and massaging.  Much better than those old sponge things that I used to use and I LOVE that its washable and dryable!!  Really well made.</li>
            <li> Really cleans hard to get to areas good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this scrubber. I struggle with acne, and recently it spread down my back. I&#x27;ve also got extremely sensitive skin and have many skin allergies, so I always make sure whatever touches my skin is safe and natural. I washed this in the washing machine before use (with free &amp; clear natural laundry detergent :) ). When pairing this scrubber with a safe vegetable based unscented soap and using coconut oil as a moisturizer after the shower, the acne on my back has greatly improved. To keep the scrubber sanitary, I&#x27;ve been washing it in my washing machine 1-2x/week and it&#x27;s held up very well thus far. It has also softened up with repeated use and washing, but still provides a perfect amount of exfoliation for me.</li>
            <li> I like this scrubber because I can wash and dry it.  I use it very carefully because it can be a little scratchy.</li>
            <li> Body Scrubber, Exfoliating, All Natural Hemp,... , would have given five star, as it is the best back scrubber I have bought; the loss of a star is the odor.  In spite of hand washing and leaving in the sun for a day some of the odor remained.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best! Natural Hemp is an outstanding and long lasting fiber!</li>
            <li> I love the deal. The back scrubber part stretches out - I didn&#x27;t like that. It does is job but doesn&#x27;t help the soap to lather up.</li>
            <li> These are great...LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has made my skin feel so good however be careful if you have a patch of skin that is already irritated it will make it worse. I use this twice a week and my skin feels amazing. Product came on time as promised. Excited to see what else De Laines comes up with.</li>
            <li> Leaves stain run-off in the bathtub!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow, by far the best item I bought for myself. this is great, I have plenty of yard , tree&#x27;s . Ticks and other things love to bite me, this helps me not allow them to attach.  I am able to exfoliate with this long item and it works fantastic. I feel so much cleaner using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what a great gift Idea.  Thank you for providing this item.</li>
            <li> Totally superior to loofa products! It feels amazing and you&#x27;ll swear you&#x27;ve never felt so clean. I would recommend this to anyone! In fact, I liked it so much; I ordered three more as gifts.</li>
            <li> this is just what I was looking for it works perfectly thanks</li>
            <li> Love the product. Is as represented and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for an earth friendly exfoliate I landed on this product.  I have to honestly question the sellers morals.  I work in the customer service industry at a high end fine dining restaurant.  I fully understand how detrimental reviews mean to a business.  I&#x27;ve promised myself to never give a terrible review even if they deserved it.  This product truly does.  It reeks of gasoline.  It is such a strong smell I gagged.  Even after the initial introduction to the product I wanted to try it still.  So I soaked it in some Dr bronners over night.  with fresh cut oranges and lemon.  after 24+ hours of soaking I took it out and it still REEKED like gasoline.  I&#x27;m appalled someone thinks it is a good idea to sell this product.  There is no way the 5 star reviews are real.  Please do not buy this product.  Supporting this business is a crime.</li>
            <li> My skin has recently became very sensitive, so I needed to find something to use in the shower that works without inflaming my skin that I can keep germ free.  The scrubber works great without being scratchy or rough on skin, my arms, elbows and knees feel noticeably softer.  It&#x27;s also so great to be able to throw it in the washing machine and dry it in the drier so it doesn&#x27;t hang on to germs.</li>
            <li> i have dry skin works great</li>
            <li> So Wonderful I could hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> An incredible product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this forever.</li>
            <li> First use, this scrubber seemed almost *too* rough, but for subsequent showers it has been perfect.  The length is also adequate for this rather large and no-longer-flexible male, though I will say that one time I heard some stitches rip as I maneuvered the scrubber into position. So far the handles are still attached, but I have been more gentle with them since. Even so, I am entirely happy. The scrubbing glove is, to me, merely icing on the cake. Mmmmm, cake....</li>
            <li> I took a chance and bought this scrubber.  I read the reviews and am very pleased with my purchase.  It is very well constructed and the mitt is large and roomy.  They both hold liquid soap very well, lather up well.  A little scratchy, not much.  The back scrubber is soft enough that I use it dry with no water and it does a wonderful job exfoliating those hard to reach places on my back.  Also, the length is great!  Lots of room to work.  This is my first time of using a hemp product and I am delighted with the quality of the product and also the quickness of the service.  Good follow-up from the seller who genuinely cares about their customer.  Great to have such attention to professional service!</li>
            <li> This feels SO great, especially the glove. I don&#x27;t need to keep buying body scrubs anymore. To let it dry, I hang them both by my window, and my whole room will smell like lavender body wash. No downsides.</li>
            <li> THE MITTEN IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO COVER MY HAND AND THE OTHER ITEM IS NOT LONG ENOUGH</li>
            <li> I really love how this scrubber feels on my back. It provides circulation and leaves my back soft. I also love the mitt. It leaves me soft to the touch from head to toe. It is so worth the price. If and when I need to buy another I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I found them to be fairly rough (which is what I was hoping for) ...got carried away and took some of the skin off my nose (healing nicely). The back scrubber stretches, and gets kind of narrow (still works fine)</li>
            <li> Very well made.  Does the job.l Feels good on your back. Looks like it will hold up.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product, so soft! I have owned other body scrubbers that were scatchy and uncomfortable, but this one is gentle and effective. My skin feels so good! You hang it in the shower and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Wow! This back scrubber is amazing! Wish I had one years ago. You can feel it working to exfoliate, yet it is very comfortable and easy to use. The hand mitt makes cleaning the rest of your body quickly, and you can feel the difference in your skin. Thank you for this product!</li>
            <li> Seemed a bit pricey when I ordered it. It was a splurge of sorts. Well worth the money now that I am using it daily. Should have bough this years ago.  My feet love it too.</li>
            <li> Helps you get to all those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> Great product, no harsh smells.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome invention!  My back thanks you!</li>
            <li> Bought for my 86 year old mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Scrubber is a gift. I&#x27;m sure it will be loved!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been surching for great product!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter.  She said it is too rough on her skin.  The small one would be better if thinner so it can be used between toes easier.</li>
            <li> Works very well -- easy to use.  Leaves your skin clean and tingly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I felt it so rough on my skin, and I was about to return it. But I realized that it did the job and was happy with result. So I continued using it and I&#x27;m still happy with it. By the way, if you leave it wet, it doesn&#x27;t get bad smell. I really recommend it to men.</li>
            <li> I love these two products!  I have purchased a number of like items over the years and have found these to be the best so far.  While there is a slight odor to start, it goes away with washing and continual use.  The mitten is an added bonus.  Definately recommend these products.</li>
            <li> i am sorry to say i am not happy with it, i don&#x27;t like how long and loose the scrubber gets, it stretches way too much and looses the ability to really give a good scrub, i was really hoping i would be great and i bought 2 of them, boy am i sorry</li>
            <li> Received the product in a very timely manner. The size was good however the material was much rougher than the one we had before. We are hoping it softens as we use it.</li>
            <li> This scrubber is awesome. I have really dry skin and my youngest has really sensitive skin, this has helped my dry skin a lot, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my youngest&#x27;s skin whatsoever. It&#x27;s also done great with my feet. A previous reviewer mentioned a smell, there is a slight odor but that&#x27;s how hemp smells. Ran it through the wash (how awesome that this can be washed!) and the smell was gone. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Update: 10/17/15, still performs nicely with little, if any, apparent wear. A good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently purchased and find no problem or difficulty using this &#x27;Body Scrubber, Exfoliator&#x27; from DeLaine&#x27;s Kitchen and Bath. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; with average arm length and have found this to be just about the correct size. I like that it&#x27;s a natural product and that it survived a run through the wash, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels invigorated after use and I don&#x27;t find it necessary to use the handles nor have I tested the mitt as I didn&#x27;t have that in mind when purchasing. I&#x27;ll update this review, though, if needed.</li>
            <li> It does what it supposed to do and its not scratchy. The material is like a burlap bag with twine weaved into it. Its heavy when wet and it takes awhile for it to dry. I really like using the glove its alot lighter and soaps up as good as the scrubber. It is one of the best scrubbers that I have used. I do not really know how long it will last. Usually the handles break on scrubbers. This scrubber is big and long and easy to grip to use without the handles.</li>
            <li> i must say i am very impressed with how well made these are &amp; how they feel to my skin. I will be ordering more of these for the rest of the family.&lt;br /&gt;they are very well made, sturdy &amp; durable. no funny smell when left to dry in the shower. I have very sensitive skin &amp; this hemp body scrubber feels very good on my skin, not irritable or scratchy really give me a good scrub, especially after a day at the construction site in the hot sun. This hemp scrubber gets the job done &amp; leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; renewed.</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for people who can&#x27;t reach because of &amp;#34;range of motion issues&amp;#34;.  The one we received is well made and performs as expected.  It was a gift for my son and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this body scrubber! Better than any loofah! I plan to buy more as gifts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good back scrubber for  years and I finally found it.  And it even came with a body scrubber.  Yes, it does have a gas smell to it at first but it goes away after using it a few times.  I&#x27;m well aware that the strings usually brake with this type but its plenty long enough that I don&#x27;t even use the strings, I just grab each end of the scrubber itself and scrub away.  When I&#x27;m don&#x27;t with it, I wring it out and hang it to dry for the next time.  Its an awesome product, just give it time to lose the gassy odor which is not left on your body at all.  This even came with the body scrubber mitten that I didn&#x27;t think I would use but it gets more use than the back scrubber now. They are a bit abrasive but isn&#x27;t that what you want?  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Was way scratchier than I would have imagined. Really not able to soften up with water or use. Would be better for a foot scrubber only. Now it just sits in the shower un-used.</li>
            <li> So far these have held up well.  I didn&#x27;t expect to be as drawn to the hand mitt as I have been, and find myself using it even more than the back scrubber.  These seem very durable and do a good job of scrubbing without being too rough.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far with mildew or bad smell on either.</li>
            <li> First time using hemp to exfoliate - works very well!  Used before a self-tanner and got great results.  Very impressed with company&#x27;s follow up and reminder that it can be thrown in washer and dryer.  Great product, great company...thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had shoulder injuries, with &amp;#34;frozen shoulder&amp;#34; as a result.&lt;br /&gt;This thing helps me get around that problem and delivers a good scrub.</li>
            <li> Just Opened Package and I&#x27;m Concerned Before I use This.&lt;br /&gt;This Thing WREAKS of Motor Oil &amp; Gasoline!!&lt;br /&gt;L0L, Smells Like You Cleaned The Floor of Some  Auto Workshop!&lt;br /&gt;OMG Are You Kidding Me? Seriously?  Is This Some Kinda Joke?</li>
            <li> Nice durable hemp fibers used to make this.  Only issue is that the mitt is too small for my XL hands (I often need to buy XXL gloves), and the back scrubber is a bit clumsy to use in a small shower; otherwise works great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! I&#x27;ve never really felt compelled to write a review before. But, I had read a review that this was too rough. Well, I thought it was great. I have arthritis and just couldn&#x27;t get enough pressure with my back brush to really scrub my back. I hesitated to pay the price but was glad I did. When this one wears out...I will replace it.</li>
