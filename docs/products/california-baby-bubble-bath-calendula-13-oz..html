            <li>I tried it myself and it has zero taste and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>Thanks CA Baby!</li>
            <li>I just went to a drugstore and found a extra sensitive Elmo bubble bath for $4, so I will try that out to see if it&#x27;s more economical.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately the title of this product is misleading, it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s french lavender, it only says calendula, I thought it was fragrance free. I am not a fan of lavender but I have bern using it anyway for my toddler and no, it did not help him sleep better at all.&lt;br /&gt;I like the unscented one much better.</li>
            <li> I use of a lot of CA Baby products and love them but I will not be purchasing this bubble bath again. You have to pour a ton of it in the bath to even get some bubbles so I went through it very quickly. Smells good but that about the only positive thing I have to say.</li>

            <li> California baby is one of the few brands that doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughter&#x27;s very sensitive skin.  This baby bubble bath is the best! After one bath, I saw significant improvement in her eczema.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 18 month old son, who loves bubbles.  Bathtime has now become a favorite activity!  We absolutely love this product. The smell is nice and relaxing, but not overpowering.  It leaves his skin feeling very soft. We will definitely be using this bubble bath regularly from now on.</li>
            <li> Very good shopping experience,bubble is too much.My baby just seven month,I think his will be like it after 1 years old.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great item. Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but I won&#x27;t purchase again because there are no bubbles!  What is a bubble bath with no bubbles?</li>
            <li> We love these bubble baths! Calendula has a rather strong fragrance for bubble-blowing but is pleasant for bubble baths. Very bubbly, esp great for bubble-blowing.</li>
            <li> This bubble bath smells natural and nice, and seems gentle. it is quite expensive though. I have bought two of these, and you can go through them very quickly if you do a bubble bath every day. I just went to a drugstore and found a extra sensitive Elmo bubble bath for $4, so I will try that out to see if it&#x27;s more economical.</li>
            <li> Best bubbles from a trusted source, yet.</li>
            <li> I left off a star because the bubble wand doesn&#x27;t really work. Although this product is simply amazing with or without a bubble wand.... My one year old loves to splash about and watch/eat  the bubbles in the tub.  California Baby never irritates my son&#x27;s sensitive skin and the scent is always pleasant. I love the convenience of Amazon Prime delivery and I feel great knowing that the products from California Baby are always safe.</li>
            <li> I pretty much summed it up in the summary line above.  We love the scent of the bubble bath and like California baby products but if you use 3-4 capfuls per bath, which is on the lower end of what they recommend, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Good product for childrenï¼Œhope more competitive price later.</li>
            <li> Good products worthy of trust</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s the same smell as the shampoo and it&#x27;s gentle. The bubble wand will come in handy one day.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this stuff saying it&#x27;s for my infant and toddler, but it&#x27;s really my favorite bubble bath.  It smells like heaven.  It&#x27;s the best de-stressing bubble bath I&#x27;ve ever used.  Take your bubble bath to the next level.  Get this stuff.</li>
            <li> just use it,and i do not know how did it working,I think it will be ok!&lt;br /&gt;shi bu shi a !</li>
            <li> Suds are nice, product does not irritate baby&#x27;s sensitive skin. Do not need much product for a nice bubble bath.</li>
