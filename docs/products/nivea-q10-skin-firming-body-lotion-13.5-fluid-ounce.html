            <li> Works very well, but I forget to use it everyday. I wish it came with someone to apply it to me everyday! Oh well, can&#x27;t have everything!</li>
            <li> ive been using it for almost a month, and im not seeing much of a difference. Its hydrating my skin and giving me a great complexion, but not helping with stretch marks.</li>
            <li> More feed back to follow after I&#x27;ve used it longer. I&#x27;ve only had it a week. So far I LOVE the nongreasiness, and the subtle fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps to make my skin feel very smooth and soft. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. The lotion gets absorbed by my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few years now and I haven&#x27;t found a better lotion.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t firm anything.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It keeps my skin soft, smooth, moisturized and glowing. Not to mention that it smells wonderful too. As long as this product is available for purchase, I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it&#x27;s not thick</li>
            <li> This product is ok..not sure if its about the firming part..still waiting to see</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and like this lotion because it is not heavy or greasy!  AND perhaps it is my imagination, but I really think my skin appears more firm and supple.  I have been using it for 6 months and don&#x27;t want to go back to any other body lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Still have to exercise. Even works on my neck which now looks great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer with delightful fresh scent.</li>
            <li> So amazing better than other products at triple the price</li>
            <li> I used it for two weeks and found that it made only a tiny impact. It also felt like I had a plastic layer on my skin. It did something alright but not what i wanted.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only lotion I use.  It really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever!!  Heals dry itchy skin but is light and drys quickly!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> First let me be honest. Im like an ashy factory. I hate taking multiple trips to get my lotion during the day for dry skin. This product is a one and done deal for me. I use once a day and my skin feels soft for the rest of the day. Its nice to know its also firming my body in the process. That does not mean you can stop going to the gym. Its a lotion not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and a great value.  Purchasing from a local vendor was costing almost twice the price.  Nivea is a quality product and meets the expectations made in their claims.&lt;br /&gt;m</li>
            <li> This is a nice body lotion, but is VERY heavily scented.</li>
