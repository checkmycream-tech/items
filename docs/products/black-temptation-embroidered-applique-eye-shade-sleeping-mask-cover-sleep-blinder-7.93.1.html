            <li>This eye mask is cute!</li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>I do enjoy this sleep mask, plus the kitty Applique is really great.  </li>
            <li>Nice details.  </li>
            <li>cutesy and effective.  </li>
            <li>This was also true for me, however, I cut the lace from the bottom and tightened up the elastic ear straps and voila, perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>FITS GOOD, KEEPS ALL THE LIGHT</li>
            <li>I found it to be very comfortable, the beads can be a bit agitating but just snip them off</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve owned about 12 in the last six years and this is the best quality one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>It is so cute.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait go give this to my grand daughter.</li>
            <li>I know she will love it.</li>
            <li>I love the look of this mask, but my concern with it is the straps going over the ears instead of around the head.</li>
            <li>but it is, it&#x27;s actually the best idea because others press against your eyes which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>So cute.</li>
            <li>It stays in a lot better while I sleep.</li>
            <li>I love this mask b/c</li>
            <li>I wish they made them a bit more durable.</li>
            <li>Blocks out the light as intended, purrrrrrfect for those kitty naps!</li>
            <li>;, that comfortable!</li>
            <li>The sides stretch out over time, but it helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>and at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t a good idea</li>
            <li>This is such a great mask, I&#x27;ve had plenty of them and this one is real comfortable</li>
            <li>Adorable, and blocks out all light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute, well made and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>This is super cute and well made for what it is, but it&#x27;s more for fun/decoration than for sleep.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to wear this through a full night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li>Order was received very quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s elasticity very quickly.</li>
            <li>super cute and of course it is not heavy duty and more for looks - but very unique and cannot find another design this cute.</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my pre-teen nieces, and they were a huge hit.</li>
            <li>So comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It help keep the light out so that I can sleep, but the strap that goes around the ears.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t even fit.</li>
            <li>cheaply made and the straps go around your ears which I did not like</li>
            <li>But it does keep the sun and light away</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is very well made and is cute on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Very cute, soft, and look just like the picture.</li>
            <li>As a novelty, this is cute, but as a person that wanted a real eye mask to block light, and was comfortable...</li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>The product arrived earlier than the estimate date within a good quality.</li>
            <li>This is just as adorable in real life as it looks in the pictures.  </li>
            <li>Really cute eye mask, very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>If you only want it because it is very cute</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>This adorably styled sleep mask is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t damage my fine, brittle hair.</li>
            <li>I use it as I work nights at my job during the day and it really keeps out the light.</li>
            <li>So far I love the product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>But although it is really cute it is not very soft and not too comfortable.</li>
            <li>We sleep better as they are able to block out the lights from little things like the cd player or alarm clock.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If someone isn&#x27;t sensitive to things like that, this mask would be fantastic.</li>
            <li>Keeps the dark out and is very cute.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>The manufacturer probably makes it slightly large so that more people can fit into it, but just like a pair of pants that must be tailored to fit perfectly, small adjustments can be made to make this fit smaller people.  </li>
            <li>I took the beads out and it made it a little more comfortable, and room but not by much.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to do.</li>
            <li>This mask is very well made.</li>
            <li>I was suprised on how fast this item was delievered.</li>
            <li>But I do not find this comfortable enough to sleep in.</li>
            <li>It stayed in place very well.</li>
            <li>Not my style really,</li>
            <li>description does not state that elastic is designed to fit over each ear rather than around the back of the head.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would really like this, but it doest even hold around your head, it hold around your ears....</li>
            <li>I already washed it as i thought i would really like it, but not so.</li>
            <li>Very tacky product.  </li>
            <li>They really add to the mask&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So nice concept, but poor execution (also feels a bit cheaply made).</li>
            <li>But I was able to untie the separate ear straps, and then &amp;#34;sew&amp;#34; the two sides together to get a double elastic that goes across the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>I love it, but it just really cuts into my ears, probably it would be better to have just regular elastic from behind.</li>
            <li>It was a little bit pricie, but then again, there won&#x27;t be to many of these around.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s an instant laugh with my fianc√© when he wakes up and looks at me on the wknds.  </li>
            <li>then I guess you can go for it but don&#x27;t expect it to be super comfortable (not good quality) because that will not happen.</li>
            <li>The beads at the end hurt your ears sometimes and after my first time using it my ears got red and achy...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, but to wear it, you pull these elastic loops back over each of your ears, and it pulls it tight on the face.</li>
            <li>The ear loops are not comfortable, and light leaks though the bottom.</li>
            <li>Cuz that&#x27;s not cozy...</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture (super cute), and although I had to adjust the straps because they were a little tight, it stays on very well and doesn&#x27;t mess my hair up for the next morning.</li>
            <li>used this mask on a crowded train, and got a full night&#x27;s sleep--unlike a previous trip.</li>
            <li>Plus it has an extra flap by the nose that you can pull down for extra light protection!</li>
            <li>very cute ,maybe too expensive for the quality</li>
            <li>I live that te item goes aroun your ears rather than the back of your head.</li>
            <li>Not worth 14$. more like 5 or less</li>
            <li>donning the mask, be sure to flip down the little flap of fabric that covers the corners of your nose.</li>

            <li> donning the mask, be sure to flip down the little flap of fabric that covers the corners of your nose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a full strap behind your head and how the ear straps are positioned</li>
            <li> I use while on long overnight flights.</li>
            <li> the side threads are a bit stretched and worn.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with it was how it didn&#x27;t have one elastic band like my other masks.  </li>
            <li> The elastic that goes around your ears to secure the mask into place is a little harsh and made behind my ears very sore and achey, and I have small ears.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really stinky like chemicals, and the elastic is not good.</li>
            <li> the straps loose</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, the mask works by looping the elastic around each ear.  </li>
            <li> It is thin and uncomfortable since provide no protection from light and the only way you can use it by hanging it over your ears.</li>
            <li> it has less pressure on your eyes.</li>
            <li> My modifications took less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> They were tollerable, but I would wake up with them a little sore. .</li>
            <li> This is two fold,  sleep mask and for a little intrigue and mysteriousness during sex&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a little stiffer than I planned and smushed the eyes a little.</li>
            <li> and I was a little sore from using it a few nights in a row.</li>
            <li> However, one you must take the little buttons it comes with off b/c they hurt behind your ears when you sleep and 2nd</li>
            <li> used this for a few years.</li>
            <li> My sister has trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li> cheap crap probably made in china.  </li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> My mother and sister wear plain sleep masks, and now they are demanding one of these.</li>
            <li> my ears are small</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about the lace being itchy and the ear straps not fitting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find one like this that doesn&#x27;t wrap around your head and gives you that bed head dent.  </li>
            <li> My ears are very small, and it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> But it hurt my ears, because the straps are very small</li>
            <li> a side sleeper, and the little beads for adjusting the mask were uncomfortable behind my ears, so I removed them.</li>
            <li> It does have two ear straps that go behind the ear</li>
            <li> Little balls on the sides are so UNCOMFORTABLE!</li>
            <li> Too uncomfortable to wear on each ear.</li>
            <li> weird.</li>
            <li> The ear straps are weird</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product as it was expensive for the poor quality.</li>
            <li> But I found the ear things annoying and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I found it very uncomfortable and the lace a bit itchy.</li>
            <li> just stupid ear straps.  </li>

            <li> Order was received very quickly. Excellent quality eye cover. We&#x27;ve owned about 12 in the last six years and this is the best quality one I&#x27;ve had. Didn&#x27;t realize from picture or description that straps go around each ear instead of one strap around the back of your head. I&#x27;ve never seen one made that way. Too uncomfortable to wear on each ear. I cut elastic and tied it together in back to go around head. Works well that way. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order from this retailer again.</li>
            <li> This ia awesome the sleeping mask was sent very quickly and has got many comments. It is so cute. It should be let sleeping cats lie.</li>
            <li> super cute and of course it is not heavy duty and more for looks - but very unique and cannot find another design this cute. I use while on long overnight flights.</li>
            <li> This mask is very well made. I was suprised on how fast this item was delievered. It was a little bit pricie, but then again, there won&#x27;t be to many of these around.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s up with the straps that don&#x27;t go around your head?? Are they meant to strap to your ears?? Cuz that&#x27;s not cozy...</li>
            <li> This eye mask is cute! But I found the ear things annoying and uncomfortable. I also simply cut them and tied them in a knot to make a band that goes around the head, not the ears!</li>
            <li> This is super cute and well made for what it is, but it&#x27;s more for fun/decoration than for sleep. I found it very uncomfortable and the lace a bit itchy. The elastic that goes around your ears to secure the mask into place is a little harsh and made behind my ears very sore and achey, and I have small ears. Don&#x27;t expect to wear this through a full night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> Adorable, and blocks out all light. The only con was the ear straps to keep it on. They were tollerable, but I would wake up with them a little sore. .</li>
            <li> Really cute eye mask, very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is two fold,  sleep mask and for a little intrigue and mysteriousness during sex&lt;br /&gt;Why not give it a try.....</li>
            <li> Eh. It&#x27;s cute, but to wear it, you pull these elastic loops back over each of your ears, and it pulls it tight on the face. No room for blinking and REM sleep! But I do not find this comfortable enough to sleep in. Which defeats the purpose. So nice concept, but poor execution (also feels a bit cheaply made).</li>
            <li> used this for a few years. absolutely love it. the side threads are a bit stretched and worn. will not ever part with it, just keep mending it tto keep it usable. it is very cute, and the fabric against your face.</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than the estimate date within a good quality.Excellent customer service.I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase from the buyer.Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far I love the product. It looks exactly like the picture (super cute), and although I had to adjust the straps because they were a little tight, it stays on very well and doesn&#x27;t mess my hair up for the next morning. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES HER MASK. FITS GOOD, KEEPS ALL THE LIGHT OUT SHE CAN SLEEP IN EVEN LONGER NOW AND WAKE UP FEELING WELL RESTED.</li>
            <li> It was a little stiffer than I planned and smushed the eyes a little. It stayed in place very well.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would have changed was to not have the elastic straps be the ones that go over your ears.  My ears are very small, and it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  But I was able to untie the separate ear straps, and then &amp;#34;sew&amp;#34; the two sides together to get a double elastic that goes across the back of my head.  Easy enough to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find one like this that doesn&#x27;t wrap around your head and gives you that bed head dent.  So comfortable.  Not my style really, but it&#x27;s an instant laugh with my fianc√© when he wakes up and looks at me on the wknds.  Our window faces east and we can&#x27;t use our blinds because of our kitten.  So when I want to sleep in, this comes on at around sun rise! :D</li>
            <li> I do enjoy this sleep mask, plus the kitty Applique is really great.  My daughters wear them too.  We sleep better as they are able to block out the lights from little things like the cd player or alarm clock.</li>
            <li> Great Deal!!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait go give this to my grand daughter. I know she will love it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  Nice details.  The only problem I had with it was how it didn&#x27;t have one elastic band like my other masks.  Instead it has two loops to go around the ears.  Kind of awkward so I bought some elastic and added it to the loops to make just one.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this mask, but my concern with it is the straps going over the ears instead of around the head. I noticed that it irritated the back of my ears and I was a little sore from using it a few nights in a row. If someone isn&#x27;t sensitive to things like that, this mask would be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I think it is very cute! But it hurt my ears, because the straps are very small so they pinch my ears.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my pre-teen nieces, and they were a huge hit. My mother and sister wear plain sleep masks, and now they are demanding one of these. Very cute, soft, and look just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Little balls on the sides are so UNCOMFORTABLE! I had to take them off and attach the sides with an extra elastic</li>
            <li> I love it, but it just really cuts into my ears, probably it would be better to have just regular elastic from behind.</li>
            <li> I like the style and shape of the mask. It help keep the light out so that I can sleep, but the strap that goes around the ears. Hurts my ears.</li>
            <li> cutesy and effective.  description does not state that elastic is designed to fit over each ear rather than around the back of the head.  still works, just different feel.</li>
            <li> This is just as adorable in real life as it looks in the pictures.  As other reviewers have stated, the mask works by looping the elastic around each ear.  I am a bit leery of using it that way, but another reviewer said they cut the elastic and tied them together to go around the head, so I am going to try that!  Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> The ear loops are not comfortable, and light leaks though the bottom. As a novelty, this is cute, but as a person that wanted a real eye mask to block light, and was comfortable...THIS IS NOT IT.</li>
            <li> I thought I would really like this, but it doest even hold around your head, it hold around your ears....weird. I already washed it as i thought i would really like it, but not so. Poor CHEAP Quality. DO NOT BUY! Not worth 14$. more like 5 or less I took the beads out and it made it a little more comfortable, and room but not by much. Still would Not purchase again</li>
            <li> This is such a great mask, I&#x27;ve had plenty of them and this one is real comfortable, I wouldn&#x27;t say cheap--it is thin but it does block out any light. It does have two ear straps that go behind the ear and at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t a good idea but it is, it&#x27;s actually the best idea because others press against your eyes which I don&#x27;t like. What I did was loop a string with the two ear strap to allow it to tie in the back, by doing this it&#x27;s a full strap behind your head and how the ear straps are positioned it has less pressure on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Very tacky product.  I returned it because of this.  Very disappointed in this product as it was expensive for the poor quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really stinky like chemicals, and the elastic is not good.</li>
            <li> The straps go around your ears instead of your head.  Just took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> It is adorable and blocks all the light in my vividly bright dorm!! Plus it has an extra flap by the nose that you can pull down for extra light protection! I found it to be very comfortable, the beads can be a bit agitating but just snip them off and it is perfect!</li>
            <li> My sister has trouble sleeping. Bought it for her birthday. He loves it. Sleeps with it every night. Keeps the dark out and is very cute.</li>
            <li> So cute. I purchased as a gag gift.</li>
            <li> gift for my granddaughter. She loves it</li>
            <li> This adorably styled sleep mask is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t damage my fine, brittle hair. Instead of putting an elastic band around your head, you slip smaller elastic bands over your ears, similar to putting on a surgical mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a side sleeper, and the little beads for adjusting the mask were uncomfortable behind my ears, so I removed them. The mask still stays over my eyes while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When donning the mask, be sure to flip down the little flap of fabric that covers the corners of your nose. They really add to the mask&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this mask on a crowded train, and got a full night&#x27;s sleep--unlike a previous trip. It also helps me sleep when I work graveyard shift. I wish it came in several styles, including a gender neutral one that I could recommend to a male colleague.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even have a strap to hold it to your head!  just stupid ear straps.  cheap crap probably made in china.  my ears are small so it doesn&#x27;t even fit. waste of money.</li>
            <li> very cute ,maybe too expensive for the quality</li>
            <li> It is thin and uncomfortable since provide no protection from light and the only way you can use it by hanging it over your ears. I don&#x27;t care how it looks now since doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> cheaply made and the straps go around your ears which I did not like</li>
            <li> I live that te item goes aroun your ears rather than the back of your head. It stays in a lot better while I sleep. I use it as I work nights at my job during the day and it really keeps out the light.</li>
            <li> I love this mask b/c you can place the straps around your ears instead of your head, which causes your hair to ripe. However, one you must take the little buttons it comes with off b/c they hurt behind your ears when you sleep and 2nd the straps loose it&#x27;s elasticity very quickly. I wish they made them a bit more durable.</li>
            <li> I have had several sleeping masks and this may be one of the cutest! But although it is really cute it is not very soft and not too comfortable. If you only want it because it is very cute then I guess you can go for it but don&#x27;t expect it to be super comfortable (not good quality) because that will not happen. The beads at the end hurt your ears sometimes and after my first time using it my ears got red and achy... But it does keep the sun and light away so it does it job just right! But I&#x27;m not sure if I would recommend it unless someone just wants it for the cuteness and even so I&#x27;m not sure if its worth it.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is very well made and is cute on top of it.  I read some reviews about the lace being itchy and the ear straps not fitting.  This was also true for me, however, I cut the lace from the bottom and tightened up the elastic ear straps and voila, perfect fit.  The manufacturer probably makes it slightly large so that more people can fit into it, but just like a pair of pants that must be tailored to fit perfectly, small adjustments can be made to make this fit smaller people.  My modifications took less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Super cute! Blocks out the light as intended, purrrrrrfect for those kitty naps! The ear straps are weird but you get use to them.</li>
            <li> I Love it! It&#x27;s so cute, well made and comfortable to use. Sometimes I wake up and forget I have it on and think: &amp;#34; It&#x27;s still night? &amp;#34;, that comfortable! I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> The sides stretch out over time, but it helps me sleep better.</li>
