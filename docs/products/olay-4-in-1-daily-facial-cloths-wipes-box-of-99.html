            <li> I have been using the daily facial wash for ever and I love it because it takes off all your makeup really good and leaves your face feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> Use them all the time.  Great for cleansing and exfoliating daily.</li>
            <li> Very convenient cleansing pads.  Just add water and enjoy.  Generate lots of gentle bubbly soap.  I would recommend to all.</li>

            <li> Love these facial cleansing disposable sheets.  Simply apply a bit of warm water and wash your face.  They&#x27;re gentle and the soap doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes. Even though I have normal skin, I also like the clothes for oily skin because they have a tiny bit of abrasive quality that helps to exfoliate while cleansing.  That&#x27;s a plus.  Simply throw it away after use.  No extra laundry.  Don&#x27;t flush these.</li>
            <li> Happy with product and service</li>
            <li> This is the best face cloth for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Wife has sensitive skin &amp; this product is a great help!  It&#x27;s mild, not harsh &amp; does the job!  Thank You Olay &amp; Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these facial cloths and have had difficulty finding them in the stores for a reasonable price.  Glad to have them!</li>
            <li> These facial cleansers are much better than the pre-moistened cleansers. You only need to use one to clean your face thoroughly, whereas, I find that it takes two pre-moistened towelettes to remove all makeup. Great product!</li>
            <li> I like these better than any facial cloths that I have used. They are great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday to wash my face. They work really well and your face feels nice and clean when you are done. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for daily cleansing. They leave your face smooth and clean, I have had&lt;br /&gt;no reactions or problems and I have sensitive skin. I will never be without them.</li>
            <li> Very consistent product.  This is my face cleansing routine.  It does an excellent job of removing all makeup, including mascara.</li>

            <li> These cloths have 2 sides to them. One for gentle cleansing and one for softly exfoliating your skin.  Neither is harsh. There&#x27;s also cleansing lather built into each cloth, all you do is wet the cloth and begin cleansing.  It does a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It&#x27;s the only facial wipe that removes makeup completely</li>

            <li> Cleans my face better than a wash cloth. Takes all my makeup off with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, love it.  Even my husband washes his face with the same Olay cloth.</li>
            <li> Works great for taking off makeup.</li>
            <li> THEY are the  very best make-up remover cloths there are.</li>
