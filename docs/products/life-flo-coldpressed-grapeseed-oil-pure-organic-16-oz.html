            <li>Lore has it that grapeseed oil is good for the skin--as opposed to baby oil that clogs the pores--as opposed to avacado oil that makes you smell like a salad.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a great oil, many uses and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>

            <li>I am loving this oil.</li>
            <li>I mix it with glycerine and rose hip seed oil and use it on my face nightly.</li>
            <li>no fragrance, which is a plus, so you can add your own scent to it.</li>
            <li>but it did give my skin a nice glow and it makes me feel like I am taking care of myself.</li>
            <li>Love this in my hair, I added this to my hair regimen and it fit very nicely.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin nicely and in my opinion its a healthy oil.</li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s very smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very light, and Yes - you can use it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After your facewash at night, apply a moisturizer (jojoba oil, very light application, rub it in).</li>

            <li>My favorite oil for massage.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was an ok product, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that it is not certified organic.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>There are lots of better RC cars in Amazon than this ..</li>
            <li>The combination of these two all-natural products has left my skin in the best shape it has ever been in!  </li>
            <li>Cheap too!</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Eggs come out better for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for face and whole body.</li>
            <li>but I think I like this product better for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>If someone is looking for light and moisture they should buy this!</li>
            <li>Love it/</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>an I am still pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Some people may require one or two drops more depending on the size of the face or the skin type, but that&#x27;s up to you to find out.</li>
            <li>Application method is also important!</li>
            <li>Might work better for others  </li>
            <li>I have read many articles touting the anti-occident benefits of grapeseed oil.  </li>
            <li>It says organic in the title, but the bottle doesn&#x27;t show that&#x27;s certified organic, so I wish there was more information about the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; claim in the title, but for face wash</li>
            <li>so I am sure that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It took about a week for arrival and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it for many things.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the size.</li>
            <li>Maybe this will work better for some people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>must better than any cream I have used - I use it as a body oil -</li>
            <li>My order was delivered quickly, and I am very pleased with the grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li>Very ggod for the skin, the darker grapeseed oil is better but for whatever you wish to pay this is well worth it, and is very good.</li>
            <li>Edit 5/28/2016:&lt;br /&gt;After using it the first time, I really loved it and it lasted me almost 2 years.</li>

            <li>Also nice for a neutral salad dressing oil when you want mild herbs to stand along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very light weight, non greasy and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Also works great by itself as a natural moisturizer.</li>

            <li>I enjoy every bit of this oil</li>
            <li>Great overall product.</li>
            <li>I also use grape seed on my body, it gives you a natural looking glow and it help your skin become solf and sooooooo smooth good stuff.</li>
            <li>If you try rubbing right away your going to &#x27;run out&#x27; and feel like you need more</li>
            <li>I found this very useful both for my skin</li>

            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>The order took awhile to get to me, but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I originally purchase this oil for massages.  </li>
            <li>Who would have ever thought that an oil can help to clean your face?</li>
            <li>You will never believe that an oil will clean your face until you try it.</li>
            <li>Nice and light, scent is not real heavy.</li>
            <li>I also use Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Sweet Almond Oil for massaging and makeup removal</li>
            <li>Sometimes things seem to good to be true; this purchase definitely was.</li>
            <li>I also like the viscosity of it and that it absorbs into your skin quickly without a lot of greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>Smoothes the skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>Love this oil as the &#x27;most often used&#x27; carrier for my essential oil blends and skin care lotions/salves.  </li>
            <li>aka:GSO, absorbs quickly in my applications.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Great for all over skin moisturizing alone or a little oil combined with my favorite lotion works very well.  </li>
            <li>This product itself is great and it is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quilts doesn&#x27;t smell isnt that greasy works great for hair and skin big bottle will probably last for a long time</li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase of Grape seed oil on Amazon which I found to be a little cheaper than Wholefoods  Market.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find any for a reasonable price with free shipping that was organic.</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been cleaner and it works great as a substitute for harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li>Great product and price, I use this everyday and it is everything my friend told me it would be.  </li>
            <li>I also use it as a body oil straight out of the shower and it leaves my skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>and it gives the most amazing, fluffy consistency.</li>
            <li>My skin was much softer, I love this product so much....</li>
            <li>but it is worth it to not get the stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>What tackiness you feel soon goes away as the oil is rapidly absorbed.</li>
            <li>so worth a try</li>
            <li>This as been working great so far mixing in with my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it also doesnt leave your face oily and even has a soft barely there pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I like but when I ordered it elsewhere the color and flavor were bold and intense.</li>
            <li>We are on our second bottle, and plan on buying more once that runs out.</li>
            <li>I have only had this for one day but it made the skin around my eyes feel much better.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe people go out and spend $100&#x27;s on products with chemicals when stuff like this really works!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for hot oil treatments and does seem to work.</li>
            <li>Should have checked the bottle when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soooooo smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin shinny for the first 15-20 minutes after putting the oil on.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil to use to wash my face and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>But I can just tell by the way my skin looks right now that this oil is far superior to the other ones.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased other oils from this company and will do so in the future, great price.</li>
            <li>Great oil as a carrier for other essential oils.</li>
            <li>From a light, fast absorbing, non greasy skin softener, to a natural, non chemical intimate lubricant.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff and use if every day sometimes 2 or 3 times a day&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time  and works very well....</li>
            <li>The title of the item says &amp;#34;Life-Flo Organic Pure Grapeseed Oil.&amp;#34; It is not certified organic oil.</li>
            <li>They sent a bottle of Pure Magnesium Oil in a wrapper labeled Organic Pure Grapeseed Oil.</li>
            <li>just fine - I&#x27;ve been using it on my face mixed with tea tree oil</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin, but not too fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but I do not know how much to take...</li>
            <li>It really does cleanse the face.</li>
            <li>contrary to everything you&#x27;ve ever heard about acne and skin cleansing, your skin NEEDS and WANTS oil.</li>
            <li>But after two weeks, my face stayed moisturized the whole day after applying the oil in the morning.</li>
            <li>Rub the oil between your fingertips and then lightly tap your face with it, then, and only then, you can proceed to rub.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave oily stains on my pillow.</li>
            <li>The top seal on mine was partially opened when I got the package, so grapeseed oil was covering everything in the box.</li>
            <li>I put some essential oil and some of this product into smaller bottles to give it a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I used to have an oily complexion, but now, my oil is far more tamed because my skin is always moisturized properly with this oil (and jojoba oil as the follow-up moisturizer).</li>
            <li>I mixed it with castor oil and lavender and have been pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in the tiny lines around my eyes and lips and it just gives my skin a soft, more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Has a much lighter taste than olive oil and according to what I&#x27;ve read is better for frying/sauteeing than other oils.</li>
            <li>This settle into the skin very smoothly and less tacky than lotion.</li>
            <li>I have tried almond oil and coconut oil on my face and both left my face super oily and even caused breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommender</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick or greasy.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to love this stuff; I will massage it into my unwashed, dry face each morning and then follow up with a wet hot washcloth to remove the excess.</li>
            <li>Over the past few years, I have experimented with various organic oils, and find this oil is best for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I use this oil for making my homemade epsom salt scrubs and it leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s partly because I started drinking more water and exfoliating once a week</li>
            <li>Works like a charm every time on my natural hair ..</li>
            <li>and I am continuing to use it post-pregnancy since my baby is sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I use it either directly as body lotion, in body lotions that I make or as massage oil.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night before bed and by morning my skin is soft - no</li>
            <li>Has a light grape scent and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I got it because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Grapeseed oil is a fantastic oil to use for your hair I am African American woman who has recently going natural</li>
            <li>My skin had to get used to it after years of torturing it with the toxic products that sell as natural and benign, like Neutrogena, Ponds, etc.</li>
            <li>(4c natural hair).</li>
            <li>Do it the natural way</li>
            <li>Use it for cooking or soft skin</li>
            <li>This oil seems to work well in my natural 4b hair</li>
            <li>(it works for high heat cooking, salad dressing and facial, body and hair moisturizer/conditioner).</li>
            <li>Does exactly what hearers oil is expected to do.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t go through it very fast either; it&#x27;s gonna last me a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really works well for dry skin in the wintertime.</li>
            <li>Definitely money worth spent.</li>
            <li>So at first, after soaking the oil in, my face would feel a bit dry (especially since we were in the winter).</li>
            <li>/&gt;*****this product is not certified organic by any third party as far as I can tell</li>
            <li>actually I&#x27;ve been natural for about 6 months</li>
            <li>No strong scent, just pure and soft oil for anything you would like!</li>
            <li>It is like all other body oils and can feel greasy if you put too much on.  </li>
            <li>I live in Arizona where it&#x27;s dry all of the time and no matter what type of moisturizer I&#x27;m using</li>
            <li>Leaves dry skin feeling silky smooth with very little tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>so any added essential oils are not drowned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am getting married in a few months and wanted to find something to moisten my skin.</li>
            <li>After finishing my novel for Kindle, Story of The Ghost, I wanted to cook a little more than I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got this to help my dry skin and to hopefully clear up some of my acne scars and such.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for natural alternatives for moisturizing because I have typically oily skin, but this absorbs so well that it leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>

            <li> Feels good on your hands.  </li>
            <li> Lore has it that grapeseed oil is good for the skin--as opposed to baby oil that clogs the pores--as opposed to avacado oil that makes you smell like a salad.</li>
            <li> A light oil with no smell that is a perfect massage oil.</li>
            <li> Still smells good.</li>

            <li> Amazon had this at a good price-</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the versatility of grapeseed oil.  </li>

            <li> I add this grapeseed oil to my favorite moisturizer and my face looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great oil, many uses and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> But otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless I would recommend this oil to so many people!</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>

            <li> No smell and nice product.</li>
            <li> I am loving this oil.</li>
            <li> I mix it with glycerine and rose hip seed oil and use it on my face nightly.</li>
            <li> no fragrance, which is a plus, so you can add your own scent to it.</li>
            <li> but it did give my skin a nice glow and it makes me feel like I am taking care of myself.</li>
            <li> Love this in my hair, I added this to my hair regimen and it fit very nicely.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin nicely and in my opinion its a healthy oil.</li>
            <li> The one-finger, push-to-open cap is easy to use and provides excellent control over how much oil comes out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very light, and Yes - you can use it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After your facewash at night, apply a moisturizer (jojoba oil, very light application, rub it in).</li>
            <li> After your facewash at night, apply a moisturizer (jojoba oil, very light application, rub it in).</li>

            <li> Love love</li>

            <li> I love it and would purchase again deff.</li>
            <li> and I feel safe putting it on my chest even while breastfeeding since this is edible.</li>
            <li> My favorite oil for massage.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it was an ok product, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that it is not certified organic.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> There are lots of better RC cars in Amazon than this ..</li>
            <li> The combination of these two all-natural products has left my skin in the best shape it has ever been in!  </li>
            <li> Cheap too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this grape seed oil</li>
            <li> my hair is so much better since I have been using I will be purchasing more I love love love love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Eggs come out better for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for face and whole body.</li>
            <li> but I think I like this product better for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> If someone is looking for light and moisture they should buy this!</li>
            <li> Love it/</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> an I am still pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Some people may require one or two drops more depending on the size of the face or the skin type, but that&#x27;s up to you to find out.</li>
            <li> Application method is also important!</li>
            <li> Might work better for others  </li>
            <li> I have read many articles touting the anti-occident benefits of grapeseed oil.  </li>
            <li> It says organic in the title, but the bottle doesn&#x27;t show that&#x27;s certified organic, so I wish there was more information about the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; claim in the title, but for face wash</li>
            <li> so I am sure that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It took about a week for arrival and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it for many things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> Love the size.</li>
            <li> Maybe this will work better for some people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> must better than any cream I have used - I use it as a body oil -</li>
            <li> My order was delivered quickly, and I am very pleased with the grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li> Very ggod for the skin, the darker grapeseed oil is better but for whatever you wish to pay this is well worth it, and is very good.</li>
            <li> Edit 5/28/2016:&lt;br /&gt;After using it the first time, I really loved it and it lasted me almost 2 years.</li>
            <li> I love this Grapeseed oil, is perfect for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Perfect for massaging or moisturizing my DRY skin.  </li>
            <li> Also nice for a neutral salad dressing oil when you want mild herbs to stand along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very light weight, non greasy and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Also works great by itself as a natural moisturizer.</li>

            <li> I enjoy every bit of this oil</li>
            <li> Great overall product.</li>
            <li> I also use grape seed on my body, it gives you a natural looking glow and it help your skin become solf and sooooooo smooth good stuff.</li>
            <li> If you try rubbing right away your going to &#x27;run out&#x27; and feel like you need more</li>
            <li> I found this very useful both for my skin</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s light and mostly odorless and does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> The order took awhile to get to me, but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I originally purchase this oil for massages.  </li>
            <li> Who would have ever thought that an oil can help to clean your face?</li>
            <li> You will never believe that an oil will clean your face until you try it.</li>
            <li> Nice and light, scent is not real heavy.</li>
            <li> I also use Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Sweet Almond Oil for massaging and makeup removal</li>
            <li> Sometimes things seem to good to be true; this purchase definitely was.</li>
            <li> I also like the viscosity of it and that it absorbs into your skin quickly without a lot of greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Smoothes the skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> Love this oil as the &#x27;most often used&#x27; carrier for my essential oil blends and skin care lotions/salves.  </li>
            <li> aka:GSO, absorbs quickly in my applications.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Great for all over skin moisturizing alone or a little oil combined with my favorite lotion works very well.  </li>
            <li> This product itself is great and it is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great quilts doesn&#x27;t smell isnt that greasy works great for hair and skin big bottle will probably last for a long time</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase of Grape seed oil on Amazon which I found to be a little cheaper than Wholefoods  Market.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find any for a reasonable price with free shipping that was organic.</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been cleaner and it works great as a substitute for harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li> Great product and price, I use this everyday and it is everything my friend told me it would be.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a body oil straight out of the shower and it leaves my skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> and it gives the most amazing, fluffy consistency.</li>
            <li> My skin was much softer, I love this product so much....</li>
            <li> but it is worth it to not get the stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> What tackiness you feel soon goes away as the oil is rapidly absorbed.</li>
            <li> so worth a try</li>
            <li> This as been working great so far mixing in with my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it also doesnt leave your face oily and even has a soft barely there pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I like but when I ordered it elsewhere the color and flavor were bold and intense.</li>
            <li> We are on our second bottle, and plan on buying more once that runs out.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for one day but it made the skin around my eyes feel much better.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe people go out and spend $100&#x27;s on products with chemicals when stuff like this really works!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for hot oil treatments and does seem to work.</li>
            <li> Should have checked the bottle when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soooooo smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin shinny for the first 15-20 minutes after putting the oil on.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to use to wash my face and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> But I can just tell by the way my skin looks right now that this oil is far superior to the other ones.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other oils from this company and will do so in the future, great price.</li>
            <li> Great oil as a carrier for other essential oils.</li>
            <li> From a light, fast absorbing, non greasy skin softener, to a natural, non chemical intimate lubricant.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff and use if every day sometimes 2 or 3 times a day&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time  and works very well....</li>
            <li> The title of the item says &amp;#34;Life-Flo Organic Pure Grapeseed Oil.&amp;#34; It is not certified organic oil.</li>
            <li> They sent a bottle of Pure Magnesium Oil in a wrapper labeled Organic Pure Grapeseed Oil.</li>
            <li> just fine - I&#x27;ve been using it on my face mixed with tea tree oil</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin, but not too fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but I do not know how much to take...</li>
            <li> It really does cleanse the face.</li>
            <li> contrary to everything you&#x27;ve ever heard about acne and skin cleansing, your skin NEEDS and WANTS oil.</li>
            <li> But after two weeks, my face stayed moisturized the whole day after applying the oil in the morning.</li>
            <li> Rub the oil between your fingertips and then lightly tap your face with it, then, and only then, you can proceed to rub.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave oily stains on my pillow.</li>
            <li> The top seal on mine was partially opened when I got the package, so grapeseed oil was covering everything in the box.</li>
            <li> I put some essential oil and some of this product into smaller bottles to give it a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I used to have an oily complexion, but now, my oil is far more tamed because my skin is always moisturized properly with this oil (and jojoba oil as the follow-up moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I mixed it with castor oil and lavender and have been pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the tiny lines around my eyes and lips and it just gives my skin a soft, more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Has a much lighter taste than olive oil and according to what I&#x27;ve read is better for frying/sauteeing than other oils.</li>
            <li> This settle into the skin very smoothly and less tacky than lotion.</li>
            <li> I have tried almond oil and coconut oil on my face and both left my face super oily and even caused breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommender</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to love this stuff; I will massage it into my unwashed, dry face each morning and then follow up with a wet hot washcloth to remove the excess.</li>
            <li> Over the past few years, I have experimented with various organic oils, and find this oil is best for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for making my homemade epsom salt scrubs and it leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s partly because I started drinking more water and exfoliating once a week</li>
            <li> Works like a charm every time on my natural hair ..</li>
            <li> and I am continuing to use it post-pregnancy since my baby is sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I use it either directly as body lotion, in body lotions that I make or as massage oil.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night before bed and by morning my skin is soft - no</li>
            <li> Has a light grape scent and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I got it because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Grapeseed oil is a fantastic oil to use for your hair I am African American woman who has recently going natural</li>
            <li> My skin had to get used to it after years of torturing it with the toxic products that sell as natural and benign, like Neutrogena, Ponds, etc.</li>
            <li> (4c natural hair).</li>
            <li> Do it the natural way</li>
            <li> Use it for cooking or soft skin</li>
            <li> This oil seems to work well in my natural 4b hair</li>
            <li> (it works for high heat cooking, salad dressing and facial, body and hair moisturizer/conditioner).</li>
            <li> Does exactly what hearers oil is expected to do.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t go through it very fast either; it&#x27;s gonna last me a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff really works well for dry skin in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> Definitely money worth spent.</li>
            <li> So at first, after soaking the oil in, my face would feel a bit dry (especially since we were in the winter).</li>
            <li> /&gt;*****this product is not certified organic by any third party as far as I can tell</li>
            <li> actually I&#x27;ve been natural for about 6 months</li>
            <li> No strong scent, just pure and soft oil for anything you would like!</li>
            <li> It is like all other body oils and can feel greasy if you put too much on.  </li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where it&#x27;s dry all of the time and no matter what type of moisturizer I&#x27;m using</li>
            <li> Leaves dry skin feeling silky smooth with very little tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> so any added essential oils are not drowned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am getting married in a few months and wanted to find something to moisten my skin.</li>
            <li> After finishing my novel for Kindle, Story of The Ghost, I wanted to cook a little more than I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this to help my dry skin and to hopefully clear up some of my acne scars and such.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for natural alternatives for moisturizing because I have typically oily skin, but this absorbs so well that it leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is like an oil slick down my nose, and today I can really tell that this product really does work like a toner on oily skin.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t drag it over the rest of your face, but then you&#x27;ll realize your face will be extremely oily, too much for the skin to absorb.</li>
            <li> It is not near the expiration date until 2015.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moisturized, seems to wipe off dirt when using a cotton ball, not certain if that is some of the oil seen on the ball that appears to look like dirt, or it actually legitimate dirt itself.</li>
            <li> Blends well with essential oils and other butters.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well on dry scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> and I needed something to keep my skin from being dry without breaking out.</li>
            <li> , my face feels so dry.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after every shower on my belly and chest and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an oily complexion, and it comes right back if I fail to moisturize.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an oily complexion, and it comes right back if I fail to moisturize.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my dry, flaky, scaly skin has disappeared!</li>
            <li> During the winter my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face since I have very dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Be careful what you order this with.</li>
            <li> It was neatly packaged and it came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes a little, but I find that I need to follow up with a moisturizing non-astringent oil in very very tiny amounts after this oil because this grapeseed oil will tighten my skin and dry it out a little bit.</li>
            <li> Non-scented and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use grape seed oil on my hair mix with a few other oils mix with three small drops of neem oil use it for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Carries other scents well.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap, but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The label says &amp;#34;organically grown&amp;#34; but no USDA label or any other certification that I see.</li>
            <li> I can tell A big difference, however I will have to wait a few weeks or a month to notice hair growth!</li>
            <li> I purchased it to mix with other pricey oils to make a face oil and it works well.</li>
            <li> Blends well with the other oils I use on my skin..</li>
            <li> You need to be very careful with the amount of oil you use though.</li>
            <li> I have a little less than half of the bottle left and there are no signs of rancidity at all.</li>
            <li> You do feel a little oily until it sinks in/dries</li>
            <li> I use this as a base for shaving, as it provides a much better &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; for my merkur razor when used before shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its too slow and very simple design .</li>
            <li> This oil is a little heavier than some other brands of grapeseed oil.  </li>
            <li> I use this in place of lotions and also add a bit to wet hair to tame frizz.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than the typical stuff.</li>
            <li> As a hair conditioner you just need a small dab and apply it while the hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> I pour some to a little container and store it on my vanity</li>
            <li> I put a little in my skin lotions.  </li>
            <li> The oil does not feel heavy on the skin and it lasts almost a day leaving the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I got this oil a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Just opened it, and the inner cover was broken.</li>
            <li> after a few months people started asking me what I do to take care of my skin.</li>
            <li> few family teenagers also like it as a carrier for an acne treatment (2-3 times a day), that is made with two drops of organic tea tree/Melaleuca alt.</li>
            <li> Just a few dabs has done wonders for them!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I just wasted my money...</li>
            <li> Often times, I try to buy Grapeseed Oil and it has turned green.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not cheap.  </li>
            <li> It is not strongly noticeable - I do tend to have a nose for that type of thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of the chefs on the cooking shows use grapeseed and that makes me think I&#x27;m a little bit smarter in the kitchen now than I was in the past.</li>
            <li> Very little greasiness to food</li>
            <li> Applying a small amount of grapeseed oil to the skin, allows it to become moist but not oily.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it will make my hair grow.</li>
            <li> If you wash it all away and don&#x27;t moisturize it or replace it with something, your skin is going to react by making EXCESSIVE amounts of oil.</li>
            <li> In the morning you will not feel the oil slick anymore.our skin is going to react by making EXCESSIVE amounts of oil.</li>
            <li> In the morning you will not feel the oil slick anymore.</li>
            <li> Has not really improved my skin but hasn&#x27;t made it worse either.  </li>
            <li> But the seal was broken and leaked all over the box and other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, you know that feeling when you wake up in the morning with that icky, oil slick feeling to your face?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, you know that feeling when you wake up in the morning with that icky, oil slick feeling to your face?</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to say which was the solution)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late to return now.</li>
            <li> My face is not overly oily like it usually is, even though you&#x27;d think putting an oil on your skin would make it worse.  </li>
            <li> I know that rancid oil is not good for health, but does it apply to oil that is not used to eat but rather applied to the skin?</li>
            <li> but it is very thick</li>
            <li> It is just a part of the aging process, but not attractive to customers.</li>
            <li> it appears that the expiration date is slightly rubbed off or it&#x27;s very faint.</li>
            <li> My wife is addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wish shipping was not so expensive though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to use for skin and hair during cold, drying, winter season.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this product and will NOT purchase again!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just love this oil. I use for my hair and skin. Love love</li>
            <li> My wife is addicted to this stuff! No strong scent, just pure and soft oil for anything you would like! It absorbs into the skin, but not too fast. It is great for keeping your skin hydrated and moist. We are on our second bottle, and plan on buying more once that runs out.</li>
            <li> Great size for a great price.  I use this in place of lotions and also add a bit to wet hair to tame frizz.  It&#x27;s a great oil, many uses and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to dilute essential oils, for massage and moisturizer. Even putting it on my face does not cause blemishes. I&#x27;m impressed! It&#x27;s light and mostly odorless and does exactly what I wanted it to do. The one-finger, push-to-open cap is easy to use and provides excellent control over how much oil comes out. I might try cooking with it next. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it, I use this in a body scrub.</li>
            <li> The product for me is described as the same as shown in the site. The oil does not feel heavy on the skin and it lasts almost a day leaving the skin moisturized. Very good product for skin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other oils from this company and will do so in the future, great price.</li>
            <li> This oil is very good for cooking or for salads.  Has a much lighter taste than olive oil and according to what I&#x27;ve read is better for frying/sauteeing than other oils.</li>
            <li> Came in on time and works great, very happy camper, great service, thank you!</li>
            <li> I loved that...It&#x27;s not greasy on the skin has no smell.My skin was much softer, I love this product so much....</li>
            <li> I am obsessive about the products I use on my skin.  NO chemicals at all!  I have only had this for one day but it made the skin around my eyes feel much better.  I have oily skin that is like an oil slick down my nose, and today I can really tell that this product really does work like a toner on oily skin.  My face is not overly oily like it usually is, even though you&#x27;d think putting an oil on your skin would make it worse.  I have tried almond oil and coconut oil on my face and both left my face super oily and even caused breakouts.  If this grapeseed oil eventually causes break outs I will update this review to let you know!  But I can just tell by the way my skin looks right now that this oil is far superior to the other ones.  I cannot believe people go out and spend $100&#x27;s on products with chemicals when stuff like this really works!</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer after oil cleansing or just for any time. Perfect and I don&#x27;t know how I missed this gem of a product. I have been searching for natural alternatives for moisturizing because I have typically oily skin, but this absorbs so well that it leaves my skin soft and supple. I haven&#x27;t used it under makeup because I think it will not give me the matte look I need. But otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the stuff and use if every day sometimes 2 or 3 times a day&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time  and works very well.... Lightens  brown spots</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moisturized, seems to wipe off dirt when using a cotton ball, not certain if that is some of the oil seen on the ball that appears to look like dirt, or it actually legitimate dirt itself.</li>
            <li> Very ggod for the skin, the darker grapeseed oil is better but for whatever you wish to pay this is well worth it, and is very good.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm every time on my natural hair ..I love it and would purchase again deff. A staple product</li>
            <li> My midwife recommended this to help prevent stretch marks during pregnancy. I put it on after every shower on my belly and chest and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.  You do feel a little oily until it sinks in/dries but it is worth it to not get the stretch marks.  It&#x27;s not greasy and it is what my midwives use in their offices instead of the gel for the heartbeat doppler.  I like it, it&#x27;s very smooth and I am continuing to use it post-pregnancy since my baby is sensitive to perfumes.  This is organic so she hasn&#x27;t had any reaction to this and I feel safe putting it on my chest even while breastfeeding since this is edible.</li>
            <li> Great oil as a carrier for other essential oils. Also works great by itself as a natural moisturizer. I will definitely be buying this again and again. I also like the viscosity of it and that it absorbs into your skin quickly without a lot of greasy residue.</li>
            <li> great value for a great product</li>
            <li> Could have bought at grocery store but still enjoy the product. Used for cooking and essential oils carrier oil</li>
            <li> I use this as a base for shaving, as it provides a much better &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; for my merkur razor when used before shaving cream.  It does not gunk up my razor, and I also use it as part of my post shave routine, and my face has never been smoother.</li>
            <li> My favorite oil for massage. Combined with essential oils gets different aromas. It is not sticky. Easy absorption&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Is what it is. Does what it says it does. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Fast shipping. But the seal was broken and leaked all over the box and other products.</li>
            <li> very nice product.  works great in the recipes I have tried so far.  Feels good on your hands.  Carries other scents well.</li>
            <li> Need for making EO products.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Nice and light, scent is not real heavy. Blends well with essential oils and other butters. Will buy agin when run out.</li>
            <li> It seems to be of a great quality. I use it either directly as body lotion, in body lotions that I make or as massage oil.</li>
            <li> Sometimes things seem to good to be true; this purchase definitely was. The title of the item says &amp;#34;Life-Flo Organic Pure Grapeseed Oil.&amp;#34; It is not certified organic oil. I returned this because of the fact that it isn&#x27;t organic, as I was looking. For an oil to use with oil cleansing for my face. It seemed like it was an ok product, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that it is not certified organic.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for hot oil treatments and does seem to work. It leaves the hair hydrated and nourish just one treatment. It is very light weight, non greasy and fragrance free. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is so nice and keeps my skin moist.  It is like all other body oils and can feel greasy if you put too much on.  It seems odorless to me.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to use for skin and hair during cold, drying, winter season.  It is very light and absorbs quickly.  I massage into my feet and sleep with socks on, for great moisturizing.  Great for all over skin moisturizing alone or a little oil combined with my favorite lotion works very well.  Absorbs well on dry scalp and hair.  Non-scented and a little goes a long way.  I am very pleased with the versatility of grapeseed oil.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Lore has it that grapeseed oil is good for the skin--as opposed to baby oil that clogs the pores--as opposed to avacado oil that makes you smell like a salad. This stuff really works well for dry skin in the wintertime. It is not cheap, but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the bottle does not give dosage for internal use...it says on the bottle for skin care...I called and found out&lt;br /&gt;I could us it internally but I do not know how much to take...I would have preferred it in capsule form&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Very good oil. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wanted fractionated coconut oil to dilute my therapeutic essential oils with but I couldn&#x27;t find any for a reasonable price with free shipping that was organic. This product seems to be doing the job just fine - I&#x27;ve been using it on my face mixed with tea tree oil and my skin has actually CLEARED UP! (this could also be hormonal, I recently went off a medication I think might have been contributing to the problem so it&#x27;s hard to say which was the solution) I put it on at night before bed and by morning my skin is soft - no oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****this product is not certified organic by any third party as far as I can tell**** The label says &amp;#34;organically grown&amp;#34; but no USDA label or any other certification that I see.</li>
            <li> Great price and good product.</li>
            <li> Got this to help my dry skin and to hopefully clear up some of my acne scars and such. This settle into the skin very smoothly and less tacky than lotion. it also doesnt leave your face oily and even has a soft barely there pleasant smell. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Its great leaves your skin soft as a babies butt</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome. I use it as massage oil and I love it. It has almost no scent at all making it a great base oil to add a scent to.</li>
            <li> Incredible in my hair when I blow dry,  prevents smoking.  Excellent skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great for salad dressing or frying eggs. We bought two bottles and are on the second one . Thank you</li>
            <li> A light oil with no smell that is a perfect massage oil. Leaves dry skin feeling silky smooth with very little tacky feeling. What tackiness you feel soon goes away as the oil is rapidly absorbed.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the reviews... I didn&#x27;t like it, neither my daughter..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its too slow and very simple design . There are lots of better RC cars in Amazon than this ..</li>
            <li> Great for cooking.  Very little greasiness to food and it cleans off pans easily.</li>
            <li> The product that was purchased is not what was sent. They sent a bottle of Pure Magnesium Oil in a wrapper labeled Organic Pure Grapeseed Oil.</li>
            <li> as described, on time and no problems</li>
            <li> Quick shipment. Oil is organic and as advertised. Has a light grape scent and is not too heavy. Works great in my pre-shampoo concatenation.</li>
            <li> I got this oil a few months ago. Just opened it, and the inner cover was broken. It&#x27;s too late to return now. Should have checked the bottle when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Great oil that is light. Great for skin and hair. This oil is great for a pre-blowing drying product. Use sparingly and avoid the roots.  Makes hair soooooo smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> During the winter my skin is very dry. Applying a small amount of grapeseed oil to the skin, allows it to become moist but not oily.  As a hair conditioner you just need a small dab and apply it while the hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a face cleanser and swear by it!  My face hasn&#x27;t been cleaner and it works great as a substitute for harsh cleansers. I follow up wit Moroccan Argon Oil as a moisturizer. The combination of these two all-natural products has left my skin in the best shape it has ever been in!  Cheap too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this grape seed oil my hair is so much better since I have been using I will be purchasing more I love love love love it</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smell is important for the all over body cream a sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No smell and nice product. I will buy again..</li>
            <li> I found this very useful both for my skin (doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy) and my tummy. I pour some to a little container and store it on my vanity while I use the rest for cooking purpose, it works wonder with steak. The bottle medium size renders it convenient to bring during traveling...which is great since its versatility makes it a great all-purpose oil for me (it works for high heat cooking, salad dressing and facial, body and hair moisturizer/conditioner). Highly recommender</li>
            <li> After finishing my novel for Kindle, Story of The Ghost, I wanted to cook a little more than I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I would use olive oil for any meat in the pan. Also, I would use butter to make eggs. Grapeseed oil has replaced both olive oil and butter in my pantry. Eggs come out better for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very light, and Yes - you can use it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of the chefs on the cooking shows use grapeseed and that makes me think I&#x27;m a little bit smarter in the kitchen now than I was in the past.</li>
            <li> Great product and price, I use this everyday and it is everything my friend told me it would be.  Great for face and whole body.</li>
            <li> This oil is a very good skin moisturizer. It&#x27;s not thick or greasy. It does make your skin shinny for the first 15-20 minutes after putting the oil on.</li>
            <li> great for skin and hair</li>
            <li> Perfect for massaging or moisturizing my DRY skin.  I put some essential oil and some of this product into smaller bottles to give it a nice fragrance.  Worked perfectly.  I also use Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Sweet Almond Oil for massaging and makeup removal but I think I like this product better for moisturizing.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I use it every night on my face and neck before bed....after a few months people started asking me what I do to take care of my skin. So I know this stuff works!!</li>
            <li> Great oil. Smoothes the skin tremendously. Can use it for hair or skin. I got it because I have sensitive skin and I needed something to keep my skin from being dry without breaking out.</li>
            <li> I enjoy every bit of this oil</li>
            <li> Grapeseed oil is a fantastic oil to use for your hair I am African American woman who has recently going natural actually I&#x27;ve been natural for about 6 months I have found my grape seed oil my coconut oil my jojobo oil or wonderful oils to either use alone or in combination with moisture leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> The order took awhile to get to me, but it was worth the wait! I would have given it five stars but I am not sure if it will make my hair grow. I know that it is an excellent moisturizer for my hair and I have only been using it for 6 days. I can tell A big difference, however I will have to wait a few weeks or a month to notice hair growth! Nevertheless I would recommend this oil to so many people! If someone is looking for light and moisture they should buy this!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Well packaged and great quality. I use this oil for skin and hair, not greasy at all. Highly recommend for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I am loving this oil. I purchased it to mix with other pricey oils to make a face oil and it works well. I also use it as a body oil straight out of the shower and it leaves my skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> Love this oil as the &#x27;most often used&#x27; carrier for my essential oil blends and skin care lotions/salves.  Have used it before this purchase and now will continue with Amazon as my source.  Over the past few years, I have experimented with various organic oils, and find this oil is best for my skin.  I only use organic oils for skin care supplies.&lt;br /&gt;A few family teenagers also like it as a carrier for an acne treatment (2-3 times a day), that is made with two drops of organic tea tree/Melaleuca alt. oil per 5 ml of organic grapeseed oil in a roll-on applicator bottle. Just a few dabs has done wonders for them!&lt;br /&gt;This organic grapeseed oilk/aka:GSO, absorbs quickly in my applications.&lt;br /&gt;This GSO is also a great top layer after spraying &amp;#34; Ancient Minerals &amp;#34;Magnesium Oils&amp;#34; as part of my daily practice.  For ease of use, a two ounce pump dispenser is great, and again, just a dab will do.&lt;br /&gt;This is also delicious as a salad oil.</li>
            <li> This is all I use to wash my face at night.  Love it/</li>
            <li> This oil is a little heavier than some other brands of grapeseed oil.  It is high quality and a good sized bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil. I use it for everything!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, It works great on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like but when I ordered it elsewhere the color and flavor were bold and intense. Maybe I just got an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; batch from Amazon...?</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after lots and lots of research into the oil cleansing method and I have to say that I am quite pleased. I have been using this product on my face every morning for the purpose of cleansing and moisturizing for over a month now. Who would have ever thought that an oil can help to clean your face? Well, against all intuition, it does. This oil does what it claims to do. It does not at all clog my pores. It tightens them. It moisturizes a little, but I find that I need to follow up with a moisturizing non-astringent oil in very very tiny amounts after this oil because this grapeseed oil will tighten my skin and dry it out a little bit. My skin seems to love this stuff; I will massage it into my unwashed, dry face each morning and then follow up with a wet hot washcloth to remove the excess. My face glows like it never did before and I have fewer breakouts. I used to have an oily complexion, but now, my oil is far more tamed because my skin is always moisturized properly with this oil (and jojoba oil as the follow-up moisturizer). Definitely money worth spent. And I don&#x27;t go through it very fast either; it&#x27;s gonna last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, there is no USDA organic label on it, so there is no real proof that it is in fact organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED on May 17, 2014 to add:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for nearly a year now an I am still pleased with this product. I have a little less than half of the bottle left and there are no signs of rancidity at all. Still smells good. No discoloration. Still getting the same results. It really does cleanse the face. You will never believe that an oil will clean your face until you try it. If you have an oily complexion, you will be mortified like I was to try it--but guess what. It works. And here&#x27;s why: contrary to everything you&#x27;ve ever heard about acne and skin cleansing, your skin NEEDS and WANTS oil. If you wash it all away and don&#x27;t moisturize it or replace it with something, your skin is going to react by making EXCESSIVE amounts of oil. I&#x27;ve always had an oily complexion, and it comes right back if I fail to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil to cleanse my face but then I follow up with jojoba oil as my moisturizer, and my face is very happy with that, and it keeps the oily complexion away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, you know that feeling when you wake up in the morning with that icky, oil slick feeling to your face? I guarantee you that will go away if you keep your face moisturized 24/7. After your facewash at night, apply a moisturizer (jojoba oil, very light application, rub it in). In the morning you will not feel the oil slick anymore.our skin is going to react by making EXCESSIVE amounts of oil.

            <li> Though I received this product the very next day; it smelled like it was old/used oil! There was no nutritional information on this product and no expiration date! I am very unhappy with this product and will NOT purchase again!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what hearers oil is expected to do. I even put some in my sons hair. Very great for skin and hair!!</li>
            <li> Great for a light moisturizer</li>
            <li> Did what I needed it to</li>
            <li> I love this Grapeseed oil, is perfect for my dry skin! I had acne problems for years and it was the only thing that helped me to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I watched a show time show where couples can use this. So we tried it. It&#x27;s cheaper than the typical stuff. We love it!</li>
            <li> I originally purchase this oil for massages.  But now I use it a lot.  I put a little in my skin lotions.  It absorbs into the skin nicely and in my opinion its a healthy oil.</li>
            <li> I use it for bath and body products. It&#x27;s odorless and absorbs quickly. Great overall product.</li>
            <li> Good carrier oil. No complaints here! Very light in color and no odor makes it great for mixing with essential oils. I also heat it up with beeswax and Shea butter to make body butters.</li>
            <li> Edit 5/28/2016:&lt;br /&gt;After using it the first time, I really loved it and it lasted me almost 2 years. So now I bought it a second time, but it reeks! It&#x27;s Grapeseed oil, it&#x27;s not supposed to even HAVE a smell! I am so disappointed! I don&#x27;t think I can even return it... And even if I do, what are they gonna do with it? The thing seems to have expired. But it smells suspiciously a lot like catfish oil... I&#x27;m changing the 5 stars I had to a 1 star. I just wasted my money...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my face. It&#x27;s great. My skin had to get used to it after years of torturing it with the toxic products that sell as natural and benign, like Neutrogena, Ponds, etc. So at first, after soaking the oil in, my face would feel a bit dry (especially since we were in the winter). But after two weeks, my face stayed moisturized the whole day after applying the oil in the morning. My face feels the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been since I was a child. You need to be very careful with the amount of oil you use though. I only require literally a drop, so you know its going to last me. Some people may require one or two drops more depending on the size of the face or the skin type, but that&#x27;s up to you to find out. Application method is also important! Rub the oil between your fingertips and then lightly tap your face with it, then, and only then, you can proceed to rub. If you try rubbing right away your going to &#x27;run out&#x27; and feel like you need more cause you can&#x27;t drag it over the rest of your face, but then you&#x27;ll realize your face will be extremely oily, too much for the skin to absorb. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> All organic and its not greasy great alternative to chemical moisturizers. Use it for face and body and massages! Wish shipping was not so expensive though.</li>
            <li> Love this in my hair, I added this to my hair regimen and it fit very nicely. (4c natural hair).</li>
            <li> The oil smells just a bit rancid. I know that rancid oil is not good for health, but does it apply to oil that is not used to eat but rather applied to the skin? I don&#x27;t know. If it wasn&#x27;t for the slightest rancid smell I would give it five starts.  It is not strongly noticeable - I do tend to have a nose for that type of thing. It is not near the expiration date until 2015.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great quilts doesn&#x27;t smell isnt that greasy works great for hair and skin big bottle will probably last for a long time</li>
            <li> Read about it on oil cleansing method website for acne prone skin.  Has not really improved my skin but hasn&#x27;t made it worse either.  Might work better for others  so worth a try</li>
            <li> Great oil, good price.</li>
            <li> I have read many articles touting the anti-occident benefits of grapeseed oil.  I am currently using it on my legs after shaving and on my feet after a foot treatment.  It feels very light and is absorbed quickly into the skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use it instead of baby oil and it is great for skin</li>
            <li> I use this as makeup remover and it does a great job.  I feel like I&#x27;m hydrating at the same time.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to use to wash my face and it worked pretty well.  I mixed it with castor oil and lavender and have been pleased with the results so far.  It says organic in the title, but the bottle doesn&#x27;t show that&#x27;s certified organic, so I wish there was more information about the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; claim in the title, but for face wash it&#x27;s solid.</li>
            <li> This is a great massage oil, not too much smell and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling super oily.</li>
            <li> Im using it i think its good</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase of Grape seed oil on Amazon which I found to be a little cheaper than Wholefoods  Market. I would have given 5 stars but I just looked at the bottle again. it appears that the expiration date is slightly rubbed off or it&#x27;s very faint. I will be using this product weekly so I am sure that it&#x27;s ok. It took about a week for arrival and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Often times, I try to buy Grapeseed Oil and it has turned green. It is just a part of the aging process, but not attractive to customers. The coloring of this oil was perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use it for many things. From a light, fast absorbing, non greasy skin softener, to a natural, non chemical intimate lubricant. I mix it with glycerine and rose hip seed oil and use it on my face nightly. It absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave oily stains on my pillow. I have noticed a difference in the tiny lines around my eyes and lips and it just gives my skin a soft, more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this product.  I live in Arizona where it&#x27;s dry all of the time and no matter what type of moisturizer I&#x27;m using, my face feels so dry.  I add this grapeseed oil to my favorite moisturizer and my face looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, is good, no complaints. It worked for me. Blends well with the other oils I use on my skin..</li>
            <li> Be careful what you order this with. The top seal on mine was partially opened when I got the package, so grapeseed oil was covering everything in the box.</li>
            <li> I use grape seed oil on my hair mix with a few other oils mix with three small drops of neem oil use it for my natural hair. I also use grape seed on my body, it gives you a natural looking glow and it help your skin become solf and sooooooo smooth good stuff. Do it the natural way well ya.</li>
            <li> this grapeseed oil is very good for skinecare and body</li>
            <li> Good product, good seller</li>
            <li> Love the size. I used it on my face and no breakouts. I use it in my hair products and body oil. Very light oil no fragrance, which is a plus, so you can add your own scent to it. A great buy.</li>
            <li> This oil is great.  It&#x27;s not easy to find and it&#x27;s not cheap.  Amazon had this at a good price- it&#x27;s a big bottle and will last a while.</li>
            <li> Works well for making home made sugar acrub</li>
            <li> great massage oil too</li>
            <li> Use it for cooking or soft skin</li>
            <li> I use this as a carrier for my essential oil roller bottles. This oil does not cause me to break out as coconut oil does! This is my second bottle of grapes ed from this company.</li>
            <li> My order was delivered quickly, and I am very pleased with the grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li> *  I use this oil for making my homemade epsom salt scrubs and it leaves my skin very soft.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent so any added essential oils are not drowned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Also nice for a neutral salad dressing oil when you want mild herbs to stand along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This oil seems to work well in my natural 4b hair but it is very thick i suggest mixing it with something.</li>
            <li> This product itself is great and it is exactly what I expected. It was neatly packaged and it came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT ORGANIC! But I used it in cooking since I could not return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face since I have very dry skin in the winter. It did not help with the dryness or flakiness whatsoever but it did give my skin a nice glow and it makes me feel like I am taking care of myself. I am not acne-prone and don&#x27;t use a lot so it doesn&#x27;t give me breakouts. Maybe this will work better for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s partly because I started drinking more water and exfoliating once a week but my dry, flaky, scaly skin has disappeared! I think the grapeseed oil has definitely helped. I also whipped it with coconut oil to make a body lotion and it gives the most amazing, fluffy consistency.</li>
            <li> I am getting married in a few months and wanted to find something to moisten my skin. This as been working great so far mixing in with my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> must better than any cream I have used - I use it as a body oil - have bought for family as well!</li>
