            <li>Nice product for the price.</li>

            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>It came packaged so nice</li>
            <li>Nice staff.</li>
            <li>this is the best thing I got for them to sit and really have girl time.</li>
            <li>In case you&#x27;re wondering, the lids do tighten on nicely.  </li>
            <li>And came in handy for me.</li>
            <li>This is my honest review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They came packaged nicely and didn&#x27;t have a spill anywhere.</li>
            <li>Came in on time so many pretty colors and they&#x27;re great for making your own glitter acrylic mixes looks soooo good</li>
            <li>I love love loved them.</li>
            <li>These were great and arrived quickly with amazon prime.  </li>
            <li>Wow what a great deal!</li>
            <li>Wow happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>all the colors are beautiful, they&#x27;re many to chose from and have fun with .</li>
            <li>It is very fine glitter.  </li>
            <li>so awesome, and I only got 5 repeat colors, and they happened to be really cute and popular colors.</li>
            <li>Very fine powder more than a glitter.</li>
            <li>Glitter is super fine and looks great on gel nails.</li>
            <li>But surprisingly I guess I got lucky</li>
            <li>The glitter was very light and has a lot of static.</li>
            <li>Beautiful vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>These have been a huge hit wherever I take them and people are always asking me where i get them!</li>
            <li>but I have to say I LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the glitter.</li>
            <li>So many different awesome colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>So many choices when you order this glitter.  </li>
            <li>Most of the jars were opened</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it,Love it</li>
            <li>They were also fully packed with glitter, so maybe they&#x27;ve read the reviews &amp;/or paid better attention to the amounts.</li>
            <li>I think it could have been better packaged to prevent this.</li>
            <li>What more can you expect with glitter though...</li>
            <li>so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive a box like most of the people on here</li>
            <li>I love sparkles</li>
            <li>I am a &amp;#34;rookie at home nail technician&amp;#34; :) and I like to mix these with my acrylic powder and use my ASP dual nail forms.</li>
            <li>Pleased with shipping too.</li>
            <li>I want to leave a better review</li>
            <li>, I am ordering some more</li>
            <li>I love most of the colors. :)</li>
            <li>and she was in love.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay because she shared them with me.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I had so many repeating colors that instead of being 45 colors its more like 15.  </li>
            <li>most are non mettalic</li>
            <li>the colors are really cute too use.</li>
            <li>and they werent filled up all the way!</li>
            <li>Everything was there and each container filled to capacity!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, I still love the product.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>These were ok for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>More ended up sticking to my table than on my brush or nails.</li>
            <li>We love the colors, even though there were some repeat colors in our order.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I wish they woulda sent more than one of those hehe.</li>
            <li>These glitters came in twist top containers</li>
            <li>so I had to make sure they were all retightened when I received them.</li>
            <li>The glitter did spill over everything from shipping but it was an easy clean up and there was still a good amount in each tub.</li>
            <li>MANY COLORS!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Cant wait to order more</li>
            <li>Love the glitter.</li>
            <li>A lot were opened but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>My practice clients are really enjoying the Colors a lot.</li>
            <li>some containers have more glitter then others, but regardless i love them.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>More like a 40 piece set.</li>
            <li>We use these glitters with shellac nail polish &amp; uv lights for a outstanding look.</li>
            <li>The glitter itself is ok.</li>
            <li>Most of it I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li>I would have given a better rating if I could have gotten a replacement.</li>
            <li>All many colors of glitter</li>
            <li>Took awhile to come but was pleased</li>
            <li>Some of the pots are dust and others are more glitter</li>
            <li>it has so many colors to chose from y</li>
            <li>Love works well with</li>
            <li>Love the colors can&#x27;t wait to try it out. :)</li>
            <li>I even like using them in top coats to make glitter polish.</li>
            <li>she was very excited and like the glitter product.  </li>
            <li>But im pretty sure its still a good product.</li>
            <li>Great love the glitter very satisfied with the glitter easy to work with and fin enough that it&#x27;s not going to stick out when you put the top coat over the glitter.</li>
            <li>But overall I am happy with the variety, I just wish there was more in the tub!</li>
            <li>They were also packaged good no leaKage;)</li>
            <li>Jars don&#x27;t secure the best, so you have to make sure lids are on properly</li>
            <li>Most of the product were barely full!</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>and mostly my brides and other clients love it!!!</li>
            <li>Wow these are great.</li>
            <li>They shipped fast, packaged good, there wasn&#x27;t glitter</li>
            <li>loved it thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But the customer service was really good and fast.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; come off well</li>
            <li>So overall I am happy with this order. :)</li>
            <li>They stick well and are easy to pick up.</li>
            <li>fine glitter and so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Pots</li>
            <li>Delivery was on time but most of the tops weren&#x27;t on good most of the glitter was spilled out or low.. glitter had spilled out into plastic containers that host the bottles.</li>
            <li>But I definitely didn&#x27;t mind once I started going through the beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>but it is all the fine glitter.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to buy some glue - she ran out of it too quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and arrived unopened!</li>
            <li>so, there was some mess when I opened it and the containers aren&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li>but they are very pretty!</li>
            <li>And very pretty!</li>
            <li>Love all the different bright colors.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic collection of glitter powder.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed all the nail art I have bought, it has been so much fun doing all the designs we have done.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cheap</li>
            <li>I saw a photo with the pods filled all the way that&#x27;s why I purchased them</li>
            <li>Fantastic deal for 45 glitters.</li>
            <li>Overall a GREAT buy.</li>
            <li>you wil enjoy too</li>
            <li>It works great to do different designs on nails!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and super shinny.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see all the colors.</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>My daughter bought the original &amp;#34;shimmer kit&amp;#34; for glitter tattoos.</li>
            <li>I am so excited.</li>
            <li>totally worth it!</li>
            <li>and I had to clean all of them before I could use them.</li>
            <li>The containers themselves aren&#x27;t huge, about the size of a quarter, but the glitter itself is the dusting type, which means it doesn&#x27;t take a very big container to hold a fairly substantial amount of product.</li>
            <li>Using these make me feel special and fancy and all of my Nieces/girlfriends want to come to my house to get their mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>how vivid and bright they are cant wait to see these with nail acrylic in action :)</li>
            <li>My niece ordered same item her came in good condition.</li>
            <li>I loved the glitters I just thought they would be bigger containers.</li>
            <li>this was a reasonable option to get her more.</li>
            <li>I am loving these so far.</li>
            <li>I got only one repeat glitter out of 45, that seems fair.</li>
            <li>I really would not recommend this type for my top 3 choices</li>
            <li>I recommend putting the entire set in a container with a good lid, to keep the glitter from getting everywhere.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re not even a 1/4 full.</li>
            <li>The containers are in good condition and all screw on properly so no messes.</li>
            <li>Not bad but not a lot ether.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Came in 2 weeks, not bad .</li>
            <li>This is good for someone trying to find a perfect shade match and maybe one of the colors is a little off, but the other is just perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great colors</li>
            <li>These are the perfect addition to any serious nail art enthusiast.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the turnout and will most definitely recommended to others.</li>
            <li>The glitter is super chunky, some colors weren&#x27;t even sparkly when put on nails and</li>
            <li>She quickly went through that supply.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick</li>
            <li>Love them so many different colors to use from !</li>
            <li>Many beautiful shimmering colors, but not good for nails.  </li>
            <li>great colors my wife loved them but the only thing the person who packaged them was really messy.</li>
            <li>i like that it comes with  a bunch of colors for pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>were very pretty, thus the 2 stars.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>VERY DISAPOINTED!!</li>
            <li>I will be definitely buying more of these!</li>
            <li>I did however receive multiples of a few colors which is ok because they were mostly my favorite shades!</li>
            <li>Great colors but the tiniest little containers.</li>
            <li>wide variety of bright colors.  </li>
            <li>The colors are so intriguing on the nail.</li>
            <li>These brought some fun into it.</li>
            <li>They are worth</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>This glitter is so fun.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the money OR wait.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice because the containers are not really big.</li>
            <li>Fun purchase..</li>
            <li>Of course the color I need the most gold was almost completely dumped out in the bag with the rest of the colors that spilled.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait</li>
            <li>but if it were filled any further there would be a lot more spillage than survived products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it has to be changed more frequently.</li>
            <li>it is the right size to create a nice sparkle without being gritty or grainy on your nails.</li>
            <li>In the photo some of the colors look as though they are duplicates however they are not; each hue is a unique shade of the color family depicted in the photo, some varying only slightly, mostly in undertones</li>
            <li>The nail art glitter powder is high quality and extremely fine.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it was good.</li>
            <li>where great the gave me a small refund and let me keep what I had.</li>
            <li>Glitter in various colors and most were pretty full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fine dust, not like craft glitter with big chunks, so it&#x27;s softer on the skin.</li>
            <li>so open it on an easy to clean surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, probably only 3 maybe 4 of the same color.</li>
            <li>They require a few more top coats</li>
            <li>Overall a great foundation to build a larger collection upon.  </li>
            <li>no duplicates, all the colors are very nice, jars are small, but just like described</li>
            <li>The shipping package could have been a little better, nothing is marked color wise, but you get a decent amount of glitter.  </li>
            <li>If the customer service had not been so amazing this would have got a 1 star, there is a wide variety of colors I did not have one repeat color in all 45 that I received.</li>
            <li>I love the assortment, but they were a lot smaller</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy these again someday.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like in the pic.</li>
            <li>Will order more in the future, Must have for makeup and nails.</li>
            <li>They are just as pretty of colors as in the picture.</li>
            <li>it was only a quarter filled!</li>
            <li>Firstly the product was on time I must complement.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Although I love the price and all the colors I&#x27;m only rating three stars because of the packaging.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as shown, and we&#x27;ll packaged..  </li>
            <li>Their are alot of really pretty glitters</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very radiant and shimmery!</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying something from this company and bought it even after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty blend.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered, used for acrylics tips.</li>
            <li>Many of the containers came open and it was all over the place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>packaged well, but jar are more empty then full</li>
            <li>I can do so many different things with these!</li>
            <li>There are so many different colors!</li>
            <li>Really good product none were missing</li>
            <li>The glitter choices are great and will last us for a very, very long time!</li>
            <li>They are sooooo VIBRANT and Pretty!</li>
            <li>i have not yet used the product, that is why i&#x27;m only giving four stars, but the colors are rich and none of them are duplicates!</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and fun.  </li>
            <li>it is super cheap and comes with tons of different colors to create really nifty nail art looks.</li>
            <li>The glitter containers are small and not as full as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more glitter in the cases .. but other than that the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Some of them where full some weren&#x27;t these are suppose to be brand new but really look as if they have been used.</li>
            <li>Very cool and big selection of colors.</li>
            <li>Other than the tiny containers the colors are pretty and at a very nice price</li>
            <li>However, after cleaning it up, which didn&#x27;t take long, I have to say I love the product.</li>
            <li>I loved the product but the containers that hold the glitter leak small amounts of glitter out</li>
            <li>It is a good amount that you get in the small containers.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more deep darker colors or at least a good mix.</li>
            <li>Small containers but good choice in colors</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll have 40 or less useful containers but for the price its alright</li>
            <li>Easy to place on regular nail polish or gel polish.  </li>
            <li>Also note that many of the colors seem so close to the same color but under bright light you certainly can see they are a little off from each other.</li>
            <li>but I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much considering the price.</li>
            <li>Also some of the pots were either cracked, scratched, or only half/quarter of the way filled.</li>
            <li>I would expect to pay about $3.00 for this on here, They are extremely tiny jars, BARELY filled, and some have spilled.  </li>
            <li>i really like this set of glitter.</li>
            <li>Not so much that I know I will have them forever.</li>
            <li>They dont contain a whole bunch of glitter...</li>
            <li>It works very well with my stencil tattoo kit I have.</li>
            <li>it arrived fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re very affordable.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The colors really POP.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The variety of colors is very nice and the little containers are quality enough.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t mind that much since I can still use more than half of it and do intend to after I finish cleaning it up a bit.</li>
            <li>Oh, and one more thing, be careful when first removing the jars from the packaging as some of the lids were barely screwed on.  </li>
            <li>Cups r only 1/4 full if that..</li>
            <li>it is messy but a fan brush will sweep that loose glitter away great value.</li>
            <li>Yes, some caps were loose but nothing really spilled beside a a light dusting on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased to say that this set arrived in less than 2 weeks although the projection was 4 weeks to 1 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and shiny different colors I can use for my nail polish  when I start creating them.</li>
            <li>I did get a very pretty variety of colors but probably don&#x27;t have enough of some of them.</li>
            <li>, I probably would have had a grand mess on my hands.  </li>
            <li>High glow.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love the little pots that these come in.</li>
            <li>But most the containers were half full because they were loosely capped.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than I thought the containers would be, but the colors are so vibrant and so many assortments of colors!</li>
            <li>All different pretty much.</li>
            <li>I did get different colors but the containers were only 1/4 full!</li>
            <li>I had to clean all the loose glitter out .</li>
            <li>It may not seem like much because they are half filled</li>
            <li>Those are nice colors, and some are the same, and are in Little containers, so you can mix them up.</li>
            <li>7 more were open and two almost empty.</li>
            <li>use this kind of glitter to mix with acrylic powder and use as a color base, it&#x27;s what I bought it for, and it works amazingly for it.</li>
            <li>are very easy to open and seal tight again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any repeat colors and the little pots are perfect for nail art or dramatic makeup application.</li>
            <li>Do not I repeat do not waste your money on these!</li>
            <li>it looks like them mixed colors together creating a not so pretty drab color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that they are small so they can be packed away when i take my nail art boxes to friends parties.</li>
            <li>I had a few duplicate colors, where I thought they would be all different, and a good ten of them were opened and leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li>And some aren&#x27;t full but the were closed all the way.</li>
            <li>Pmshipped from Amazon fulfillment Center, came really quick.</li>
            <li>ante ALOT of the glitter was spilled creating  a huge mess when i opened it.</li>
            <li>There really is no way to use this glitter unless one wants to do a kaleidoscope type piece, as there is not enough of a single color to cover more than a square inch or so.</li>
            <li>I expected full containers of glitter, highly suggest looking at a different seller.</li>
            <li>Once you apply it to your nails and seal in the glitter with a clear top coat the glitter completely become dull and saturated, losing all its shine.  </li>
            <li>The glitter came packaged in a clear flimsy box and that box was set inside a cardboard box without any Styrofoam for cushion.</li>
            <li>Unless you want the hassle of not getting any product you can use and the hassle of a refund DO NOT waste your time.</li>
            <li>I have been waiting for nearly 2 months</li>
            <li>do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised with all the colors &amp; amounts.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old who loves to do glitter tattoos.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of colors that are very close in shade, but when looked at closely are different.</li>
            <li>Most of the glitters were not shut completely and a few had no glitter left in containers.</li>
            <li>Over all good product just not enough mix of colors and poor packaging.</li>
            <li>The little individual pods are not full and you would be lucky to be able to do 3 nails with one pod.  </li>
            <li>This product takes a little practice to use, but the colors are fun and limitless!  </li>
            <li>The containers are not even half full.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent on it!</li>
            <li>But one jar was open they were WAY smaller than expected it really isnt worth the money</li>
            <li>but for the price it&#x27;s stil worth it and will last a long time!</li>
            <li>Major pain in the butt!</li>
            <li>You can also apply this glitter to your bare nail or toe nail with clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>The glitters are pretty but the containers arebonly about the size of a nickle, and there&#x27;s only enough glitter in each one to barely cover the bottom of the container.  </li>
            <li>When they arrived all of them were outside of their packaging and they arrived with a couple other items I purchased so everything was super glittery.</li>
            <li>a little messy some were open &amp; spilled out in the bag, but other then that beautiful colors</li>
            <li>there are a few very pretty metallic glitters</li>
            <li>There were only 3 that were closed properly and were completely full.</li>
            <li>Also, the containers are only about half full of glitter.</li>
            <li>I got these in the mail at a decent shipment time didnt wait long</li>
            <li>Most of them are half empty and are not closed properly.</li>
            <li>I love the colors but it took well over a month to come in and most of the jars are only half full of glitter was extremely disappointed after waiting so long.</li>
            <li>The containers are even half filled and for 4 colors I got repeat colors from any where between 3-5 of a single color l</li>
            <li>I received a variety of shades and noticed that I barely had duplicates.</li>
            <li>I couldnt even begin to tell you how the product is because the glitter is all mixed together and completely ruined.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one color so far, added it to my asphalt color</li>
            <li>I only 2-3 duplicate colors in each of the sets i bought, but i will say that some of the colors are very similiar and only a shade or two different.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the colors, and they all came in one piece, so none were broken.</li>
            <li>Messy package but a fun set of glitters.</li>
            <li>Can be used by themselves, however I mixed with clear product to creat a great less expensive alternative to colored nail powders.</li>
            <li>They shipped super fast and none of the containers were broken.</li>
            <li>I kinda knew by other reviews not to expect to much though.</li>
            <li>I made a mess the first time, but that&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li>I noticed that one of the containers was slightly open, but it wasn&#x27;t major.</li>
            <li>That disappointed me greatly.</li>
            <li>I thought the containers would at least be 1/2 way full</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because even though I new there would be a wait, the almost month long wait drove be nuts!!!</li>
            <li>I got way to many pink and orange but only one dark color (black).</li>
            <li>The only minor issue was that one of the jars wasn&#x27;t closed tightly and spilled while in transit, but all the rest were secure</li>
            <li>only thing I didn&#x27;t like is there is repeat colors, so its 45 containers not 45 colors, for some reason 10 of mine were green, 3 of the exact same gold</li>
            <li>Was very late, gave three stars instead of five because most of the pinks are repeated and two of the glitters were empty because they were not closed properly or popped open while being shipped</li>
            <li>my dust fell out in the box the containers was open and there are little that I cannot do much with it.</li>
            <li>I fee that they just took some colors and mixed them with other colors to try and create new color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already mixed some with acrylic and the glitters on these bad boys pop out (in a good way)</li>

            <li> Very nice colors.</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk!</li>
            <li> These glitter pots are so perfect for encapsulating and doing really creative designs.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors, look nice in the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> great price for so many!</li>
            <li> so I looked like a Vegas showgirl/drag queen when I opened the package, but the glitter is fine and wonderful.</li>
            <li> The picture indicates a lot of bright colors</li>
            <li> Love these, great assortment and great value.  </li>
            <li> There are wonderful size nice color not repeat :)</li>
            <li> Price was good though</li>
            <li> the colors are good and i like using them.</li>
            <li> The packaging was not so good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still fair.</li>
            <li> i tried them and they worked good.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> that I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the item&#x27;s I received and also they let me keep the item&#x27;s at the end of day!</li>

            <li> The end result that I got doing my glitter tattoos was amazing.</li>
            <li> but most of them are not that bright.  </li>
            <li> I love all the colors and they  work good.</li>
            <li> Nice variety, some colors look alike</li>
            <li> Honestly I will never buy this again</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> I like to do my own nails</li>
            <li> i got nice colors even though there were some repeats</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> It came packaged so nice</li>
            <li> Nice staff.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing I got for them to sit and really have girl time.</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering, the lids do tighten on nicely.  </li>
            <li> And came in handy for me.</li>
            <li> This is my honest review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They came packaged nicely and didn&#x27;t have a spill anywhere.</li>
            <li> Came in on time so many pretty colors and they&#x27;re great for making your own glitter acrylic mixes looks soooo good</li>
            <li> I love love loved them.</li>
            <li> These were great and arrived quickly with amazon prime.  </li>
            <li> Wow what a great deal!</li>
            <li> Wow happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> all the colors are beautiful, they&#x27;re many to chose from and have fun with .</li>
            <li> It is very fine glitter.  </li>
            <li> so awesome, and I only got 5 repeat colors, and they happened to be really cute and popular colors.</li>
            <li> Very fine powder more than a glitter.</li>
            <li> Glitter is super fine and looks great on gel nails.</li>
            <li> But surprisingly I guess I got lucky</li>
            <li> The glitter was very light and has a lot of static.</li>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> These have been a huge hit wherever I take them and people are always asking me where i get them!</li>
            <li> but I have to say I LOVE</li>
            <li> I love the glitter.</li>
            <li> So many different awesome colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> So many choices when you order this glitter.  </li>
            <li> Most of the jars were opened</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it,Love it</li>
            <li> They were also fully packed with glitter, so maybe they&#x27;ve read the reviews &amp;/or paid better attention to the amounts.</li>
            <li> I think it could have been better packaged to prevent this.</li>
            <li> What more can you expect with glitter though...</li>
            <li> so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> love them</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive a box like most of the people on here</li>
            <li> I love sparkles</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;rookie at home nail technician&amp;#34; :) and I like to mix these with my acrylic powder and use my ASP dual nail forms.</li>
            <li> Pleased with shipping too.</li>
            <li> I want to leave a better review</li>
            <li> , I am ordering some more</li>
            <li> I love most of the colors. :)</li>
            <li> and she was in love.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay because she shared them with me.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had so many repeating colors that instead of being 45 colors its more like 15.  </li>
            <li> most are non mettalic</li>
            <li> the colors are really cute too use.</li>
            <li> and they werent filled up all the way!</li>
            <li> Everything was there and each container filled to capacity!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I still love the product.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> These were ok for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> More ended up sticking to my table than on my brush or nails.</li>
            <li> We love the colors, even though there were some repeat colors in our order.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I wish they woulda sent more than one of those hehe.</li>
            <li> These glitters came in twist top containers</li>
            <li> so I had to make sure they were all retightened when I received them.</li>
            <li> The glitter did spill over everything from shipping but it was an easy clean up and there was still a good amount in each tub.</li>
            <li> MANY COLORS!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Cant wait to order more</li>
            <li> Love the glitter.</li>
            <li> A lot were opened but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> My practice clients are really enjoying the Colors a lot.</li>
            <li> some containers have more glitter then others, but regardless i love them.</li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> More like a 40 piece set.</li>
            <li> We use these glitters with shellac nail polish &amp; uv lights for a outstanding look.</li>
            <li> The glitter itself is ok.</li>
            <li> Most of it I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I would have given a better rating if I could have gotten a replacement.</li>
            <li> All many colors of glitter</li>
            <li> Took awhile to come but was pleased</li>
            <li> Some of the pots are dust and others are more glitter</li>
            <li> it has so many colors to chose from y</li>
            <li> Love works well with</li>
            <li> Love the colors can&#x27;t wait to try it out. :)</li>
            <li> I even like using them in top coats to make glitter polish.</li>
            <li> she was very excited and like the glitter product.  </li>
            <li> But im pretty sure its still a good product.</li>
            <li> Great love the glitter very satisfied with the glitter easy to work with and fin enough that it&#x27;s not going to stick out when you put the top coat over the glitter.</li>
            <li> But overall I am happy with the variety, I just wish there was more in the tub!</li>
            <li> They were also packaged good no leaKage;)</li>
            <li> Jars don&#x27;t secure the best, so you have to make sure lids are on properly</li>
            <li> Most of the product were barely full!</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> and mostly my brides and other clients love it!!!</li>
            <li> Wow these are great.</li>
            <li> They shipped fast, packaged good, there wasn&#x27;t glitter</li>
            <li> loved it thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But the customer service was really good and fast.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; come off well</li>
            <li> So overall I am happy with this order. :)</li>
            <li> They stick well and are easy to pick up.</li>
            <li> fine glitter and so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Pots</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time but most of the tops weren&#x27;t on good most of the glitter was spilled out or low.. glitter had spilled out into plastic containers that host the bottles.</li>
            <li> But I definitely didn&#x27;t mind once I started going through the beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> but it is all the fine glitter.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to buy some glue - she ran out of it too quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and arrived unopened!</li>
            <li> so, there was some mess when I opened it and the containers aren&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li> but they are very pretty!</li>
            <li> And very pretty!</li>
            <li> Love all the different bright colors.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic collection of glitter powder.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed all the nail art I have bought, it has been so much fun doing all the designs we have done.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cheap</li>
            <li> I saw a photo with the pods filled all the way that&#x27;s why I purchased them</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal for 45 glitters.</li>
            <li> Overall a GREAT buy.</li>
            <li> you wil enjoy too</li>
            <li> It works great to do different designs on nails!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and super shinny.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see all the colors.</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought the original &amp;#34;shimmer kit&amp;#34; for glitter tattoos.</li>
            <li> I am so excited.</li>
            <li> totally worth it!</li>
            <li> and I had to clean all of them before I could use them.</li>
            <li> The containers themselves aren&#x27;t huge, about the size of a quarter, but the glitter itself is the dusting type, which means it doesn&#x27;t take a very big container to hold a fairly substantial amount of product.</li>
            <li> Using these make me feel special and fancy and all of my Nieces/girlfriends want to come to my house to get their mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> how vivid and bright they are cant wait to see these with nail acrylic in action :)</li>
            <li> My niece ordered same item her came in good condition.</li>
            <li> I loved the glitters I just thought they would be bigger containers.</li>
            <li> this was a reasonable option to get her more.</li>
            <li> I am loving these so far.</li>
            <li> I got only one repeat glitter out of 45, that seems fair.</li>
            <li> I really would not recommend this type for my top 3 choices</li>
            <li> I recommend putting the entire set in a container with a good lid, to keep the glitter from getting everywhere.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re not even a 1/4 full.</li>
            <li> The containers are in good condition and all screw on properly so no messes.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not a lot ether.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Came in 2 weeks, not bad .</li>
            <li> This is good for someone trying to find a perfect shade match and maybe one of the colors is a little off, but the other is just perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great colors</li>
            <li> These are the perfect addition to any serious nail art enthusiast.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the turnout and will most definitely recommended to others.</li>
            <li> The glitter is super chunky, some colors weren&#x27;t even sparkly when put on nails and</li>
            <li> She quickly went through that supply.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick</li>
            <li> Love them so many different colors to use from !</li>
            <li> Many beautiful shimmering colors, but not good for nails.  </li>
            <li> great colors my wife loved them but the only thing the person who packaged them was really messy.</li>
            <li> i like that it comes with  a bunch of colors for pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> were very pretty, thus the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> I will be definitely buying more of these!</li>
            <li> I did however receive multiples of a few colors which is ok because they were mostly my favorite shades!</li>
            <li> Great colors but the tiniest little containers.</li>
            <li> wide variety of bright colors.  </li>
            <li> The colors are so intriguing on the nail.</li>
            <li> These brought some fun into it.</li>
            <li> They are worth</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> This glitter is so fun.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money OR wait.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice because the containers are not really big.</li>
            <li> Fun purchase..</li>
            <li> Of course the color I need the most gold was almost completely dumped out in the bag with the rest of the colors that spilled.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait</li>
            <li> but if it were filled any further there would be a lot more spillage than survived products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it has to be changed more frequently.</li>
            <li> it is the right size to create a nice sparkle without being gritty or grainy on your nails.</li>
            <li> In the photo some of the colors look as though they are duplicates however they are not; each hue is a unique shade of the color family depicted in the photo, some varying only slightly, mostly in undertones</li>
            <li> The nail art glitter powder is high quality and extremely fine.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it was good.</li>
            <li> where great the gave me a small refund and let me keep what I had.</li>
            <li> Glitter in various colors and most were pretty full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fine dust, not like craft glitter with big chunks, so it&#x27;s softer on the skin.</li>
            <li> so open it on an easy to clean surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, probably only 3 maybe 4 of the same color.</li>
            <li> They require a few more top coats</li>
            <li> Overall a great foundation to build a larger collection upon.  </li>
            <li> no duplicates, all the colors are very nice, jars are small, but just like described</li>
            <li> The shipping package could have been a little better, nothing is marked color wise, but you get a decent amount of glitter.  </li>
            <li> If the customer service had not been so amazing this would have got a 1 star, there is a wide variety of colors I did not have one repeat color in all 45 that I received.</li>
            <li> I love the assortment, but they were a lot smaller</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy these again someday.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like in the pic.</li>
            <li> Will order more in the future, Must have for makeup and nails.</li>
            <li> They are just as pretty of colors as in the picture.</li>
            <li> it was only a quarter filled!</li>
            <li> Firstly the product was on time I must complement.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Although I love the price and all the colors I&#x27;m only rating three stars because of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as shown, and we&#x27;ll packaged..  </li>
            <li> Their are alot of really pretty glitters</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very radiant and shimmery!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying something from this company and bought it even after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty blend.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered, used for acrylics tips.</li>
            <li> Many of the containers came open and it was all over the place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> packaged well, but jar are more empty then full</li>
            <li> I can do so many different things with these!</li>
            <li> There are so many different colors!</li>
            <li> Really good product none were missing</li>
            <li> The glitter choices are great and will last us for a very, very long time!</li>
            <li> They are sooooo VIBRANT and Pretty!</li>
            <li> i have not yet used the product, that is why i&#x27;m only giving four stars, but the colors are rich and none of them are duplicates!</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and fun.  </li>
            <li> it is super cheap and comes with tons of different colors to create really nifty nail art looks.</li>
            <li> The glitter containers are small and not as full as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more glitter in the cases .. but other than that the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Some of them where full some weren&#x27;t these are suppose to be brand new but really look as if they have been used.</li>
            <li> Very cool and big selection of colors.</li>
            <li> Other than the tiny containers the colors are pretty and at a very nice price</li>
            <li> However, after cleaning it up, which didn&#x27;t take long, I have to say I love the product.</li>
            <li> I loved the product but the containers that hold the glitter leak small amounts of glitter out</li>
            <li> It is a good amount that you get in the small containers.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more deep darker colors or at least a good mix.</li>
            <li> Small containers but good choice in colors</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll have 40 or less useful containers but for the price its alright</li>
            <li> Easy to place on regular nail polish or gel polish.  </li>
            <li> Also note that many of the colors seem so close to the same color but under bright light you certainly can see they are a little off from each other.</li>
            <li> but I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much considering the price.</li>
            <li> Also some of the pots were either cracked, scratched, or only half/quarter of the way filled.</li>
            <li> I would expect to pay about $3.00 for this on here, They are extremely tiny jars, BARELY filled, and some have spilled.  </li>
            <li> i really like this set of glitter.</li>
            <li> Not so much that I know I will have them forever.</li>
            <li> They dont contain a whole bunch of glitter...</li>
            <li> It works very well with my stencil tattoo kit I have.</li>
            <li> it arrived fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re very affordable.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The colors really POP.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The variety of colors is very nice and the little containers are quality enough.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t mind that much since I can still use more than half of it and do intend to after I finish cleaning it up a bit.</li>
            <li> Oh, and one more thing, be careful when first removing the jars from the packaging as some of the lids were barely screwed on.  </li>
            <li> Cups r only 1/4 full if that..</li>
            <li> it is messy but a fan brush will sweep that loose glitter away great value.</li>
            <li> Yes, some caps were loose but nothing really spilled beside a a light dusting on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I am quite pleased to say that this set arrived in less than 2 weeks although the projection was 4 weeks to 1 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty and shiny different colors I can use for my nail polish  when I start creating them.</li>
            <li> I did get a very pretty variety of colors but probably don&#x27;t have enough of some of them.</li>
            <li> , I probably would have had a grand mess on my hands.  </li>
            <li> High glow.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the little pots that these come in.</li>
            <li> But most the containers were half full because they were loosely capped.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought the containers would be, but the colors are so vibrant and so many assortments of colors!</li>
            <li> All different pretty much.</li>
            <li> I did get different colors but the containers were only 1/4 full!</li>
            <li> I had to clean all the loose glitter out .</li>
            <li> It may not seem like much because they are half filled</li>
            <li> Those are nice colors, and some are the same, and are in Little containers, so you can mix them up.</li>
            <li> 7 more were open and two almost empty.</li>
            <li> use this kind of glitter to mix with acrylic powder and use as a color base, it&#x27;s what I bought it for, and it works amazingly for it.</li>
            <li> are very easy to open and seal tight again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any repeat colors and the little pots are perfect for nail art or dramatic makeup application.</li>
            <li> Do not I repeat do not waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> it looks like them mixed colors together creating a not so pretty drab color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that they are small so they can be packed away when i take my nail art boxes to friends parties.</li>
            <li> I had a few duplicate colors, where I thought they would be all different, and a good ten of them were opened and leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> And some aren&#x27;t full but the were closed all the way.</li>
            <li> Pmshipped from Amazon fulfillment Center, came really quick.</li>
            <li> ante ALOT of the glitter was spilled creating  a huge mess when i opened it.</li>
            <li> There really is no way to use this glitter unless one wants to do a kaleidoscope type piece, as there is not enough of a single color to cover more than a square inch or so.</li>
            <li> I expected full containers of glitter, highly suggest looking at a different seller.</li>
            <li> Once you apply it to your nails and seal in the glitter with a clear top coat the glitter completely become dull and saturated, losing all its shine.  </li>
            <li> The glitter came packaged in a clear flimsy box and that box was set inside a cardboard box without any Styrofoam for cushion.</li>
            <li> Unless you want the hassle of not getting any product you can use and the hassle of a refund DO NOT waste your time.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for nearly 2 months</li>
            <li> do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised with all the colors &amp; amounts.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old who loves to do glitter tattoos.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of colors that are very close in shade, but when looked at closely are different.</li>
            <li> Most of the glitters were not shut completely and a few had no glitter left in containers.</li>
            <li> Over all good product just not enough mix of colors and poor packaging.</li>
            <li> The little individual pods are not full and you would be lucky to be able to do 3 nails with one pod.  </li>
            <li> This product takes a little practice to use, but the colors are fun and limitless!  </li>
            <li> The containers are not even half full.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent on it!</li>
            <li> But one jar was open they were WAY smaller than expected it really isnt worth the money</li>
            <li> but for the price it&#x27;s stil worth it and will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Major pain in the butt!</li>
            <li> You can also apply this glitter to your bare nail or toe nail with clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> The glitters are pretty but the containers arebonly about the size of a nickle, and there&#x27;s only enough glitter in each one to barely cover the bottom of the container.  </li>
            <li> When they arrived all of them were outside of their packaging and they arrived with a couple other items I purchased so everything was super glittery.</li>
            <li> a little messy some were open &amp; spilled out in the bag, but other then that beautiful colors</li>
            <li> there are a few very pretty metallic glitters</li>
            <li> There were only 3 that were closed properly and were completely full.</li>
            <li> Also, the containers are only about half full of glitter.</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail at a decent shipment time didnt wait long</li>
            <li> Most of them are half empty and are not closed properly.</li>
            <li> I love the colors but it took well over a month to come in and most of the jars are only half full of glitter was extremely disappointed after waiting so long.</li>
            <li> The containers are even half filled and for 4 colors I got repeat colors from any where between 3-5 of a single color l</li>
            <li> I received a variety of shades and noticed that I barely had duplicates.</li>
            <li> I couldnt even begin to tell you how the product is because the glitter is all mixed together and completely ruined.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one color so far, added it to my asphalt color</li>
            <li> I only 2-3 duplicate colors in each of the sets i bought, but i will say that some of the colors are very similiar and only a shade or two different.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the colors, and they all came in one piece, so none were broken.</li>
            <li> Messy package but a fun set of glitters.</li>
            <li> Can be used by themselves, however I mixed with clear product to creat a great less expensive alternative to colored nail powders.</li>
            <li> They shipped super fast and none of the containers were broken.</li>
            <li> I kinda knew by other reviews not to expect to much though.</li>
            <li> I made a mess the first time, but that&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li> I noticed that one of the containers was slightly open, but it wasn&#x27;t major.</li>
            <li> That disappointed me greatly.</li>
            <li> I thought the containers would at least be 1/2 way full</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because even though I new there would be a wait, the almost month long wait drove be nuts!!!</li>
            <li> I got way to many pink and orange but only one dark color (black).</li>
            <li> The only minor issue was that one of the jars wasn&#x27;t closed tightly and spilled while in transit, but all the rest were secure</li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t like is there is repeat colors, so its 45 containers not 45 colors, for some reason 10 of mine were green, 3 of the exact same gold</li>
            <li> Was very late, gave three stars instead of five because most of the pinks are repeated and two of the glitters were empty because they were not closed properly or popped open while being shipped</li>
            <li> my dust fell out in the box the containers was open and there are little that I cannot do much with it.</li>
            <li> I fee that they just took some colors and mixed them with other colors to try and create new color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already mixed some with acrylic and the glitters on these bad boys pop out (in a good way)</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money not even half full...</li>
            <li> The only thing was that when it arrived one or more was slightly opened and there a little bit of a glittery mess.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and my only complaint is the caps of some of the jars of glitter came loose during shipping</li>
            <li> A ton of different colors and will last a long time for doing glitter on nails.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure how much use</li>
            <li> and it was a big old mess of glitter when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t expect too much when ordering glitter.</li>
            <li> Oh before I continue these took such a long time to be shipped to my house.</li>
            <li> Idk wish I wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much and got so little.</li>
            <li> All appeared to be at least half full, and there was extra glitter in the bag</li>
            <li> They will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> a new color every few days.</li>
            <li> Several of the containers were open in the package and leaked, one is completely empty and the glitter was everywhere.</li>
            <li> None of mine were repeats and only one pot had a loose lid where some of the glitter spilled out.</li>
            <li> just wish that they all had been at least half full.</li>
            <li> These came with a little bit of glitter loose in the packaging, but with some tightening of the tops, it was taken care of when transferred to a new bag.</li>
            <li> Arrived before due date, and had 45 colors, but they were poorly packed and every jar was only 1/4 full.</li>
            <li> The small glitter containers are just right for dipping fingers without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be bigger though!</li>
            <li> The tubs are tiny, though and careful when opening.</li>
            <li> I had 5 of the same lavender and 4 gold, 2 bronze, 4 neon pink etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3 of the 45 colors were completely open en empty.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll have them for a long time.</li>
            <li> The shipping time is long, but that should be expected when ordering internationally at an economy speed.</li>
            <li> as I have 4 of the same orange/pink color and its not a pretty color</li>
            <li> They look rich and expensive...</li>
            <li> but it does dry out the gel quicker</li>
            <li> colors were all the same I got like 3 blue and 4 green</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, just received these today and each and every container is not even half full.</li>
            <li> I am a single dad</li>
            <li> were loose and leaking glitter all over.</li>
            <li> are acrylic and some are loose</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll loose product</li>
            <li> I am set on glitter for a very long time!</li>
            <li> but theyre slightly different although i didnt get any black glitter like shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> but I thought they looked bigger in the pictures, like the size of a half dollar.</li>
            <li> but i would like the rest of the glitter of half of my refund back.</li>
            <li> The only reason for a star less is because dust was all over when delivered.</li>
            <li> 2 bad things I have to warn you about is there is a lot of excess glitter that is floating in the bag that they all come in, nothing too over the top, but enough for you not to want to dig your hand down in the bag; and that they repeat in color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s tightly taped so use a knife to open the package to avoid damaging the pots.&lt;br /&gt;The pots</li>
            <li> BUT, none were completely open, so i got every single color still none was completely wasted.</li>
            <li> The only thing was that it was 10 dollars and when I saw the little containers I was kinda upset.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s actually a lot of glitter in each little jar.</li>
            <li> I mixed  together a little bit from about a dozen jars to make a rainbow glitter which I used it in the handmade polish that I create.</li>
            <li> I bought this item, thinking they would be a little bigger containers.</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed that there were two or three of the same color</li>
            <li> This glitter is not for acrylic one little jar will only do like 3 nails.</li>
            <li> I would suggest mixing it thinly into the clear gel and use extra coats of gel until you get to the level of &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34; you desire.</li>
            <li> Man I spent like an hour just cleaning up.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s probably to be expected for it, so</li>
            <li> Got this sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> , I got concerned about the product, but I said a prayer, and they came as described just a couple of glitters got on my bed, I found a glitter bind to house them, so I need to be careful</li>
            <li> Except some of the containers were nearly empty...</li>
            <li> Not only did it come all messy and unorganized</li>
            <li> I purchased this set November 17th with an expected delivery date of December 3 - 31st.</li>
            <li> I got this sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> so be careful while takeing each and every one of the pots</li>
            <li> almost all my pods were Opened and I tightened them closed</li>
            <li> Some of the containers are almost empty.</li>
            <li> , it always gets everywhere no matter how careful you are.</li>
            <li> well so the quality is as expected</li>
            <li> but they were very loosely closed so tiny glitters did escape, making it messy to get them all out so that I could seal them.  </li>
            <li> This I did experience but very little, out of 45 only found 4 that the caps where loose on and the amount of product lost was to little to be a big deal.</li>
            <li> they only sent me half of the nail glitter!</li>
            <li> Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the tops were loose when they came and small amounts of glitter were all over inside the bag they come in.</li>
            <li> so I poured all that out, after I dusted the small containers, and made a little extra glitter pot from the extra glitter.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is glitter, I will use it, but for the money that was spent, I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> Please specify how tiny the pods are and how little amount of glitter in them so people can know most of my pods barley had any glitter very disappointing</li>
            <li> She is having a blast with all the colors and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But they did give me a very little of my money back once I brung it to their attention,</li>
            <li> The containers are small but since I always do each nail in a different color and design</li>
            <li> It works like all other nails products.</li>
            <li> They are to small wish they came bigger</li>
            <li> the money spent!</li>
            <li> taking out the other 44 pots</li>
            <li> Disappointed with how it was package most of the glitter emptied from the slacked covers on the containers.  </li>
            <li> and two of my jars were empty!</li>
            <li> just got these glitters after reading other reviews</li>
            <li> I will would NOT recommend this, or any other product this seller is trying to scam you out of your money for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money try some other glitter.</li>
            <li> Just be careful the glitter gets everywhere!</li>
            <li> Absolutely not what i was expecting!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews on this product about how it comes with a lot of the same colors, but I didn&#x27;t receive one that had any repetitive colors.</li>
            <li> Each small pot contains plenty glitter for several manicures.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also a little long!</li>
            <li> However, the amount of product in each container was much less than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Alot of my jars were half empty or less&lt;</li>
            <li> Not very full</li>
            <li> Some of the containers weren&#x27;t closed tightly, so, of course, the box of the 45 containers had glitter all over them.</li>
            <li> so there was two empty little containers.</li>
            <li> A few of the covers were not closed tightly so there was glitter all over inside of the package when I opened it, so it was messy!</li>
            <li> Just not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> There is enough glitter to do at least two sets of tips depending on how you mix it with polymer.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that it took longer than I thought to arrive.</li>
            <li> The pods are not completely filled, but i only needed small amounts of each colot.  </li>
            <li> and I will probably break down and throw it away unopened. ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> I spent almost an hour trying to get all of it cleaned off!!</li>
            <li> Another common problem was that the little jars where open....</li>
            <li> There is an inconsistency in volume of glitter in each container (some less than others).</li>
            <li> I dipped my finger in it and already like half of the glitter is used up,</li>
            <li> and I have emailed the seller twice, only to revive a generic reply of sorry not my problem.</li>
            <li> 15 of them had less then half the amount of glitter in it.</li>
            <li> Shipping took less time them I thought, under 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> cause they were slightly opened.</li>
            <li> Small pots, but a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> Because it is a glorious glittery mess.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the mess</li>
            <li> Packaging was a mess and colors were repeated.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a mess.  </li>
            <li> Some of the capsules opened during shipment and it was one heck of a mess.</li>
            <li> It was hard to keep other glitters out of other colors</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> I had a few doubles</li>
            <li> Two of them had broken all the way open</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a few reviews saying they had repeating colors in their set.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> What a waste of product.  </li>
            <li> What few glitter pots remained with glitter</li>
            <li> I do have to say a few of the colors were duplicates</li>
            <li> I am giving this product two stars because I have a few issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gave away a few.</li>
            <li> The package has suffered quite a bit before it got to me (took about a month to get it) and few of the glitters were spilled all over the box.</li>
            <li> (btw these reds are actually poorly represented in the 1st photo, 2nd column, rows 3 &amp; 5, just north and south of the green glitter)].  </li>
            <li> if any of your pots aren&#x27;t twisted on right.&lt;br /&gt;Along with the loose topped pots, there is going to be loose glitter</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was that some of them was slightly open so the box was a mess.</li>
            <li> no matter how carefully you are, there is always a mess after you are done with it!!!</li>
            <li> None of the containers were screwed tight so when I recieved the product, the glitter was EVERYWHERE!</li>
            <li> The lids were not on very tight and there were sparkles all over when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> All the individual colors were thrown in one plastic bag for shipping and I received a big bad of intermixed glitter.</li>
            <li> I received my order with a broken package the glitter was everywhere and the containers are so little and contain little bit of glitter don&#x27;t waste your money and time.  </li>
            <li> There is lots of colors with this set which is why I choose it, but the pots are so small that u get very little of each color</li>
            <li> the containers are a bit small though.</li>
            <li> Also  disapointed with the size of the jars, they were too small.</li>
            <li> Lids not on, so small.</li>
            <li> the grain of the glitter pieces is really small, but not so small that it is like dust.</li>
            <li> I have small hands.</li>
            <li> The problem is lazy people not screwing the caps on all the way</li>
            <li> The containers were extremely small, not looking like the containers which were advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but still the small amount bothered me.</li>
            <li> seller need to post the size, too small for us.</li>
            <li> Some of the small containers weren&#x27;t clossed all the way so</li>
            <li> I never write reviews and this is a first time that I have ever been so disappointed of an online order.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small the glitters were going to be.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when opening this product all the jars where half full or less some hardly had any in it.</li>
            <li> saw the pic that someone took of how empty the containers were, but thought it was possible that it was a bad batch that got sent out and</li>
            <li> The package arrived late.  </li>
            <li> it came with a very little amount inside!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m anxious to try them!</li>
            <li> I mean I used it for nail polish and glitter tattoos...and some makeup</li>
            <li> And these are very small containers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess!!!  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> The colors are really random but even though I might have a few doubles</li>
            <li> but they are difficult to apply, need little shaker tops like a salt and pepper shaker has!</li>
            <li> I am often disappointed to find that the seller has put  a tiny smattering of glitter in the containers.</li>
            <li> There is glitter all over the inside of the thin plastic box that you store them in.</li>
            <li> I just received my product and I am highly annoyed and upset.</li>
            <li> Was not happy that it took over a month to get them in.  </li>
            <li> Although I did get it sooner then expected I was disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the amount of glitter scattered throughout the packaging.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed in the amount in each container</li>
            <li> hate the product, because it is not worth the money, you are charging.</li>
            <li> Needlessly my hopes were dashed when i got them.</li>
            <li> Application is difficult.</li>
            <li> But, on the plus side, the price isn&#x27;\t too bad</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of reviews, read them all, even the bad ones and the biggest thing I seen was that people got doubles of one color or another....</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I have lots of glitter stuck my furniture and myself :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed their was no way to contact the seller or request a replacement.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.... :(</li>
            <li> I lost no product but had I grabbed them by just their lids or base jar alone</li>
            <li> And this is coming from someone who always hated doing acrylics at school.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got these in the mail at a decent shipment time didnt wait long I got a multitude of different colors in the 45  I had a few doubles but I have to say I LOVE how vivid and bright they are cant wait to see these with nail acrylic in action :)</li>
            <li> great colors my wife loved them but the only thing the person who packaged them was really messy. the glitter was all over the place.  I wish they had cleaned them before packaging them</li>
            <li> Great love the glitter very satisfied with the glitter easy to work with and fin enough that it&#x27;s not going to stick out when you put the top coat over the glitter. will buy again, very fast shipping, great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Man I spent like an hour just cleaning up. When they arrived all of them were outside of their packaging and they arrived with a couple other items I purchased so everything was super glittery. Two of them had broken all the way open so there was two empty little containers. Not good. GLITTER. EVERYWHERE. But for the price the glitter was awesome. No repeat colors. Not very full but it&#x27;s for my accent nail so it will do the job. I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the issue with packaging.</li>
            <li> The glitter was all over my box so I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll have 40 or less useful containers but for the price its alright</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves them and so do her friends. The price is real great too!!</li>
            <li> I love the assortment, but they were a lot smaller then I had thought they would be.  It is only enough to do maybe one or two sets of nails for each color.  Price was good though</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when opening this product all the jars where half full or less some hardly had any in it. I contacted customer service and they where great the gave me a small refund and let me keep what I had. If the customer service had not been so amazing this would have got a 1 star, there is a wide variety of colors I did not have one repeat color in all 45 that I received. just wish that they all had been at least half full. Seller was since 2007.</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors</li>
            <li> ALOT OF THEM WERE OPEN, SO THERE WAS GLITTER EVRYWHERE</li>
            <li> The containers are not even half full. That disappointed me greatly. the colors are good and i like using them. But i will not order this again.&lt;br /&gt;I saw the pic that someone took of how empty the containers were, but thought it was possible that it was a bad batch that got sent out and the review was from awhile ago. Needlessly my hopes were dashed when i got them.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time but most of the tops weren&#x27;t on good most of the glitter was spilled out or low.. glitter had spilled out into plastic containers that host the bottles. Had to wipe out container had glitter everywhere.  My niece ordered same item her came in good condition.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous nails!!! wide variety of bright colors.  I am very pleased with the powder and nails looks just perfect. :-)</li>
            <li> no duplicates, all the colors are very nice, jars are small, but just like described</li>
            <li> Awesome variety and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I love the glitter. It took a while for me to learn to use it. I recommend watching a youtube video to learn to apply the glitter.</li>
            <li> I love it!! im a MUA and it is beautiful on the eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Got then on time! And no colors was repeated!  I&#x27;ve already mixed some with acrylic and the glitters on these bad boys pop out (in a good way)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic collection of glitter powder.  My daughter loves this collection.  Be sure to buy some glue - she ran out of it too quickly.</li>
            <li> Great colors but the tiniest little containers. Made for accents not while nails.</li>
            <li> some glitters repeated,but I would buy again</li>
            <li> The packaging was not so good. Glitter everywhere. But I definitely didn&#x27;t mind once I started going through the beautiful colors. The containers are small but since I always do each nail in a different color and design I have no problem with it. I love love loved them. And this is coming from someone who always hated doing acrylics at school. These brought some fun into it. I will most likely buy these again someday. They are worth they&#x27;re money.</li>
            <li> Numerous jars were leaking</li>
            <li> So many different awesome colors to choose from. No colors have been left out. Easy to use &amp; come off well</li>
            <li> Great array of colors &amp; even better price!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought these and some said that glitter was spilled everywhere and shipping took forever. But surprisingly I guess I got lucky I think it only took 2 weeks. If that. And no glitter spilled. I&#x27;m very happy about this product and for the price you can&#x27;t pass it up!!! I would order these again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any repeat colors and the little pots are perfect for nail art or dramatic makeup application. The only downside is the shipping time but I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much considering the price.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and they  work good. the containers are a bit small though. i like that it comes with  a bunch of colors for pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, just received these today and each and every container is not even half full. I expected full containers of glitter, highly suggest looking at a different seller. I&#x27;ll change my rating if I get the amount that should have come.</li>
            <li> So many choices when you order this glitter.  Nails come out gorgeous!!</li>
            <li> Disapointed with the delivery and arrival of this product. Most of the jars were opened ante ALOT of the glitter was spilled creating  a huge mess when i opened it. Also  disapointed with the size of the jars, they were too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a few reviews saying they had repeating colors in their set.  None of mine were repeats and only one pot had a loose lid where some of the glitter spilled out.</li>
            <li> It works like all other nails products. I am pleased with the turnout and will most definitely recommended to others.</li>
            <li> I love it and is a great product and amaizing  color.  Looks exactly like in the pic.Love it, Love it,Love it</li>
            <li> I received the glitter in a plastic bag. I received a variety of shades and noticed that I barely had duplicates. Although I was hoping for some white glitter, I didn&#x27;t receive any. I noticed that one of the containers was slightly open, but it wasn&#x27;t major. There is an inconsistency in volume of glitter in each container (some less than others). Given the variety of colors, I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors.  Wonderful for crafts. Great price.  Last forever.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with what I received.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves to use this stuff on her nails.  The glitter quality and quantity are great.  I was a little disappointed with the amount of glitter scattered throughout the packaging.</li>
            <li> The containers are even half filled and for 4 colors I got repeat colors from any where between 3-5 of a single color l</li>
            <li> They are to small wish they came bigger</li>
            <li> Nice variety, some colors look alike but theyre slightly different although i didnt get any black glitter like shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> I loved the glitters I just thought they would be bigger containers. Other than that it&#x27;s great colors and I love the variety!</li>
            <li> These came with a little bit of glitter loose in the packaging, but with some tightening of the tops, it was taken care of when transferred to a new bag. They came with great variety and beautiful colors. They were also fully packed with glitter, so maybe they&#x27;ve read the reviews &amp;/or paid better attention to the amounts. Worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> I am set on glitter for a very long time! I was so excited to see all the colors. Great value for the price! I do recommend you open them outside when you get them. Because it is a glorious glittery mess. I will order from this seller again. Love Glitter!!</li>
            <li> I had a few duplicate colors, where I thought they would be all different, and a good ten of them were opened and leaking everywhere. I think it could have been better packaged to prevent this. But, on the plus side, the price isn&#x27;\t too bad and it&#x27;s probably to be expected for it, so it&#x27;s still fair.</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors! However, the amount of product in each container was much less than what I expected. Although for the price, I can&#x27;t complain! A few of the covers were not closed tightly so there was glitter all over inside of the package when I opened it, so it was messy! What more can you expect with glitter though...no matter how carefully you are, there is always a mess after you are done with it!!!</li>
            <li> so many colors to choose from. cant wait to get to use them and actually take them out of the package. love them</li>
            <li> so awesome, and I only got 5 repeat colors, and they happened to be really cute and popular colors. Will order more in the future, Must have for makeup and nails. very fine glitter, with amazing color!</li>
            <li> Those are nice colors, and some are the same, and are in Little containers, so you can mix them up.</li>
            <li> I got all of them and there shiny! They are just as pretty of colors as in the picture. You will not be dissapionted.</li>
            <li> Lids not on, so small. Will only work for nail art, and MAYBE added to acrylic glitter mixes but not alone. Just not worth it at all. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I recently bought these. Once I received them (before opening) I was excited. Oh before I continue these took such a long time to be shipped to my house. Anyways once I opened the package I was furious! Glitter was everywhere! I didn&#x27;t receive a box like most of the people on here I received A PLASTIC BAG! Once I opened and took 1 pot out it was only a quarter filled! Also some of the pots were either cracked, scratched, or only half/quarter of the way filled. taking out the other 44 pots my hands were covered with glitter. Honestly I will never buy this again it&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> Most of the glitters were not shut completely and a few had no glitter left in containers.</li>
            <li> The glitter containers are small and not as full as I would have liked. But I&#x27;m anxious to try them!</li>
            <li> This glitter is so fun.</li>
            <li> Definitely over-priced. I would expect to pay about $3.00 for this on here, They are extremely tiny jars, BARELY filled, and some have spilled.  Very unhappy.... :(</li>
            <li> Wow what a great deal! Just got them in and all the colors you see, I got! I ordered this because of reviews, read them all, even the bad ones and the biggest thing I seen was that people got doubles of one color or another.... This was not something I came across, thankfully I got 45 different colors. Another common problem was that the little jars where open.... This I did experience but very little, out of 45 only found 4 that the caps where loose on and the amount of product lost was to little to be a big deal. Would also like to say that you can expect each jar to have about a teaspoon of glitter.... Not bad but not a lot ether. I kinda knew by other reviews not to expect to much though. I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because even though I new there would be a wait, the almost month long wait drove be nuts!!!</li>
            <li> I love sparkles these are great to mix with acrylic. It looks absolutely beautiful on nails and toes! I did however receive multiples of a few colors which is ok because they were mostly my favorite shades!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the mess it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Wow happy with this purchase! This is a great variety and a great value!. I am a &amp;#34;rookie at home nail technician&amp;#34; :) and I like to mix these with my acrylic powder and use my ASP dual nail forms. You can also apply this glitter to your bare nail or toe nail with clear nail polish. The only thing was that when it arrived one or more was slightly opened and there a little bit of a glittery mess. But overall I am happy with the variety, I just wish there was more in the tub! I think its just about enough for one or two applications.</li>
            <li> This product takes a little practice to use, but the colors are fun and limitless!  I would suggest mixing it thinly into the clear gel and use extra coats of gel until you get to the level of &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34; you desire.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me, they put 45 plastic nail glitter bottles unsecured in an envelope and shipped it.  I couldnt even begin to tell you how the product is because the glitter is all mixed together and completely ruined.  What a waste of product.  Until they figure a way to ship this product, like secured in a box with extra padding, they are going to continue to lose money.  Unless you want the hassle of not getting any product you can use and the hassle of a refund DO NOT waste your time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my children to use for nails and for temporary tattoos.  This stuff is awesome.  It is very fine glitter.  Colors are vibrant and fun.  Great price, and easy to store and use.  Pleased with shipping too.</li>
            <li> Containers weren&#x27;t shut all the way, resulting in leaking glitter. Wasn&#x27;t worth the money OR wait. What few glitter pots remained with glitter were very pretty, thus the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I use it for body tattoo art  swesome</li>
            <li> i really like this set of glitter. it is super cheap and comes with tons of different colors to create really nifty nail art looks. the grain of the glitter pieces is really small, but not so small that it is like dust. it is the right size to create a nice sparkle without being gritty or grainy on your nails.</li>
            <li> a little messy some were open &amp; spilled out in the bag, but other then that beautiful colors</li>
            <li> I love the colors but it took well over a month to come in and most of the jars are only half full of glitter was extremely disappointed after waiting so long.</li>
            <li> The shipping package could have been a little better, nothing is marked color wise, but you get a decent amount of glitter.  Not bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with how it was package most of the glitter emptied from the slacked covers on the containers.  The only upside was the quantity.</li>
            <li> Got this sooner than expected. The lids were not on very tight and there were sparkles all over when I opened the package. There were some repeat colors but it&#x27;s nice because the containers are not really big. Nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> i didnt get white glitter in my pack and the packet i got was not 25 pc. im so upset</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because it is what they advertised. Glitter in various colors and most were pretty full. I expected them to be bigger though! Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I thought they looked bigger in the pictures, like the size of a half dollar. They&#x27;re the size of a quarter. I dipped my finger in it and already like half of the glitter is used up, mind you I have small hands.</li>
            <li> I want to leave a better review but I just received my glitter and 4 of the containers were loose and leaking glitter all over. One of them was almost off and almost all the glitter was gone.</li>
            <li> Packaging was a mess and colors were repeated.</li>
            <li> Great price, and the glitter is great! Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the tops were loose when they came and small amounts of glitter were all over inside the bag they come in. BUT, none were completely open, so i got every single color still none was completely wasted. Also, the containers are only about half full of glitter.</li>
            <li> I like to do my own nails and this is amazing.  Great color selection.  Not so much that I know I will have them forever.</li>
            <li> i got nice colors even though there were some repeats but there was glitter everywhere....and two of my jars were empty!</li>
            <li> I ordered these and it took a month to get them. They were packaged in only bubble wrap, no brown wrapper at all or box protecting the package. There is glitter all over the inside of the thin plastic box that you store them in. I haven&#x27;t opened them yet, but it looks like they all have glitter in them. A ton of different colors and will last a long time for doing glitter on nails.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors, look nice in the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bellos colores, lucen preciosos en las uÃ±as.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it , I like it.</li>
            <li> just got these glitters after reading other reviews, I got concerned about the product, but I said a prayer, and they came as described just a couple of glitters got on my bed, I found a glitter bind to house them, so I need to be careful, I am ordering some more I think from a different vendor will post about that item next month it stasted it would arrive April 1st until April 13 and they were here April 1st. can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> Glitter is great. But most the containers were half full because they were loosely capped. But for the price I can&#x27;t rally complain.</li>
            <li> Fun purchase.. Except some of the containers were nearly empty...</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed all the nail art I have bought, it has been so much fun doing all the designs we have done. Just forgot to get enough nail glue.</li>
            <li> The glitter is super chunky, some colors weren&#x27;t even sparkly when put on nails and when it arrived there was glitter everywhere. It was hard to keep other glitters out of other colors and I had to clean all of them before I could use them.</li>
            <li> They dont contain a whole bunch of glitter... but they are very pretty! I love most of the colors. :)</li>
            <li> This is a really great collection of glitter. I got it for my sister as a Christmas present and she was in love. I do have to say a few of the colors were duplicates but it&#x27;s okay because she shared them with me.</li>
            <li> I just received my product and I am highly annoyed and upset. Firstly the product was on time I must complement.&lt;br /&gt;When I open the kit  ALLLL my dust fell out in the box the containers was open and there are little that I cannot do much with it. Can someone please assist????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for awhile and haven&#x27;t even opened it to attempt to use. All the individual colors were thrown in one plastic bag for shipping and I received a big bad of intermixed glitter. It&#x27;s a mess!!!  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I have no idea about the product and probably never will. It&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for months and I will probably break down and throw it away unopened. ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> My daughter bought the original &amp;#34;shimmer kit&amp;#34; for glitter tattoos. She quickly went through that supply. this was a reasonable option to get her more. Colors were great! Delivery was quick</li>
            <li> All I can say is awesome colors, variety to choose from and mine was packed pretty well. The tubs are tiny, though and careful when opening. I made a mess the first time, but that&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li> Do not I repeat do not waste your money on these! Not only did it come all messy and unorganized it came with a very little amount inside! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> they only sent me half of the nail glitter! im so disappointed. i tried them and they worked good. but i would like the rest of the glitter of half of my refund back.</li>
            <li> This is a scam!!! Buyer be ware. I purchased this set November 17th with an expected delivery date of December 3 - 31st. The money was removed from my account that day. It is now January 13th and I have emailed the seller twice, only to revive a generic reply of sorry not my problem. I have NOT revived my order. I will would NOT recommend this, or any other product this seller is trying to scam you out of your money for. VERY DISAPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> This collection will give me lots of options when adding glitter to my nails! I am loving these so far.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase it is messy but a fan brush will sweep that loose glitter away great value.</li>
            <li> Glitter all over the bag spilled. The problem is lazy people not screwing the caps on all the way and they are lose and glitter slips out. Of course the color I need the most gold was almost completely dumped out in the bag with the rest of the colors that spilled. Highly disappointed. Don&#x27;t waist your money try some other glitter.</li>
            <li> The nail art glitter powder is high quality and extremely fine.  Easy to place on regular nail polish or gel polish.  High glow.  I love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product two stars because I have a few issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Alot of my jars were half empty or less&lt;br /&gt;2) I had so many repeating colors that instead of being 45 colors its more like 15.  I had 5 of the same lavender and 4 gold, 2 bronze, 4 neon pink etc.&lt;br /&gt;3) I fee that they just took some colors and mixed them with other colors to try and create new color.  as I have 4 of the same orange/pink color and its not a pretty color it looks like them mixed colors together creating a not so pretty drab color.&lt;br /&gt;4)While there are a few very pretty metallic glitters most are non mettalic and I am not sure how much use if any I will get out of them.</li>
            <li> This package comes with lots of glitter which is really good for doing acrylic tips. There is enough glitter to do at least two sets of tips depending on how you mix it with polymer. The colors are really random but even though I might have a few doubles the colors are really cute too use. Just be careful the glitter gets everywhere!</li>
            <li> I got this sooner than expected. But one jar was open they were WAY smaller than expected it really isnt worth the money and they werent filled up all the way!</li>
            <li> I was thinking when I ordered this that there might be some repeat colors, but there are literally 45 different colors of glitter.  There are ones that are similar, but definitely have a different glitter element. So great!</li>
            <li> Wow these are great. I doubt I will need to ever buy glitter again.  I&#x27;ve only used one color so far, added it to my asphalt color looks great. Gave away a few. They like the glitter also.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product. Reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. When I received the package, glitter was spilled inside the entire package.&lt;br /&gt;2. The containers were extremely small, not looking like the containers which were advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the product, because it is not worth the money, you are charging. The packaging was good, but didn&#x27;t even have bubble wrap, which came in an envelope not even a box.</li>
            <li> Pmshipped from Amazon fulfillment Center, came really quick. Everything was there and each container filled to capacity! Can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> GLITTERHOLIC HERE. IF IT SPARKLES I WANT IT...</li>
            <li> There is lots of colors with this set which is why I choose it, but the pots are so small that u get very little of each color and u cant fit your nails in the pot!!! Other than the tiny containers the colors are pretty and at a very nice price</li>
            <li> will order again, only took 5 days to get.</li>
            <li> Although I love the price and all the colors I&#x27;m only rating three stars because of the packaging. 3 of the 45 colors were completely open en empty. Needles to say that everything else that was shipped with it was covers in glitter (ship seperatly!). 7 more were open and two almost empty. There were only 3 that were closed properly and were completely full. 15 of them had less then half the amount of glitter in it.</li>
            <li> Tons of colors!  A couple seemed like duplicates, but overall, for the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I am over the moon with my glitter dust.  Using these make me feel special and fancy and all of my Nieces/girlfriends want to come to my house to get their mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love it. Some people stated that there are multiple colors, if you look closely the picture does show pots of glitter in very similar colors.  Came exactly as shown, and we&#x27;ll packaged..  Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Came in 2 weeks, not bad . Love them so many different colors to use from ! Came in good shape as well!</li>
            <li> An amazing buy. Easy to use and super shinny. 2 bad things I have to warn you about is there is a lot of excess glitter that is floating in the bag that they all come in, nothing too over the top, but enough for you not to want to dig your hand down in the bag; and that they repeat in color. With that in mind, I still love the product.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and arrived unopened!</li>
            <li> Glitters was falling out and plastic containers were not secured on all the way however glitter colors are beautiful</li>
            <li> Love them.Very pretty and shiny different colors I can use for my nail polish  when I start creating them. Nice</li>
            <li> These were ok for the price I paid. Not what I was expecting. The glitter was very light and has a lot of static. More ended up sticking to my table than on my brush or nails.</li>
            <li> Many beautiful shimmering colors, but not good for nails.  Once you apply it to your nails and seal in the glitter with a clear top coat the glitter completely become dull and saturated, losing all its shine.  DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>
            <li> We love the colors, even though there were some repeat colors in our order. We use these for glitter tattoos and my daughter loves them. Bold colors and an awesome deal for the price. I would recommend this product and buy it again.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a mess.  There was glitter everywhere.  There are duplicate colors, but you can tell that from the picture.  The package arrived late.  Overall, it is glitter, I will use it, but for the money that was spent, I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> okay so, there was some mess when I opened it and the containers aren&#x27;t the best but I didn&#x27;t get any repeated colors. The only thing was that it was 10 dollars and when I saw the little containers I was kinda upset. I mean I used it for nail polish and glitter tattoos...and some makeup but still the small amount bothered me. There was two holographics( one gold and one  silver) I wish they woulda sent more than one of those hehe. But yeah its alright!</li>
            <li> These glitters came in twist top containers so I had to make sure they were all retightened when I received them. Their are alot of really pretty glitters and they go on your nail effortlessly. Shipping took forever. Was not happy that it took over a month to get them in.  Oh well. Well worth the wait and I&#x27;ll have them for a long time. Beautiful on my gel nails.</li>
            <li> The packaging is cheap so I looked like a Vegas showgirl/drag queen when I opened the package, but the glitter is fine and wonderful. Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> With such mixed reviews I was worried about this order but I am pleased! Shipping took less time them I thought, under 2 weeks. I got only one repeat glitter out of 45, that seems fair. The glitter did spill over everything from shipping but it was an easy clean up and there was still a good amount in each tub. Some of the glitters may not work for nail art but I will also be using these for crafts too. So overall I am happy with this order. :)</li>
            <li> I just received my order. I am so excited. They shipped super fast and none of the containers were broken. I can&#x27;t wait to get my nails done.  And the colors are great!</li>
            <li> Arrived before due date, and had 45 colors, but they were poorly packed and every jar was only 1/4 full. There really is no way to use this glitter unless one wants to do a kaleidoscope type piece, as there is not enough of a single color to cover more than a square inch or so.</li>
            <li> LOVEE this glitter !! It came packaged so nice and there&#x27;s actually a lot of glitter in each little jar. There&#x27;s a great color range. Will defiantly be buying again !!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how it came glitter was spilt everywhere and not packaged good.. I also didn&#x27;t get 45 different colors it was all the same colors multiplied.  I really would not recommend this type for my top 3 choices</li>
            <li> Had lot of uses for these.  Wish they were a bit larger</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than you will ever find in a beauty supply store. And just as good!</li>
            <li> I bought these to go with tattoo stencils and they worked perfectly. I recommend putting the entire set in a container with a good lid, to keep the glitter from getting everywhere. It&#x27;s a very fine dust, not like craft glitter with big chunks, so it&#x27;s softer on the skin. Very cool.</li>
            <li> seller need to post the size, too small for us.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.It works very well with my stencil tattoo kit I have.The colors are gorgeous &amp; carry over well.They last for quite a bit longer than others when taken care of.</li>
            <li> They shipped fast, packaged good, there wasn&#x27;t glitter everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is there is repeat colors, so its 45 containers not 45 colors, for some reason 10 of mine were green, 3 of the exact same gold and I only got 1 black.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;The package where the pots are in is a plastic container.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tightly taped so use a knife to open the package to avoid damaging the pots.&lt;br /&gt;The pots are acrylic and some are loose so be careful while takeing each and every one of the pots out,&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT DUMP THEM OUT! You&#x27;ll loose product if any of your pots aren&#x27;t twisted on right.&lt;br /&gt;Along with the loose topped pots, there is going to be loose glitter everywhere so open it on an easy to clean surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;SO MANY COLORS!&lt;br /&gt;Very fine glitter and so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Pots are very easy to open and seal tight again.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of products. It may not seem like much because they are half filled but if it were filled any further there would be a lot more spillage than survived products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There were just about 5 colors that were doubled, but they were colors i&#x27;d use a lot of so I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:&lt;br /&gt;If you are using it for makeup, USE A GLITTER PRIMER!!! If you don&#x27;t they will not stay on the intended area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I LOVE IT! and mostly my brides and other clients love it!!!</li>
            <li> the color is bright and lovely!</li>
            <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> great! some of the glitter was all over the place but overall it will do</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought the containers would be, but the colors are so vibrant and so many assortments of colors! I love it!</li>
            <li> Was very late, gave three stars instead of five because most of the pinks are repeated and two of the glitters were empty because they were not closed properly or popped open while being shipped</li>
            <li> The colors I received were in good quality. The end result that I got doing my glitter tattoos was amazing. These glitters also were delivered on time. They were also packaged good no leaKage;)</li>
            <li> Love all the different bright colors. I can mix and match and blend and thats awesome. Cant wait to order more</li>
            <li> Love the glitter. Wish there were a bigger color variety though . a lot of repeat colors</li>
            <li> I ordered this glitter package but when it arrived glitter was everywhere! Some of the capsules opened during shipment and it was one heck of a mess. I spent almost an hour trying to get all of it cleaned off!! The glitter came packaged in a clear flimsy box and that box was set inside a cardboard box without any Styrofoam for cushion. The movement caused the containers to open I guess.</li>
            <li> i have not yet used the product, that is why i&#x27;m only giving four stars, but the colors are rich and none of them are duplicates! it arrived fast and packaged well. Plus they&#x27;re very affordable. They&#x27;re very radiant and shimmery! can&#x27;t wait to see how gorgeous they look when applied with acrylic!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. I bought this for my daughter and it was never shipped to me I have been waiting for nearly 2 months I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> great selection of colors, so many things to do!</li>
            <li> The colors are great. My kids really loved them. Application is difficult. The only way I found to apply the dust is to dip a wet painted nail directly into the container. The problem with that is it is too think and it bumpy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my best friend.  she is an hair dresser and always keeps nails on.  she was very excited and like the glitter product.  a new color every few days.</li>
            <li> Are some very beautiful colors and cover the surface of the nail, is a good product I recommend ... thanks</li>
            <li> So I bought this glitter for my nails and it just arrived today. This is my first time buying something from this company and bought it even after reading the reviews. When I opened it up it there was glitter everywhere inside. I did get a very pretty variety of colors but probably don&#x27;t have enough of some of them. This was $10 so I really don&#x27;t mind that much since I can still use more than half of it and do intend to after I finish cleaning it up a bit. I suggest that you find someone else to buy it from. I have lots of glitter stuck my furniture and myself :(</li>
            <li> None of the containers were screwed tight so when I recieved the product, the glitter was EVERYWHERE!</li>
            <li> Very tiny and some of my glitters was spilled out</li>
            <li> Colors, Colors and LOTS of Colors! They are sooooo VIBRANT and Pretty! We used these for glitter tattoos and face painting. Worked out GREAT!</li>
            <li> Received them and one was open covering all 47 cases in glitter. Major pain in the butt!</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed in the amount in each container however you get what you pay for. I loved the product but the containers that hold the glitter leak small amounts of glitter out so I had to change there packaging</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money not even half full...I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy then</li>
            <li> Absolutely not what i was expecting! I just received them and there is glitter everywhere. Most of them are half empty and are not closed properly. Also its not like the picture at all. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> They came like in 2 weeks after ordering, glitter was everywhere. I had to individually close all the glitter cases cause they were slightly opened. One has a crack on it. I was expecting more glitter in the cases .. but other than that the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> A lot were opened but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Please specify how tiny the pods are and how little amount of glitter in them so people can know most of my pods barley had any glitter very disappointing I saw a photo with the pods filled all the way that&#x27;s why I purchased them...... almost all my pods were Opened and I tightened them closed there is glitter everywhere... but what was there I mixes some together and they came out beautifully I&#x27;d like to buy the silver holographic glitter at a larger amount!</li>
            <li> Thought this was a good deal but when I got it the glitter was everywhere! Some of the small containers weren&#x27;t clossed all the way so in its travel it spilled a lot of glitter. Some of the containers are almost empty. And some aren&#x27;t full but the were closed all the way. Idk wish I wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much and got so little.</li>
            <li> Great product, probably only 3 maybe 4 of the same color. All appeared to be at least half full, and there was extra glitter in the bag so I poured all that out, after I dusted the small containers, and made a little extra glitter pot from the extra glitter. It&#x27;s a pretty blend. Glitter is super fine and looks great on gel nails. Also note that many of the colors seem so close to the same color but under bright light you certainly can see they are a little off from each other.</li>
            <li> great colors but they are difficult to apply, need little shaker tops like a salt and pepper shaker has!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered, used for acrylics tips.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that it took longer than I thought to arrive. But once it did come, when I opened it, I was very pleased. I&#x27;ve read other reviews on this product about how it comes with a lot of the same colors, but I didn&#x27;t receive one that had any repetitive colors. They were all different. And very pretty! They actually are a lot brighter than they are in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I use this kind of glitter to mix with acrylic powder and use as a color base, it&#x27;s what I bought it for, and it works amazingly for it. The colors are so intriguing on the nail. My practice clients are really enjoying the Colors a lot. They look rich and expensive...but the price is unbeatable here. Fantastic deal for 45 glitters. They don&#x27;t come with a lot of glitter in them but I was expecting that with the quantity and the price. However, the amount of glitter is perfect for what I&#x27;m using it for. They will last me a long time! But Ill have no issue purchasing this product again when I do need more.</li>
            <li> Great color groups....</li>
            <li> I am a single dad and I have 3 girls this is the best thing I got for them to sit and really have girl time.</li>
            <li> This set is awesome for the price. The glitter choices are great and will last us for a very, very long time! The colors really POP. totally worth it!</li>
            <li> do not waste your money.  Many of the containers came open and it was all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The custom slip said what was inside was a phone cover....hum</li>
            <li> I LOVE the colors, and they all came in one piece, so none were broken. some containers have more glitter then others, but regardless i love them. They adhere to your nails well. They require a few more top coats then I&#x27;m use too, but over all they are a great quality. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased to say that this set arrived in less than 2 weeks although the projection was 4 weeks to 1 1/2 months.  It is a very nice set of ultra fine glitter giving you a good selection of colors.  In the photo some of the colors look as though they are duplicates however they are not; each hue is a unique shade of the color family depicted in the photo, some varying only slightly, mostly in undertones [i.e. there are 2 red glitters, one with blue undertones (not flash) and one with orange undertones (btw these reds are actually poorly represented in the 1st photo, 2nd column, rows 3 &amp; 5, just north and south of the green glitter)].  Overall a great foundation to build a larger collection upon.  Oh, and one more thing, be careful when first removing the jars from the packaging as some of the lids were barely screwed on.  I lost no product but had I grabbed them by just their lids or base jar alone, I probably would have had a grand mess on my hands.  In case you&#x27;re wondering, the lids do tighten on nicely.  Overall a GREAT buy.</li>
            <li> Glitter was all over the place because the lids were not screwed on all the way.  Very disappointed! More like a 40 piece set.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine bought this item through my account, and i can tell that she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Although I did get it sooner then expected I was disappointed with the product. I did get different colors but the containers were only 1/4 full! And these are very small containers. Would not recommend this product. I will be contacting the seller</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets, for my sister &amp; me.  They arrived in 2 days(Prime) I opened both sets since some reviews stated that they contained  multiples of some colors. Each of my sets had 45 different colors! Yeah. Each small pot contains plenty glitter for several manicures. We use these glitters with shellac nail polish &amp; uv lights for a outstanding look.</li>
            <li> I thought the containers would at least be 1/2 way full but they&#x27;re not even a 1/4 full. Color are great though.</li>
            <li> Really good product none were missing but there was 3 of the same color</li>
            <li> Lots of glitter for nail art! It was shipped quickly and my only complaint is the caps of some of the jars of glitter came loose during shipping and it was a big old mess of glitter when I opened the box. But it&#x27;s glitter, it always gets everywhere no matter how careful you are. Good product and good price with a good selection of colors. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> the nail art glitter got here on time and the product was really good. And came in handy for me.</li>
            <li> loved it thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I ordered the glitter for my nail shop and instead of receiving the amount of 45 different colors, I got 12! Not just 12 different colors but 12 total! I am so angry!!!! I never write reviews and this is a first time that I have ever been so disappointed of an online order. I expect this to happen off of eBay, NOT amazon!! The nerve some people have!</li>
            <li> When the package arrived the glitter was all opened and EVERYWHERE! But the customer service was really good and fast. The glitter itself is ok.</li>
            <li> The glitters are pretty but the containers arebonly about the size of a nickle, and there&#x27;s only enough glitter in each one to barely cover the bottom of the container.  5 of them were repeat colors.  Some of them are very similar but not repeats.  The picture indicates a lot of bright colors but most of them are not that bright.  The containers were not oprn but they were very loosely closed so tiny glitters did escape, making it messy to get them all out so that I could seal them.  The shipping time is long, but that should be expected when ordering internationally at an economy speed.</li>
            <li> I bought this glitter for my nails and also for art projects. The products were all open,There was glitter everywhere. Most of it I had to throw it away. It wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent on it!</li>
            <li> I like the glitter colors and quality.  Several of the containers were open in the package and leaked, one is completely empty and the glitter was everywhere. I am disappointed their was no way to contact the seller or request a replacement. I would have given a better rating if I could have gotten a replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a church activity with 16 girls. They thought this was the best thing ever. great price for so many!</li>
            <li> Most of the product were barely full! Buy at your own risk! Shipping was also a little long! But they did give me a very little of my money back once I brung it to their attention, that I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the item&#x27;s I received and also they let me keep the item&#x27;s at the end of day! I was ok with it!</li>
            <li> I love the little pots that these come in. There are so many colors to choose from! I can&#x27;t wait to start using them in my nail art. But you could use them on ANY art project. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with all the colors &amp; amounts. This will last me a while. Looking forward to using them on my nail art.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old who loves to do glitter tattoos. She is having a blast with all the colors and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> my grandaughter loves this stuff.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say ecept she is using it frequesntly you wil enjoy too</li>
            <li> Very cool and big selection of colors. Cups r only 1/4 full if that.. but for the price it&#x27;s stil worth it and will last a long time! Good buy!</li>
            <li> All many colors of glitter I didn&#x27;t know which to start with. Very fine powder more than a glitter. Beautiful vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to come but was pleased</li>
            <li> I like all the colors in this pack. It is a good amount that you get in the small containers. The only bad thing was that some of them was slightly open so the box was a mess. I had to clean all the loose glitter out .</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t expect too much when ordering glitter. I am often disappointed to find that the seller has put  a tiny smattering of glitter in the containers. However, this time I was thrilled.to find that all 45 containers contained a lot of glitter and the colors were wonderful. The containers themselves aren&#x27;t huge, about the size of a quarter, but the glitter itself is the dusting type, which means it doesn&#x27;t take a very big container to hold a fairly substantial amount of product. The only minor issue was that one of the jars wasn&#x27;t closed tightly and spilled while in transit, but all the rest were secure so I am very happy. I mixed  together a little bit from about a dozen jars to make a rainbow glitter which I used it in the handmade polish that I create. It showed up beautifully in the polish. Very pleased, would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> The package has suffered quite a bit before it got to me (took about a month to get it) and few of the glitters were spilled all over the box. There were quite repeat colors which means you won&#x27;t necessarily get 45 different colors. I got way to many pink and orange but only one dark color (black). I was hoping for more deep darker colors or at least a good mix. This is good for those who like bright neon colors. I use it for my gel and they seem to work well so the quality is as expected but it does dry out the gel quicker so it has to be changed more frequently. Over all good product just not enough mix of colors and poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Some of the pots are dust and others are more glitter but it is all the fine glitter.  Which is what I hoped I was ordering.  So It&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
            <li> The glitter was open&lt;br /&gt;The colors were all the same I got like 3 blue and 4 green&lt;br /&gt;I regret buying it</li>
            <li> Love it works really good for eyes with a good primerðŸ˜Š it has so many colors to chose from y</li>
            <li> Love works well with the art glitter tattoo kit my daughter got snd she likes all the different colors</li>
            <li> Awesome and fun to paint and make designs with this glitter on your nails.  I would recommend it to poeple.</li>
            <li> Great colors and very easy to use. Can be used by themselves, however I mixed with clear product to creat a great less expensive alternative to colored nail powders.</li>
            <li> Lots of glitter, would have given 4 stars but 2 came unscrewed and went all over.</li>
            <li> Great colors. All different pretty much. Haven&#x27;t used it yet. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These glitter pots are so perfect for encapsulating and doing really creative designs. They stick well and are easy to pick up. Love them!</li>
            <li> Love these, great assortment and great value.  Jars don&#x27;t secure the best, so you have to make sure lids are on properly or you will have glitter everywhere!!!!</li>
            <li> packaged well, but jar are more empty then full</li>
            <li> Took a while to recieve but did recieve it by promise date. The variety of colors is very nice and the little containers are quality enough.</li>
            <li> Love the colors can&#x27;t wait to try it out. :)</li>
            <li> Came in on time so many pretty colors and they&#x27;re great for making your own glitter acrylic mixes looks soooo good</li>
            <li> Great colors. Packaged well.</li>
            <li> These were great and arrived quickly with amazon prime.  Yes, some caps were loose but nothing really spilled beside a a light dusting on the bottom.  The pods are not completely filled, but i only needed small amounts of each colot.  I only 2-3 duplicate colors in each of the sets i bought, but i will say that some of the colors are very similiar and only a shade or two different.</li>
            <li> These nail art glitter  are great all the colors are beautiful, they&#x27;re many to chose from and have fun with .</li>
            <li> There are wonderful size nice color not repeat :)Ã¢Ëœâ€¦Ã¢Ëœâ€¦Ã¢Ëœâ€¦</li>
            <li> they have every color u can imagine</li>
            <li> this is a nice collection of fine glitter, works great for art projects and for my nails!  Happy with this purchase...</li>
            <li> Love using these! I can do so many different things with these! I even like using them in top coats to make glitter polish. They work so well! There are so many different colors! It works great to do different designs on nails! I will be definitely buying more of these! This is my honest review.</li>
            <li> Small pots, but a little goes a very long way.  Advise customer to make a separate purchase of mini scoops to assist with glitter application.  I found a set of 5 at my local Sally Beauty store.  Good price for amount of product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item, thinking they would be a little bigger containers. They are an alright size, but there are several of the same color. So I guess It makes enough glitter for whatever you&#x27;re using it for. I am using it for acrylic nails and I mix it with my acrylic powder and it works wonders. The only downside, when I opened it, some of the containers leaked out and glitter was all over.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  When I opened the package,  that took over 30 days to get here, the glitter was everywhere.  The little individual pods are not full and you would be lucky to be able to do 3 nails with one pod.  Definitely would not recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice colors. The only reason for a star less is because dust was all over when delivered.</li>
            <li> Some of them where full some weren&#x27;t these are suppose to be brand new but really look as if they have been used.</li>
            <li> Small containers but good choice in colors</li>
            <li> My glitters arrived on time. Didn&#x27;t realize how small the glitters were going to be. But im pretty sure its still a good product.</li>
            <li> Some of the containers weren&#x27;t closed tightly, so, of course, the box of the 45 containers had glitter all over them. However, after cleaning it up, which didn&#x27;t take long, I have to say I love the product.</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed that there were two or three of the same color and they didn&#x27;t all have the same amount in them. Other than that it was good.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect addition to any serious nail art enthusiast. The small glitter containers are just right for dipping fingers without making a mess. There are a lot of colors that are very close in shade, but when looked at closely are different. This is good for someone trying to find a perfect shade match and maybe one of the colors is a little off, but the other is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;They came packaged nicely and didn&#x27;t have a spill anywhere. The containers are in good condition and all screw on properly so no messes. I love that they are small so they can be packed away when i take my nail art boxes to friends parties. These have been a huge hit wherever I take them and people are always asking me where i get them!</li>
            <li> I received my order with a broken package the glitter was everywhere and the containers are so little and contain little bit of glitter don&#x27;t waste your money and time.  This glitter is not for acrylic one little jar will only do like 3 nails.</li>
            <li> Love this! So many colors!!!</li>
            <li> Messy package but a fun set of glitters. I used them with gel polish.</li>
