            <li>For this price, it&#x27;s a really good curler!!</li>
            <li>I use Revlon makeup and think they have some excellent products, but this is not one of them .</li>
            <li>It gets into the eye perfectly and</li>
            <li>Using this curler gives me beautifully curved lashes with no pinching or crimping.  </li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great lash curler.</li>
            <li>Trust me, this baby works great</li>
            <li>I was in the grocery store looking for one, and of course it&#x27;s not there, and didn&#x27;t want to go to the drugstore, lol</li>
            <li>:) works great :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many and this one always gives me the best results!!</li>
            <li>I loved Maybelline, but now I&#x27;m reading that they&#x27;ve \\&quot;improved\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have good results when I curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as good a gold one</li>
            <li>It NEVER gave a good curl.  </li>
            <li>Good eyelash curler,</li>
            <li>/&gt;The curl isn&#x27;t that good .</li>
            <li>it has  good resistence</li>
            <li>lol...:))</li>
            <li>I have an eyelash curler by Sally Hanson that I LOVE!</li>
            <li>this  eyelash curler is amazing</li>
            <li>see u soon when I&#x27;m purchasing more lol:))))</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even give you a nice shape to your curl.</li>
            <li>Honestly don&#x27;t notice a lot of difference using it or not.</li>
            <li>I have tried every eyelash curler ever made, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect to be able to curl just once per eye</li>
            <li>that one and it no longer works for most people.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler is just okay.</li>
            <li>No mascara will conceal, help, or make them look better.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want what I just experienced to happen to anyone else.</li>
            <li>I was glad that I received the GOLD curler.</li>
            <li>It works ok could be better :)</li>
            <li>so glad I found my favorite eyelashe curler. .</li>
            <li>that one always curled my outer eyelashes way more than the rest of my eyelashes, and I had to squeeze *</li>
            <li>so it fits my eye shape (personally) MUCH better and curls all my eyelashes evenly, and I literally just have to squeeze and let go</li>
            <li>So pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>this is it :)</li>
            <li>Off comes the top piece again.  </li>
            <li>so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Came with an extra pad, which was awesome.</li>
            <li>This lash curler has really squishy rubber lining that works great</li>
            <li>Overall, this curler works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>many high end lash curlers and none work as good as the Revlon Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li>All in all, I don&#x27;t really like these, but they&#x27;re good if you&#x27;ve got nothing else.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and my eye lashes are curled to perfection.</li>
            <li>Also, it is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was just what I wanted and the shipping was fast and the way they packed the package was AWESOME will definitely be buying 3 more</li>
            <li>I guess it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I would give this 0 stars if that was available.</li>
            <li>: I received an email today 2/18/2015 from Revlon and was instructed to call their toll free number, I waited on hold for over 5 minutes before I spoke with Kim, who transferred me to the claims department, which was another 4 minute hold time.</li>
            <li>It curls my eyelashes and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>style doesn&#x27;t fit my eyes and tends to pinch around the corners.</li>
            <li>and this will fit almost all of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even had it for 6 months, and the top of the curler just came right off.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t think of one good thing to say about this lash curler other than it doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what was happening at first, but I couldn&#x27;t get the curly onto my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>and they do the job, but I really liked the old gold ones.  </li>
            <li>Positives: it is easy to squeeze, is reasonably priced and widely available, and gives some (not long-lasting) curl to my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it curls just great.</li>
            <li>(I borrowed my mom&#x27;s gold one over 10 years ago and never gave it back, because I loved it so much!!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even KNOW eyelash curlers could work this well or this quickly.</li>
            <li>The top is too high</li>
            <li>but I liked it better than the other ones</li>
            <li>When I first received this in the mail (before it was scheduled to arrive!)</li>
            <li>The pad is different, definitely better!  </li>
            <li>I decided to try a different kind</li>
            <li>, I have to curl in about 3 different areas on my lashes to get a nice curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I tried it rather than following my original thought, which was to return it.  </li>
            <li>then I won&#x27;t be soured on this experience, just a little more cautious in the future :)I will say that I was happy with the customer service, how quickly they responded, and that I was able to understand the lady I was speaking with and that she could easily understand me.</li>
            <li>- you have to use the right technique.</li>
            <li>I did email Revlon, so hopefully they will make this right and refund me the purchase price..</li>
            <li>if Revlon makes this right</li>
            <li>This curler fits just right and doesn&#x27;t make me lose my lashes.</li>
            <li>, just gotta use it right.</li>
            <li>Once in a while i was able to get a pretty good curl on one eye but the other did not come out looking the same.</li>
            <li>The curl doesn&#x27;t last even with mascara, and better curlers are out there</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere</li>
            <li>It also works better than a different, simpler Revlon model I used to have...  </li>
            <li>Sure, I can put it back on, but as soon as I put the \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; on it, pop!  </li>
            <li>First off I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It has a prominent higher rise in the middle.  </li>
            <li>This gold set does have good tension and fits right up to the base of your lash; which creates a great curling and lengthening effect.</li>
            <li>Doing my best, and applying the pressure, I only get a little hint at a curl.&lt;br /&gt;Structurally it seems sturdy enough, and it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, but do yourself a favor and buy [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Then I realized that the large metal piece at the top was hitting my upper eyelid bone and</li>
            <li>i only liked the old one</li>
            <li>I find that to get the best curl with this device, you clamp it close to the base of your lashes, then work your way up to the middle-tips, holding it away from your eyelid in an upward ark, so it adds more curl.</li>
            <li>When they receive the information Kay said they will refund me and send me Revlon coupons, so awesome, I wish I didn&#x27;t loose my eyelashes to begin with, but at least they are willing to make it right.</li>
            <li>The picture shows a gold and black eyelash curler, which I&#x27;ve tried before and really liked.</li>
            <li>AS A LARGE</li>
            <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t fit into my eye socket.  </li>
            <li>but I recommend anyone that wants or looking for this product purchase it 5 stars all the way....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as what is available in stores by Revlon</li>
            <li>but I did really like the gold ones that are pictured</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this curler to anyone looking for one!</li>
            <li>Put on a light coat of mascara and let it set, then curl your eyelashes, and add a second coat of mascara.</li>
            <li>Very well built</li>
            <li>The spring and entire item is very well made, and it seems to fit my eye area very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older (maybe that&#x27;s part of the reason), but I couldn&#x27;t even get my lashes in the thing.</li>
            <li>B004KS0NBO Sally Hansen Eyelash Curler, Classic, Flirty Eyes 1 eyelash curler]]</li>
            <li>Most importantly this one came with a spring, which I swear is the secret to my lashes being so curly.  </li>
            <li>I vowed never to buy this lash curler again, but I&#x27;ve had a devil of a time finding a decent lash curler in the stores, so I turned to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Once again, Revlon isn&#x27;t making this particular eye lash curler anymore</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a decent eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>For those with round eyes, like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to you because the curve on this curler is for much more almond-shaped eyes.  </li>
            <li>this is the only one that works right.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t get all of my lashes in it from left to right because of it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because at the stores they had the new version that I didn&#x27;t like when it arrived</li>
            <li>and I got a new one I did not like at all.</li>
            <li>and I ended up with the new version of this that is silver.  </li>
            <li>I could have gotten the new version at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Simple to use, does exactly what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li>First off I did not buy this on Amazon, so I did get the actual gold, gold series eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I have pretty big eyes</li>
            <li>My lashes are pretty flat, and curling them is hassle, with results not lasting very much.</li>
            <li>I purchased this eyelash curler at the store, not on Amazon, just to be clear.  </li>
            <li>It pinches the very outer edges of the lashes only.</li>
            <li>For those wanting actual curled lashes, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this either.</li>
            <li>I put this curler side by side with my old curler and found that it is indeed wider and taller than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for the refills for my old one.</li>
            <li>My old eyelash curler ran out of pads</li>
            <li>But this is how it is for every curler I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I will use the parts for an old one that I have</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>The cushioned grip is nice, but unnecessary.  </li>
            <li>, I just know that I have looked high and low and</li>
            <li>The edge of the curler doesn&#x27;t really sink into the black pad when you press down, so your lashes are still pretty straight.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally use eyelash curlers as I think they are like torture divides coming at your eye.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these when I couldn&#x27;t find the white pads for my old Maybelline curler.</li>
            <li>I wiggled it around and could barely get it into my eye.  </li>
            <li>It was a total piece of junk as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>so please HBA Depot save me the gold ones u sent me on my other order I bought from yall thanks</li>
            <li>Here I spoke with Kay who was really sweet and genuinely felt bad for my situation.</li>
            <li>The silver edge isn&#x27;t sharp to where it would damage my lashes, and the padding is not warped at all and visably brand new.  </li>

            <li> if Revlon makes this right</li>
            <li> This curler fits just right and doesn&#x27;t make me lose my lashes.</li>
            <li> , just gotta use it right.</li>
            <li> Once in a while i was able to get a pretty good curl on one eye but the other did not come out looking the same.</li>
            <li> The curl doesn&#x27;t last even with mascara, and better curlers are out there</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere</li>
            <li> It also works better than a different, simpler Revlon model I used to have...  </li>
            <li> Sure, I can put it back on, but as soon as I put the \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; on it, pop!  </li>
            <li> First off I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It has a prominent higher rise in the middle.  </li>
            <li> This gold set does have good tension and fits right up to the base of your lash; which creates a great curling and lengthening effect.</li>
            <li> Doing my best, and applying the pressure, I only get a little hint at a curl.&lt;br /&gt;Structurally it seems sturdy enough, and it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, but do yourself a favor and buy [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Then I realized that the large metal piece at the top was hitting my upper eyelid bone and</li>
            <li> i only liked the old one</li>
            <li> I find that to get the best curl with this device, you clamp it close to the base of your lashes, then work your way up to the middle-tips, holding it away from your eyelid in an upward ark, so it adds more curl.</li>
            <li> When they receive the information Kay said they will refund me and send me Revlon coupons, so awesome, I wish I didn&#x27;t loose my eyelashes to begin with, but at least they are willing to make it right.</li>
            <li> The picture shows a gold and black eyelash curler, which I&#x27;ve tried before and really liked.</li>
            <li> AS A LARGE</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t fit into my eye socket.  </li>
            <li> but I recommend anyone that wants or looking for this product purchase it 5 stars all the way....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as what is available in stores by Revlon</li>
            <li> but I did really like the gold ones that are pictured</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this curler to anyone looking for one!</li>
            <li> Put on a light coat of mascara and let it set, then curl your eyelashes, and add a second coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> Very well built</li>
            <li> The spring and entire item is very well made, and it seems to fit my eye area very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older (maybe that&#x27;s part of the reason), but I couldn&#x27;t even get my lashes in the thing.</li>
            <li> B004KS0NBO Sally Hansen Eyelash Curler, Classic, Flirty Eyes 1 eyelash curler]]</li>
            <li> Most importantly this one came with a spring, which I swear is the secret to my lashes being so curly.  </li>
            <li> I vowed never to buy this lash curler again, but I&#x27;ve had a devil of a time finding a decent lash curler in the stores, so I turned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Once again, Revlon isn&#x27;t making this particular eye lash curler anymore</li>
            <li> I am still looking for a decent eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> For those with round eyes, like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to you because the curve on this curler is for much more almond-shaped eyes.  </li>
            <li> this is the only one that works right.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t get all of my lashes in it from left to right because of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because at the stores they had the new version that I didn&#x27;t like when it arrived</li>
            <li> and I got a new one I did not like at all.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with the new version of this that is silver.  </li>
            <li> I could have gotten the new version at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Simple to use, does exactly what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> First off I did not buy this on Amazon, so I did get the actual gold, gold series eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I have pretty big eyes</li>
            <li> My lashes are pretty flat, and curling them is hassle, with results not lasting very much.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyelash curler at the store, not on Amazon, just to be clear.  </li>
            <li> It pinches the very outer edges of the lashes only.</li>
            <li> For those wanting actual curled lashes, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this either.</li>
            <li> I put this curler side by side with my old curler and found that it is indeed wider and taller than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for the refills for my old one.</li>
            <li> My old eyelash curler ran out of pads</li>
            <li> But this is how it is for every curler I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I will use the parts for an old one that I have</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> The cushioned grip is nice, but unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> , I just know that I have looked high and low and</li>
            <li> The edge of the curler doesn&#x27;t really sink into the black pad when you press down, so your lashes are still pretty straight.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally use eyelash curlers as I think they are like torture divides coming at your eye.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these when I couldn&#x27;t find the white pads for my old Maybelline curler.</li>
            <li> I wiggled it around and could barely get it into my eye.  </li>
            <li> It was a total piece of junk as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> so please HBA Depot save me the gold ones u sent me on my other order I bought from yall thanks</li>
            <li> Here I spoke with Kay who was really sweet and genuinely felt bad for my situation.</li>
            <li> The silver edge isn&#x27;t sharp to where it would damage my lashes, and the padding is not warped at all and visably brand new.  </li>
            <li> As far as curling - it does not even come close to comparing to any other lash curlers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was a bit confused when i first opened the box, as the package inside was ripped a bit and looked partially open, but as i examined the product, it was untouched and completely usable.</li>
            <li> I have large eyes with VERY long lashes and most curlers are too small - i.e. leave weird crimp lines,</li>
            <li> I knew there was a chance of different colored inserts, and I don&#x27;t care about the color as long as they work.</li>
            <li> I really like the grip on the curler because it does not hurt your fingers, however my eyelashes where a bit hard to curl because it had been years, but it still works.</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive curlers that did not work as well, inexpensive curlers that came apart with the least amount of pressure and experimental curlers that did not work at all (specifically Revlon&#x27;s lighted curler).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also too wide, or maybe it doesn&#x27;t have enough of a cupped shape.</li>
            <li> Do you want long eyelashes, but you don&#x27;t want to wear falsies?</li>
            <li> the other big make up companies.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s women&#x27;s faces in general are even this big.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the gold and black one, but I was sent a silver one with red padding.</li>
            <li> I held the darn thing in place for two minutes, and in less than fifteen second the half of my lashes that did curl (or rather crimp) was flat again.</li>
            <li> This curler by Revlon is your basic everyday lash curler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that were 2 to 3 times the cost</li>
            <li> And extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> when curling and the other dont.</li>
            <li> Wanted the gold one with black accent, got soccer with pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just average.  </li>
            <li> down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This curler is your typical drugstore mechanical eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Revlon lash curler with the black rubber inserts.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this POS lash curler, it leaves a black mark on either side of my eye on the skin below my eye.</li>
            <li> The picture shows the gold with black rubber eyelash curler and that the one I \\&quot;purchased\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but i received the silver with black.</li>
            <li> allways the little 5-6 dollar bs that turns out this way, almost not worth the return process</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to work a bit to get to the roots of my lashes, or rather anywhere past the tips of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous to wait that long for a lash curler.</li>
            <li> i know this because my mom has very thin small lashes and when she try this curler she was so happy others bend really ugly and uneven if you know what I mean..</li>
            <li> I have to curl my lashes everyday to keep them out of my eyes and have been using the Revlon Cushion Grip for years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> Because it does not pinch, it grips nicely, it is firm, no pain, and it lasts.  </li>
            <li> This curler is a cheap knock off of department stores and was curved in a way that will not fit your eyes, I do not have small or hooded eyes and this curler pinched my eyes and didn&#x27;t curl, but the worst part to add insult to injury is it broke off the my lashes in the middle</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the other 10 negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read a couple of other negative reviews that said they couldn&#x27;t return the lash curler because they couldn&#x27;t reach the seller.</li>
            <li> One side of it curls kind of sideways; it has a pointless spring/coil thing; but the worst flaw is the paint will start to rub off on you in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I even tried the other revlon silver model, and no good.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on my eyelashes everyday with the use of this eyelash curler followed by mascara!</li>
            <li> I was being lazy.</li>
            <li> It is very hard, my eyelashes are not pretty.</li>
            <li> Aside from a Lacrosse eyelash curler I tried once and tossed in the trash because it pinched, this painted pewter and red Revlon one is the absolute worst ever.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the one I received is exactly like one I already have and hate.</li>
            <li> To hard to use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t trust it have to hold to hard to get a curl</li>
            <li> really* hard and hold it there for 10-15 seconds to get the amount of curl I wanted.</li>
            <li> It is hard to squeeze because of the spring.</li>
            <li> This eye lash curler is a terrible product, hard to use and the cheap plastice pad are a jole</li>
            <li> Lashes grow slow anyway, now I have to wait months.</li>
            <li> it was not the one in the picture they had send me the new version very disappointing</li>
            <li> Really disappointed because this does not work as well as my old (gold colored)</li>
            <li> The curling &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; is hard and inflexible.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this at Wal-Mart, and it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> plus the confusion of the spring on the handle which I think is unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> It seems to make things worse for me.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed because it wasn&#x27;t the gold curler that was in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I will share a secret with you.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst eyelash curler I have ever tried to use.  </li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> That said, this iz by far the worst eyelash curler I have, as of yet, tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird, that I have to be so picky about an eyelash curler, but alas.</li>
            <li> and I mean they are GONE!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the strongest because of the spring, and out performs all of the expensive curlers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I prefer an eyelash curler with a spring and they are difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Sent the wrong one!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> It practically makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> : THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s impossible to curl your lashes without skin contact.)</li>
            <li> Bad design and bad product.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this curler after getting really sick of my Covergirl curler -</li>
            <li> and this is what I get to deal with :(    </li>
            <li> (I would have been disappointed if a substitute had been sent)</li>
            <li> Worthless to me....</li>
            <li> Awful, and dangerous.</li>
            <li> The spring is annoying for storage.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed witht the product that was sent to me.</li>
            <li> Worst eye lash curler I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Horrible doesn&#x27;t describe, but there is no stronger word.</li>

            <li> My lashes are pretty flat, and curling them is hassle, with results not lasting very much. That said, this iz by far the worst eyelash curler I have, as of yet, tried. I held the darn thing in place for two minutes, and in less than fifteen second the half of my lashes that did curl (or rather crimp) was flat again. Guess it&#x27;s off to the trash with it. ~$7 down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!!! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great. Its easy to use and my eye lashes are curled to perfection. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this at Wal-Mart, and it isn&#x27;t too bad. It curls my lashes sufficiently. My only complaint is that I have to work a bit to get to the roots of my lashes, or rather anywhere past the tips of my eyelashes. Other than that it curls just great.</li>
            <li> The item was incorrect. I received a curler with no spring and the picture shows a spring</li>
            <li> I have large eyes with VERY long lashes and most curlers are too small - i.e. leave weird crimp lines, etc -  for me because of it. I have to curl my lashes everyday to keep them out of my eyes and have been using the Revlon Cushion Grip for years. It&#x27;s the strongest because of the spring, and out performs all of the expensive curlers I&#x27;ve tried. But don&#x27;t expect to be able to curl just once per eye - you have to use the right technique. I start at the lash line and work out, holding each time for about 10 seconds. My lashes stay curled until I wash my face every time, 12-24 hours.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these when I couldn&#x27;t find the white pads for my old Maybelline curler. I&#x27;m older (maybe that&#x27;s part of the reason), but I couldn&#x27;t even get my lashes in the thing. It pinches the very outer edges of the lashes only. Worthless to me.... I loved Maybelline, but now I&#x27;m reading that they&#x27;ve \\&quot;improved\\&quot; that one and it no longer works for most people. I have no idea what to buy now!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is just okay. Once in a while i was able to get a pretty good curl on one eye but the other did not come out looking the same. &amp; sometimes my lashes would get caught &amp; i&#x27;d pull some out! Not good! I would prefer a Tweezerman eyelash curler over Revlon any day!</li>
            <li> Positives: it is easy to squeeze, is reasonably priced and widely available, and gives some (not long-lasting) curl to my lashes.  The curl doesn&#x27;t last even with mascara, and better curlers are out there (I like my Sally Hansen Flirty lashes curler)at this price point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyelash curler since I was 14 and I&#x27;m now 23.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands that were 2 to 3 times the cost and I keep returning to this curler to get the results I want.  I get compliments on my eyelashes everyday with the use of this eyelash curler followed by mascara!</li>
            <li> This curler is your typical drugstore mechanical eyelash curler. It&#x27;s just average.  For those with round eyes, like myself, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to you because the curve on this curler is for much more almond-shaped eyes.  For those wanting actual curled lashes, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this either. The edge of the curler doesn&#x27;t really sink into the black pad when you press down, so your lashes are still pretty straight.  All in all, I don&#x27;t really like these, but they&#x27;re good if you&#x27;ve got nothing else.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have good results when I curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler has pulled my eyelashes out. When I try curling, sometimes there&#x27;s still an eyelash still stuck in it and it pokes my eye! How can anyone give this 5 stars? It&#x27;s a spanish inquisition torture device for your eyes. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Wanted the gold one with black accent, got soccer with pink. Doesn&#x27;t work as good a gold one</li>
            <li> Worst eye lash curler I&#x27;ve ever used. Revlon needs to remove this product from their line. It rips out eyelashes and pinches your eyelids. Yesterday it ripped out several lashes. I&#x27;ve been using curlers for years and never have had this experience! The curling &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; is hard and inflexible. As far as curling - it does not even come close to comparing to any other lash curlers I&#x27;ve used. It was thrown in the garbage - were it belongs!</li>
            <li> This curler by Revlon is your basic everyday lash curler. Simple to use, does exactly what it&#x27;s made for. And extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> Item just as described.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I wanted.  I&#x27;ve found that this curler has the perfect curve for my eyes and lashes which is the trick to perfectly curled lashes.  I&#x27;ve tried many high end lash curlers and none work as good as the Revlon Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> I would give this 0 stars if that was available. First off I did not buy this on Amazon, so I did get the actual gold, gold series eyelash curler. BUYER BEWARE!!!! This curler is a cheap knock off of department stores and was curved in a way that will not fit your eyes, I do not have small or hooded eyes and this curler pinched my eyes and didn&#x27;t curl, but the worst part to add insult to injury is it broke off the my lashes in the middle and I mean they are GONE!! No mascara will conceal, help, or make them look better. Lashes grow slow anyway, now I have to wait months. I want to stop anyone who is considering this eyelash curler. I really don&#x27;t want what I just experienced to happen to anyone else. Horrible doesn&#x27;t describe, but there is no stronger word. I did email Revlon, so hopefully they will make this right and refund me the purchase price..I will update if they do. BTW tomorrow is Valentines and this is what I get to deal with :(    **Update: I received an email today 2/18/2015 from Revlon and was instructed to call their toll free number, I waited on hold for over 5 minutes before I spoke with Kim, who transferred me to the claims department, which was another 4 minute hold time. Here I spoke with Kay who was really sweet and genuinely felt bad for my situation. Kay will send me a prepaid envelope to send my curler back in. When they receive the information Kay said they will refund me and send me Revlon coupons, so awesome, I wish I didn&#x27;t loose my eyelashes to begin with, but at least they are willing to make it right. Kay did say that the curlers hinges could of been out of alignment, which might be why it pinched my eyelid. So all in all if Revlon makes this right then I won&#x27;t be soured on this experience, just a little more cautious in the future :)I will say that I was happy with the customer service, how quickly they responded, and that I was able to understand the lady I was speaking with and that she could easily understand me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because at the stores they had the new version that I didn&#x27;t like when it arrived it was not the one in the picture they had send me the new version very disappointing i only liked the old one</li>
            <li> This is a great lash curler. I&#x27;ve used many and this one always gives me the best results!! Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and it did not work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what was happening at first, but I couldn&#x27;t get the curly onto my eyelashes.  Then I realized that the large metal piece at the top was hitting my upper eyelid bone and the side pieces were hitting my nose and eye socket bones.  I wiggled it around and could barely get it into my eye.  plus the confusion of the spring on the handle which I think is unnecessary.  but anyway,...  I put this curler side by side with my old curler and found that it is indeed wider and taller than my old one.  It simply doesn&#x27;t fit into my eye socket.  I wish I had read the other 10 negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY SHOULD LABEL THIS CURLER AS A LARGE but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s women&#x27;s faces in general are even this big.</li>
            <li> To hard to use. Didn&#x27;t trust it have to hold to hard to get a curl</li>
            <li> I was glad that I received the GOLD curler. I have found that one works the best. (I would have been disappointed if a substitute had been sent)</li>
            <li> It works ok could be better :)</li>
            <li> Really disappointed because this does not work as well as my old (gold colored) Revlon lash curler with the black rubber inserts. I knew there was a chance of different colored inserts, and I don&#x27;t care about the color as long as they work. These don&#x27;t, and the metal part of the curler is different, as well. All I wanted was refills, but had to get this instead. Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for the refills for my old one.</li>
            <li> seems to perform as advertised</li>
            <li> I have tried every eyelash curler ever made, and this is by far the best. Why? Because it does not pinch, it grips nicely, it is firm, no pain, and it lasts.  I even tried the other revlon silver model, and no good.  Maybe because this one has the spring?! I do not know and I do not care, I just know that I have looked high and low and this is the only one that works right. I am 52 so I have tried a lot!!</li>
            <li> I have an eyelash curler by Sally Hanson that I LOVE! I wanted to buy the same one to leave at my boyfriends house but didn&#x27;t see it at the drugstore so I just bought one that looked similar. This curler is not shaped for my eye at all. The top is too high and I can&#x27;t get it in the socket all the way. It&#x27;s also too wide, or maybe it doesn&#x27;t have enough of a cupped shape. But I can&#x27;t get all of my lashes in it from left to right because of it. Doing my best, and applying the pressure, I only get a little hint at a curl.&lt;br /&gt;Structurally it seems sturdy enough, and it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, but do yourself a favor and buy [[ASIN:B004KS0NBO Sally Hansen Eyelash Curler, Classic, Flirty Eyes 1 eyelash curler]] it&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever owned. They are not all created equal!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere so I so glad I found my favorite eyelashe curler. . This product was just what I wanted and the shipping was fast and the way they packed the package was AWESOME will definitely be buying 3 more so please HBA Depot save me the gold ones u sent me on my other order I bought from yall thanks lol...:))) but I recommend anyone that wants or looking for this product purchase it 5 stars all the way....see u soon when I&#x27;m purchasing more lol:))))</li>
            <li> I just bought this curler after getting really sick of my Covergirl curler - that one always curled my outer eyelashes way more than the rest of my eyelashes, and I had to squeeze *really* hard and hold it there for 10-15 seconds to get the amount of curl I wanted. It also works better than a different, simpler Revlon model I used to have...  With this curler, the curler part is not so curved so it fits my eye shape (personally) MUCH better and curls all my eyelashes evenly, and I literally just have to squeeze and let go and they are curled. It must have to do with the mechanics of the spring they have below the handle. I didn&#x27;t even KNOW eyelash curlers could work this well or this quickly. So pleased.</li>
            <li> My old eyelash curler ran out of pads and I got a new one I did not like at all. I decided to try a different kind and I found this one. I am sticking with it! It curls my eyelashes and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> this  eyelash curler is amazing I love it I never switch to another product this is it :)&lt;br /&gt;it curls even the thinnest lashes i know this because my mom has very thin small lashes and when she try this curler she was so happy others bend really ugly and uneven if you know what I mean..</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyelash curler at the store, not on Amazon, just to be clear.  But I saw it listed here and felt the need to put in my two cents regarding my experience with this piece of junk.  It NEVER gave a good curl.  And today, it broke.  I haven&#x27;t even had it for 6 months, and the top of the curler just came right off. Sure, I can put it back on, but as soon as I put the \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; on it, pop!  Off comes the top piece again.  Awful, and dangerous. I will not purchase a Revlon eyelash curler ever again...</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be the same style of eyelash curler but potentially a different colour (as stated). My gold one fits my eye perfectly and I couldn&#x27;t find the same one in stores.&lt;br /&gt;The one I was sent is a different style and different colour. It&#x27;s the same as what is available in stores by Revlon but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;This style doesn&#x27;t fit my eyes and tends to pinch around the corners. Eyelash curlers aren&#x27;t universal.</li>
            <li> This curler fits just right and doesn&#x27;t make me lose my lashes. I can&#x27;t just curl once, I have to curl in about 3 different areas on my lashes to get a nice curl. But this is how it is for every curler I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Good eyelash curler, but I did really like the gold ones that are pictured and I ended up with the new version of this that is silver.  I already have one of these and they do the job, but I really liked the old gold ones.  I could have gotten the new version at the grocery store.  Most importantly this one came with a spring, which I swear is the secret to my lashes being so curly.  It&#x27;s weird, that I have to be so picky about an eyelash curler, but alas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not an eyelash curler girl. It seems to make things worse for me. Tossed it out.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to add to all the makeup that I put together as a birthday package and I hope she will like it.</li>
            <li> The picture shows a gold and black eyelash curler, which I&#x27;ve tried before and really liked. HOWEVER, the one I received is exactly like one I already have and hate. It&#x27;s a painted pewter one with red rubber curler pad and grips. Over a short period of time, the paint starts to deteriorate. Every time I use this POS lash curler, it leaves a black mark on either side of my eye on the skin below my eye. (It&#x27;s impossible to curl your lashes without skin contact.) Also, the rubber grips continually pop out. I vowed never to buy this lash curler again, but I&#x27;ve had a devil of a time finding a decent lash curler in the stores, so I turned to Amazon. Aside from a Lacrosse eyelash curler I tried once and tossed in the trash because it pinched, this painted pewter and red Revlon one is the absolute worst ever. It doesn&#x27;t even give you a nice shape to your curl. One side of it curls kind of sideways; it has a pointless spring/coil thing; but the worst flaw is the paint will start to rub off on you in a few weeks. I&#x27;m also going to complain to Revlon and beg them to go back to the design from 1979. Honestly, I can&#x27;t think of one good thing to say about this lash curler other than it doesn&#x27;t pinch. That&#x27;s it. Lastly, I had to wait over a week to get this. Ridiculous to wait that long for a lash curler. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. I&#x27;ve also read a couple of other negative reviews that said they couldn&#x27;t return the lash curler because they couldn&#x27;t reach the seller.</li>
            <li> When I first received this in the mail (before it was scheduled to arrive!) I was annoyed because it wasn&#x27;t the gold curler that was in the picture.  (I borrowed my mom&#x27;s gold one over 10 years ago and never gave it back, because I loved it so much!!  It was the perfect width for my eyes!)  I&#x27;m really glad I tried it rather than following my original thought, which was to return it.  It&#x27;s like an updated version of the gold one.  The pad is different, definitely better!  I highly recommend this curler to anyone looking for one!</li>
            <li> Once again, Revlon isn&#x27;t making this particular eye lash curler anymore but I liked it better than the other ones so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler I use. I have pretty big eyes and this will fit almost all of my eyelashes. Also, it is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I received is slightly different from the picture. It has red pads and a spring (which I cannot tell if that is in the picture). The spring is annoying for storage. Keep the plastic thing that is included on the finger holes in the packaging to replace after you use the curler.</li>
            <li> I prefer an eyelash curler with a spring and they are difficult to find.  This one is GREAT!!!  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is very hard, my eyelashes are not pretty. I will use the parts for an old one that I have</li>
            <li> I really like the grip on the curler because it does not hurt your fingers, however my eyelashes where a bit hard to curl because it had been years, but it still works. I will say one thing however that the curl does not last a while on them, so maybe I have to curl for hours. This is why it has only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed witht the product that was sent to me. What I was sent is not what is depicted in the picture at all. This eye lash curler is a terrible product, hard to use and the cheap plastice pad are a jole</li>
            <li> Do you want long eyelashes, but you don&#x27;t want to wear falsies? I will share a secret with you. Put on a light coat of mascara and let it set, then curl your eyelashes, and add a second coat of mascara. You will look like you are wearing falsies after this technique. This gold set does have good tension and fits right up to the base of your lash; which creates a great curling and lengthening effect.</li>
            <li> I was a bit confused when i first opened the box, as the package inside was ripped a bit and looked partially open, but as i examined the product, it was untouched and completely usable. Came with an extra pad, which was awesome. For this price, it&#x27;s a really good curler!! Any so-so curler can work for you, it&#x27;s not the technology, but the technique you use. I find that to get the best curl with this device, you clamp it close to the base of your lashes, then work your way up to the middle-tips, holding it away from your eyelid in an upward ark, so it adds more curl. Youtube techniques if the product still isn&#x27;t working to your satisfaction. Trust me, this baby works great, just gotta use it right.</li>
            <li> I guess it works fine.  I don&#x27;t generally use eyelash curlers as I think they are like torture divides coming at your eye.  Honestly don&#x27;t notice a lot of difference using it or not.</li>
            <li> This lash curler has really squishy rubber lining that works great and it even comes with one replacement rubber thingy.  It practically makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes!  Very well built and it&#x27;s by Revlon.  I try to always buy Revlon products because they don&#x27;t test on animals unlike the other big make up companies.</li>
            <li> Sent the wrong one!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its allways the little 5-6 dollar bs that turns out this way, almost not worth the return process</li>
            <li> Ok&lt;br /&gt;The curl isn&#x27;t that good . But for the price it does well .</li>
            <li> Using this curler gives me beautifully curved lashes with no pinching or crimping.  I have used more expensive curlers that did not work as well, inexpensive curlers that came apart with the least amount of pressure and experimental curlers that did not work at all (specifically Revlon&#x27;s lighted curler).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler works well for those that like to use quite a  bit of pressure when curling.  It stands up well, the curler hasn&#x27;t loosened or come apart.  The cushioned grip is nice, but unnecessary.  Overall, this curler works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This did not curl my eyelashes. It is hard to squeeze because of the spring. It was a total piece of junk as far as I am concerned. I am still looking for a decent eyelash curler. I use Revlon makeup and think they have some excellent products, but this is not one of them .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the curler.  It has changed and is too big for my eye socket.  Why change something that works well??</li>
            <li> First off I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon.  This is the absolute worst eyelash curler I have ever tried to use.  It has a prominent higher rise in the middle.  This part stuck me in my eye and I could never even get the curler on my lashes.  Who would make a curler that rises almost to a point in the middle?  Bad design and bad product.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the gold and black one, but I was sent a silver one with red padding. It works well so I have no complaints. The spring and entire item is very well made, and it seems to fit my eye area very well. The silver edge isn&#x27;t sharp to where it would damage my lashes, and the padding is not warped at all and visably brand new.  Anyway, I&#x27;m pleased. I was in the grocery store looking for one, and of course it&#x27;s not there, and didn&#x27;t want to go to the drugstore, lol ya ya I was being lazy. Anyway, so I looked on here and they were all like ~$15-25. I&#x27;m not cheap but that&#x27;s a bit much for a damn eyelash curler. So I saw this one for &amp;6.50 and couldn&#x27;t be happier :) works great :D</li>
            <li> The picture shows the gold with black rubber eyelash curler and that the one I \\&quot;purchased\\&quot; but i received the silver with black. The colored eyelash curlers are not just for looks they each have a different curl effect to them. I perfer the gold one because its a vey well made. It gets into the eye perfectly and it it has  good resistence when curling and the other dont. They are cheply made so when I found it here (drugstores dont carry it anymore) I bought but got something else. Do not buy cant even contact seller to return the item.</li>
