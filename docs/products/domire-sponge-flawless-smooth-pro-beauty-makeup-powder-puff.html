            <li>Very cool!  </li>
            <li>The bright color makes it easy to find in your cosmetics bag.</li>
            <li>Love love this one!</li>
            <li>Love this idem and bought one for my Mom!  :)</li>
            <li>i would love it even more!</li>
            <li>This is the best beauty blender ive bought so far!</li>
            <li>the replica of the original one wich is 20 $ more great item</li>
            <li>And very good price girls or guys should really buy.</li>
            <li>So far the best make up blender</li>
            <li>Soft, works perfect!</li>
            <li>nice to be able to come to turkey cargo.</li>
            <li>I order this product and I totally enjoy using this , it works good.</li>
            <li>Love the color blends amazing</li>
            <li>but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>I use it to blend in my concealer and it&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s not as soft as the beauty blender</li>
            <li>i really love this beauty blender its amazing</li>
            <li>the price is great and it came in right on time .</li>
            <li>great blender fits right in my hand</li>
            <li>I love love love this beauty blender!</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this!</li>
            <li>A great and smooth blender, very useful for ladies .</li>
            <li>Great for the price, and it works exactly how I thought it would.</li>
            <li>However, this was very smooth.</li>
            <li>The original beauty blender is very soft and when you run it under water, it absorbs water which makes your make up application flawless.</li>
            <li>this is more of like the sponge that you would find it a sponge pit that you would jump into.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it on here instead of $10 at a make up store.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this sponge.</li>
            <li>This makeup blender is okay</li>
            <li>It was okay ..</li>
            <li>It does apply it evenly and helps make the makeup more pigmented.</li>
            <li>I would repurchase! :)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I use it every day. :)</li>
            <li>The product was cute</li>
            <li>this one has to be my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>Need to order more.</li>
            <li>Cute and compact.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>Practice makes perfect, but I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>These are ok</li>
            <li>Just okay for the price.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I found without a doubt that a stipple brush blends in your foundation better and more evenly.</li>
            <li>but it does the job just damp it more.</li>
            <li>The item is ok for the price</li>
            <li>they sell these at any fashion store for more than $5.</li>
            <li>Ive bought the $20 ones, the $15 ones, but this one has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better at applying concealer under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with them and have given a couple away as gifts.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love them I got 2 of them</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It does help apply makeup on your face better than face hand and fingers.</li>
            <li>PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>So about 9 months back I bought one of these and thought it was awesome!</li>

            <li>If you use and love the BB then don&#x27;t ecpect this to replace it.</li>
            <li>thank you:)</li>
            <li>Came on time love using it.</li>
            <li>I love this sponges.</li>
            <li>Make-up applies more evenly.</li>
            <li>but I was pleased with the product after I received it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was great for the price!</li>
            <li>I love this sponge blender.</li>
            <li>but it seem okay after rinsing it.</li>
            <li>If i could only perfect using it</li>
            <li>I love the way it blends my makeup I can contour better with it</li>
            <li>id definitely purchase it again awesome product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Smooth out my concealer n foundation really nice</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve come across better sponges</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>then that it was okay,</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality for a very low price.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok .</li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>but i was hoping it would be better than it was.</li>
            <li>Love these for the price.</li>
            <li>Its ok doesn&#x27;t blend well in my opinion.shipping</li>
            <li>Love the shape.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>this one is way better</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve evened it out a lot with your fingers you can blend it some more with a brush.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll end up wasting a lot of product as well as saturating the sponge so you&#x27;ll have to throw it out more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Just trying to get you to spend more money.  </li>
            <li>but I felt like most of my foundation was sucked up in this rather then on my face.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>but, for the price I was pleased.</li>
            <li>Great product with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this blender.</li>
            <li>i love these i use them on my makeup kit</li>
            <li>and i love them</li>
            <li>and they so affordable that i can buy many of them for my client</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a beauty blender but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like...</li>
            <li>Still ok for $1 though.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;ll need to try it out a bit more and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not upset by this purchase, more than I am about the reviews.</li>
            <li>Better off with the orange sponge from technique that i got from ulta.</li>
            <li>Love how the foundation comes out from just dabbing.</li>
            <li>I love the even and lightweight finish I get with the blender.  </li>
            <li>I love it, will be ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li>Love this applicator.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>it gives a more matte finish, which is what I want.</li>
            <li>really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it was ok for the price.</li>
            <li>now that i know more about these.</li>
            <li>but im sure it can be washed</li>
            <li>Did what I wanted and more.</li>
            <li>I will order much more from them</li>
            <li>So I did a search and found the $1.50 version :)  </li>
            <li>But for $20 I would have had a TON of complaints!  :)</li>
            <li>Love love this product .</li>
            <li>Okay makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>this is an okay blender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but others compared it to Beauty Blender... not even close.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the BB for more than 2 years now</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad i tried it,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok but not what I thought it was</li>
            <li>Love this tool for smoothing out makeup</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap and is a MUST!</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>Im just in love with this</li>
            <li>Love it for the price</li>
            <li>really helps apply liquid foundation very nicely.</li>
            <li>Makes blending much easier!!!!</li>
            <li>I love the sponge, very light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This BB is pretty good :3</li>
            <li>I recommend thoroughly rinsing it with warm water and soap to clean it of its smell (and sanitize it), before you use</li>
            <li>Ok ive ordered  over 5 different blenders and this 1 works just as good fast and blends flawless</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s pretty straightforward lol).</li>
            <li>I would say that this does not work like the Beauty Blender but is still a pretty good cosmetic sponge.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good to blend the foundation</li>
            <li>However, it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>They are GORGEOUS and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>and it went on flawlessy, actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth the wait!!</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait !!</li>
            <li>I have dry patches but this sponge makes my face look flawless</li>
            <li>Easy to wash and actually a cute makeup accessory.</li>
            <li>Great for blending foundation and getting a nice sheer coverage.</li>
            <li>I love pink and putting on make up,this is perfect.</li>
            <li>i love how it blends my foundation in smoothly..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap sponge,had to go to Sephora for a smoother softer feel,makeup goes on better with a pricy one</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Blends perfectly with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>is more comparable to cheap sponges that you can buy at drugstores.</li>
            <li>But for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much, so 2 stars for fair pricing.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely baffled about the good reviews.</li>
            <li>i think its good f use for contour though i dont use it much ..</li>
            <li>Not as good as the real beauty blender(doesn&#x27;t absorb water nor expand)</li>
            <li>Glad I went with this first!!</li>
            <li>its not the right kind of sponge</li>
            <li>It arrived in a beat up package due to USPS error, but the product is perfect.</li>
            <li>But, the other side is still working great!</li>
            <li>This was a cool buy!  </li>
            <li>Shipping took a while but other than that I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This thing is so cool!  </li>
            <li>Easy to get up close in those crevasses.</li>
            <li>Not the same as the origninal Beauty Blender, but they are great for my use; and I love the price.</li>
            <li>easy to blend with this without messing anything else up.</li>
            <li>Its blends around the eye area easily</li>
            <li>Easy to apply make up</li>
            <li>You can build coverage easily and it works well with my thicker  concealer  </li>
            <li>Easily to use foundation now.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly &amp; easy to wash</li>
            <li>love it :) worth the money</li>
            <li>It is not as easy because the shape of it</li>
            <li>(and it smelled like extremely strong chemicals when it arrived and even after I washed it) into the trash it goes..</li>
            <li>Super cute, super good, super cheap</li>
            <li>I liked it very much...</li>
            <li>absolutely love this never have used the actually real beauty blender and don&#x27;t feel the need to this works just fine and does the job perfect totally recommend it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight, and easily cleanable.</li>
            <li>These work just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>IT WORKS EXTREMELY FINE FOR WHAT YOU PAID FOR.  </li>
            <li>Works fine for the money you paid.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fine too.</li>
            <li>This little guy works great!  </li>
            <li>Little in size but does the job, I am very impressed with this product for the price that I have paid for!😍</li>
            <li>love it soooooo much!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even soak up any water so it never get moist to smooth out brush lines.</li>
            <li>Just invest the money in a bb, it will be worth it :)</li>
            <li>Because no beauty blender is gonna be this cheap.</li>
            <li>I use Maybelline fit me foundation</li>
            <li>It applies my foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li>Kinda Cheap</li>
            <li>Not the real material for makeup sponges but still works nicely</li>
            <li>It was okay, it was worth the $2</li>
            <li>it has pieces that flake off it, does not leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Cheap and functional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Dirt cheap.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price and thinking if buying more.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s a cheap price for the product...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in search of a cheap, alternative to the BB, I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li>&amp; I enjoy my product.</li>
            <li>The surface will be smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>It looks like the beauty blender but most certainly is worth what you pay.</li>
            <li>now that i tried this cheap 1</li>
            <li>It took a while to arrive but it works great then the regular sponge.</li>
            <li>I can just wash it, reuse it, and it doesn&#x27;t peel off like the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>The item works great blending and is equal to my dermablend one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>I got this knowing that it was cheap and that it wasn&#x27;t going to be the beauty blender</li>
            <li>Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for the price.</li>
            <li>Sponge not that cheap foam.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it wouldn&#x27;t clean as easy.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a 50/50 chance you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Cheap and couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy the results I achieve with this product.</li>
            <li>Feels cheap</li>
            <li>This helps smooth out your makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made, it feels like a rubber ball and do not blend my makeup out.</li>
            <li>Literally laughed out loud when I read this</li>
            <li>I love beauty blenders and I was glad to find this in for a much cheaper price than the original at sephora for $20.</li>
            <li>for the price, good.  not typical beauty blender, though.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I can say that it blended and contoured quickly and easily</li>
            <li>it applies my makeup with even coverage and is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>not like the original.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t swell and absorb like the original beauty blender but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Now, I know it&#x27;s not the original one which is 20 bucks, but I wanted to try a cheaper version first.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>So far I love it as it helps smooth out foundation and gives a more even appearance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reviewing this to the original beauty blender because I have it.</li>
            <li>It also does not sponge up like the original beauty blender</li>
            <li>Excited to start using.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend 35$ on another  the original Beauty blender</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this out</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t spend like the original bb....</li>
            <li>You get what you&#x27;re paying for basically and for two dollars I&#x27;m not extremely disappointed,  however, I will not repurchase this</li>
            <li>I do not have the original beauty blender so nothing to compare this to, but this does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>If you have the original beauty blender you would understand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just buy another original beauty blender instead.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that I have ever used, so I don&#x27;t know if there is suppose to be something magical about this product or not.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever believe that this is comparable to the original Beauty Blender (BB).</li>
            <li>I just received my Makeup Blender after ordering it a month ago and was excited to try my inexpensive makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it</li>
            <li>I love this little thing its great for blending</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something I can&#x27;t live without but nice to have.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference and makes everything so much more smooth and blended.</li>
            <li>It works to clean up makeup lines though.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the wait, and they&#x27;re also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>maybe I could clean my tiles with them if I were</li>
            <li>i am in love c: , it took about a month to get here but other than that i am extremely happy with this , i will be coming back to buy more !</li>
            <li>These are totally different than the original Beauty Blender, but still a good makeup tool.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special , I&#x27;ve been doing makeup for years</li>
            <li>That thing went right into the trash!</li>
            <li>Great shipping came before expected</li>
            <li>Works great shippin was faster then expected</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and never fails it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think that something so simple would work correctly no matter the quality, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good beauty blender, don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li>Its cool...</li>
            <li>this is okay, it picks up some product but not as much as I would like...</li>
            <li>Come on, is the most economic sponge ever, what are you expecting??</li>
            <li>Not too good for smaller areas like eyes</li>
            <li>and this is such a good deal.</li>
            <li>so they  will last me a good wile</li>
            <li>Definitely a cheap find and worth it.</li>
            <li>If you use it to take the place of your hands or brush in that scenario you get the problem of the sponge absorbing most of what you are applying</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of an optional part of your beauty toolkit as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>The good things about this makeup blender are that its actually bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this blender.</li>
            <li>full coverage.</li>
            <li>The good thing about this product is that it was only a dollar</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and it helps you get full coverage of your make up.</li>
            <li>If you do not want to pay for a beauty blender (like myself), I recommend just paying 4 dollars more and going to ulta and buying the real techniques complexion sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad quality</li>
            <li>It was not bad.</li>
            <li>wish is grow in water like the beauty blender but not bad</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>even though this isnt the original beauty blender it isnt worth it.</li>
            <li>Took awhile to receive but other than that it was great product.</li>
            <li>I use a mild bar soap and you can wash it and squeeze it</li>
            <li>It delivered quickly too</li>
            <li>Still, better than some and ok if you&#x27;re just starting to use makeup.  </li>
            <li>Great little makeup blender so worth the price!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not so special that it&#x27;s worth waiting over a month for to be shipped from China.</li>
            <li>This is like a magic little thing,I love it:)</li>
            <li>Product as described long shipping time but the price is good.</li>
            <li>Very useful, blends pretty well</li>
            <li>Be warned, mine smelled really funky, like a strong plastic odor, when I received them.</li>
            <li>Makeup Blender arrived quick but the sponge had a distinct odor and no matter what I did</li>
            <li>It is cheap and nice, but just took long time on shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, I love it so much !</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have the original, so i don&#x27;t have a comparison, but this works fine for me as just a normal makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>When this thing finally dies, I&#x27;ll be getting another for sure!</li>
            <li>First off took about a month to get here!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to do!</li>
            <li>All in all pretty comparable to the Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more!</li>
            <li>A good dupes would feel light, and as you squeeze you would feel there is less foam in the core.</li>
            <li>But i fine it makes my hands and face smell like latex which is why I don&#x27;t really reach for it.</li>
            <li>Great sponge for the price, shipping too a little while</li>
            <li>Though it works great, it sucks up make up too quickly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;For something so cheap, there isn&#x27;t much complain or praise one can offer.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product for the price.</li>
            <li>only good thing I can say about this product is that it arrived extremely fast.</li>
            <li>, I feel like applying with my fingers works better, but my 28 year old niece loves it and uses hers every day.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it for then</li>
            <li>Not even worth the price it has..</li>
            <li>This is really useful in blending liquid makeups.</li>
            <li>Really absorbed the soap &amp; water when washed.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t expand when wet, but blends really good.</li>
            <li>Then recently I ended up buying three because k liked them and shipping</li>
            <li>This sponge is pretty freaking sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitey worth</li>
            <li>Shipping took a while, but It was well worth it.</li>
            <li>then i expected but they workpretty good.</li>
            <li>It came on time, but is kind of a waste… I only used it once.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soooo worth it.</li>
            <li>but when I used it it just absorbed all of the product.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think the dupe was worth it</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>She liked it but commented that it was smaller than the one she uses that she bought from Avon.  </li>
            <li>Worth the wait for shipping.</li>
            <li>love this product it blends so effortlessly, and the sponge material is so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>shape is useful.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expanded when wet but did a good job blending.</li>
            <li>Useful.</li>
            <li>Shipping does take a while, but it&#x27;s well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It just absorbed my makeup.</li>
            <li>took a while to get here but worth it</li>
            <li>it was worth it.</li>
            <li>the other ones are more spongier but this one has more firmness to it.</li>
            <li>Small, but works nicely and very cheap</li>
            <li>When I bought this thinking it was the real deal, I was excited.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much harsher than the original beauty blender.  </li>
            <li>While the blender doesn&#x27;t expand like the original BB, it is made of quite a soft material as well as no odor as other buyers seem to have experienced.</li>
            <li>The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t expect item right away</li>
            <li>and it was the right call.</li>
            <li>The product in general is great the only aging is shipping</li>
            <li>U get what u pay for pretty much this one I got suck!!</li>
            <li>Great material that holds up even after a few of my monthly cleanings, I will order again!</li>
            <li>I Use It Everyday And Loving It !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small but it&#x27;s a great size to keep in its ziplock plastic pouch and take with you in your purse for touch ups throughout the day if needed.</li>
            <li>Great blender but just a tad bit small</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out because I thought it would be good but its not :/</li>
            <li>I seriously do not think a sponge is worth $15 despite the advertised &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; properties of the BB; it&#x27;s a sponge!</li>
            <li>and i am in love ,way better than the little foundation sponge squares,and made my application a breeze</li>
            <li>Good quality, well I braved for its arrival based on a previous reviewer who bought them.  </li>
            <li>think this probably isn&#x27;t as good as the beauty blender, but it&#x27;s seriouly changed my makeup game for the better.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, but if you want it fast don&#x27;t get standard</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a flawless application of your foundation, spend the extra money on the original beauty blender and you will know what I mean.  </li>
            <li>But this pink one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Everything was as expected i love it !</li>
            <li>THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST RECEIVED ORDER</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the original for a small fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>Just a normal sponge, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I use dish soap and olive oil to clean it and leaves it looking like brand new.</li>
            <li>The difficult part for me was learning how to use the sponges for the best results.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>First I use a stippling brush</li>
            <li>Perfect for blending and applying it has a pointier tip so its easier to reach corners of the eye etc really helpful and useful plus its a dollar fifty you cant go wrong</li>
            <li>Love this ordering a second one 👍</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that it doesn&#x27;t expand or enlarge at all.  </li>
            <li>but I threw this one out the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was my first time using it 😀</li>
            <li>Thanks china!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Very squishy!</li>
            <li>Love the shape and size - actually like it much better than one I had purchased at a local store.</li>
            <li>and it has a funny smell to it.</li>
            <li>but overall I love it.</li>
            <li>But the price is a bit unreasonable in my opinion because I&#x27;ve seen the price $15 when it first came out.</li>
            <li>I have used the BB for about a year now, and am absolutely in love with it, but this product has stopped short.</li>
            <li>First off they forgot to send it</li>
            <li>blends really well!</li>
            <li>First off, this took about 2 months to get here.</li>
            <li>Hot here on time</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Not as big and more dense than I would&#x27;ve wanted it but for the price I cannot complain.</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>I ordered it the first week of December</li>
            <li>it really works no lie!</li>
            <li>I like the shape of this makeup sponge as you can really get under your eyes with it!</li>
            <li>exactly as the picture</li>
            <li>but it absolutely was!</li>
            <li>what exactly is this made of if it can&#x27;t soak up and retain atleast some water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size is exactly as you see it on your screen and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the description</li>
            <li>When I first saw these I thought... whatever.  </li>
            <li>Many people don&#x27;t know how to use them properly.</li>
            <li>I finally got mine after a month, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was promised.</li>
            <li>easy to use, good quality, but difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>Almost exactly like the beauty blender</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the wait because they&#x27;re so much cheaper than retail stores and sites</li>
            <li>its ok it doesn&#x27;t blend any better than my usual blending sponge</li>
            <li>This product is perfect and is the same as the more expensive brands...</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I recently bought another makeup blender at Charlotte Russe for $5.00, and it works much better than the one I bought from here.</li>
            <li>Exactly how it was decribed on site</li>
            <li>After I bought my first</li>
            <li>Still wprks grest, but just isnt as firm support wise</li>
            <li>Took kind of a long time to get here but it is super soft and squishy.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind it takes a while to dry after use, but since i dont wear makeup everyday its perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far from the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definition not as soft as the original puff tool, it&#x27;s too dense!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>and i love it its kinda small but blends my makeup very well :)</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as big as I thought it would be , but overall it works just fine . :)</li>
            <li>If you get it completely wet then squeeze the water out and squeeze it again in a dry towel, it distributes the makeup evenly and beautifully.</li>
            <li>That pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>Also, for as long as it took to reach me in the U.S., I would have been better off buying a sponge at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>If you want something that really works though, splurge and buy the real one!</li>
            <li>This blender had a really off smell when I first opened, almost like hamster urine (I raise hamsters that is how I know,</li>
            <li>It gave me amazing, natural coverage with no streaks like a flat foundation brush does.</li>
            <li>This most definitely NOT the same thing as the original beauty blender.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb the water quickly however if sprayed directly on the sponge from the spouse</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought, It&#x27;s cheep, easy to use</li>
            <li>And it blends everything nicely, but it has  this slight rubber smell, and it didn&#x27;t expand under water like the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mini, I like it better dry.</li>
            <li>All things considered though, we are putting the makeup on and not the sponge, so it will likely be fine.</li>
            <li>And it Came at my first expected delivery date! :)</li>
            <li>Pretty decent sponge -</li>
            <li>Again, it is actually a very high quality makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints so far, also its pretty cheep!</li>
            <li>Cheap cheap don&#x27;t buy, waste of money</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this, but you have to use it what it was meant for, and basically it doesn&#x27;t really do that much</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY nothing like a beauty blender.</li>
            <li>The product does work very well</li>
            <li>Its notthing like he real bb.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Or just go buy the real deal.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t really mastered the use of the sponge</li>
            <li>it really makes a difference in your makeup</li>
            <li>And i got it so much cheaper</li>
            <li>So fast.</li>
            <li>and I know it&#x27;s probably nothing like the $20 one, but I can&#x27;t see myself spending $20 on this in real life</li>
            <li>it absorbs to much makeup</li>
            <li>Like this item got it for my blush, works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>&amp; i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Took absolutely FOREVER to get this.</li>
            <li>Can not compare to the real beauty blender.  </li>
            <li>I got a real techniques one instead.</li>
            <li>better than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t expand under water like the beauty blender does, but I found that It still worked really well.</li>
            <li>I think that this for the price, it is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It feels just like the real beauty blender but for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>but yah I really like it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and the blenders do what they are supposed</li>
            <li>This is very doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li>No mater how much you add water, it does not expand.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this again and instead suck it up and spend the money for the real thing.</li>
            <li>very well it gets in your crease</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>just like the real one</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have thought about what it is made with when I ordered it, and YOU really should too</li>
            <li>I may not know a whole lot about make up</li>
            <li>Better quality than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>If you think this is comparable to the beauty blender or real techniques sponge its not.</li>
            <li>It took forever to get to here but for a whole buck fifty</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see too much difference from this tool and a drug store cosmetics sponges.</li>
            <li>eh, didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb water very well</li>
            <li>Not the real deal, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>This product takes FOREVER to receive but it works just like the real thing.</li>
            <li>And I really like it</li>
            <li>Item as described, Fast Shipping, A++++</li>
            <li>it blends everything VERY well.</li>
            <li>Invest in the real product, the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>these are absolutely fantastic for blending, especially in uses of stage makeup foundation application</li>
            <li>It stays the size (which is VERY tiny).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the color pink.</li>
            <li>The beauty blender doubles in size by absorbing water like a sponge</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water but for the price</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product really soft and blends my makeup in really well totally recommend it to people.</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>i had to wait to much for it</li>
            <li>I use too much  product than with a brush.</li>
            <li>I use this blender to apply my concealer and it works really well</li>
            <li>It has given me the confidence to try some of the YouTube tutorials i have watched, and I have accomplished.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work at all and are too tiny to fit in your hands.</li>
            <li>I also feel like no matter how much I moisten it</li>
            <li>It gets the job done ok the only thing I wish it was a little more softer other then that its ok sponge.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>soaks up more product than it puts on your face, i would rather save my money and buy a real beauty blender than this or other knockoffs</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, much thicker than my other ones but works pretty well</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>its an okay product besides the fact that it broke me out terribly other than that</li>
            <li>Only difference from original is the size.</li>
            <li>Took well over two months to arrive but work the same as the original bb that cists $20</li>
            <li>I have not used it enough yet, but it feels pretty firm, good quality</li>
            <li>Very strong smell and was tore up with chunks missing when I got it.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is worth the purchase as long as you know how to use it the right way.</li>
            <li>it feels super nice, only complain would be that for a $2 product I ordered it sept. 26 and received it oct. 20 almost a month later way too long of a wait.</li>
            <li>well (better than the average drugstore triangle sponge), but it also absorbs a lot of product.</li>
            <li>Pretty soft.</li>
            <li>Nice and small.  </li>
            <li>Short and sweet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s honestly just way too small to take on that job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for small areas like around the eyes and nose</li>
            <li>Works ok for that, but it was not useful for the purpose I bought it for... Applying makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take to long to clean either which I do every other day using African black soap which I have found to be the best for cleaning these sponges.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the one that I bought at target, once I started using this one it started to pile a little bit after multiple uses.</li>
            <li>I already ordered a new one !</li>
            <li>Loved this beauty blender and it was so cheap but works the same exact way an expensive one would work</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of hard but does the job, not as much bounce as the beauty blender, but for the price it does what is&#x27;s supposed  to do.</li>
            <li>hard to clean but easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>I gave it a one star because it&#x27;s super tiny.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this beauty blender mainly because of the quality.</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose, but I would go with a different &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; or the actual beauty blender for better performance.</li>
            <li>but it did a decent job at smoothing out my foundation.</li>
            <li>Love it the only downfall is just how tiny it is</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really as bouncy and like soft as the real bb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as soft as the regular beauty blender, doesn&#x27;t blend the makeup as smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most of the pads and sponges I used before tend to feel rough.</li>
            <li>so I was excited, but when I used it I was like I waited this long for this...</li>
            <li>Blends well, but not sure how you&#x27;re supposed to clean it!?!</li>
            <li>Good price but very hard</li>
            <li>HIGHLY dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>4 stars only because it took a while to ship but other than that it had very good coverage and worked very well with A little water added</li>
            <li>You can wet it just like the Beauty Blender and it will blend just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obviously not the REAL beauty blender , the one that&#x27;s $20!!</li>
            <li>which I like a little better.</li>
            <li>Good for the price, just took a little long to receive.</li>
            <li>Beauty Blenders, cheap or not, are supposed to expand when wet...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and works very well.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought but worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>And the $5 pricetag isn&#x27;t competitive enough to make it worth your wait.</li>
            <li>Feels firm and I like it better than the one I had before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more round than that</li>
            <li>It will put some of your colorful makeup on next time you try to finish your foundation</li>
            <li>I normally pay $5 for these</li>
            <li>If you have the extra money for the beauty blender this product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was kind of slow</li>
            <li>Not huge like many I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Their very soft but yet kind of hard.</li>
            <li>For $8 dollars less, it&#x27;s a steal! :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard at all, makes me question if people are using it correctly...</li>
            <li>If they actually did what a beauty blender does right?</li>
            <li>I have to buy a new one every so often.</li>
            <li>The new it thing , this sponge does wonders ❤</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to wait months for a new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I expected but will for sure get the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I had expected, but it sure does the job well.</li>
            <li>Its very soft and just what i was looking for..</li>
            <li>Was very surprised, was looking for comparisons to the beauty blender and found this.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>I little smaller than expected , but works great</li>
            <li>Very good, very fluffy and pretty tough, it is antiallergic material.</li>
            <li>Pretty solid too.</li>
            <li>You will have to wait a long time for delivery but worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more in other shapes and colors.</li>
            <li>Cute, small , soft and affordable!</li>
            <li>It  makes your skin look so natural!</li>
            <li>First of all, they are tiny size, The pic is deceiving.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer that to a real beauty blender!</li>
            <li>reviewers have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t expand when wet, that is true.</li>
            <li>The actual sponge works fine, but the shipping took a long time!</li>
            <li>The size allows me to have a firm grip on the sponge and also makes it easy to store in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Not as soft but does the exact same thing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a waste of money considering its dirt cheap but it took over a month to arrive, it&#x27;s just not worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected but easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous little sponge.</li>
            <li>The price is great, but the blending is a little hard and the sponge is not as soft as name brand ones.</li>
            <li>Its firmer and less porous compared to the original</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard but it does an okay job I still use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great as the beauty blender, the sponge was harsh and rough even wet.</li>
            <li>Clearly.</li>
            <li>At least it was a cheap experiment!</li>
            <li>It is really tiny and when you went and soak in water like the real beauty blender it doesn&#x27;t puff up not absorb the water</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s not made for mature (50 year old) skin.</li>
            <li>Now where near the  beauty  blender.</li>
            <li>, It did not increase in size or get soft.</li>
            <li>This is no where near as quality as the beauty blender, or even just a knockoff beauty blender from walmart</li>
            <li>but it sure sucks up your makeup.</li>
            <li>do not waste your time or money</li>
            <li>Save yourself the heartache and get the Real techniques sponge if you&#x27;re looking to find something similar to the beauty blender without having to break the bank.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even feel soft at all.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s seems bigger in the picture than in real life.</li>
            <li>I have bought a few beauty blender dupes for cheap before and this one is a dud.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>its so tiny and it works very well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get soft when you put water on it</li>
            <li>I thought that it was a soft sponge not a rubber sponge......</li>
            <li>Let me just start by saying you have to wait a pretty long time for this item.</li>
            <li>This is not like a real beauty blender because it is not as porous and you do not get the same finish.</li>
            <li>Even after wetting it, it didn&#x27;t seem to expand or get soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft and durable sponge.</li>
            <li>I have only used so called dupes so can&#x27;t really compare it to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product if you are looking for the same function that the real Beauty Blender provides.</li>
            <li>Is perfect To put your base on</li>
            <li>I did, however, notice that using this sponge makes my foundation go a bit patchy around my mouth but a little buffing in with a flat top brush</li>
            <li>and I did not want to pay the full price for a Beauty Blender so for less then 2 bucks I decided to try this one out.</li>
            <li>And thought it was flat not circular the whole way around.</li>
            <li>I ran it under cold, hot, and warm water, and still nothing happened.</li>
            <li>My only tip would be to get the sponge wet, like run it under cool water and squeeze it like 15 times, then put a towel around it and squeeze again.</li>
            <li>I think this is a decent product for only a dollar fifty.</li>
            <li>Im not sure if its because is not an original beauty blender , but the sponge is kinda hard and it took more than a month to arrive</li>
            <li>It took a long time to get here but other than that it applys smoothly and keeps my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Not soft like the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li>This sponge is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first beauty blender, and isn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>But after previously buying many other sponges I&#x27;m rather in between on the quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed it several times and the texture is still just like new.</li>
            <li>The only problem very delayed shipments from the rest only !!!</li>
            <li>The real Beauty Blender might be better but is quite expensive.</li>
            <li>I was little let down because I thought  I was getting two different kind</li>
            <li>On the matter of this beauty blender being firm, it feels pretty solid and does not have much give to it.</li>
            <li>no more messy fingures and it covers very well, better then my brushes.</li>
            <li>I usually use the original beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>I have got several good beauty blenders and a few dud ones in the past.</li>
            <li>The sponge is a bit small but I  like that because it makes it extra easy to get my under eye concealer blended.</li>
            <li>I figured I was going to get a decent, run-of-the-mill makeup sponge that would be a little better than the wedge-shaped ones that come in a big pack for a few bucks.</li>
            <li>Great product, Its just the shipping thats bad</li>
            <li>I watch a lot of make up tutorials on youtube and people are generally raving about it.</li>
            <li>Water barely changes its size and density.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>As you add water, this expand double and get soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I know that because this cost 99 cents I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much from this product, but hey, I wanted to give it a go.</li>
            <li>I personally do not like it because to me, it doesn&#x27;t apply the makeup as seamlessly as I thought it would (or as I&#x27;ve been hearing).</li>
            <li>A lot harder then real beauty blender, doesn&#x27;t mix in makeup as well as the BB</li>
            <li>It is not very soft, it absorbs more makeup than it applies and it is very small.</li>
            <li>A friend has the $20 version and she said that hers is a little bit more dense, but these little ~$1.50 guys get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Other name brand have the same exact thing, but sell them for 20 dollars.  </li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s super small.</li>
            <li>this is really hard not like the original one</li>
            <li>I gave it one star because it looks like the real thing other than that it does not work.</li>
            <li>was it took a whole month to get here but other than that prefect</li>
            <li>its soft yet firm very durable</li>
            <li>It was fun to try a few but out of the three different brands I purchased, none of them worked.</li>
            <li>As a newbie to the contouring and blending thing, I think this little guy works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>this little beauty does it all, and it holds up really well!</li>
            <li>Not only did I barely receive this product in February.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the product is worth all the hype it receives in the beauty community</li>
            <li>so hope you&#x27;re not in a rush), and it was very helpful in getting my blending technique down.  </li>
            <li>seriously just stuck on to the sponge instead of blending on my face like an original beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Its super hard and takes foreverrrrrr to arrived.</li>
            <li>and it was super Hard</li>
            <li>Too stiff and broke the first day.</li>
            <li>It was rubber like what you would use on ur feet I would never use on my face not sure I got the right thing</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;m now supposed to use this (unsanitary) sponge on my clean face?  </li>
            <li>Its a bit on the very sturdy less spongey side</li>
            <li>But I was ready to order another one when I saw this less than 2 bucks Makeup Blender and decided to buy 5 which I thought would still be cheaper than one BB.</li>
            <li>The sponge is very comparable to the &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; and gives the same effect but will a very different price, on the other hand after a few uses the very tip of mine</li>
            <li>This little sponge really does work, and for a buck, who could complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other thing I like about this is that I think it&#x27;s very durable and will last a long time (definitely a plus).</li>
            <li>It also soaked up an huge amount of foundation that didn&#x27;t make it on my skin, which was frustrating, because I felt like I was wasting a ton of product.</li>

            <li> This is amazing</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I kind thought they would be softer</li>
            <li> When I received the BB it was packaged nicely but when I opened it, the blenders had a fish smell &amp; I washed them and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> I thought that for the price ($1.19) that it would be a nice dupe.</li>
            <li> It blends nicely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good, I would order it again :)</li>
            <li> it blends soo perfectly nice.</li>

            <li> Well works really good love it</li>
            <li> All I own now.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Tricky to blend with your brush kind of places</li>
            <li> It leaves my foundation looking flawless and the pointy part works really well for the under eye area.</li>
            <li> That way, the foundation can settle in nicely.</li>
            <li> it kind of smell like rubber</li>
            <li> Nice foundation applicator.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it is a great dupe for the beauty blender at a great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> Not to use with face paint but for makeup is nice.</li>
            <li> it is nice quality though.</li>
            <li> very nice sponge for blending makeup lightly.</li>
            <li> AWESOME QUALITY AND SUPER CHEAP &amp; CUTE !</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this sponge based on the great reviews and it sucked.</li>

            <li> Very cool!  </li>
            <li> The bright color makes it easy to find in your cosmetics bag.</li>
            <li> Love love this one!</li>
            <li> Love this idem and bought one for my Mom!  :)</li>
            <li> i would love it even more!</li>
            <li> This is the best beauty blender ive bought so far!</li>
            <li> the replica of the original one wich is 20 $ more great item</li>
            <li> And very good price girls or guys should really buy.</li>
            <li> So far the best make up blender</li>
            <li> Soft, works perfect!</li>
            <li> nice to be able to come to turkey cargo.</li>
            <li> I order this product and I totally enjoy using this , it works good.</li>
            <li> Love the color blends amazing</li>
            <li> but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I use it to blend in my concealer and it&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s not as soft as the beauty blender</li>
            <li> i really love this beauty blender its amazing</li>
            <li> the price is great and it came in right on time .</li>
            <li> great blender fits right in my hand</li>
            <li> I love love love this beauty blender!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this!</li>
            <li> A great and smooth blender, very useful for ladies .</li>
            <li> Great for the price, and it works exactly how I thought it would.</li>
            <li> However, this was very smooth.</li>
            <li> The original beauty blender is very soft and when you run it under water, it absorbs water which makes your make up application flawless.</li>
            <li> this is more of like the sponge that you would find it a sponge pit that you would jump into.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it on here instead of $10 at a make up store.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this sponge.</li>
            <li> This makeup blender is okay</li>
            <li> It was okay ..</li>
            <li> It does apply it evenly and helps make the makeup more pigmented.</li>
            <li> I would repurchase! :)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I use it every day. :)</li>
            <li> The product was cute</li>
            <li> this one has to be my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> Need to order more.</li>
            <li> Cute and compact.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> Practice makes perfect, but I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> These are ok</li>
            <li> Just okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I found without a doubt that a stipple brush blends in your foundation better and more evenly.</li>
            <li> but it does the job just damp it more.</li>
            <li> The item is ok for the price</li>
            <li> they sell these at any fashion store for more than $5.</li>
            <li> Ive bought the $20 ones, the $15 ones, but this one has been my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better at applying concealer under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with them and have given a couple away as gifts.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love them I got 2 of them</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It does help apply makeup on your face better than face hand and fingers.</li>
            <li> PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> So about 9 months back I bought one of these and thought it was awesome!</li>

            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve come across better sponges</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> then that it was okay,</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for a very low price.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok .</li>
            <li> its okay</li>
            <li> but i was hoping it would be better than it was.</li>
            <li> Love these for the price.</li>
            <li> Its ok doesn&#x27;t blend well in my opinion.shipping</li>
            <li> Love the shape.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> this one is way better</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve evened it out a lot with your fingers you can blend it some more with a brush.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll end up wasting a lot of product as well as saturating the sponge so you&#x27;ll have to throw it out more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Just trying to get you to spend more money.  </li>
            <li> but I felt like most of my foundation was sucked up in this rather then on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> but, for the price I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this blender.</li>
            <li> i love these i use them on my makeup kit</li>
            <li> and i love them</li>
            <li> and they so affordable that i can buy many of them for my client</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a beauty blender but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like...</li>
            <li> Still ok for $1 though.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ll need to try it out a bit more and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not upset by this purchase, more than I am about the reviews.</li>
            <li> Better off with the orange sponge from technique that i got from ulta.</li>
            <li> Love how the foundation comes out from just dabbing.</li>
            <li> I love the even and lightweight finish I get with the blender.  </li>
            <li> I love it, will be ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li> Love this applicator.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> it gives a more matte finish, which is what I want.</li>
            <li> really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it was ok for the price.</li>
            <li> now that i know more about these.</li>
            <li> but im sure it can be washed</li>
            <li> Did what I wanted and more.</li>
            <li> I will order much more from them</li>
            <li> So I did a search and found the $1.50 version :)  </li>
            <li> But for $20 I would have had a TON of complaints!  :)</li>
            <li> Love love this product .</li>
            <li> Okay makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> this is an okay blender.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but others compared it to Beauty Blender... not even close.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the BB for more than 2 years now</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad i tried it,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok but not what I thought it was</li>
            <li> Love this tool for smoothing out makeup</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and is a MUST!</li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Im just in love with this</li>
            <li> Love it for the price</li>
            <li> really helps apply liquid foundation very nicely.</li>
            <li> Makes blending much easier!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the sponge, very light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This BB is pretty good :3</li>
            <li> I recommend thoroughly rinsing it with warm water and soap to clean it of its smell (and sanitize it), before you use</li>
            <li> Ok ive ordered  over 5 different blenders and this 1 works just as good fast and blends flawless</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s pretty straightforward lol).</li>
            <li> I would say that this does not work like the Beauty Blender but is still a pretty good cosmetic sponge.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good to blend the foundation</li>
            <li> However, it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> They are GORGEOUS and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> and it went on flawlessy, actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> but it was well worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait !!</li>
            <li> I have dry patches but this sponge makes my face look flawless</li>
            <li> Easy to wash and actually a cute makeup accessory.</li>
            <li> Great for blending foundation and getting a nice sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> I love pink and putting on make up,this is perfect.</li>
            <li> i love how it blends my foundation in smoothly..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap sponge,had to go to Sephora for a smoother softer feel,makeup goes on better with a pricy one</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Blends perfectly with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> is more comparable to cheap sponges that you can buy at drugstores.</li>
            <li> But for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much, so 2 stars for fair pricing.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely baffled about the good reviews.</li>
            <li> i think its good f use for contour though i dont use it much ..</li>
            <li> Not as good as the real beauty blender(doesn&#x27;t absorb water nor expand)</li>
            <li> Glad I went with this first!!</li>
            <li> its not the right kind of sponge</li>
            <li> It arrived in a beat up package due to USPS error, but the product is perfect.</li>
            <li> But, the other side is still working great!</li>
            <li> This was a cool buy!  </li>
            <li> Shipping took a while but other than that I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing is so cool!  </li>
            <li> Easy to get up close in those crevasses.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the origninal Beauty Blender, but they are great for my use; and I love the price.</li>
            <li> easy to blend with this without messing anything else up.</li>
            <li> Its blends around the eye area easily</li>
            <li> Easy to apply make up</li>
            <li> You can build coverage easily and it works well with my thicker  concealer  </li>
            <li> Easily to use foundation now.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly &amp; easy to wash</li>
            <li> love it :) worth the money</li>
            <li> It is not as easy because the shape of it</li>
            <li> (and it smelled like extremely strong chemicals when it arrived and even after I washed it) into the trash it goes..</li>
            <li> Super cute, super good, super cheap</li>
            <li> I liked it very much...</li>
            <li> absolutely love this never have used the actually real beauty blender and don&#x27;t feel the need to this works just fine and does the job perfect totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light weight, and easily cleanable.</li>
            <li> These work just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> IT WORKS EXTREMELY FINE FOR WHAT YOU PAID FOR.  </li>
            <li> Works fine for the money you paid.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fine too.</li>
            <li> This little guy works great!  </li>
            <li> Little in size but does the job, I am very impressed with this product for the price that I have paid for!😍</li>
            <li> love it soooooo much!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even soak up any water so it never get moist to smooth out brush lines.</li>
            <li> Just invest the money in a bb, it will be worth it :)</li>
            <li> Because no beauty blender is gonna be this cheap.</li>
            <li> I use Maybelline fit me foundation</li>
            <li> It applies my foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li> Kinda Cheap</li>
            <li> Not the real material for makeup sponges but still works nicely</li>
            <li> It was okay, it was worth the $2</li>
            <li> it has pieces that flake off it, does not leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Cheap and functional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Dirt cheap.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price and thinking if buying more.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a cheap price for the product...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in search of a cheap, alternative to the BB, I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> &amp; I enjoy my product.</li>
            <li> The surface will be smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> It looks like the beauty blender but most certainly is worth what you pay.</li>
            <li> now that i tried this cheap 1</li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive but it works great then the regular sponge.</li>
            <li> I can just wash it, reuse it, and it doesn&#x27;t peel off like the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> The item works great blending and is equal to my dermablend one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I got this knowing that it was cheap and that it wasn&#x27;t going to be the beauty blender</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the price.</li>
            <li> Sponge not that cheap foam.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t clean as easy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a 50/50 chance you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Cheap and couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> but I do enjoy the results I achieve with this product.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap</li>
            <li> This helps smooth out your makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made, it feels like a rubber ball and do not blend my makeup out.</li>
            <li> Literally laughed out loud when I read this</li>
            <li> I love beauty blenders and I was glad to find this in for a much cheaper price than the original at sephora for $20.</li>
            <li> for the price, good.  not typical beauty blender, though.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I can say that it blended and contoured quickly and easily</li>
            <li> it applies my makeup with even coverage and is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> not like the original.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t swell and absorb like the original beauty blender but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Now, I know it&#x27;s not the original one which is 20 bucks, but I wanted to try a cheaper version first.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> So far I love it as it helps smooth out foundation and gives a more even appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this to the original beauty blender because I have it.</li>
            <li> It also does not sponge up like the original beauty blender</li>
            <li> Excited to start using.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend 35$ on another  the original Beauty blender</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t spend like the original bb....</li>
            <li> You get what you&#x27;re paying for basically and for two dollars I&#x27;m not extremely disappointed,  however, I will not repurchase this</li>
            <li> I do not have the original beauty blender so nothing to compare this to, but this does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> If you have the original beauty blender you would understand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just buy another original beauty blender instead.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that I have ever used, so I don&#x27;t know if there is suppose to be something magical about this product or not.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever believe that this is comparable to the original Beauty Blender (BB).</li>
            <li> I just received my Makeup Blender after ordering it a month ago and was excited to try my inexpensive makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use it</li>
            <li> I love this little thing its great for blending</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something I can&#x27;t live without but nice to have.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference and makes everything so much more smooth and blended.</li>
            <li> It works to clean up makeup lines though.</li>
            <li> Very much worth the wait, and they&#x27;re also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> maybe I could clean my tiles with them if I were</li>
            <li> i am in love c: , it took about a month to get here but other than that i am extremely happy with this , i will be coming back to buy more !</li>
            <li> These are totally different than the original Beauty Blender, but still a good makeup tool.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special , I&#x27;ve been doing makeup for years</li>
            <li> That thing went right into the trash!</li>
            <li> Great shipping came before expected</li>
            <li> Works great shippin was faster then expected</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and never fails it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that something so simple would work correctly no matter the quality, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good beauty blender, don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> Its cool...</li>
            <li> this is okay, it picks up some product but not as much as I would like...</li>
            <li> Come on, is the most economic sponge ever, what are you expecting??</li>
            <li> Not too good for smaller areas like eyes</li>
            <li> and this is such a good deal.</li>
            <li> so they  will last me a good wile</li>
            <li> Definitely a cheap find and worth it.</li>
            <li> If you use it to take the place of your hands or brush in that scenario you get the problem of the sponge absorbing most of what you are applying</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of an optional part of your beauty toolkit as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> The good things about this makeup blender are that its actually bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this blender.</li>
            <li> full coverage.</li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that it was only a dollar</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and it helps you get full coverage of your make up.</li>
            <li> If you do not want to pay for a beauty blender (like myself), I recommend just paying 4 dollars more and going to ulta and buying the real techniques complexion sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad quality</li>
            <li> It was not bad.</li>
            <li> wish is grow in water like the beauty blender but not bad</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> even though this isnt the original beauty blender it isnt worth it.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to receive but other than that it was great product.</li>
            <li> I use a mild bar soap and you can wash it and squeeze it</li>
            <li> It delivered quickly too</li>
            <li> Still, better than some and ok if you&#x27;re just starting to use makeup.  </li>
            <li> Great little makeup blender so worth the price!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not so special that it&#x27;s worth waiting over a month for to be shipped from China.</li>
            <li> This is like a magic little thing,I love it:)</li>
            <li> Product as described long shipping time but the price is good.</li>
            <li> Very useful, blends pretty well</li>
            <li> Be warned, mine smelled really funky, like a strong plastic odor, when I received them.</li>
            <li> Makeup Blender arrived quick but the sponge had a distinct odor and no matter what I did</li>
            <li> It is cheap and nice, but just took long time on shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, I love it so much !</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have the original, so i don&#x27;t have a comparison, but this works fine for me as just a normal makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> When this thing finally dies, I&#x27;ll be getting another for sure!</li>
            <li> First off took about a month to get here!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to do!</li>
            <li> All in all pretty comparable to the Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> A good dupes would feel light, and as you squeeze you would feel there is less foam in the core.</li>
            <li> But i fine it makes my hands and face smell like latex which is why I don&#x27;t really reach for it.</li>
            <li> Great sponge for the price, shipping too a little while</li>
            <li> Though it works great, it sucks up make up too quickly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;For something so cheap, there isn&#x27;t much complain or praise one can offer.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product for the price.</li>
            <li> only good thing I can say about this product is that it arrived extremely fast.</li>
            <li> , I feel like applying with my fingers works better, but my 28 year old niece loves it and uses hers every day.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it for then</li>
            <li> Not even worth the price it has..</li>
            <li> This is really useful in blending liquid makeups.</li>
            <li> Really absorbed the soap &amp; water when washed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t expand when wet, but blends really good.</li>
            <li> Then recently I ended up buying three because k liked them and shipping</li>
            <li> This sponge is pretty freaking sweet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitey worth</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while, but It was well worth it.</li>
            <li> then i expected but they workpretty good.</li>
            <li> It came on time, but is kind of a waste… I only used it once.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soooo worth it.</li>
            <li> but when I used it it just absorbed all of the product.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think the dupe was worth it</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> She liked it but commented that it was smaller than the one she uses that she bought from Avon.  </li>
            <li> Worth the wait for shipping.</li>
            <li> love this product it blends so effortlessly, and the sponge material is so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> shape is useful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expanded when wet but did a good job blending.</li>
            <li> Useful.</li>
            <li> Shipping does take a while, but it&#x27;s well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It just absorbed my makeup.</li>
            <li> took a while to get here but worth it</li>
            <li> it was worth it.</li>
            <li> the other ones are more spongier but this one has more firmness to it.</li>
            <li> Small, but works nicely and very cheap</li>
            <li> When I bought this thinking it was the real deal, I was excited.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much harsher than the original beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> While the blender doesn&#x27;t expand like the original BB, it is made of quite a soft material as well as no odor as other buyers seem to have experienced.</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t expect item right away</li>
            <li> and it was the right call.</li>
            <li> The product in general is great the only aging is shipping</li>
            <li> U get what u pay for pretty much this one I got suck!!</li>
            <li> Great material that holds up even after a few of my monthly cleanings, I will order again!</li>
            <li> I Use It Everyday And Loving It !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but it&#x27;s a great size to keep in its ziplock plastic pouch and take with you in your purse for touch ups throughout the day if needed.</li>
            <li> Great blender but just a tad bit small</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it out because I thought it would be good but its not :/</li>
            <li> I seriously do not think a sponge is worth $15 despite the advertised &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; properties of the BB; it&#x27;s a sponge!</li>
            <li> and i am in love ,way better than the little foundation sponge squares,and made my application a breeze</li>
            <li> Good quality, well I braved for its arrival based on a previous reviewer who bought them.  </li>
            <li> think this probably isn&#x27;t as good as the beauty blender, but it&#x27;s seriouly changed my makeup game for the better.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, but if you want it fast don&#x27;t get standard</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a flawless application of your foundation, spend the extra money on the original beauty blender and you will know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> But this pink one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected i love it !</li>
            <li> THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST RECEIVED ORDER</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as the original for a small fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Just a normal sponge, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I use dish soap and olive oil to clean it and leaves it looking like brand new.</li>
            <li> The difficult part for me was learning how to use the sponges for the best results.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> First I use a stippling brush</li>
            <li> Perfect for blending and applying it has a pointier tip so its easier to reach corners of the eye etc really helpful and useful plus its a dollar fifty you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> Love this ordering a second one 👍</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that it doesn&#x27;t expand or enlarge at all.  </li>
            <li> but I threw this one out the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was my first time using it 😀</li>
            <li> Thanks china!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Very squishy!</li>
            <li> Love the shape and size - actually like it much better than one I had purchased at a local store.</li>
            <li> and it has a funny smell to it.</li>
            <li> but overall I love it.</li>
            <li> But the price is a bit unreasonable in my opinion because I&#x27;ve seen the price $15 when it first came out.</li>
            <li> I have used the BB for about a year now, and am absolutely in love with it, but this product has stopped short.</li>
            <li> First off they forgot to send it</li>
            <li> blends really well!</li>
            <li> First off, this took about 2 months to get here.</li>
            <li> Hot here on time</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Not as big and more dense than I would&#x27;ve wanted it but for the price I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> I ordered it the first week of December</li>
            <li> it really works no lie!</li>
            <li> I like the shape of this makeup sponge as you can really get under your eyes with it!</li>
            <li> exactly as the picture</li>
            <li> but it absolutely was!</li>
            <li> what exactly is this made of if it can&#x27;t soak up and retain atleast some water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size is exactly as you see it on your screen and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like the description</li>
            <li> When I first saw these I thought... whatever.  </li>
            <li> Many people don&#x27;t know how to use them properly.</li>
            <li> I finally got mine after a month, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was promised.</li>
            <li> easy to use, good quality, but difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Almost exactly like the beauty blender</li>
            <li> It does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the wait because they&#x27;re so much cheaper than retail stores and sites</li>
            <li> its ok it doesn&#x27;t blend any better than my usual blending sponge</li>
            <li> This product is perfect and is the same as the more expensive brands...</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I recently bought another makeup blender at Charlotte Russe for $5.00, and it works much better than the one I bought from here.</li>
            <li> Exactly how it was decribed on site</li>
            <li> After I bought my first</li>
            <li> Still wprks grest, but just isnt as firm support wise</li>
            <li> Took kind of a long time to get here but it is super soft and squishy.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind it takes a while to dry after use, but since i dont wear makeup everyday its perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far from the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definition not as soft as the original puff tool, it&#x27;s too dense!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> and i love it its kinda small but blends my makeup very well :)</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as big as I thought it would be , but overall it works just fine . :)</li>
            <li> If you get it completely wet then squeeze the water out and squeeze it again in a dry towel, it distributes the makeup evenly and beautifully.</li>
            <li> That pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> Also, for as long as it took to reach me in the U.S., I would have been better off buying a sponge at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> If you want something that really works though, splurge and buy the real one!</li>
            <li> This blender had a really off smell when I first opened, almost like hamster urine (I raise hamsters that is how I know,</li>
            <li> It gave me amazing, natural coverage with no streaks like a flat foundation brush does.</li>
            <li> This most definitely NOT the same thing as the original beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb the water quickly however if sprayed directly on the sponge from the spouse</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought, It&#x27;s cheep, easy to use</li>
            <li> And it blends everything nicely, but it has  this slight rubber smell, and it didn&#x27;t expand under water like the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mini, I like it better dry.</li>
            <li> All things considered though, we are putting the makeup on and not the sponge, so it will likely be fine.</li>
            <li> And it Came at my first expected delivery date! :)</li>
            <li> Pretty decent sponge -</li>
            <li> Again, it is actually a very high quality makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints so far, also its pretty cheep!</li>
            <li> Cheap cheap don&#x27;t buy, waste of money</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like this, but you have to use it what it was meant for, and basically it doesn&#x27;t really do that much</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY nothing like a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> The product does work very well</li>
            <li> Its notthing like he real bb.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Or just go buy the real deal.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t really mastered the use of the sponge</li>
            <li> it really makes a difference in your makeup</li>
            <li> And i got it so much cheaper</li>
            <li> So fast.</li>
            <li> and I know it&#x27;s probably nothing like the $20 one, but I can&#x27;t see myself spending $20 on this in real life</li>
            <li> it absorbs to much makeup</li>
            <li> Like this item got it for my blush, works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> &amp; i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Took absolutely FOREVER to get this.</li>
            <li> Can not compare to the real beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> I got a real techniques one instead.</li>
            <li> better than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t expand under water like the beauty blender does, but I found that It still worked really well.</li>
            <li> I think that this for the price, it is reasonable.</li>
            <li> It feels just like the real beauty blender but for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> but yah I really like it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast and the blenders do what they are supposed</li>
            <li> This is very doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li> No mater how much you add water, it does not expand.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again and instead suck it up and spend the money for the real thing.</li>
            <li> very well it gets in your crease</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> just like the real one</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have thought about what it is made with when I ordered it, and YOU really should too</li>
            <li> I may not know a whole lot about make up</li>
            <li> Better quality than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> If you think this is comparable to the beauty blender or real techniques sponge its not.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get to here but for a whole buck fifty</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see too much difference from this tool and a drug store cosmetics sponges.</li>
            <li> eh, didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb water very well</li>
            <li> Not the real deal, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> This product takes FOREVER to receive but it works just like the real thing.</li>
            <li> And I really like it</li>
            <li> Item as described, Fast Shipping, A++++</li>
            <li> it blends everything VERY well.</li>
            <li> Invest in the real product, the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> these are absolutely fantastic for blending, especially in uses of stage makeup foundation application</li>
            <li> It stays the size (which is VERY tiny).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the color pink.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender doubles in size by absorbing water like a sponge</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water but for the price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product really soft and blends my makeup in really well totally recommend it to people.</li>
            <li> Thanks..</li>
            <li> i had to wait to much for it</li>
            <li> I use too much  product than with a brush.</li>
            <li> I use this blender to apply my concealer and it works really well</li>
            <li> It has given me the confidence to try some of the YouTube tutorials i have watched, and I have accomplished.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work at all and are too tiny to fit in your hands.</li>
            <li> I also feel like no matter how much I moisten it</li>
            <li> It gets the job done ok the only thing I wish it was a little more softer other then that its ok sponge.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> soaks up more product than it puts on your face, i would rather save my money and buy a real beauty blender than this or other knockoffs</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, much thicker than my other ones but works pretty well</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> its an okay product besides the fact that it broke me out terribly other than that</li>
            <li> Only difference from original is the size.</li>
            <li> Took well over two months to arrive but work the same as the original bb that cists $20</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough yet, but it feels pretty firm, good quality</li>
            <li> Very strong smell and was tore up with chunks missing when I got it.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is worth the purchase as long as you know how to use it the right way.</li>
            <li> it feels super nice, only complain would be that for a $2 product I ordered it sept. 26 and received it oct. 20 almost a month later way too long of a wait.</li>
            <li> well (better than the average drugstore triangle sponge), but it also absorbs a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Pretty soft.</li>
            <li> Nice and small.  </li>
            <li> Short and sweet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s honestly just way too small to take on that job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for small areas like around the eyes and nose</li>
            <li> Works ok for that, but it was not useful for the purpose I bought it for... Applying makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take to long to clean either which I do every other day using African black soap which I have found to be the best for cleaning these sponges.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the one that I bought at target, once I started using this one it started to pile a little bit after multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I already ordered a new one !</li>
            <li> Loved this beauty blender and it was so cheap but works the same exact way an expensive one would work</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of hard but does the job, not as much bounce as the beauty blender, but for the price it does what is&#x27;s supposed  to do.</li>
            <li> hard to clean but easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I gave it a one star because it&#x27;s super tiny.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this beauty blender mainly because of the quality.</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose, but I would go with a different &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; or the actual beauty blender for better performance.</li>
            <li> but it did a decent job at smoothing out my foundation.</li>
            <li> Love it the only downfall is just how tiny it is</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really as bouncy and like soft as the real bb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as the regular beauty blender, doesn&#x27;t blend the makeup as smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most of the pads and sponges I used before tend to feel rough.</li>
            <li> so I was excited, but when I used it I was like I waited this long for this...</li>
            <li> Blends well, but not sure how you&#x27;re supposed to clean it!?!</li>
            <li> Good price but very hard</li>
            <li> HIGHLY dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because it took a while to ship but other than that it had very good coverage and worked very well with A little water added</li>
            <li> You can wet it just like the Beauty Blender and it will blend just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously not the REAL beauty blender , the one that&#x27;s $20!!</li>
            <li> which I like a little better.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, just took a little long to receive.</li>
            <li> Beauty Blenders, cheap or not, are supposed to expand when wet...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and works very well.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> And the $5 pricetag isn&#x27;t competitive enough to make it worth your wait.</li>
            <li> Feels firm and I like it better than the one I had before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more round than that</li>
            <li> It will put some of your colorful makeup on next time you try to finish your foundation</li>
            <li> I normally pay $5 for these</li>
            <li> If you have the extra money for the beauty blender this product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was kind of slow</li>
            <li> Not huge like many I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Their very soft but yet kind of hard.</li>
            <li> For $8 dollars less, it&#x27;s a steal! :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard at all, makes me question if people are using it correctly...</li>
            <li> If they actually did what a beauty blender does right?</li>
            <li> I have to buy a new one every so often.</li>
            <li> The new it thing , this sponge does wonders ❤</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait months for a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I expected but will for sure get the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I had expected, but it sure does the job well.</li>
            <li> Its very soft and just what i was looking for..</li>
            <li> Was very surprised, was looking for comparisons to the beauty blender and found this.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> I little smaller than expected , but works great</li>
            <li> Very good, very fluffy and pretty tough, it is antiallergic material.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid too.</li>
            <li> You will have to wait a long time for delivery but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more in other shapes and colors.</li>
            <li> Cute, small , soft and affordable!</li>
            <li> It  makes your skin look so natural!</li>
            <li> First of all, they are tiny size, The pic is deceiving.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer that to a real beauty blender!</li>
            <li> reviewers have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t expand when wet, that is true.</li>
            <li> The actual sponge works fine, but the shipping took a long time!</li>
            <li> The size allows me to have a firm grip on the sponge and also makes it easy to store in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Not as soft but does the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a waste of money considering its dirt cheap but it took over a month to arrive, it&#x27;s just not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous little sponge.</li>
            <li> The price is great, but the blending is a little hard and the sponge is not as soft as name brand ones.</li>
            <li> Its firmer and less porous compared to the original</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard but it does an okay job I still use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as great as the beauty blender, the sponge was harsh and rough even wet.</li>
            <li> Clearly.</li>
            <li> At least it was a cheap experiment!</li>
            <li> It is really tiny and when you went and soak in water like the real beauty blender it doesn&#x27;t puff up not absorb the water</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not made for mature (50 year old) skin.</li>
            <li> Now where near the  beauty  blender.</li>
            <li> , It did not increase in size or get soft.</li>
            <li> This is no where near as quality as the beauty blender, or even just a knockoff beauty blender from walmart</li>
            <li> but it sure sucks up your makeup.</li>
            <li> do not waste your time or money</li>
            <li> Save yourself the heartache and get the Real techniques sponge if you&#x27;re looking to find something similar to the beauty blender without having to break the bank.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even feel soft at all.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s seems bigger in the picture than in real life.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few beauty blender dupes for cheap before and this one is a dud.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> its so tiny and it works very well</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get soft when you put water on it</li>
            <li> I thought that it was a soft sponge not a rubber sponge......</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying you have to wait a pretty long time for this item.</li>
            <li> This is not like a real beauty blender because it is not as porous and you do not get the same finish.</li>
            <li> Even after wetting it, it didn&#x27;t seem to expand or get soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft and durable sponge.</li>
            <li> I have only used so called dupes so can&#x27;t really compare it to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product if you are looking for the same function that the real Beauty Blender provides.</li>
            <li> Is perfect To put your base on</li>
            <li> I did, however, notice that using this sponge makes my foundation go a bit patchy around my mouth but a little buffing in with a flat top brush</li>
            <li> and I did not want to pay the full price for a Beauty Blender so for less then 2 bucks I decided to try this one out.</li>
            <li> And thought it was flat not circular the whole way around.</li>
            <li> I ran it under cold, hot, and warm water, and still nothing happened.</li>
            <li> My only tip would be to get the sponge wet, like run it under cool water and squeeze it like 15 times, then put a towel around it and squeeze again.</li>
            <li> I think this is a decent product for only a dollar fifty.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if its because is not an original beauty blender , but the sponge is kinda hard and it took more than a month to arrive</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get here but other than that it applys smoothly and keeps my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Not soft like the real beauty blender.</li>
            <li> This sponge is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first beauty blender, and isn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> But after previously buying many other sponges I&#x27;m rather in between on the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it several times and the texture is still just like new.</li>
            <li> The only problem very delayed shipments from the rest only !!!</li>
            <li> The real Beauty Blender might be better but is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I was little let down because I thought  I was getting two different kind</li>
            <li> On the matter of this beauty blender being firm, it feels pretty solid and does not have much give to it.</li>
            <li> no more messy fingures and it covers very well, better then my brushes.</li>
            <li> I usually use the original beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> I have got several good beauty blenders and a few dud ones in the past.</li>
            <li> The sponge is a bit small but I  like that because it makes it extra easy to get my under eye concealer blended.</li>
            <li> I figured I was going to get a decent, run-of-the-mill makeup sponge that would be a little better than the wedge-shaped ones that come in a big pack for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Great product, Its just the shipping thats bad</li>
            <li> I watch a lot of make up tutorials on youtube and people are generally raving about it.</li>
            <li> Water barely changes its size and density.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> As you add water, this expand double and get soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I know that because this cost 99 cents I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much from this product, but hey, I wanted to give it a go.</li>
            <li> I personally do not like it because to me, it doesn&#x27;t apply the makeup as seamlessly as I thought it would (or as I&#x27;ve been hearing).</li>
            <li> A lot harder then real beauty blender, doesn&#x27;t mix in makeup as well as the BB</li>
            <li> It is not very soft, it absorbs more makeup than it applies and it is very small.</li>
            <li> A friend has the $20 version and she said that hers is a little bit more dense, but these little ~$1.50 guys get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Other name brand have the same exact thing, but sell them for 20 dollars.  </li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s super small.</li>
            <li> this is really hard not like the original one</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because it looks like the real thing other than that it does not work.</li>
            <li> was it took a whole month to get here but other than that prefect</li>
            <li> its soft yet firm very durable</li>
            <li> It was fun to try a few but out of the three different brands I purchased, none of them worked.</li>
            <li> As a newbie to the contouring and blending thing, I think this little guy works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> this little beauty does it all, and it holds up really well!</li>
            <li> Not only did I barely receive this product in February.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product is worth all the hype it receives in the beauty community</li>
            <li> so hope you&#x27;re not in a rush), and it was very helpful in getting my blending technique down.  </li>
            <li> seriously just stuck on to the sponge instead of blending on my face like an original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Its super hard and takes foreverrrrrr to arrived.</li>
            <li> and it was super Hard</li>
            <li> Too stiff and broke the first day.</li>
            <li> It was rubber like what you would use on ur feet I would never use on my face not sure I got the right thing</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m now supposed to use this (unsanitary) sponge on my clean face?  </li>
            <li> Its a bit on the very sturdy less spongey side</li>
            <li> But I was ready to order another one when I saw this less than 2 bucks Makeup Blender and decided to buy 5 which I thought would still be cheaper than one BB.</li>
            <li> The sponge is very comparable to the &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; and gives the same effect but will a very different price, on the other hand after a few uses the very tip of mine</li>
            <li> This little sponge really does work, and for a buck, who could complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other thing I like about this is that I think it&#x27;s very durable and will last a long time (definitely a plus).</li>
            <li> It also soaked up an huge amount of foundation that didn&#x27;t make it on my skin, which was frustrating, because I felt like I was wasting a ton of product.</li>
            <li> When wet they do not expand very much, I use them both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I expected, but that actually helps it work better for me since i have small features.</li>
            <li> but I used it DRY not wet</li>
            <li> Applies foundation just ok, but not great like that other beauty sponge dupes.</li>
            <li> I use it for applying foundation (sides and bottom) and under eye concealer (pointed tip) and it does the job very well whether I use it slightly damp or dry.</li>
            <li> As a comparison, the beauty blender I purchased from Tj Maxx is extremely squishy and soft and expands about 5 times</li>
            <li> Secondly, when wet it doesn&#x27;t expand AT ALL and is still pretty firm.</li>
            <li> and I also  run water over it for a short time then squeeze it out and pat on my upper lip and cheeks taking the extra foundation off to give my face a glow instead of a dry affect.</li>
            <li> It had a strange smell, and it was a little rough at first, but once you start using it regularly it gets easier to blend and use on your face.</li>
            <li> I like the size which is not as large as others or as small.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb water well or expand in size, pretty hard on my face.</li>
            <li> Its firm and won&#x27;t fall apart quickly after a few washes.</li>
            <li> I never tried the real version I am not sure about this so call beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay $20 for a sponge, yet at the same time I was curious as I&#x27;ve seen many of Youtube &amp;quot;gurus&amp;quot; praise this expensive sponge.  </li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but I suggest buying this in bulk because it didn&#x27;t last terribly long at all for me.</li>
            <li> Only thing is took way to long to come.</li>
            <li> this was waste money, more  like stress squeeze sponge waste of money, glad only a dollar :{</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t waste your foundation, and washes up like new.  </li>
            <li> The only downside was it was a lot smaller than what I expected it was a mini beauty blender.</li>
            <li> a bit long say about  three weeks  too long for a simple sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> so it is not very soft</li>
            <li> This is smaller than other similar cheaper sponges that I have bought before and since and the cheapest.</li>
            <li> It is hard, and doesn&#x27;t swell much with water application.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this and would buy again except that I found another of these &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; which is a little more expensive than this but</li>
            <li> hard not soft like the real blenders</li>
            <li> , there could be lead or whatever in this, because it does come from China, and you dont want any kind of bad chemicals coming in contact with your skin or for you make-up artist, you might want to think about that as  well.  </li>
            <li> The point gets difficult areas and the rounded end is comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least the height of my thumb and very buoyant and shapeable.</li>
            <li> Not fond about how long it took to get here though.</li>
            <li> Neither washed well nor lasts long.</li>
            <li> I wonder what took me so long to get one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent $30.00 on a 2 pack Beauty Blender pack and this is basically the same thing.</li>
            <li> Smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> It did take rather a long time to ship to me.3weeks.  </li>
            <li> It took a long time to recieve this product.</li>
            <li> However, the material is not nearly as dense/thick as others.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always kept it&#x27;s shape and lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> Not soft for the face</li>
            <li> Item took a long time to come.</li>
            <li> The shipping time was extremely long thou</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not what I expected.</li>
            <li> then I expected to be , in the picture it looks big</li>
            <li> only used it a couple of times but no real issues with it</li>
            <li> CAME IN EARLIER THAN EXPECTED..</li>
            <li> to do.&lt;br /&gt;A bit smaller than I expected but the size in no way affects the effectiveness of the item.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t expand when wet and doesn&#x27;t blend properly either</li>
            <li> this product took way to long to arrive.</li>
            <li> I got this not too long ago</li>
            <li> you get what you paid for its not soft even if you soak it in water.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than she expected but they work</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected..</li>
            <li> long time to recieve.. and started flaking as washed.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not absorbing the water enough to hydrate it.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> I personally would NOT use this for foundation, because when you wet it, it doesn&#x27;t expand.</li>
            <li> I bought two from this seller a pink one that looks like a beauty blender and a purple one with a different shape.</li>
            <li> Sponge is smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> it does not exsorb water its just a replica  that smells strange...</li>
            <li> The shipping was actually faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I know beauty blenders are a fad now but not all skin is made the same, if you want a dewy finish then wet the sponge ,</li>
            <li> otherwise it takes too long and doesn&#x27;t seem to cover well.</li>
            <li> a bit bigger than expected</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Shipping took way too long.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even get larger once wet.</li>
            <li> It is about the same size (dry) as one, but it never softens nor expands when wet.  </li>
            <li> Awful, super cheap felt like a rubber ball against my face!</li>
            <li> I use it dry, it does absorb the makeup, but not as much as people are saying (when it&#x27;s dry at least).</li>
            <li> Very small compared to the real BB</li>
            <li> My other 2 all but double in size.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same thing as the other brands.  </li>
            <li> I never tried out the original Beauty Blender which I hear is expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying it cause I&#x27;ve had the original beauty blender</li>
            <li> thought it was gna be bigger but other than tht</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but it seemed really hard.  </li>
            <li> Could be from packaging witch also took a very long time to receive.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a very long time but once it got here i tried it out</li>
            <li> I have tried applying my foundation and concealer with an array of brushes, wedge sponges (damp and dry), and even my hands.</li>
            <li> ️I have really dry skin and every time I use brushes my face looks</li>
            <li> tested this out dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it damp, I&#x27;ve used it dry.</li>
            <li> quite a bit DRY</li>
            <li> its dry</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my fault really for expecting a 1 something dollar product to compare to the actual thing, and to make it worse</li>
            <li> Instead, I found that this sponge was far too dense and stiff, even when wet, to even try to apply foundation with.</li>
            <li> Use it every single day to blend my concealer.  </li>
            <li> the other ones are bigger &amp; just slightly harder to work around things.</li>
            <li> I find that it does steal a lot of my product and it does not work the same as other beauty blenders or blending sponges when wet.</li>
            <li> Texturally it is strange, feeling extremely  rough on my skin, and it does not distribute the product well.</li>
            <li> but you can not send because I thought I was the victim</li>
            <li> It works just as well as some of the more expensive ones that I have, but it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> I use this slightly damp especially to blend out my concealer!</li>
            <li> Well the single pink teardrop sponge I bought took quite awhile to get here</li>
            <li> Its not actually true to size in pic, I was expecting it to be slightly larger.</li>
            <li> Soaks in the foundation and only a little goes on face.</li>
            <li> This little beauty definitely helps to ensure my make-up is on perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It ripped a little bit the second time I used (cleaned) it.  </li>
            <li> only a little over 1 $ still cheaper than The Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> I like it a little smaller.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than expected but get the job done..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad reviews, but I personally love it.</li>
            <li> Really bad it&#x27;s been more thAn month ..&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works great but smells awful.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to arrive in at least a month but was surprised when it arrived in about 3 weeks since I think it was being sent from somewhere in Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ITS TOO ROUGH</li>
            <li> EVEN WHEN WET.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really applying old-dried out foundation, CC cream, or concealer.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that you get it wet before using it.</li>
            <li> Shipping takes forever,  but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> It took a while to receive the product, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> It did ship quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> The pruduct is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Did not really like it.</li>
            <li> I wet the sponge</li>
            <li> then I expected and harder then</li>
            <li> sponge was harder than expected.</li>
            <li> Next time I order, I will order a few instead of one.</li>
            <li> did take longer then expected</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t expand when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Came way before expected delivery.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt blend anyting wen wet</li>
            <li> Product arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> I bought them with my eyes closed</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> These do not expand when you get them wet.</li>
            <li> So tiny microbes in a microscope would have trouble finding it.</li>
            <li> Alittle squishier than expected, theres a lot of give to it when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> again total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a really rough sponge even when wet.</li>
            <li> Does not absorb water and expand like expected</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> Blender doesn&#x27;t expand when wet.</li>
            <li> and it arrived in minimal packaging (not like it needed any</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t even think it got wet at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to arrive but once I got it</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t expand when you wet it.  </li>
            <li> Tinier than I expected, but does the job.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender did not soak up water like expected</li>
            <li> This shipped faster then expected and worked well</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Sponge does not expand when wet.</li>
            <li> These are cheaper, and pink.  </li>
            <li> Once I wet it and spray my Fix + spray from MAC</li>
            <li> then I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was expected.</li>
            <li> but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> , theres really no need to wet it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it when it&#x27;s wet though.</li>
            <li> I left it out of the package for a few hours and the smell is almost gone.</li>
            <li> Tips for use: wet sponge with water, squeeze out excess, dip in foundation, and buff on your face.</li>
            <li> Product wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Shipping was slower than expected.</li>
            <li> This sponge is a rough on the skin</li>
            <li> It is very soft but a little small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original size and was only $6, which I don&#x27;t think is bad considering this one was $2 and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Rinsed in clean water 3 times and the water was still brown and dirty looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real hard &amp; doesn&#x27;t really apply makeup well</li>
            <li> Sometimes the makeup looks a little splotchy, but I&#x27;m not a professional.</li>
            <li> the worst blender ever it hard and doesnt clean easy at all DONT BUY.</li>
            <li> I see why other people buy it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t swell up when I put it in water like my other beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> my other sponge I bought.</li>
            <li> In addition to being unsatisfied with the purchase, I am extremely unsatisfied with the shipping.</li>
            <li> I thought the item would suck due to the price.</li>
            <li> This is everything I expected to be!</li>
            <li> but I tried out the other one</li>
            <li> Sending other cargo shirk</li>
            <li> no ill never buy another expensive  beauty blender  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as all the other name brand ones.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> Its sturdy unlike other makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using ordinary sponges again.</li>
            <li> No pitting or pilling like I&#x27;ve read about with some other beauty blenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But said let me try these to see, cause of the price and other reviews. ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like a beauty blender not even close to other dupes of beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I used this the other day to apply foundation</li>
            <li> and that is all I expected!</li>
            <li> Positives and negatives like any other sponge or product you are going to get.</li>
            <li> All-in-all I do like it especially for the price point and that there wasn&#x27;t excessive packaging.</li>
            <li> However, for me personally it is too small.</li>
            <li> Even after you get it wet, it stays hard and TINY.</li>
            <li> Very small, I expected it to be bigger and smoother at applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Too hard and not spongy enough.</li>
            <li> Not as big as i thought it would be to hard</li>
            <li> and although it may blend through those hard to reach corners, I prefer using my sponge squares from the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> this item works, but I personally do not like how hard it is.</li>
            <li> Not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> I would throw these away after using, which makes the price not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth buying it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much that can go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> After the 2nd time washing it it started to crack, so if I purchased again I would buy at least 10 since there</li>
            <li> The one I got is not very light, as you squeeze, the sponge has its resistance in the core.</li>
            <li> but i mean it was only 2$</li>
            <li> Very hard and didn&#x27;t absorb water or got larger when wet.</li>
            <li> Very small , thought it would be bigger</li>
            <li> Waste of money, not close to ANY other blenders I have tried...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super dense,</li>
            <li> Cut my foundation application time in half</li>
            <li> and I noticed less separation throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It  has been well over a month and a half, and I just received my order.</li>
            <li> black gorge beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t puff up much, hard to use, not soft.</li>
            <li> This  beauty  makeup sponge  never expend in the water, so it make hard to use , they not soft enought</li>
            <li> Took way too long to deliver and it&#x27;s hard, even when it&#x27;s damp.</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay $15 for a little sponge</li>
            <li> I have had this little gem for a while now</li>
            <li> I like these little blenders.</li>
            <li> but I do know what works for me and this little thing does wonders for me</li>
            <li> took a little time to get here</li>
            <li> A neat little blender tool.</li>
            <li> It took a little while</li>
            <li> Its not worth waiting over a month for!</li>
            <li> My one and only complaint is the time it took to get to my house!</li>
            <li> I were a little troll</li>
            <li> but after it did I cant put it down!</li>
            <li> the sponge is to hard even if you wet it.</li>
            <li> When I wet it, it was still hard and just absorb all the make up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard as crap, it doesn&#x27;t get bigger when water is absorbed in it.</li>
            <li> I WASTE FOUNDATION BECAUSE IT DOESNT STICK</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> All in all a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but this product was a waste in my opinion.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> It came a few days before the estimated time.</li>
            <li> It will pick up any excess that you don&#x27;t need and it will help reduce harsh lines if used correctly.</li>
            <li> I would return it in a heartbeat, as I now have a waste of space sitting in my makeup applicator drawer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> My mom uses this everyday when she puts on her make up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made</li>
            <li> and it came a few weeks after (3-4 weeks after I placed the order)</li>
            <li> waste your time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Ladies don&#x27;t waste your time, just go buy one today from target.</li>
            <li> If you have a few dollars to spare and want to try it out</li>
            <li> use it for trouble areas or applying concealer around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to ship</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Falls apart after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> i have some trouble cleaning the makeup off it though afterwards</li>
            <li> Even when added water to it it stays firm</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I thought maybe by the mix reviews I would try them out for less that $5 for both seems like a steal!</li>
            <li> It got dirty very fast and was stained the 1st time I used it and no matter how hard I tried cleaning it, I couldn&#x27;t get the stains out.</li>
            <li> Really bad quality and a lot smaller than expected, it is not soft, nor does it expand.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other dupe I bought from Tj Maxx it sucks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To hard to work with and small not even wet</li>
            <li> Stiff, doesn&#x27;t blend foundation.</li>
            <li> For a 1$ sponge u can&#x27;t complain, it&#x27;s kinda stiff even after dampening it</li>
            <li> Stiff.  </li>
            <li> It has started to fall apart a little bit, not to a point where I can&#x27;t use it, but a small chunk of it fell off, and I&#x27;ve a feeling the rest will soon follow.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t expand when wet.. not a good sponge</li>
            <li> so I usually order a few.  </li>
            <li> It tugs on my skin so much that it&#x27;s impossible to use around my eyes</li>
            <li> But it works well to get it a little damp and then apply the make up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having this sponge for a little over 3 months !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard stale tiny pink &amp;#34;makeup sponge&amp;#34; that feels hard when patting on your face.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s NO quality in this little hard sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard, even when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your $ because this hard sponge does not yield the effects of a quality Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> Too small for me.</li>
            <li> this is a small size.</li>
            <li> No more brushes for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
            <li> It does NOT expand when damp and it is too small to use practically.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any smell like past reviews stated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> It is small and you can carry around .</li>
            <li> The sponge is small but it get the job done.</li>
            <li> Easier to use and can get into small areas.</li>
            <li> They are extremely HARD and not easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It is very firm even after I have ran it under water.</li>
            <li> Very firm.  </li>
            <li> Soooo small and hard</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too hard and small and no it does not get softer after you soak in water either.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like using a round pink eraser (a little exaggerated density) to apply makeup!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stiff.</li>
            <li> VERY STIFF.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this sponge though is that its TOO SMALL its probably half the size of a regular sized beauty sponge therefore takes longer to do your makeup.</li>
            <li> this one stayed hard.</li>
            <li> Too hard to use anywhere on the face.</li>
            <li> The sponge is too hard.</li>
            <li> Too hard and doesn&#x27;t expand</li>
            <li> This sponge is way too hard and doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> This blender does not blend, it is really hard and isn&#x27;t absorbent</li>
            <li> but it is too hard to use..</li>
            <li> ( it&#x27;s too hard to use on the face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works alright for it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it&#x27;s too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard, even when dampened</li>
            <li> and its hard .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard on your face</li>
            <li> Hard and doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s hard to squeeze .</li>
            <li> I give 3 stars because it does the job although it is veeery hard.</li>
            <li> This sponge was hard even after washing and damping.</li>
            <li> BUT it will still have take the sponge and press it hard into a towel or washcloth to get all of the make up out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard and doesn&#x27;t even get damp, the water just runs off of it.</li>
            <li> Too hard</li>
            <li> Way too hard not spongy do not buy</li>
            <li> It hard and won&#x27;t &amp;#34;suck up water&amp;#34; as it&#x27;d supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Hard to spread the makeup around.</li>
            <li> The sponge didn&#x27;t swell when wetted and it was hard to use on the face.  </li>
            <li> Wayy too hard on my face compared to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> To hard, felt like I was beating my self up with it</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock save your dollar</li>
            <li> it is still too hard for me.</li>
            <li> This is just a bad product  do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> It sucks up all of the foundation.</li>
            <li> but, ultimately, this blender is a disappointment. /:</li>
            <li> but sucks up all of my foundation</li>
            <li> It came so late</li>
            <li> sucks its not even a sponge..... doesnt blend anything.</li>
            <li> , it sucks up literally  all the product.</li>
            <li> is the only disappointment.</li>
            <li> I feel like it sucks up a lot of my foundation.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you really focus on your base and do contouring and stuff</li>
            <li> NOT VERY HAPPY it wasent the ones i thought it was</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was going to be, I mean if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to the beauty try Target or Sallys.</li>
            <li> I am anxiously wanting for item and can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these DO NOT do anything a beauty blender does other than look like one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Sucks its really hard and nothing like a beauty blender and it is as hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> This sponge is very small and it took forever to get in the mail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very very small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very small compared to the rest of my beauty blenders...</li>
            <li> Its very small compared to what you see in the picture.  </li>
            <li> very small but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Its very small.</li>
            <li> It seriously smells like burnt rubber.  </li>
            <li> I was anticipating a wider base, like the picture, but I received a smaller looking sponge with a round bottom.</li>
            <li> really ridiculous....</li>
            <li> I was not super disappointed because I spent under $2</li>
            <li> You need to wet them with cold water and squeeze them while it&#x27;s under the water (6-7 times) and then you squeeze all the excess water out so you can use it.</li>
            <li> Not good after expensive foundation is wasted and inside the sponge.</li>
            <li> blush, eyeshadow, etcetera should be applied once your base is completely blended in.</li>
            <li> very disappointed, really was looking forward to trying it out!</li>
            <li> This sponge was so hard!</li>
            <li> Really hard!</li>
            <li> Has strange feel and makeup looks bad.</li>
            <li> Arrived with wooden splinters in it :(</li>
            <li> it smells pretty awful and the smell seemed to transfer to my face even after washing the thing before application.</li>
            <li> Very hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard, and it doesn&#x27;t even work well one bit.</li>
            <li> they were squished into a little envlelope and were dirty.</li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed that it was really small</li>
            <li> Worse makeup sponge I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product at all&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this seems like an unnecessary tool for me.</li>
            <li> But, alas, it was no Beauty Blender in function, softness and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with how long they took for just 2 sponges!</li>
            <li> Took very long to arrive though :(</li>
            <li> this will be useful, but I just put a thin layer of base on to minimize a bit of redness in my complexion and sometimes I don&#x27;t even bother with my base layer</li>
            <li> but this was, by far, the worst.</li>
            <li> It was hard would absorb water and doesn&#x27;t blend makeup at all!!</li>
            <li> I have used other Beauty Blender knock-offs in the past and found this one to be the worst of them all,</li>
            <li> and it arrived with a really bad smell not sure you should be using this on your face anyway</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard and it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> So people who gave a negative review on here could have gotten the bad ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> The second thing I noticed was the AWFUL smell!!</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s really exaggerated.</li>
            <li> But boy, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> cause i don&#x27;t use it that often, but it get that weird fish smell...</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> it did smell a bit weird though</li>
            <li> Ill be buying again.</li>
            <li> but it has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry this is one product I cannot say I would recommend...</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> When I went to Sephora to pick this blending sponge up it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> it is rather difficult as the material clings to the skin</li>
            <li> Hmm, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
            <li> Works just as well as a $20 beauty blender and is a mere fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> For $15  a sponge it was getting to be expensive.</li>
            <li> She loves this expensive thing.  </li>
            <li> Its shape helps in applying makeup evenly in difficult places on face.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak of its use to build up coverage, but I have casually used it for liquid foundation, concealer, and foundation stick.</li>
            <li> Disappointed I just receiving a hard sponge.</li>
            <li> It was completely filthy and covered in black gunk, got my fingers dirty</li>
            <li> The worst thing is how long it takes to get.</li>
            <li> This thing is hard, doesn&#x27;t expand and does a crap job</li>
            <li> Also mine didn&#x27;t not have any awkward plastic smell.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t in desperate need of it just yet.</li>
            <li> I felt they were dirty,</li>
            <li> even the one that didn&#x27;t look dirty.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they gave me the sponge all dirty &amp; with holes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally obsessed with it !</li>
            <li> Also for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with that!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it has bad chemicals and just was horrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> This sponge is the worst sponge ever its so hard</li>
            <li> one bit.its hard its awful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write bad reviews often</li>
            <li> Not too bad for the price; I use these for under eye concealer and powder application.</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> smells really bad</li>
            <li> for the price, I cannot complain too bad</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad .</li>
            <li> it does have a bad smell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wanna pay $10 for something that&#x27;s gonna get ugly faster since it&#x27;s in my bag.</li>
            <li> The smell makes me sick and for that reason alone I tossed it in the trash.    </li>
            <li> THUMBS DOWN!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I must say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> The sponges were received on time, however they were very dirty.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate looking like I have makeup caked on and this just blends everything so well.</li>

            <li> This  is absolutely  crap..</li>
            <li> Its crap and I threw it away.</li>
            <li> And if you hate it?</li>
            <li> Its softness allows evenly distribute makeup base .</li>
            <li> Really hate this sponge.</li>

            <li> and when it dod the bag was scraped up and the sponge smelled terrible!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend anything at all, I thought it would compare to the beauty blender, but it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> It had this terrible smell that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smooths my makeup perfectly</li>
            <li> Basic blender. Great material that holds up even after a few of my monthly cleanings, I will order again!</li>
            <li> Nice product. It does take a while to arrive though.</li>
            <li> not like the original. Too hard and not spongy enough.</li>
            <li> These are so easybto use &amp; I biught some for my friends too</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous little sponge. It is perfect for applying make up. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Easy to get up close in those crevasses.</li>
            <li> Very small compared to the real BB but it&#x27;s decent. Pretty solid too.</li>
            <li> ITS TOO ROUGH EVEN WHEN WET. I FEEL LIKE I WASTE FOUNDATION BECAUSE IT DOESNT STICK WELL SO I HAVE TO KEEP RE-APPLYING</li>
            <li> Not the same as the origninal Beauty Blender, but they are great for my use; and I love the price. The difficult part for me was learning how to use the sponges for the best results. When wet they do not expand very much, I use them both wet and dry. These are totally different than the original Beauty Blender, but still a good makeup tool.</li>
            <li> Its Amazing! Its Perfect For Blending Out My Concealer Under My Eyes! It Makes The Look More FLAWLESS</li>
            <li> Great blender for the price. I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this and my more expensive ones. Also mine didn&#x27;t not have any awkward plastic smell.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as big as I thought it would be , but overall it works just fine . :)</li>
            <li> I gave it a one star because it&#x27;s super tiny. and it took forever to get here.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because it looks like the real thing other than that it does not work. its not the right kind of sponge this is more of like the sponge that you would find it a sponge pit that you would jump into. Doesn&#x27;t even soak up any water so it never get moist to smooth out brush lines.</li>
            <li> It sucks up all of the foundation. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this sponge dupe becauze jn this case you do get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different off brand Beauty Blenders but this was, by far, the worst. Beauty Blenders, cheap or not, are supposed to expand when wet...this one stayed hard. I ran it under cold, hot, and warm water, and still nothing happened. I tried to use it anyway, but instead of blending my makeup, it put streaks on my face. I would not buy this again. You get what you pay for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say about this product is that it arrived extremely fast. It was set to arrive in about three weeks, but got here in under two. That was a plus but, ultimately, this blender is a disappointment. /:</li>
            <li> Stiff, doesn&#x27;t blend foundation. ABSOLUTELY nothing like a beauty blender. At least it was a cheap experiment!</li>
            <li> Best price for this item... Glad I got it on here instead of $10 at a make up store.</li>
            <li> it took about a month to receive this when it says 3-4 days. The product does work very well and I love it. I mean it&#x27;s pretty cheap and I wasn&#x27;t in desperate need of it just yet. But it works well to get it a little damp and then apply the make up!</li>
            <li> It is really tiny and when you went and soak in water like the real beauty blender it doesn&#x27;t puff up not absorb the water</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright...it doesn&#x27;t swell and absorb like the original beauty blender but it gets the job done. I have to buy a new one every so often. I refuse to pay $15 for a little sponge</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money. Its notthing like he real bb. Not even close. Too hard to use anywhere on the face. Just invest the money in a bb, it will be worth it :)</li>
            <li> Gets the job done... But i fine it makes my hands and face smell like latex which is why I don&#x27;t really reach for it. It also doesn&#x27;t get that big when you put it in water. But you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It works the way it should but this item is coming from China, so shipping takes forever!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It arrived in a beat up package due to USPS error, but the product is perfect.</li>
            <li> Amazing dupe for the beauty blender!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this beauty blender mainly because of the quality. You&#x27;d think that something so simple would work correctly no matter the quality, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good beauty blender, don&#x27;t buy this one. The sponge is too hard. It has no flexibility. It also took a month to get to my house, probably because it was shipped from China though. All in all a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this sponge. It&#x27;s not super dense, it&#x27;s light weight, and easily cleanable.</li>
            <li> It is the worst buy in my life work  for nothing 👎👎👎👎</li>
            <li> Great price but sucks up all of my foundation</li>
            <li> This makeup blender is okay, I feel like applying with my fingers works better, but my 28 year old niece loves it and uses hers every day. Maybe it&#x27;s not made for mature (50 year old) skin.</li>
            <li> It was okay .. You get what you pay for . It came so late I forgot I ordered it, and it reared apart wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great sponge. I bought two but only received one...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! Totally worth it for then price! I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad reviews, but I personally love it. Not fond about how long it took to get here though. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks, love it! I use it dry, it does absorb the makeup, but not as much as people are saying (when it&#x27;s dry at least). I actually like that it absorbs it, so when I go to use it again I&#x27;m not really applying old-dried out foundation, CC cream, or concealer. It does apply it evenly and helps make the makeup more pigmented. I would repurchase! :)</li>
            <li> Its very soft and just what i was looking for.. I will buy from them again as I need it.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> They absorb make up and aren&#x27;t bouncy at all</li>
            <li> Took months to great and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Crusty. Neither washed well nor lasts long.</li>
            <li> Not as big as i thought it would be to hard</li>
            <li> The sponges were received on time, however they were very dirty. Rinsed in clean water 3 times and the water was still brown and dirty looking. Will not use them.</li>
            <li> It work here and there but it</li>
            <li> Great product. I would suggest that you get it wet before using it. Shipping takes forever,  but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> All it does is it absorbs the makeup instead of blending it onto your skin so you get what you pay for plus did not receive it on time!!!</li>
            <li> This sponge is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Too hard and doesn&#x27;t expand</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here. Amazing for the  price! But over all does what its supposed to. Pleased!</li>
            <li> Never used a beauty blender before, but I just had to buy one because of the hype. I watch a lot of make up tutorials on youtube and people are generally raving about it. Now, I know it&#x27;s not the original one which is 20 bucks, but I wanted to try a cheaper version first.&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, it does provide a great application of my foundation. First I use a stippling brush and then I finish by blending nicely with this - awesome. Also use it to blend the highlighting and shading for a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;Now I wonder what took me so long to get one.</li>
            <li> It took a while to receive the product, but that&#x27;s to be expected. However, this blender is great. I would definitely by again.</li>
            <li> Its perfect. I love it i use it to blend my make in.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, and it works exactly how I thought it would. The real Beauty Blender might be better but is quite expensive. I would say that this does not work like the Beauty Blender but is still a pretty good cosmetic sponge. I use it every day. :)</li>
            <li> took 2 months to be deliver</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent $30.00 on a 2 pack Beauty Blender pack and this is basically the same thing. Not as soft but does the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t puff up much, hard to use, not soft.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the ones at Ulta, and works just as well.</li>
            <li> Does a great job blended evenly and smoothing out foundation! Took very long to arrive though :(</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t buy again! Soaks in the foundation and only a little goes on face. Not good after expensive foundation is wasted and inside the sponge.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Came with two so I gave one to my daughter and she loves it. You will have to wait a long time for delivery but worth it.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but easy to use. 👌</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was going to be, I mean if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to the beauty try Target or Sallys. This sponge is way too hard and doesn&#x27;t work well. Or just go buy the real deal.</li>
            <li> i love how it blends my foundation in smoothly..</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t really mastered the use of the sponge but i&#x27;m getting there.</li>
            <li> Bets product for makeup artists and I love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in December of 2014. The estimated delivery said it would be January 14th. Not only did I barely receive this product in February. My cat decided to chew it up... The product was cute but I never got to use it.</li>
            <li> not a dupe for a beayuty blender but works.</li>
            <li> Did not come inside retail packaging. Did not include instructions on how to use.</li>
            <li> Good price. Ordered 3. Good quality.</li>
            <li> love this make up blender! this one has to be my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than expected but get the job done..</li>
            <li> Used this once and it have me acne! Not sanitary at all. I washed it to take the stench away from it but it has bad chemicals and just was horrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> Perfect for blending and applying it has a pointier tip so its easier to reach corners of the eye etc really helpful and useful plus its a dollar fifty you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> I liked it very much... it really makes a difference in your makeup and it&#x27;s so inexpensive</li>
            <li> good at blending! works like a charm</li>
            <li> The best thing I have ever bought! I would buy this again and I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> So far the best make up blender I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, great product</li>
            <li> These brushes were a gift for my granddaughter for Christmas.She is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best work grate</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but I suggest buying this in bulk because it didn&#x27;t last terribly long at all for me.</li>
            <li> Too stiff and broke the first day.</li>
            <li> Never got a chance to use it.  My granddaughter took it over and loved it.  Need to order more.</li>
            <li> soaks up more product than it puts on your face, i would rather save my money and buy a real beauty blender than this or other knockoffs</li>
            <li> Feels like plastic . It&#x27;s real hard &amp; doesn&#x27;t really apply makeup well</li>
            <li> Its a good cousin to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I have had this little gem for a while now and I use it every time I put on my makeup. I absolutely hate looking like I have makeup caked on and this just blends everything so well. When this thing finally dies, I&#x27;ll be getting another for sure!</li>
            <li> This item is disgusting. Please don&#x27;t waste your $ because this hard sponge does not yield the effects of a quality Beauty Blender. There&#x27;s NO quality in this little hard sponge. My advice is go to Sephora or MAC and purchase a quality Beauty Blender that will yield the performance you desire.</li>
            <li> This sponge is very small and it took forever to get in the mail.</li>
            <li> If I could give it 0 stars I would. When I bought this thinking it was the real deal, I was excited. Until I actually got it. It&#x27;s fake. Clearly. Because no beauty blender is gonna be this cheap. So I guess I got what I paid for. It is very firm even after I have ran it under water. Disapointed. *sigh*</li>
            <li> Works great. I never use these sponges but thought I would give it a try. Does things brushed just can&#x27;t at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Cute and compact. Perfect all purpsose tool for the gal on the go.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST RECEIVED ORDER</li>
            <li> This blender does not blend, it is really hard and isn&#x27;t absorbent</li>
            <li> I love it! I see why other people buy it. And i got it so much cheaper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what it should feel like at all. It&#x27;s very stiff. And it didn&#x27;t blend makeup very good at all. It&#x27;s also very very small. Defiantly wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t swell up when I put it in water like my other beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it was going to be. I hate it.</li>
            <li> Love this ordering a second one 👍</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail.  It did ship quicker than expected.  I&#x27;ve now tried several brands of the &amp;#34;beauty blender type&amp;#34; sponges.  This one falls way way short.    The first thing I noticed was that it doesn&#x27;t expand or enlarge at all.  My other 2 all but double in size.  This one doesn&#x27;t AT ALL.    The second thing I noticed was the AWFUL smell!! It seriously smells like burnt rubber.  The smell makes me sick and for that reason alone I tossed it in the trash.    I did attempt to apply makeup with it and it didn&#x27;t blend well at all.  I don&#x27;t write bad reviews often but this product was a waste in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it away after using it and washing a few times, but it doesn&#x27;t cost that much so I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> It works so good but it didn&#x27;t double it size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far from the original. I trashed the 2 I bought.&lt;br /&gt;1. Water barely changes its size and density.&lt;br /&gt;2.. It tugs on my skin so much that it&#x27;s impossible to use around my eyes&lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t think it blends well at all.</li>
            <li> the sponge is to hard even if you wet it. even though this isnt the original beauty blender it isnt worth it. it wont leave you a good make up finish look</li>
            <li> As a newbie to the contouring and blending thing, I think this little guy works pretty well.  I had a contour pallet I was using and just blending with brushes.  Then this finally arrived (took literally 30 days so hope you&#x27;re not in a rush), and it was very helpful in getting my blending technique down.  Practice makes perfect, but I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> If you clean them before use, they work awesome.</li>
            <li> Smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> Worse makeup sponge I have ever tried. Its super hard and takes foreverrrrrr to arrived.</li>
            <li> BE WARNED! This most definitely NOT the same thing as the original beauty blender.  I saw this and thought, &amp;#34;Hey! I found one for under $2!&amp;#34; So I bought it.  It took about 2 weeks or longer to ship.  Then when I got it I realized WHY it was $2.  The original beauty blender is very soft and when you run it under water, it absorbs water which makes your make up application flawless. This knock off does nothing of the sort.  It does not retain any water, if anything, it makes your make up run.  It&#x27;s much harsher than the original beauty blender.  If you are looking for a flawless application of your foundation, spend the extra money on the original beauty blender and you will know what I mean.  I was not super disappointed because I spent under $2 but I threw this one out the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> Mines didnt come in 😒</li>
            <li> Takes forever to receive but all and all I love this sponge ! I use Maybelline fit me foundation it goes on flawlessly and I got complemented on my make up . It&#x27;s was my first time using it 😀</li>
            <li> My girl loves it.  I bought it for her.  Everything is great.  It did take rather a long time to ship to me.3weeks.  Though it was only a couple three dollars  shipping included.  So I shouldn&#x27;t complain.  Very happy over all.</li>
            <li> She goes through these things. So fast. Buy them in bulk.  There good tools for the make up</li>
            <li> Love it, does what exactly its supposed to :D</li>
            <li> I feel it absorbs my make-up and although it may blend through those hard to reach corners, I prefer using my sponge squares from the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Awesome it does the job,, :)</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I wear makeup and I love it. It really does make a difference and makes everything so much more smooth and blended. I have this one along with a yellow one in a different shape. But this pink one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> The actual sponge works fine, but the shipping took a long time!</li>
            <li> I little smaller than expected , but works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously not the REAL beauty blender , the one that&#x27;s $20!! What did you expect . I have one and I know it&#x27;s probably nothing like the $20 one, but I can&#x27;t see myself spending $20 on this in real life smh</li>
            <li> Its cool...for a good price</li>
            <li> Not worth your time or money. Disappointed I just receiving a hard sponge. It was fun to try a few but out of the three different brands I purchased, none of them worked.</li>
            <li> Very much like the picture, perfect for blending and contouring</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good and a great price</li>
            <li> Works like it should. Nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Love it</li>
            <li> I have seen this product used on YouTube and wanted one for foundation application.  So far I love it as it helps smooth out foundation and gives a more even appearance. I will order another one.</li>
            <li> This little beauty definitely helps to ensure my make-up is on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;It helps with blending and contouring...LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;It is so NOT like a make up sponge.. I just wish I ordered about 4 of them.. but now I know.</li>
            <li> it absorbs to much makeup</li>
            <li> I love it! It applies my foundation smoothly. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> This little guy works great!  Very handy tool to have.  Doesn&#x27;t waste your foundation, and washes up like new.  The best quality sponge I&#x27;ve found compared to the original one.  For $8 dollars less, it&#x27;s a steal! :-)</li>
            <li> great quality! Cut my foundation application time in half and I noticed less separation throughout the day.</li>
            <li> These are ok I kind thought they would be softer but maybe it&#x27;s just they way they all are.</li>
            <li> I got a knock off beauty blender.not impressed! That thing went right into the trash! It&#x27;s supposed to absorb water doesn&#x27;t do that! And it took almost two months to receive it and it smelled like fish when I got it in the mail. Thanks china! Your products suck!</li>
            <li> The size is workable and it&#x27;s the technique that you use that will make it work. It doesn&#x27;t absorb the water quickly however if sprayed directly on the sponge from the spouse it will work. Great dupe from the bb and does the job fine for me.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works perfect for blending</li>
            <li> I used this sponge to apply my foundation as well as to highlight and contour my makeup great product👌</li>
            <li> Sucks its really hard and nothing like a beauty blender and it is as hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> Too small for me. Just okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Like this item got it for my blush, works very well. Seller was prompt</li>
            <li> Is definitely what you&#x27;d expect.  It is about the size of a dolls pretend blender. But for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much, so 2 stars for fair pricing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good I love it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well putting makeup on face. Has strange feel and makeup looks bad.</li>
            <li> I received me order on time and am very satisfied with the purchase. The pruduct is what I expected. The price was excellent  as well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Received sponge and tried it immediately. I found without a doubt that a stipple brush blends in your foundation better and more evenly.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to recieve this product. Its not actually true to size in pic, I was expecting it to be slightly larger. I do like the product, but didnot understand why it took about six weeks before recieved, otherwise good product for blending.</li>
            <li> Kinda Cheap but it does the job just damp it more. I had to use water then my mac fix sprits</li>
            <li> Okay so it&#x27;s a beautiful sponge. However, it&#x27;s not so special that it&#x27;s worth waiting over a month for to be shipped from China. And the $5 pricetag isn&#x27;t competitive enough to make it worth your wait. I could have done without!</li>
            <li> Though it works great, it sucks up make up too quickly!</li>
            <li> The item is ok for the price but it is too hard to use.. I think I&#x27;ll just stick to my make up brushes</li>
            <li> Good blender, but it smelled of rotting fish when it arrived. I had to soak it in a number of things to get the smell out.</li>
            <li> I love this blender! works great!</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> When I got this I was expecting it to be a lot bigger... Very disappointed !!</li>
            <li> Arrived with wooden splinters in it :(</li>
            <li> this is okay, it picks up some product but not as much as I would like... BUT it doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> Not the real material for makeup sponges but still works nicely</li>
            <li> This  beauty  makeup sponge  never expend in the water, so it make hard to use , they not soft enought</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY.  This does not even come close to comparing to the beauty blender.  Does not absorb water at all and does not blend makeup.  HIGHLY dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> they sell these at any fashion store for more than $5. Ive bought the $20 ones, the $15 ones, but this one has been my favorite. Ive noticed they are all different materials. the other ones are more spongier but this one has more firmness to it. easy to blend with this without messing anything else up. the other ones are bigger &amp; just slightly harder to work around things. gotta get the hang of it but all together this was a GREAT buy &amp; i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It was okay, it was worth the $2</li>
            <li> sucks its not even a sponge..... doesnt blend anything. WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> Great way to blend your foundation/makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> Already used it and threw it away</li>
            <li> Wish it was softer:( it&#x27;s too hard to use on the face</li>
            <li> Came torn but package intact</li>
            <li> Good quality, well I braved for its arrival based on a previous reviewer who bought them.  So it takes a while , around the globe, from China, but they are good in quality!!</li>
            <li> Took absolutely FOREVER to get this. Nothing special about this at all.</li>
            <li> This is like a magic little thing,I love it:)</li>
            <li> Did not really like it.</li>
            <li> Love love this one! Very squishy! Good to work with, blends nice! Need to order another one!</li>
            <li> The sponge arrived covered in what I assume was ink from the packaging. It was unusable, so I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of the actual product. I must say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This BB is pretty good :3 but it took a while of delivery</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this but decided to buy it anyways. First off took about a month to get here! So I just went out to buy a beauty blender at sephora and that same day it came in. I compared them and this does not come close to the BB! Doesn&#x27;t grow, soften, or even blend well. Not even worth the price it has..</li>
            <li> Amazing sponge... it applies my makeup with even coverage and is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> the sponges are perfect for makeup application; promptly shipped; no problems whatsoever</li>
            <li> This  is absolutely  crap.. Now where near the  beauty  blender. It doesn&#x27;t  even expand or get  soft when wet, it sucks up literally  all the product. This is just a bad product  do not waste your money.😠</li>
            <li> Great for blending foundation and getting a nice sheer coverage. You won&#x27;t look cakey with this sponge! It&#x27;s even better at applying concealer under the eyes. The shape allows you to blend and get in the corners. A must have for any beauty junkie!</li>
            <li> I love it and the price is great. It is just like the beauty blender. I will definitely be repurchasing one again soon.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent sponge - I&#x27;ve personally never used the actual beauty blender so I can&#x27;t compare it to that.  Personally I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again because I don&#x27;t like how dense it is.  It works to apply BB and CC Creams well (better than the average drugstore triangle sponge), but it also absorbs a lot of product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of hard but does the job, not as much bounce as the beauty blender, but for the price it does what is&#x27;s supposed  to do.</li>
            <li> These work just fine for me.  A friend has the $20 version and she said that hers is a little bit more dense, but these little ~$1.50 guys get the job done.  I&#x27;m pleased with them and have given a couple away as gifts.</li>
            <li> It came a few days before the estimated time. It&#x27;s works alright for it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it&#x27;s too hard. It&#x27;s definition not as soft as the original puff tool, it&#x27;s too dense!&lt;br /&gt;It still. Does the job, that&#x27;s why 4 *, but it&#x27;s like using a round pink eraser (a little exaggerated density) to apply makeup!</li>
            <li> Really good. Perfect make up.</li>
            <li> This sponge was so hard! I wet the sponge and it did nothing, It did not increase in size or get soft. It did not blend in my makeup. I threw it in the trash! Save your money.</li>
            <li> I am anxiously wanting for item and can&#x27;t wait to try it! Still have not received.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard, even when dampened</li>
            <li> This is no where near as quality as the beauty blender, or even just a knockoff beauty blender from walmart</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to an actual BeautyBlender. I would throw these away after using, which makes the price not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!  Did not blend out anything and it was super Hard</li>
            <li> This is really useful in blending liquid makeups. It will pick up any excess that you don&#x27;t need and it will help reduce harsh lines if used correctly. Using it damp gave the best results. I find that it does steal a lot of my product and it does not work the same as other beauty blenders or blending sponges when wet. I would say that this is worth the purchase as long as you know how to use it the right way.</li>
            <li> Love the shape and size - actually like it much better than one I had purchased at a local store. However, the material is not nearly as dense/thick as others. It ripped a little bit the second time I used (cleaned) it.  But, the other side is still working great!</li>
            <li> Very small , thought it would be bigger then what is was and it has a funny smell to it. Could be from packaging witch also took a very long time to receive.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought, It&#x27;s cheep, easy to use and I love it. I use it every day and it&#x27;s always kept it&#x27;s shape and lasts for a long time, my cat got mine though, oops, time for another one!</li>
            <li> Works great! Took forever to get but overall I love it.</li>
            <li> I love them I got 2 of them and they are prefect the only thing I didn&#x27;t like it was it took a whole month to get here but other than that prefect</li>
            <li> Best beauty blender but my kittens got a hold of it and ripped it to shreds so I need to get another!</li>
            <li> Can not compare to the real beauty blender.  Its firmer and less porous compared to the original you would get a sephoras.</li>
            <li> works just as well the 30 dollar ones from sephora</li>
            <li> Good price but don&#x27;t expect item right away Shipping took over a month.</li>
            <li> Pretty soft. Blends good.&lt;br /&gt;No downside!</li>
            <li> Shipping was kind of slow but it got to me so no worries. The tracking number didnt work at all. When I received the BB it was packaged nicely but when I opened it, the blenders had a fish smell &amp; I washed them and the smell went away. Really absorbed the soap &amp; water when washed. Their very soft but yet kind of hard. I havent tested them out yet but I&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Feels firm and I like it better than the one I had before. It was good for price.</li>
            <li> What can you expect for a dollar 😒</li>
            <li> hard not soft like the real blenders</li>
            <li> I got a real techniques one instead. This thing is hard, doesn&#x27;t expand and does a crap job</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t expand when wet, but blends really good. Better than expected!</li>
            <li> Loved it.. Blends well.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, not close to ANY other blenders I have tried... it has pieces that flake off it, does not leave a smooth finish. Its crap and I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive good texture washes well. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Love it. If you get it completely wet then squeeze the water out and squeeze it again in a dry towel, it distributes the makeup evenly and beautifully.</li>
            <li> Cheap and functional. Nothing to complain about!!</li>
            <li> Works great for applying my foundation, and blending.. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really hard! Not soft for the face</li>
            <li> Item took a long time to come. The company did say (after the order was processed) that the delivery date would be about 7 weeks. Item was as described and priced great.</li>
            <li> Good for the price! Is not the beauty blender but it is a good sponge!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap. Dirt cheap.  They are all made from China so mind as well cut out the middle man.  It&#x27;s the same thing as the other brands.  Will definitely buy lots of them!</li>
            <li> The my mini blending sponge.  Worth the price and thinking if buying more. The shipping time was extremely long thou</li>
            <li> Four stars. The shipping took forever, I had to wait about six weeks for it to finally come, once it did it was smaller then I expected and harder then my other sponge I bought. Its blends around the eye area easily and I also  run water over it for a short time then squeeze it out and pat on my upper lip and cheeks taking the extra foundation off to give my face a glow instead of a dry affect. Great product, Its just the shipping thats bad i had to wait up to two months</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of things about this blender but I think it&#x27;s really exaggerated. It does help apply makeup on your face better than face hand and fingers. But the price is a bit unreasonable in my opinion because I&#x27;ve seen the price $15 when it first came out. Don&#x27;t know what that was about. Then it went below 2 dollars. Like heck I&#x27;ll give it a try. It&#x27;s not something I can&#x27;t live without but nice to have.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not what I expected. I have used the BB for about a year now, and am absolutely in love with it, but this product has stopped short. Texturally it is strange, feeling extremely  rough on my skin, and it does not distribute the product well. I thought that for the price ($1.19) that it would be a nice dupe.But boy, I was wrong. In addition to being unsatisfied with the purchase, I am extremely unsatisfied with the shipping. It  has been well over a month and a half, and I just received my order. I would return it in a heartbeat, as I now have a waste of space sitting in my makeup applicator drawer.</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Only for contouring!  Do not try to use as a regular foundation sponge!</li>
            <li> So about 9 months back I bought one of these and thought it was awesome! Then recently I ended up buying three because k liked them and shipping takes FOREVER! Well when I received the product it was terrible! It was hard would absorb water and doesn&#x27;t blend makeup at all!!</li>
            <li> I love it.... it gives great coverage and is very easy to use. It takes about a month to receive it is the only disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was torn on weather or not I should buy this. I thought the item would suck due to the price. Its great and I love it. It blends nicely.  I tried foundation, bb cream, and bronzer. It works great BUT it takes about 2 weeks to ship and arrive.</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose, but I would go with a different &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; or the actual beauty blender for better performance.</li>
            <li> Not as squishy as I wanted it to be</li>
            <li> First off they forgot to send it i had to remind them after almost 2 months.. it&#x27;s very small compared to the rest of my beauty blenders... I guess it&#x27;s a cheap price for the product...</li>
            <li> Do not buy this sponge if you want to use it to apply your makeup. It is nothing like the beauty blender, it doesn&#x27;t absord any water but it sure sucks up your makeup.</li>
            <li> Come on, is the most economic sponge ever, what are you expecting?? IT WORKS EXTREMELY FINE FOR WHAT YOU PAID FOR.  UPDATE: after a couple months of using it, i wash it every week cause i don&#x27;t use it that often, but it get that weird fish smell...</li>
            <li> The only problem very delayed shipments from the rest only !!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Soft, works perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this works perfect for any make up contouring blush anything</li>
            <li> Love this idem and bought one for my Mom!  :)</li>
            <li> got these babies in the mail and I love it! blends really well!</li>
            <li> Just as good as the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> sponge was harder than expected. Not too good for smaller areas like eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good, I would order it again :)</li>
            <li> Took awhile to receive but other than that it was great product.</li>
            <li> better than I expected. I never tried out the original Beauty Blender which I hear is expensive. Glad I went with this first!! Only thing was the shipping took longer than actual delivery date. I got it in 2 months!! Next time I order, I will order a few instead of one.</li>
            <li> really helps apply liquid foundation very nicely.</li>
            <li> Much smaller then I expected to be , in the picture it looks big but once I recived it its so much smaller...</li>
            <li> I love beauty blenders and I was glad to find this in for a much cheaper price than the original at sephora for $20. The only downside was it was a lot smaller than what I expected it was a mini beauty blender. Nevertheless, it works just as great and leaves my concealer flawless.</li>
            <li> only used it a couple of times but no real issues with it</li>
            <li> The product in general is great the only aging is shipping did take longer then expected</li>
            <li> This sponge is pretty freaking sweet. I bought it because I&#x27;ve wanted a beauty blender, but couldn&#x27;t justify 15 dollars on a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this probably isn&#x27;t as good as the beauty blender, but it&#x27;s seriouly changed my makeup game for the better. I have tried applying my foundation and concealer with an array of brushes, wedge sponges (damp and dry), and even my hands. This thing trumps them all. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitey worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t expand under water like the beauty blender does, but I found that It still worked really well. Shipping took a while, but It was well worth it. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap sponge,had to go to Sephora for a smoother softer feel,makeup goes on better with a pricy one</li>
            <li> do not waste your time or money</li>
            <li> CAME IN EARLIER THAN EXPECTED.. VERY NICE SPONGE!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother if you&#x27;re trying to find a dupe for the beauty blender! It doesn&#x27;t expand when it gets wet. Save yourself the heartache and get the Real techniques sponge if you&#x27;re looking to find something similar to the beauty blender without having to break the bank. I&#x27;m reviewing this to the original beauty blender because I have it.</li>
            <li> I like these little blenders. They get the job done.</li>
            <li> this is a small size. not tiny but like the med. and its hard . works okay . best ones are the bigger ones. but i mean it was only 2$ so cant complain</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was about to not buy it but since the price was so low i did anyways as an add on. I love it. Its a bit on the very sturdy less spongey side but it gets the job done. Because this one worked well i now have to try the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I think that this for the price, it is reasonable. It blends into areas I can&#x27;t blend with my fingers properly, for example, under my eyes or the sides of my nose. It has a weird smell. I washed it with my cleanser twice now, to remove the residue, and still the smell has not faded.&lt;br /&gt;For something so cheap, there isn&#x27;t much complain or praise one can offer.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other dupe I bought from Tj Maxx it sucks. First off, this took about 2 months to get here. (which is why I needed up buying a different dupe) Secondly, when wet it doesn&#x27;t expand AT ALL and is still pretty firm. On the matter of this beauty blender being firm, it feels pretty solid and does not have much give to it. As a comparison, the beauty blender I purchased from Tj Maxx is extremely squishy and soft and expands about 5 times it&#x27;s original size and was only $6, which I don&#x27;t think is bad considering this one was $2 and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> You have to do a lot of patting for this to blend out and give you the finish of a beauty blenders. It also does not sponge up like the original beauty blender</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how great this shape blender would be! I finally bought this one and am now using it almost every day! I would definitely recommend trying it if you haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, and works great. It&#x27;s pretty small but it does work and the price is perfect!</li>
            <li> Mine came unwrapped im</li>
            <li> It has been 3 months since I have ordered it and I have recieved nothing</li>
            <li> its ok...the only problem is it has an odor but its bearable.</li>
            <li> This was awful.  I was hoping for a beauty blender dupe but this was awful.  Did not blend makeup out at all.</li>
            <li> Works fine for the money you paid. But there is some feathering sometimes.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I have a beauty blender and a dupe and they work night and day different than this. It&#x27;s made of a plastic material like. Doesn&#x27;t even feel soft at all. Moment you put it under the water it beads off and makes a squeeky noise from the plastic feel. Not a sponge at all. I didn&#x27;t even put it to my face from the disaster I felt just putting water on it. It&#x27;s a definite no. If you want a good dupe, the winstonia (I think is how you spell it) black gorge beauty blender. It feels just like the real beauty blender but for a fraction of the cost. Like $3.</li>
            <li> Came way before expected delivery.  I love this sponge!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the beauty blender it doesn&#x27;t grow and it&#x27;s really hard on your face and it kinda hurts</li>
            <li> Amazing blender, great for traveling and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Good price but very hard</li>
            <li> This sponge is the worst sponge ever its so hard an it doesnt blend anyting wen wet it does expand i would say to invest in a beauty blender</li>
            <li> Love it! Took a while to get here but it was well worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> This is everything I expected to be!</li>
            <li> i love it... the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t get bigger. but you get what you paid for</li>
            <li> Hot here on time and I love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> As advertised.....love it!</li>
            <li> For a 1$ sponge u can&#x27;t complain, it&#x27;s kinda stiff even after dampening it but it did a decent job at smoothing out my foundation.</li>
            <li> Thought it was alittle bigger</li>
            <li> OMG ! I&#x27;ve been having this sponge for a little over 3 months ! I&#x27;m totally obsessed with it ! I already ordered a new one ! I recommend not to use it damp, just to apply moisturizer on your face with the sponge then foundation ! And omg amaze balls.  Love it ! 😅💘💘💘</li>
            <li> Love it and am going to order some more.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before expected. Good quality.love it!</li>
            <li> Too many days to deliver</li>
            <li> The new it thing , this sponge does wonders ❤️❤️</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this blinder it blends so well!</li>
            <li> My mom uses this everyday when she puts on her make up. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> terrible/ what else can you get for the price</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I had thought it would be , but gets the job done nonetheless .</li>
            <li> I always see this in makeup tutorials and people raving about it....i found this one and decided to try it. Cant beat the price. Im soo in looove...it blends soo perfectly nice. Thumbs up!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like it! I haven&#x27;t tried the beautyblender so I can&#x27;t compare but yah I really like it</li>
            <li> Love itttttt. I bought them with my eyes closed lol.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and the blenders do what they are supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;A bit smaller than I expected but the size in no way affects the effectiveness of the item.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like these. They are extremely HARD and not easy to work with. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> Hard and doesn&#x27;t do anything. Good cat toy, tho!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice dupe for the BB. I&#x27;ve been using mine for several months now, and it works well enough. It has started to fall apart a little bit, not to a point where I can&#x27;t use it, but a small chunk of it fell off, and I&#x27;ve a feeling the rest will soon follow. If you&#x27;re in search of a cheap, alternative to the BB, I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Not cheaply made</li>
            <li> Shipping took a very long time but once it got here i tried it out and i love it its kinda small but blends my makeup very well :)</li>
            <li> a lot smaller then i expected but they workpretty good.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works amazing!</li>
            <li> It came on time, but is kind of a waste… I only used it once.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of them one of them came torn so I had to throw that one out but I tried out the other one and now I can&#x27;t stop use ing this 👌❤️I have really dry skin and every time I use brushes my face looks so caked 🍰🎂bc I have dry patches but this sponge makes my face look flawless I will get again I&#x27;m in love 💝 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> Good product. Happy and satisfied. Pretty good. Excited to start using. Good material. Yay !</li>
            <li> it works perfect. it did smell a bit weird though, i washed out the smell. Keep in mind it takes a while to dry after use, but since i dont wear makeup everyday its perfect.</li>
            <li> It took awhile for me to receive it but I absolutely love it. I would purchase more.</li>
            <li> Great price. Not as big and more dense than I would&#x27;ve wanted it but for the price I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> Great shipping came before expected &amp; I enjoy my product.</li>
            <li> Product as described long shipping time but the price is good.</li>
            <li> Little in size but does the job, I am very impressed with this product for the price that I have paid for!😍</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and loved the sponge, just perfect. Packaging was great and will order with this seller again! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> This is very doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture. It&#x27;s more round than that and it&#x27;s seems bigger in the picture than in real life. Also i had to redeliver so it took longer.other than that it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> For the price works great ! It just took about a month or longer to arrive but I didn&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li> Despite seeing mixed reviews, I took a chance and ordered two. These are fantastic! In my personal opinion, these stand up to the brand name product. I seriously do not think a sponge is worth $15 despite the advertised &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; properties of the BB; it&#x27;s a sponge! I don&#x27;t wear a lot of foundation so I can&#x27;t speak of its use to build up coverage, but I have casually used it for liquid foundation, concealer, and foundation stick. This little sponge really does work, and for a buck, who could complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t expand when wet, that is true. But I had no problems applying and blending foundation. Be warned, mine smelled really funky, like a strong plastic odor, when I received them. I recommend thoroughly rinsing it with warm water and soap to clean it of its smell (and sanitize it), before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a dollar to spend? Take a chance on this product. And if you hate it? Well, it was only a dollar.</li>
            <li> Would totally recommend this to anyone looking to get a beauty blender. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $20+ for a sponge and I saw this and thought why not give it a shot. It&#x27;s a fraction of the price. And let me tell you it&#x27;s awesome! Blends perfectly and makes my makeup look awesome and not cakey, which is a big problem I had with Mac foundations. My only tip would be to get the sponge wet, like run it under cool water and squeeze it like 15 times, then put a towel around it and squeeze again.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few beauty blender dupes for cheap before and this one is a dud. Mine look nothing like the one in the picture (color and shape). I even try my best to look at the texture of the sponge, but it looks like the one they sent me is not the one in the picture. I have got several good beauty blenders and a few dud ones in the past. A good dupes would feel light, and as you squeeze you would feel there is less foam in the core. As you add water, this expand double and get soft and bouncy. The surface will be smooth. The one I got is not very light, as you squeeze, the sponge has its resistance in the core. No mater how much you add water, it does not expand. So people who gave a negative review on here could have gotten the bad ones. It is not because they did not add water, but because no matter what, water cannot absorb in all the way.</li>
            <li> Not too bad for the price; I use these for under eye concealer and powder application. Use while damp</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t got it still, it&#x27;s been about 2 months now?</li>
            <li> Really works and it&#x27;s my best friend when it comes to blending my concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li> Is perfect To put your base on</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend 35$ on another  the original Beauty blender and it was the right call. This works WONDERFULLY! I&#x27;m ordering more because it makes applies my liquid foundations flawlessly. It&#x27;s just as good as the original for a small fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this never have used the actually real beauty blender and don&#x27;t feel the need to this works just fine and does the job perfect totally recommend it!(:</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product for the price. Ill be buying again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good to blend the foundation</li>
            <li> Very hard. Not like it&#x27;s competition at all!</li>
            <li> Great gift for a friend</li>
            <li> I love the sponge, very light weight and easy to use. Easy to clean as well. Also for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Love it the only downfall is just how tiny it is but I guess that&#x27;s what u get for a dollar</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all. Both came to me torn. Bad quality.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get it to expand!! I&#x27;ve tried everything. If I get an email back on how it can actually work, I will change my review but seeing as how I can&#x27;t even use it, it gets 0 stars or recommendations from me!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the hype, but it was a dollar so whatever.</li>
            <li> I like the items!!!! good seller.</li>
            <li> These do not expand when you get them wet. I figured they would be cheaper quality than the actual beauty blender, but I didn&#x27;t think they wouldn&#x27;t work. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> Shipping took about a month but it&#x27;s soooo worth it. This thing is so amazing and this is such a good deal. I ordered one a couple months ago, and it&#x27;s still in use. I&#x27;m ordering two more now.</li>
            <li> Es suave y muy bonita el problema es que es muy peque&amp;ntilde;a</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I use it everyday! It works very well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Took forever to get!!</li>
            <li> It was very tiny. When it came it did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Received them the day it said on the delivery info took several weeks but it was worth the wait !! They work amazing</li>
            <li> smaller than i expected. But nice color and works great</li>
            <li> Amazing product, but if you want it fast don&#x27;t get standard it took four weeks when it was only supposed to take two</li>
            <li> Well works really good love it</li>
            <li> So tiny microbes in a microscope would have trouble finding it. Would NOT purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered it the first week of December and I just received it today. I was excited to try this out but when I used it it just absorbed all of the product. It didn&#x27;t blend at all whether I dabbed it or twist it it refused to blend. I could see the spots where I put the product after that I just went back to using a brush</li>
            <li> Alittle squishier than expected, theres a lot of give to it when applying makeup. Still wprks grest, but just isnt as firm support wise</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the hype! I&#x27;m going to spend the money on the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It looks like the beauty blender but most certainly is worth what you pay. If you use and love the BB then don&#x27;t ecpect this to replace it. I would not purchase this again and instead suck it up and spend the money for the real thing.</li>
            <li> Took a loooong a** time to get to me and when it dod the bag was scraped up and the sponge smelled terrible!</li>
            <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
            <li> B sponges are very very very good and I will recommend them to anyone or any body who does makeup it compares to the Beauty Blender very well it gets in your crease is it does a very good job so I would recommend this is such a low price to anyone</li>
            <li> nice to be able to come to turkey cargo. Sending other cargo shirk but you can not send because I thought I was the victim but it came. thank you:)</li>
            <li> Is great I thought it was going to be s***ty for the price turna out is the replica of the original one wich is 20 $ more great item</li>
            <li> Was very surprised, was looking for comparisons to the beauty blender and found this. It works like a dream just as good as my beauty blender.</li>
            <li> not makeup mac sponge this was waste money, more  like stress squeeze sponge waste of money, glad only a dollar :{</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here, and the sponge wasn&#x27;t even good. It doesn&#x27;t expand when wet and doesn&#x27;t blend properly either</li>
            <li> Ok ive ordered  over 5 different blenders and this 1 works just as good fast and blends flawless you wont no till you order this urself!!! Trust me you&#x27;ll  like it cuz i no ill never buy another expensive  beauty blender  again total waste of money. ..now that i tried this cheap 1 wow it really works no lie! Now im going to order like 20 of these lil blenders so they  will last me a good wile</li>
            <li> Came on time love using it.</li>
            <li> Very good!  And very good price girls or guys should really buy.</li>
            <li> Love..... not to mention great price.</li>
            <li> Love it !! Makes my makeup look really good 😊👍</li>
            <li> Excellent. I use them only once, so for this price it&#x27;s great for me.</li>
            <li> this product took way to long to arrive. would never order again!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I use it all the time for my foundation now. Definitely a cheap find and worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend anything at all, I thought it would compare to the beauty blender, but it&#x27;s horrible. It&#x27;s very hard, and it doesn&#x27;t even work well one bit. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This is a really rough sponge even when wet. Since it looks like the beauty blender, I thought it would be a dupe. If you use this for foundation, you&#x27;ll get the same finish if you were to apply it with your fingers. I waited a month to receive it and now I&#x27;m disappointed. It works to clean up makeup lines though.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell and was tore up with chunks missing when I got it.</li>
            <li> Great to touch up foundation makeup</li>
            <li> I like the shape of this makeup sponge as you can really get under your eyes with it! It is made of a durable substance and who can beat the price. I have only one concern and that is what this could be made of as it&#x27;s coming from a different country with different regulations than the US. It has an odor to it that arose this concern in me as we have to watch what we put on our face. All things considered though, we are putting the makeup on and not the sponge, so it will likely be fine. Again, it is actually a very high quality makeup sponge. Not huge like many I&#x27;ve seen. The other thing I like about this is that I think it&#x27;s very durable and will last a long time (definitely a plus). I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> At last I have received the sponges.  Nice and small.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> exactly as the picture</li>
            <li> I love love love this beauty blender! I was skeptical about buying it cause I&#x27;ve had the original beauty blender and I didn&#x27;t think the dupe was worth it but it absolutely was! Best dollar I&#x27;ve ever spent! Would recommend and I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing</li>
            <li> I love this sponges. Make-up applies more evenly. All I own now. No more brushes for me.</li>
            <li> It came on time and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Great for blending foundations and powders</li>
            <li> Took a month to get here but the price was great. I love pink and putting on make up,this is perfect.</li>
            <li> When this product came it was NOT wrapped at all! It only came in the ups package! It had this terrible smell that wouldn&#x27;t go away. Almost like burnt rubber mixed with sewage! I threw it away after a week of trying to get the odor out! I would not recommend this product to anyone! It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply make up</li>
            <li> just like the real one</li>
            <li> Great for touching up your face from oils and dirt.</li>
            <li> amazing! obviously ordering one again. 😂💕👌✊</li>
            <li> The shipping for this sponge took a while but I was pleased with the product after I received it. The sponge is a bit small but I  like that because it makes it extra easy to get my under eye concealer blended. I did, however, notice that using this sponge makes my foundation go a bit patchy around my mouth but a little buffing in with a flat top brush and it&#x27;s perfectly fine. Overall, it was great for the price!</li>
            <li> I Use It Everyday And Loving It !</li>
            <li> I love this sponge blender. It&#x27;s soft and works very well. For this price I totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend at all, just soaks up all your makeup...</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 for my sister and myself and we were not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;it blends like a dream and it great for getting in the corners of my nose and eye area. Very much worth the wait, and they&#x27;re also easy to clean. I&#x27;ll will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Loved this beauty blender and it was so cheap but works the same exact way an expensive one would work</li>
            <li> Does not absorb water and expand like expected</li>
            <li> Not what i expected. Soooo small and hard</li>
            <li> Disappointed with how long they took for just 2 sponges! I thought they would be bigger but I guess I get what I pay for.</li>
            <li> It is good, I like it but it has a weird smell. I don&#x27;t know if it is from the manufacture or the mailing but it seem okay after rinsing it.</li>
            <li> Really bad quality and a lot smaller than expected, it is not soft, nor does it expand. Feels nothing like the beauty blender. will not be using to apply makeup feels like I am punching myself in the face and it arrived with a really bad smell not sure you should be using this on your face anyway (does not state what it is made of or whether or not its hypoallergenic or even safe to use on the skin!)</li>
            <li> Makeup Blender arrived quick but the sponge had a distinct odor and no matter what I did I could not get rid of the smell.  When I used it to blend my makeup I would smell the odor on me all day so I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really as bouncy and like soft as the real bb. It doesn&#x27;t put on our makeup it picks it up. And it&#x27;s hard to squeeze .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as the regular beauty blender, doesn&#x27;t blend the makeup as smoothly. took almost a month to receive</li>
            <li> This was a cool buy!  If i could only perfect using it i would love it even more!</li>
            <li> Great!  Works wonderfully at blending</li>
            <li> Not the item pictured. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best beauty blender ive bought so far! thanks.</li>
            <li> great product will definetly purchase more and from this seller.</li>
            <li> Blender doesn&#x27;t expand when wet. However, it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive but it works great then the regular sponge. I am very happy to put on my foundation now. no more messy fingures and it covers very well, better then my brushes.</li>
            <li> smells really bad so it when on the garbage</li>
            <li> They took almost a month to arrive. When they finally arrived the sponges came with no wrapping, no box, nothing.  They came in just the usps plastic packaging. One of them look used! Seeing that they came in no wrapping I felt they were dirty, even the one that didn&#x27;t look dirty.  Not worth it I&#x27;ll be throwing them in the trash. HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product at all&lt;br /&gt;To hard to work with and small not even wet did the sponge got bigger or softer and it leaves an after smell on your face</li>
            <li> I know that because this cost 99 cents I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much from this product, but hey, I wanted to give it a go. So I purchased this and it came a few weeks after (3-4 weeks after I placed the order) and it arrived in minimal packaging (not like it needed any; it&#x27;s a sponge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this out dry and it didn&#x27;t do anything but soak up product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this the way a beauty blender is supposed to be used - damp - but it didn&#x27;t work. It did not expand at all, and it did nothing but soak up product. Plus, I don&#x27;t even think it got wet at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what exactly is this made of if it can&#x27;t soak up and retain atleast some water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! I literally opened the &amp;#34;package&amp;#34; and had to throw away. It was completely filthy and covered in black gunk, got my fingers dirty and I had to throw it away immediately. There goes a dollar literally to the trash!!!</li>
            <li> What? No. Even if you&#x27;re starting out, no. It does NOT expand when damp and it is too small to use practically. I am absolutely baffled about the good reviews. Literally laughed out loud when I read this was a dupe for a beauty blender. (and it smelled like extremely strong chemicals when it arrived and even after I washed it) into the trash it goes..</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to arrive but once I got it I was thrilled. I love the way it blends my makeup I can contour better with it its soft yet firm very durable id definitely purchase it again awesome product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. When I wet it, it was still hard and just absorb all the make up. Don&#x27;t spend your money on this.</li>
            <li> excellent product and what can I say about the price wow</li>
            <li> Well, hubby is worried there is chemicals in this and has made me nervous to use, so I now use it in my artist studio to blend watercolor, pastels and acrylics LOL works perfect. I guess I should have thought about what it is made with when I ordered it, and YOU really should too, there could be lead or whatever in this, because it does come from China, and you dont want any kind of bad chemicals coming in contact with your skin or for you make-up artist, you might want to think about that as  well.  I&#x27;m sorry this is one product I cannot say I would recommend...</li>
            <li> I may not know a whole lot about make up but I do know what works for me and this little thing does wonders for me I love it</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY... price matches the quality...</li>
            <li> Not as good as the one I bought at Ulta, it doesn&#x27;t work well at all and just absorbs product.</li>
            <li> I love it... Smooth out my concealer n foundation really nice</li>
            <li> I JUST received these in the mail making the shipping time 14 days. They are GORGEOUS and exactly as pictured. Its firm and won&#x27;t fall apart quickly after a few washes. (I ordered six). The size is exactly as you see it on your screen and the color is about 1 shade deeper. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I expected but will for sure get the job done.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS AWESOME BEAUTYBLENDER</li>
            <li> I give 3 stars because it does the job although it is veeery hard. Not as the Beauty Blender that you damp it and is like a sponge.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as all the other name brand ones. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Took kind of a long time to get here but it is super soft and squishy. I have no complaints so far, also its pretty cheep!</li>
            <li> Perfect for me. Better quality than I ever expected. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If you think this is comparable to the beauty blender or real techniques sponge its not. This sponge was hard even after washing and damping. I gave it 2 stars BC I like the color and shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special , I&#x27;ve been doing makeup for years &amp; I&#x27;ve come across better sponges</li>
            <li> Well the single pink teardrop sponge I bought took quite awhile to get here but it still got here before its actual arrival date. It&#x27;s not bad quality but it&#x27;s definitely no Beauty Blender. For the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong. You can wet it just like the Beauty Blender and it will blend just fine.</li>
            <li> So much smaller than I imagined.</li>
            <li> The sponge is very comparable to the &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; and gives the same effect but will a very different price, on the other hand after a few uses the very tip of mine just came off, I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the price but it still works like a charm. took a little time to get here but after it did I cant put it down! so much better than my brushes!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter.  She liked it but commented that it was smaller than the one she uses that she bought from Avon.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Very good, very fluffy and pretty tough, it is antiallergic material.</li>
            <li> It was much smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> its so tiny and it works very well i am in love c: , it took about a month to get here but other than that i am extremely happy with this , i will be coming back to buy more !</li>
            <li> This is awesome! It took forever to get to here but for a whole buck fifty I really can&#x27;t complain. I like the size which is not as large as others or as small. It blends great! It took me a bit to figure it out but that was me not the blender  (it&#x27;s pretty straightforward lol). You can build coverage easily and it works well with my thicker  concealer  The cleaning it was the tricky part I use a mild bar soap and you can wash it and squeeze it BUT it will still have take the sponge and press it hard into a towel or washcloth to get all of the make up out. I love it. They sell similar ones at Target for $5. next time I think I&#x27;ll order several.</li>
            <li> Small, but works nicely and very cheap</li>
            <li> It took forever to get the product and this is no beauty blender. It&#x27;s just a sponge.</li>
            <li> Makes blending much easier!!!!</li>
            <li> A neat little blender tool. It doesn&#x27;t absorb water the way it should and when water is applied has a rubbery feel.  Other then that it was okay, I didn&#x27;t see too much difference from this tool and a drug store cosmetics sponges.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It does exactly what I want it to do! Perfect buy!</li>
            <li> Ordered this 3 months ago. No one has gotten back to me. That pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Junk, you get what you pay for.  Its not a blender sponge, it doesn&#x27;t swell when placed in water and it just absorbs and eat up all your makeup.  Also its shipped from China so it takes forever to get it.</li>
            <li> eh, didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb water well or expand in size, pretty hard on my face.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and works wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT a beauty blender! It doesn&#x27;t absorb water very well so it is not very soft neither does it blend liquid makeup well. Go to walgreens or cvs and buy their sponge it lasts forever if u wash it with soap and it&#x27;s sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> Really bad it&#x27;s been more thAn month ..&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it. And it Came at my first expected delivery date! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for a very low price.  Worth the wait for shipping.</li>
            <li> When I went to Sephora to pick this blending sponge up it was so expensive. So I hit up Amazon and of course there was this version that I just had to try and I&#x27;m very pleased that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product it blends so effortlessly, and the sponge material is so soft on my skin. I have sensitive skin and most of the pads and sponges I used before tend to feel rough. However, this was very smooth. I like that I can just wash it, reuse it, and it doesn&#x27;t peel off like the cheap stuff. I love these. I will definitely get more in other shapes and colors.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok . i think its good f use for contour though i dont use it much ..i use my fingers instead lol :D</li>
            <li> I did not notice any smell like past reviews stated. The item works great blending and is equal to my dermablend one.</li>
            <li> Worst sponge ever. It&#x27;s so hard and doesn&#x27;t even get damp, the water just runs off of it.</li>
            <li> Cheap cheap don&#x27;t buy, waste of money they aren&#x27;t anything like a beauty blender</li>
            <li> I got this not too long ago I was so excited to try it out because I thought it would be good but its not :/ you get what you paid for its not soft even if you soak it in water. Not worth buying it. I regret it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that the shape I received does not match the picture shown. I was anticipating a wider base, like the picture, but I received a smaller looking sponge with a round bottom. Also, for as long as it took to reach me in the U.S., I would have been better off buying a sponge at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> It took a little while but I was a little disappointed that it was really small and it doesn&#x27;t expand when you wet it.  I&#x27;m still trying to get use to it and play around with it but over all its compact and does the job.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the real beauty blender(doesn&#x27;t absorb water nor expand) but does what it is suppose to do and it&#x27;s cheap. ordered from the seller twice. comes within its time frame.</li>
            <li> Too hard and it doesn&#x27;t spend like the original bb.... Nothing can substitute the amazing BB</li>
            <li> i dont like it one bit.its hard its awful and it doesn&#x27;t blend.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get mine yesterday! Ordered a loooong time ago... very disappointed, really was looking forward to trying it out!</li>
            <li> Not the real deal, you get what you pay for. It felt like rubber and didn&#x27;t expand when i put it in water. I rather stick to the $20 beauty blender from Sephora.</li>
            <li> its an okay product besides the fact that it broke me out terribly other than that its okay</li>
            <li> Very small, I expected it to be bigger and smoother at applying foundation. I would definitely not buy again.</li>
            <li> Tinier than I expected, but does the job. The bright color makes it easy to find in your cosmetics bag.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife she loves it. They were smaller than she expected but they work</li>
            <li> Horrible! Spend the extra two dollars and buy one at CVS or a local drugstore or just a makeup place of your choice. Its not worth waiting over a month for!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.. long time to recieve.. and started flaking as washed. The beauty blender did not soak up water like expected and i had to look up directions on youtube for use.</li>
            <li> I got this knowing that it was cheap and that it wasn&#x27;t going to be the beauty blender but i was hoping it would be better than it was. it&#x27;s my fault really for expecting a 1 something dollar product to compare to the actual thing, and to make it worse it smells pretty awful and the smell seemed to transfer to my face even after washing the thing before application. I&#x27;m just going to but the actual beauty blender i definitely learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> Ive been using these for about 2 years now and I am in love!!  They take a while to get here so I usually order a few.  I have used one I think for an entire year and that&#x27;s when it starts to come apart.  Not complaining though it got a lot of use lol.</li>
            <li> just got it in and used it and i am in love ,way better than the little foundation sponge squares,and made my application a breeze</li>
            <li> i love this beauty blender dupe! applies my concealer perfectly &amp; is affordable.</li>
            <li> Very useful, blends pretty well</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and is angled perfectly for covering up under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Love these for the price. Apply foundation with them all the time.</li>
            <li> Its ok doesn&#x27;t blend well in my opinion.shipping was a bit long say about  three weeks  too long for a simple sponge.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Good quality, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of this makeupsponge on my face, it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> This was just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. I have used other Beauty Blender knock-offs in the past and found this one to be the worst of them all, even tho it does apply my make-up but in no way does it compare to my Beauty Blender but for the price, I cannot complain too bad</li>
            <li> Love the shape. It works great with applications under the eyes. Its sturdy unlike other makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like the description</li>
            <li> for the price, good.  not typical beauty blender, though.  needs lotion/oil to blend well-or else it is rather difficult as the material clings to the skin</li>
            <li> Awful, super cheap felt like a rubber ball against my face!</li>
            <li> shipping takes forever, but works as well as the sephora ones.. just about 10 times cheaper</li>
            <li> Obviously, at this price, this sponge isn&#x27;t going to compare to the Beauty Blender. I figured I was going to get a decent, run-of-the-mill makeup sponge that would be a little better than the wedge-shaped ones that come in a big pack for a few bucks. Instead, I found that this sponge was far too dense and stiff, even when wet, to even try to apply foundation with. It also soaked up an huge amount of foundation that didn&#x27;t make it on my skin, which was frustrating, because I felt like I was wasting a ton of product.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible sponge. It&#x27;s hard and it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> love it. i dont see myself using anything else</li>
            <li> Product is great have not yet used it but compared to the price and the ones I have bought for $5 in stores here this one is way better it feels super nice, only complain would be that for a $2 product I ordered it sept. 26 and received it oct. 20 almost a month later way too long of a wait. IF not b/c of this I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> very nice sponge for blending makeup lightly. I recommend it for temporary usage. I just got it and used it earlier. Nice.</li>
            <li> Perfect! It was everything I expected!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first beauty blender, and isn&#x27;t quite what I expected. The key to using this is to apply your foundation or BB cream by hand, (and concealer, primer. bronzer.) Once you&#x27;ve evened it out a lot with your fingers you can blend it some more with a brush. Once you&#x27;ve done that this helps with the pesky blending between your undereye concealer or transitioning between parts of the face like between the cheeks and the bottom of the nose. Tricky to blend with your brush kind of places. If you use it to take the place of your hands or brush in that scenario you get the problem of the sponge absorbing most of what you are applying and you&#x27;ll end up wasting a lot of product as well as saturating the sponge so you&#x27;ll have to throw it out more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your blush, eyeshadow, etcetera should be applied once your base is completely blended in. You shouldn&#x27;t use the sponge on those at all. It will put some of your colorful makeup on next time you try to finish your foundation and that&#x27;s really no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape is useful. The point gets difficult areas and the rounded end is comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this, but you have to use it what it was meant for, and basically it doesn&#x27;t really do that much so it&#x27;s kind of an optional part of your beauty toolkit as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Maybe if you really focus on your base and do contouring and stuff this will be useful, but I just put a thin layer of base on to minimize a bit of redness in my complexion and sometimes I don&#x27;t even bother with my base layer so this seems like an unnecessary tool for me.</li>
            <li> When I first saw these I thought... whatever.  Just trying to get you to spend more money.  Use a regular sponge.  Hmm, I was wrong.  I use this for almost everything.  I put on my foundation.  Then I put on my powder.  It gives me a flawless look.</li>
            <li> These beauty blenders are awesome! Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. Many people don&#x27;t know how to use them properly. You need to wet them with cold water and squeeze them while it&#x27;s under the water (6-7 times) and then you squeeze all the excess water out so you can use it. It leaves my foundation looking flawless and the pointy part works really well for the under eye area. When using it, bounce it on your skin instead of just rubbing it. That way, the foundation can settle in nicely. I use dish soap and olive oil to clean it and leaves it looking like brand new. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase :)</li>
            <li> love it, blends well and the price was awesome!</li>
            <li> This product takes FOREVER to receive but it works just like the real thing. Id order 2 or 3 so you don&#x27;t have to wait months for a new one.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work like the beauty blender at all. doesn&#x27;t expand when wet.. not a good sponge</li>
            <li> It does the job. Only recommend for beginners to use.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly. Great item for a great price.</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday, thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product especially for the price. Blends perfectly with minimal effort. It&#x27;s small which is a plus for me. The size allows me to have a firm grip on the sponge and also makes it easy to store in my makeup bag. Shipping took a while but other than that I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Would buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a blending sponge for a while now and I did not want to pay the full price for a Beauty Blender so for less then 2 bucks I decided to try this one out. I honestly hated it, it did not blend well at all and it just soaked up product. You get what you&#x27;re paying for basically and for two dollars I&#x27;m not extremely disappointed,  however, I will not repurchase this and I suggest you shouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> Like it but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get soft when you put water on it</li>
            <li> This shipped faster then expected and worked well but I felt like most of my foundation was sucked up in this rather then on my face. All in all pretty comparable to the Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li> Terrible!!!! Way too hard not spongy do not buy</li>
            <li> I normally pay $5 for these but this one works just as good as the ones that I have. It&#x27;s firm and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the price.You can&#x27;t go wrong with this it works like a pro.Make up stores sell them for $20 when u can get them at this price.They just take months to come.</li>
            <li> Took forever to ship but I like it.</li>
            <li> My fav! Love this. Only thing is took way to long to come.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. And I really like it</li>
            <li> Even after you get it wet, it stays hard and TINY. It also smells horid. Smells kinda like sulfur.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is not anything like the one I purchased before from amazon.  It&#x27;s not absorbing the water enough to hydrate it. There for keeping all product in it. Takes a bit to work with.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as a $20 beauty blender and is a mere fraction of the price. I love it!</li>
            <li> Easily to use foundation now.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all. Sponge does not expand when wet. Applies foundation just ok, but not great like that other beauty sponge dupes. Will not purchase again!</li>
            <li> Just what i needed.  Sponge not that cheap foam.  Other name brand have the same exact thing, but sell them for 20 dollars.  These are cheaper, and pink.  Love them.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! Definitely Buy it!! Leaves your skin looking flawless! Someone asked me if I got Botox and I replied &amp;#34;no, beauty blender!&amp;#34; Perfect size!!! :)</li>
            <li> I finally got mine after a month, but it&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s not as great as the beauty blender, the sponge was harsh and rough even wet. &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t clean as easy. If you have the extra money for the beauty blender this product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Item as described, Fast Shipping, A++++</li>
            <li> I thought that it was a soft sponge not a rubber sponge......rubber sponge is not what I want to apply make up</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying you have to wait a pretty long time for this item. Also, was unimpressed that my package was ripped open and resealed with an apology letter. That part was unprofessional but was a mistake on the postal services part. The good things about this makeup blender are that its actually bigger than I thought it would be. At least the height of my thumb and very buoyant and shapeable. It had a strange smell, and it was a little rough at first, but once you start using it regularly it gets easier to blend and use on your face. Sometimes the makeup looks a little splotchy, but I&#x27;m not a professional. Also, make sure you&#x27;re putting water on your blender before you apply your makeup onto it! That will make it easier to apply! I think this is a decent product for only a dollar fifty. If you want something that really works though, splurge and buy the real one!</li>
            <li> Awesome Coverage. 4 stars only because it took a while to ship but other than that it had very good coverage and worked very well with A little water added</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month and I still haven&#x27;t gotten this item yet. I went ahead and bought one from target. Once I wet it and spray my Fix + spray from MAC it blends everything VERY well. Ladies don&#x27;t waste your time, just go buy one today from target. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> loved it! Took a long time to arrive but I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.</li>
            <li> Great item, bought it twice!!!</li>
            <li> And it blends everything nicely, but it has  this slight rubber smell, and it didn&#x27;t expand under water like the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It was okay. I&#x27;m not sure if the product is worth all the hype it receives in the beauty community but, for the price I was pleased. If you have a few dollars to spare and want to try it out I say go for it. There&#x27;s a 50/50 chance you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly &amp; easy to wash</li>
            <li> My makeup application is truly flawless with this beauty blender. It&#x27;s small but it&#x27;s a great size to keep in its ziplock plastic pouch and take with you in your purse for touch ups throughout the day if needed. Definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> Great quality / design.</li>
            <li> The ideal time to apply makeup complemto , this product should not miss in the case of cosmesticos . Its softness allows evenly distribute makeup base . It is small and you can carry around . Great product with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard as crap, it doesn&#x27;t get bigger when water is absorbed in it. If you expect it to be like beauty blender do not get it. Invest in the real product, the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Love love this blender!!! I am a believer now!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> it kind of smell like rubber</li>
            <li> I love it i ordered three!!</li>
            <li> Cheap and couldn&#x27;t use it. It not the same like the one i bought from Sephora. It hard and won&#x27;t &amp;#34;suck up water&amp;#34; as it&#x27;d supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It was not bad. You have to remember it&#x27;s only $1.50. Didn&#x27;t expanded when wet but did a good job blending. The worst thing is how long it takes to get. I waited 44 days!!!!!!</li>
            <li> love it soooooo much!! it blends perfectly and i am thinking about buying  one more.</li>
            <li> these are absolutely fantastic for blending, especially in uses of stage makeup foundation application</li>
            <li> the worst blender ever it hard and doesnt clean easy at all DONT BUY.</li>
            <li> I love this blender. Short and sweet. Works perfect.</li>
            <li> I do not have the original beauty blender so nothing to compare this to, but this does the trick for me. I use it to apply my concealer and it works amazingly  In this video I use it if you would like to see how it works etc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kQXMxrE2a70</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad . Much smaller then I thought &amp; I know it won&#x27;t last .</li>
            <li> wish is grow in water like the beauty blender but not bad i dont use water because it seam to wash my face not put make up on</li>
            <li> i love these i use them on my makeup kit and i love them and they so affordable that i can buy many of them for my client</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a beauty blender but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like... so I ordered this one. And guess what...? I love it! I will never go back to using ordinary sponges again. And the price on this cannot be beat. I can&#x27;t say enough good about this blender. I&#x27;ve used it damp, I&#x27;ve used it dry. I&#x27;ve used it for foundation, concealer, as a smudger for eyeliner... this little beauty does it all, and it holds up really well! I&#x27;ve washed it several times and the texture is still just like new. No pitting or pilling like I&#x27;ve read about with some other beauty blenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this one again!</li>
            <li> These are actually knock offs. Still ok for $1 though.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was promised.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time. easy to use, good quality, but difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I would say same as one of those triangle sponges you get in a bag. The great thing about the beauty blender is it&#x27;s pores. This is not like a real beauty blender because it is not as porous and you do not get the same finish. It blends. Just not the same is thats what you think your getting.</li>
            <li> I got this a year later</li>
            <li> Very low quality.. Received them and two of them were stripped</li>
            <li> This thing is so cool!  Use it every single day to blend my concealer.  Easy to wash and actually a cute makeup accessory.</li>
            <li> Great product! , i ordered this 2 weeks ago &amp; i have it !</li>
            <li> I personally would NOT use this for foundation, because when you wet it, it doesn&#x27;t expand. It stays the size (which is VERY tiny).&lt;br /&gt;I use it for trouble areas or applying concealer around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wanting an actual Beauty Blender to apply foundation to your entire face, do not purchase this.</li>
            <li> A great and smooth blender, very useful for ladies . I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but it seemed really hard.  Even after wetting it, it didn&#x27;t seem to expand or get soft.  Think I&#x27;ll need to try it out a bit more and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> Never going to order again.&lt;br /&gt;they gave me the sponge all dirty &amp; with holes plus it&#x27;s super small.</li>
            <li> I order this product and I totally enjoy using this , it works good.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible</li>
            <li> This product is great for the price. It definitely does its job.  Its very small compared to what you see in the picture.  Overall, I like it, it blends in my makeup well.</li>
            <li> Super cute, super good, super cheap</li>
            <li> Not a fan. went back to regular drugstore wedges.</li>
            <li> Got it today works amazing. Said i would get it at the end of July.  Love the color blends amazing</li>
            <li> This was delivered with no packaging and had an awful smell. Seriously, I&#x27;m now supposed to use this (unsanitary) sponge on my clean face?  No way!!  What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Works great shippin was faster then expected</li>
            <li> love it :) worth the money</li>
            <li> Just wish it was bigger in size but I do enjoy the results I achieve with this product.</li>
            <li> The quality is actually good it does its job. The bad thing about this sponge though is that its TOO SMALL its probably half the size of a regular sized beauty sponge therefore takes longer to do your makeup. I can see it working for concealing under eyes but not for my foundation which that&#x27;s what it was intended for it&#x27;s honestly just way too small to take on that job.</li>
            <li> Soft and durable sponge.</li>
            <li> Nice foundation applicator.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get here but other than that it applys smoothly and keeps my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help me highlight and contour it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> I love the color pink. Now that I have 2 sponges at my house. My cosmetics case has everything I need to put on my make up and blend it when needed. I love this.</li>
            <li> Just a normal sponge, nothing special. I would rather use my hand.</li>
            <li> Cute, small , soft and affordable! Very good for makeup love it!!</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s great for the price applies my makeup evenly</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to ship but so far I am very impressed. It is very soft but a little small. Overall I think it is a great dupe for the beauty blender at a great price!</li>
            <li> I use it to blend in my concealer and it&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s not as soft as the beauty blender so it was soak up of the product.</li>
            <li> I feel like it sucks up a lot of my foundation. And thought it was flat not circular the whole way around. It&#x27;s good for blending around my nose and eyes.</li>
            <li> It is not as easy because the shape of it</li>
            <li> very good, cheaper alternative to the beauty blender</li>
            <li> Not at all like a beauty blender! It is hard, and doesn&#x27;t swell much with water application. Has uses for some things, but perhaps not for foundation,</li>
            <li> This is like using a rock to apply your makeup. Tried it once and tossed it.</li>
            <li> Works great. It does have that &amp;#34;packaging&amp;#34; smell so definitely wash it thoroughly before use. My one and only complaint is the time it took to get to my house! Almost a 2 month wait!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this! It&#x27;s my go to tool for foundation!</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I expected, but that actually helps it work better for me since i have small features.</li>
            <li> My sister loved this! but it is smaller then I expected it to be.😁</li>
            <li> Almost exactly like the beauty blender</li>
            <li> i really love this beauty blender its amazing i will repurchas this again amazing for any type of skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay not as awesome as I thought it&#x27;d be but I got it for .89 can&#x27;t go wrong with that! It&#x27;s a bit hard but it does an okay job I still use it. The only thing that sucked was it took about a month to get here so I was excited, but when I used it I was like I waited this long for this... Lol</li>
            <li> Great little makeup blender so worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought two from this seller a pink one that looks like a beauty blender and a purple one with a different shape. I thought maybe by the mix reviews I would try them out for less that $5 for both seems like a steal! If they actually did what a beauty blender does right? Unfortunately these DO NOT do anything a beauty blender does other than look like one. The beauty blender doubles in size by absorbing water like a sponge it&#x27;s not science. These sponges don&#x27;t even absorb water! (Yeah I know a sponge that does not absorb?) Which means they don&#x27;t double in size. Therefore not blending makeup on your face. If you have the original beauty blender you would understand.  I thought maybe I should still try them out so I did and when I started to pat my foundation on it seriously just stuck on to the sponge instead of blending on my face like an original beauty blender. I&#x27;m not upset by this purchase, more than I am about the reviews. I knew it was a risk buying these but I don&#x27;t understand how anybody could use these for anything?  I won&#x27;t try anything else I&#x27;ll just buy another original beauty blender instead.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap but I did get it for my make up bag to touch up which is perfect cause I didn&#x27;t wanna pay $10 for something that&#x27;s gonna get ugly faster since it&#x27;s in my bag.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Shipping time was expected. Easy to hold, much thicker than my other ones but works pretty well</li>
            <li> thought it was gna be bigger but other than tht it works great!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE! Great for blending.</li>
            <li> The sponge is small but it get the job done.</li>
            <li> Literally just a rubber ball.  Hard to spread the makeup around. Better off with the orange sponge from technique that i got from ulta.</li>
            <li> Never used the sponge before. Love how the foundation comes out from just dabbing.</li>
            <li> Tiny. Useful. Works great.</li>
            <li> terrible make up sponge</li>
            <li> I usually use the original beauty blenders. But said let me try these to see, cause of the price and other reviews. ... Unfortunately I was disappointed. .. It&#x27;s very hard, even when it&#x27;s wet. So I won&#x27;t be using them. .</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender and blend your make up so flawless I will recommend</li>
            <li> Bought it and its awsome!! Why didn&#x27;t I get one before??¿ . Thank you</li>
            <li> I love the even and lightweight finish I get with the blender.  Applying foundation with water makes my face feel refreshed as the foundation dries and seemingly becomes one with the skin.</li>
            <li> Sponge is smaller than I expected but I love it! Waaaayyyy cheaper than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I used it once and never used it for the second time. It arrives with minimum package. It does not absorb water and expand like the beauty blender. I can only say that you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> very small but gets the job done. Doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water but for the price it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Horrible sponge!!!!!! Please don&#x27;t waste your money. I was really excited to get this sponge based on the great reviews and it sucked. The sponge smells and doesn&#x27;t EXPAND! What so ever! Really hate this sponge.</li>
            <li> worst decision i ever made in life!! the sponge (if you could call it that) does not expand! it does not exsorb water its just a replica  that smells strange...PLEASE DO NOT BUY....OH it took weeks for these worthless sponges to arrive!</li>
            <li> Great product, works much better than a foundation brush. Shipping does take a while, but it&#x27;s well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I love it, will be ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li> This helps smooth out your makeup</li>
            <li> This did not give me a flawless finish and it soaked up all the product, even when I dampened it with water before.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much that can go wrong with this product. It does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> B/c I never tried the real version I am not sure about this so call beauty blender. It&#x27;s just like a regular sponge in my opinion. I can&#x27;t really complain for the price I paid. I do think it soaks up a lot of product. It&#x27;s very mini, I like it better dry. The shipping was actually faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Love this applicator.</li>
            <li> these came from china.  they were squished into a little envlelope and were dirty. really ridiculous....maybe I could clean my tiles with them if I were I were a little troll</li>
            <li> Great sponge for the price, shipping too a little while but that was to be expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is what is on description. I enjoyed it. Good product.</li>
            <li> I personally do not like it because to me, it doesn&#x27;t apply the makeup as seamlessly as I thought it would (or as I&#x27;ve been hearing). I used it a couple times and noticed that all it does is suck up the concealer and that&#x27;s about it. Considering the price, I guess I got what I paid for, oh well.</li>
            <li> such a waist of money. It&#x27;s nothing like a beauty blender not even close to other dupes of beauty blender. This does not blend any makeup. it&#x27;s too hard and small and no it does not get softer after you soak in water either.</li>
            <li> Works well! Good for the price, just took a little long to receive.</li>
            <li> love it. it&#x27;s worth the wait because they&#x27;re so much cheaper than retail stores and sites</li>
            <li> Great Use! Took a while to recieve but it works great! Blending couldnt be easier!</li>
            <li> It is cheap and nice, but just took long time on shipping.</li>
            <li> im currently using it with a powder and it pics up quite a bit DRY, theres really no need to wet it. full coverage. awesome.</li>
            <li> hard to clean but easy to use.</li>
            <li> its ok it doesn&#x27;t blend any better than my usual blending sponge</li>
            <li> It smelled weird and I should have invested in something better.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product really soft and blends my makeup in really well totally recommend it to people.</li>
            <li> this item works, but I personally do not like how hard it is.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect and is the same as the more expensive brands...definitely a must get item!!! It delivered quickly too</li>
            <li> Makes makeup application easy and will make you finished look flawless,</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 2015 : I am revising my review. I guess every ones skin tone is different.. I used this the other day to apply foundation but I used it DRY not wet and it went on flawlessy, actually pretty good. I don&#x27;t like it when it&#x27;s wet though. I know beauty blenders are a fad now but not all skin is made the same, if you want a dewy finish then wet the sponge , but with this specific sponge I don&#x27;t think it will turn out too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When its dry it gives a more matte finish, which is what I want.</li>
            <li> Stiff.  Doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of water.  Falls apart after a few uses.  If you wear makeup every day, may not be good for u.</li>
            <li> Penelope D.&lt;br /&gt;I really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again. Thanks..</li>
            <li> After the 2nd time washing it it started to crack, so if I purchased again I would buy at least 10 since there only a little over 1 $ still cheaper than The Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected i love it !</li>
            <li> This is great it has the same feeling as a regual beauty blender it worked the same but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same size as the regular but it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is great for makeup application.  It really is good.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Used it once and never used it again, it leaves marks and it doesn&#x27;t help you blend your make up well.</li>
            <li> just what i needed.  it works great.</li>
            <li> This blender had a really off smell when I first opened, almost like hamster urine (I raise hamsters that is how I know, I&#x27;m not a weirdo). I left it out of the package for a few hours and the smell is almost gone. I used it for the first time yesterday and it gets the job done. This is the first one that I have ever used, so I don&#x27;t know if there is suppose to be something magical about this product or not. I can say that it blended and contoured quickly and easily and that is all I expected! I love it.</li>
            <li> it was ok for the price. now that i know more about these. it does have a bad smell but im sure it can be washed</li>
            <li> The sponge didn&#x27;t swell when wetted and it was hard to use on the face.  It didn&#x27;t blend or apply my foundation and concealer at all!</li>
            <li> Took way too long to deliver and it&#x27;s hard, even when it&#x27;s damp. Wayy too hard on my face compared to the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Did what I wanted and more. I will order much more from them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving to this four stars cause i had to wait to much for it</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay $20 for a sponge, yet at the same time I was curious as I&#x27;ve seen many of Youtube &amp;quot;gurus&amp;quot; praise this expensive sponge.  So I did a search and found the $1.50 version :)  It&#x27;s nice I suppose.  Very firm.  I don&#x27;t use it for foundation but I do use it for adding highlighter to my cheeks and forehead.  For $1.50 I have no complaints.  But for $20 I would have had a TON of complaints!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the sponge is &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> this is really hard not like the original one</li>
            <li> Positives and negatives like any other sponge or product you are going to get. But after previously buying many other sponges I&#x27;m rather in between on the quality. It works just as well as some of the more expensive ones that I have, but it&#x27;s small so I only use it for concealer otherwise it takes too long and doesn&#x27;t seem to cover well. All-in-all I do like it especially for the price point and that there wasn&#x27;t excessive packaging.</li>
            <li> it works well. i have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> a bit bigger than expected but thats not a problem</li>
            <li> This is a tiny blender, it&#x27;s texture is more comparable to cheap sponges that you can buy at drugstores. It&#x27;s nice for small areas like around the eyes and nose but otherwise it&#x27;s just meh. It&#x27;s not really a waste of money considering its dirt cheap but it took over a month to arrive, it&#x27;s just not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Love love this product . I got 2 and they are just amazing and the price is great and it came in right on time .</li>
            <li> It was rubber like what you would use on ur feet I would never use on my face not sure I got the right thing</li>
            <li> took 3 weeks to get it, works fair, bulky and has to be cleaned often. wouldn&#x27;t purhase again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for applying make up. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great sponge easy to use.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Perfect! Great price! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use this slightly damp especially to blend out my concealer! Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> everyone who says this is nothing like the beauty blender is RIGHT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is horrible....FEELS LIKE RUBBER, THUMBS DOWN!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A lot harder then real beauty blender, doesn&#x27;t mix in makeup as well as the BB</li>
            <li> (Bf account) Okay makeup sponge. I use too much  product than with a brush. Doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the beauty blender. I have only used so called dupes so can&#x27;t really compare it to the beauty blender. This is smaller than other similar cheaper sponges that I have bought before and since and the cheapest. I use it for applying foundation (sides and bottom) and under eye concealer (pointed tip) and it does the job very well whether I use it slightly damp or dry. Highly recommend. I was expecting it to arrive in at least a month but was surprised when it arrived in about 3 weeks since I think it was being sent from somewhere in Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take to long to clean either which I do every other day using African black soap which I have found to be the best for cleaning these sponges. I definitely recommend this and would buy again except that I found another of these &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; which is a little more expensive than this but which I like a little better.</li>
            <li> Excellent sellers. I recommend 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neyeska.</li>
            <li> NOT VERY HAPPY it wasent the ones i thought it was</li>
            <li> To hard, felt like I was beating my self up with it</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the Beauty Blender. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try one, but I was NOT going to pay $20 for a makeup sponge. It gave me amazing, natural coverage with no streaks like a flat foundation brush does. Tips for use: wet sponge with water, squeeze out excess, dip in foundation, and buff on your face. Use the tip for around the nose and under the eyes.</li>
            <li> U get what u pay for pretty much this one I got suck!!</li>
            <li> this is an okay blender. i don&#x27;t have the original, so i don&#x27;t have a comparison, but this works fine for me as just a normal makeup sponge. i have some trouble cleaning the makeup off it though afterwards</li>
            <li> Shipping took way too long. Product wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Even when added water to it it stays firm</li>
            <li> AWESOME QUALITY AND SUPER CHEAP &amp; CUTE !</li>
            <li> awesome for putting on makeup in one wsecond!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but others compared it to Beauty Blender... not even close.  Still, better than some and ok if you&#x27;re just starting to use makeup.  Shipping was slower than expected.</li>
            <li> The price is great, but the blending is a little hard and the sponge is not as soft as name brand ones. This sponge is a rough on the skin</li>
            <li> It  makes your skin look so natural! Amazing!</li>
            <li> I use this blender to apply my concealer and it works really well</li>
            <li> Not as good as the one that I bought at target, once I started using this one it started to pile a little bit after multiple uses. You get what you pay for in this instance. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product no complaints herei would recommend to anyone looking to blender contour their face</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock save your dollar</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! Don&#x27;t ever believe that this is comparable to the original Beauty Blender (BB). I have been using the BB for more than 2 years now and I love it. For $15  a sponge it was getting to be expensive. But I was ready to order another one when I saw this less than 2 bucks Makeup Blender and decided to buy 5 which I thought would still be cheaper than one BB. I just received my Makeup Blender after ordering it a month ago and was excited to try my inexpensive makeup sponge. But, alas, it was no Beauty Blender in function, softness and ease of use. Like one reviewer pointed out here, it didnt expand after wetting them with water nor blend my make-up well. It just absorbed my makeup. Now I have 5 egg-shaped sponges that I have no use for, except probably as a crafting material for the next Easter. So save yourself the wait, money and hassle. Don&#x27;t buy this product if you are looking for the same function that the real Beauty Blender provides.</li>
            <li> great blender fits right in my hand</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. It&#x27;s a dollar, what ya gonna do about?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I had expected, but it sure does the job well.</li>
            <li> Blends well, but not sure how you&#x27;re supposed to clean it!?!</li>
            <li> Im not sure if its because is not an original beauty blender , but the sponge is kinda hard and it took more than a month to arrive</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Only difference from original is the size. I like it a little smaller. Easier to use and can get into small areas. Very soft. Cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> I do not like this make up blender. It is not very soft, it absorbs more makeup than it applies and it is very small. I recently bought another makeup blender at Charlotte Russe for $5.00, and it works much better than the one I bought from here. The good thing about this product is that it was only a dollar so I didn&#x27;t really waste much and I&#x27;m glad i tried it, so now i know what to look for in a makeup blender next time I purchase one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, I love it so much !</li>
            <li> Not to use with face paint but for makeup is nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alright. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the specific sponge I don&#x27;t like, or if I simply prefer just using my hands to apply my makeup. it is nice quality though. and for this price i thought why not give it a try!</li>
            <li> It got dirty very fast and was stained the 1st time I used it and no matter how hard I tried cleaning it, I couldn&#x27;t get the stains out. It was a nice applicator though and great for the price!</li>
            <li> Works great but smells awful.</li>
            <li> Took well over two months to arrive but work the same as the original bb that cists $20</li>
            <li> Exactly how it was decribed on site</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok but not what I thought it was</li>
            <li> Love this tool for smoothing out makeup</li>
            <li> This sponge is great. It allows me to apply and blend my make up like a pro. It has given me the confidence to try some of the YouTube tutorials i have watched, and I have accomplished. It&#x27;s shape allows you to blend with make up with ease. It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and it helps you get full coverage of your make up.</li>
            <li> Great blender but just a tad bit small</li>
            <li> I was little let down because I thought  I was getting two different kind instead both was alight</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here and when I got it it looked used</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smaller than what I was expecting but I absolutely love it. it blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> While the blender doesn&#x27;t expand like the original BB, it is made of quite a soft material as well as no odor as other buyers seem to have experienced. To get the blender to absorb water you need to squeeze it while wetting it, again won&#x27;t expand, but this also doesn&#x27;t allow makeup to soak into the blender.&lt;br /&gt;Good product. After I bought my first I purchased another as backup.</li>
            <li> my obsession for contouring</li>
            <li> Horrid. I thought this would be a beauty blender dupe. Heck no! First of all, they are tiny size, The pic is deceiving. Second, they don&#x27;t expand and get soft when you wet it. It&#x27;s a hard stale tiny pink &amp;#34;makeup sponge&amp;#34; that feels hard when patting on your face. Oh and it pulls off my foundation when I pat it on my face to blend. Please don&#x27;t get these. They don&#x27;t work at all and are too tiny to fit in your hands.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges, they are perfect in every way</li>
            <li> I love this little thing its great for blending</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected. Doesn&#x27;t even get larger once wet. It took forever to get sent to me, and was in transit for over a month.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Beauty Blender dupe, this is not it.  It is about the same size (dry) as one, but it never softens nor expands when wet.  As inexpensive as it is, I still wanted to find a use for it and not just throw it away.  I am using it to tap ou my cream blush.  Works ok for that, but it was not useful for the purpose I bought it for... Applying makeup.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done ok the only thing I wish it was a little more softer other then that its ok sponge. Shipping was fine too.</li>
            <li> Very hard and didn&#x27;t absorb water or got larger when wet.</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough yet, but it feels pretty firm, good quality</li>
            <li> I like this product to use around the eyes</li>
            <li> VERY STIFF. Not soft like the real beauty blender. WOULD NOT BUY again. Doesn&#x27;t blend well at all. Waste of time and money</li>
            <li> The reviews had me second guessing my purchase. It&#x27;s not hard at all, makes me question if people are using it correctly... Its very small. I&#x27;m excited to use it</li>
            <li> Got for wife and now I am the Man.  She loves this expensive thing.  All that matters.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS SOOO WELL! As a makeup artist the blending sponge is an excellent way to blend your foundation and concealor all together. This product is cheap and is a MUST!</li>
            <li> It finally arrived.  It was in good condition.  Works just as well as the $20.00 one, but only cost $1.50!  Very cool!  Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is amazing I use it everyday and never fails it&#x27;s perfect took a while to get here but worth it</li>
            <li> I love it!!! It&#x27;s perfect for contouring and highlighting or just blending in your foundation</li>
            <li> WORST thing I have ever ordered. Took 3 months to ship &amp; came with mold inside &amp; outside of the bag!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. For the price I guess you can say it does the job. However, for me personally it is too small. I also feel like no matter how much I moisten it it is still too hard for me. If you do not want to pay for a beauty blender (like myself), I recommend just paying 4 dollars more and going to ulta and buying the real techniques complexion sponge. I actually prefer that to a real beauty blender!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Its shape helps in applying makeup evenly in difficult places on face.  Hand washable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made, it feels like a rubber ball and do not blend my makeup out. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> It caused my face to break out when I used it to apply my make up.</li>
            <li> Im just in love with this</li>
            <li> Very good sponge but you can but 4 for $2.85 (on Amazon) they&#x27;re just as good</li>
            <li> Love it for the price it was worth it.</li>
