            <li>His were perfect - just the right amount of retaining pressure.  </li>
            <li>I love this comb!</li>
            <li>It works great for him because it folds easily to be put in his pocket.</li>
            <li>nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Text on the casing started rubbing off after a couple days, but this is the best comb I&#x27;ve ever owned and it feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Good comb; sturdy and strong</li>
            <li>Leave it to the Brits to come up with a winning solution.</li>
            <li>Perfect size and weight for daily use or travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better for your scalp compared to cheaper combs.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>and he was so happy with his new pocket comb.</li>
            <li>every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teeth of the comb move easily through my hair, and somehow allow greater control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A folding pocket comb that protects the teeth is a simple and brilliant idea.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for guys who want a good sturdy comb to carry around in there pocket.</li>
            <li>This is hands down one of the best combs I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>-The teeth could be a bit closer together for precise mustache control  </li>
            <li>Rigid, yet smooth and forgiving.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, both to use and carry.</li>
            <li>Now it opens perfectly fine, and doesn&#x27;t open on it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handsome tortiseshell case gives it a classic appearance, and it&#x27;s compactness allows you to bring it with you everywhere.</li>
            <li>Very classy and elegant, but very convenient and easy to carry.  </li>
            <li>it helps me fresh up the look every time before a presentation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced it with a cheap \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; plastic pocket comb, which has the additional advantage of both coarse and fine teeth.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and smooth, folds up small, is easy to open (but won&#x27;t open on it&#x27;s own), and really gets the job done!</li>
            <li>-No sharp points to irritate lip/scalp  -Easy</li>
            <li>I would certainly suggest a more robust sleeve to be added in the future.  </li>
            <li>It easily fits in his back pocket.</li>
            <li>I am keeping the comb though because it is a very high quality comb .</li>
            <li>If you carry a $100 pen, a $200 wallet and a $1000 watch, do you really want to have a $.69 comb???</li>
            <li>Very compact.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>it is about the size of a normal comb .</li>
            <li>Not sure what is &amp;#34;hand-made&amp;#34; about it, but the teeth feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>Now, if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re just in the first year or so of growing a big beard, you know people will call you homeless unless you take care of it.</li>
            <li>The easiest, most basic way of NOT looking homeless, is to brush your beard (at least) every morning.</li>
            <li>Yes, about 10 times more than you would pay for an ordinary pocket comb, but still less than the tip to your stylist.</li>

            <li> Yes, about 10 times more than you would pay for an ordinary pocket comb, but still less than the tip to your stylist.</li>
            <li> I read a review that claimed it was hard to open, and the first 2 uses it was, but that was it.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to carry yet big enough to do</li>
            <li> my first choice of colors  -The swinging mechanism is a basic rivet -- will probably fail before the comb teeth break off  </li>
            <li> The other ones tend to rip out hairs (getting caught in the clasp) or fall apart (rivet falling out with use).</li>
            <li> well without being too loose or tight  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and he can&#x27;t put it down.</li>
            <li> and about I notice some stray hairs in the corner of my eye, I can comb them down.</li>
            <li> The sleeve broke in half after less than two weeks upon receiving the comb (while folded in my pocket.)</li>
            <li> -Tight bristles</li>
            <li> It would be even nicer if the comb tines were a little longer.</li>
            <li> The ones I bought were VERY hard to open and close</li>
            <li> only downside is that if you use alot of thick product, like pomade, be careful and grib the comb near the blade&#x27;s base.</li>
            <li> I have had this about a month now, it works well, fits in my pocket with very little bulk.</li>
            <li> it was a small pocket moustache comb but unfolded</li>
            <li> The folding design keeps teeth from being broken.</li>

            <li> Good comb; sturdy and strong</li>
            <li> Pros:  -Folds well without being too loose or tight  -Solid construction  -Tight bristles/teeth  -No sharp points to irritate lip/scalp  -Easy to reopen  Cons:  -Not my first choice of colors  -The swinging mechanism is a basic rivet -- will probably fail before the comb teeth break off  -The teeth could be a bit closer together for precise mustache control  Good product if you want/need something for the go.  *EDIT Day 3* (Adjusted from 4 stars to 3)  The handle broke while in use, no one was harmed -- nor beard.  The handle broke off in the middle (not at the rivet).  I am probably to blame.  The comb was in my back pocket all day at work.  Sitting upon the comb probably weakened it, while extensive beard taming eventually did the deed.  On to the next comb!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this thinking it was a small pocket moustache comb but unfolded it is about the size of a normal comb . I am keeping the comb though because it is a very high quality comb . It is hand made and feels quite sturdy .&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy one for my brother for his birthday !</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and he can&#x27;t put it down. It easily fits in his back pocket. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend, he loves it! nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The sleeve broke in half after less than two weeks upon receiving the comb (while folded in my pocket.) I would certainly suggest a more robust sleeve to be added in the future.  WFM</li>
            <li> I go through several pocket combs each year, because if the teeth don&#x27;t break, they bend out of shape and become unusable. A folding pocket comb that protects the teeth is a simple and brilliant idea. Leave it to the Brits to come up with a winning solution. And I&#x27;m a Yank. Go figure...</li>
            <li> i keep mine in my bag, with a splash of water it helps me fresh up the look every time before a presentation. very handy very easy.</li>
            <li> Yes, about 10 times more than you would pay for an ordinary pocket comb, but still less than the tip to your stylist. Beautiful tortoise-shell comb and case. Rigid, yet smooth and forgiving. Comfortable, both to use and carry. If you carry a $100 pen, a $200 wallet and a $1000 watch, do you really want to have a $.69 comb??? Huh, do you???</li>
            <li> Great product.  Wonderful quality and craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful, handmade comb at a great price. Very compact. Perfect size and weight for daily use or travel.Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I did not received the comb in the picture. The Kent logo was different, the lettering rubbed off, and the color wasn&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li> I love this comb! It is well made and has a great style too. I would highly recommend this for guys who want a good sturdy comb to carry around in there pocket.</li>
            <li> This comb is great to carry in a pocket. The folding design keeps teeth from being broken. It is small enough to carry yet big enough to do it&#x27;s job.</li>

Not sure what is &amp;#34;hand-made&amp;#34; about it, but the teeth feel very smooth. It&#x27;s probably better for your scalp compared to cheaper combs.</li>

The connection between the handle and blade doesn&#x27;t feel all that sturdy, but that&#x27;s the price I guess you pay for a folding comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Corey D. Sullivan</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he really likes it. It does the job (even after riding on the motorcycle) and compact.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandfather since he lost the one that he had and he was so happy with his new pocket comb. He totally loved it. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> My friend bought a couple of these and I was impressed so I did the same.  His were perfect - just the right amount of retaining pressure.  The ones I bought were VERY hard to open and close so I had to work them a lot to loosen them enough to work.  Great quality but they seem to have slipped by the last person on the line that checked that feature.</li>
            <li> I carried this comb in my pocket for about one month. The handle broke -- not at the hinge, but the handle body. As such, the comb is now worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced it with a cheap \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; plastic pocket comb, which has the additional advantage of both coarse and fine teeth.</li>
            <li> bought this for my fiance because he has a mustache. he loves it and keeps it in the car. i also like the fact that it folds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have had this about a month now, it works well, fits in my pocket with very little bulk. It would be even nicer if the comb tines were a little longer.</li>
            <li> Very classy and elegant, but very convenient and easy to carry.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> Now, if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re just in the first year or so of growing a big beard, you know people will call you homeless unless you take care of it. The easiest, most basic way of NOT looking homeless, is to brush your beard (at least) every morning. So, this is the third beard comb I&#x27;ve ordered off Amazon. I like to keep it in my back pocket, so if while I&#x27;m out and about I notice some stray hairs in the corner of my eye, I can comb them down. This is the best pocket beard comb I&#x27;ve found. The other ones tend to rip out hairs (getting caught in the clasp) or fall apart (rivet falling out with use). This one doesn&#x27;t do either of those things. It feels nice and smooth, folds up small, is easy to open (but won&#x27;t open on it&#x27;s own), and really gets the job done! If you need a beard comb, look no further. This is the one you want. I read a review that claimed it was hard to open, and the first 2 uses it was, but that was it. Now it opens perfectly fine, and doesn&#x27;t open on it&#x27;s own! What more can you ask for? Stop your shopping now, THIS is the comb you want for your beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who is a mustache aficionado. It works great for him because it folds easily to be put in his pocket.</li>
