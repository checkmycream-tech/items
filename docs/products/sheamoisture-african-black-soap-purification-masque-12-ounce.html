            <li>(Buy one get one free) sale</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product several times before with great results.</li>
            <li>I was so perplexed as to why</li>
            <li>(free shipping on $35) site, or from Walgreens</li>
            <li>(free shipping on $25).&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I love most Shea Moisture products, but some of the hair products that work well have scents that leave much to be desired.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to know I have 4a fine, dense hair with low porosity.</li>
            <li>; ... but seems to work great for helping with dry scalp...</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth and super moisturized.</li>
            <li>This stuff gets your scalp clean, but it still moisturizes.</li>
            <li>, it felt really clean, it was still shiny</li>
            <li>Does have a strong smell, but I became used to it after the first use&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>quick note on Walgreens</li>
            <li>it makes my hair super soft, easy to detangle, and my curls pop!  </li>
            <li>And make sure you use it pretty much as recommended.</li>
            <li>conditioner is great, it really helped my hair go from really dry to super moisturized.</li>
            <li>Be aware of the directions and the time it says to leave it on!</li>
            <li>They make a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love this product because the ingredients are wholesome and natural.</li>
            <li>I honestly wish they sold this product in a bigger size.</li>
            <li>I was very aware of the higher price I paid for this when I bought it</li>
            <li>use it right before I shower.</li>
            <li>I liked this deep conditioner a lot, but It was tricky to use at first.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, I apply and rinse out the Shea Moisture African black balancing conditioner (truly one of the best conditioners I have ever used).</li>
            <li>deep condition, I apply coconut oil to my freshly washed hair followed by SM Purification Masque on top</li>
            <li>Instead of the black soap shampoo, they make a head-to-toe baby wash with chamomile, and that could be an acceptable substitute (I find the conditioner did more for my dandruff than the shampoo, but ideally you should try the black soap shampoo) as chamomile is an anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li>I generally use a wide tooth comb but it seems to be even more effective if you finger</li>
            <li>I have very thick wavy/curly hair and this has helped tremendously (along with Head &amp; Shoulders) to rid of dandruff and give my hair a nice healthy shine.</li>
            <li>He wants me to buy it by the case!  </li>
            <li>Walgreens offers free shipping for all orders over $25.</li>
            <li>;) ☆★☆★♡</li>
            <li>One of the best points about the shea moisture line is that it&#x27;s low priced for very high value, and beyond affordable enough to be a standard in your beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t find this at a more reasonable price on here from a different seller, then buy it from walgreens or the walgreens website.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from scalp psoriasis and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that is gentle on my skin and restorative of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that I use this up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that on the label, every single ingredient listed has its &amp;#34;layman&#x27;s term&amp;#34; for each ingredient.</li>
            <li>It was a huge relief to finally come across SheaMoisture.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>not only hydrates the scalp, but it&#x27;s a fantastic all-over hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>You can get it from Walgreens for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and it had too much of an odor, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>It removed product build-up very well.</li>
            <li>Not only is it all natural, but my hair and skin never felt better.</li>
            <li>first time I used it I left it on for 30 minutes then rinsed with cool water and the natural part of my hair</li>
            <li>so I bought this the purification mask, the black soap shampoo, the hibiscus milk and my favorite shea butter shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon and usually come here first for items, but I was looking to see if I could repurchase this here like with the rest of my beauty items, and I came across this.</li>
            <li>I use Shea Moisture Purification Masque to deep condition my super dense, kinky coily, Afro-textured hair.</li>
            <li>It has super duper slip, imparts tons of moisture to my hair and smells like ripe plantains (Yum!).The second ingredient is coconut oil--an oil scientifically proven to penetrate hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems to ok, color does change with time due to natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>but it definitely wasn&#x27;t as moisturized as the first time.</li>
            <li>I love the Shea Butter Shampoo and Deep Conditioner Treatment, The Black Soap Purification Masque, and The Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li>I love ALL the products in Shea Moisture&#x27;s African Black Soap line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very soothing, especially on elbows.</li>
            <li>And when you rinse it out, it&#x27;s still soft and detangled.</li>
            <li>my strands felt extremely soft and my flaky dandruff was gone.</li>
            <li>how soft it makes my hair feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>I used it on my 6 year  old daughter&#x27;s tangle prone hair</li>
            <li>He says his hair &amp; scalp feel like they did when he was 7 years old.  </li>
            <li>Learning I have eczema at almost 40 years old was a mind blower.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair feeling like butter (soft).</li>
            <li>, so you can apply directly to the scalp and massage.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work IMO, but I only use it once a week so that could be why.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how moisturized my hair became, even the stringy relaxed ends felt soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed right out of the box is the color which is usually white, but this stuff is dark brown.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a deep hair conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>A little bit also really goes a long way with this line, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about eating through it quickly.</li>
            <li>I have thick coarse natural hair and this product made my hair so soft and it was easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the seller is charging such a high mark up on this, plus an extra $11.00 on shipping.</li>
            <li>My hair is hydrated and extra soft.</li>
            <li>It can get slightly oily (it has shea butter, coconut oil, and all that good stuff), but I typically cleanse my hair a few days later</li>
            <li>I have been transitioning to natural hair for quite a while now and one of my major problems is dry hair.</li>
            <li>My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing it through Amazon, and only did so because it was convenient as I ordered a few items.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair, not ethnic, and it&#x27;s been a game changer.</li>

            <li> I love ALL the products in Shea Moisture&#x27;s African Black Soap line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very soothing, especially on elbows.</li>
            <li> And when you rinse it out, it&#x27;s still soft and detangled.</li>
            <li> my strands felt extremely soft and my flaky dandruff was gone.</li>
            <li> how soft it makes my hair feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 6 year  old daughter&#x27;s tangle prone hair</li>
            <li> He says his hair &amp; scalp feel like they did when he was 7 years old.  </li>
            <li> Learning I have eczema at almost 40 years old was a mind blower.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair feeling like butter (soft).</li>
            <li> , so you can apply directly to the scalp and massage.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work IMO, but I only use it once a week so that could be why.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how moisturized my hair became, even the stringy relaxed ends felt soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed right out of the box is the color which is usually white, but this stuff is dark brown.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a deep hair conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> A little bit also really goes a long way with this line, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about eating through it quickly.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse natural hair and this product made my hair so soft and it was easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the seller is charging such a high mark up on this, plus an extra $11.00 on shipping.</li>
            <li> My hair is hydrated and extra soft.</li>

            <li> This was my first time purchasing it through Amazon, and only did so because it was convenient as I ordered a few items.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, not ethnic, and it&#x27;s been a game changer.</li>
            <li> After letting my hair air dry, I only have to use a couple of styling products to have long lasting curls for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have probably went through at least 10 deep conditioners in the past year or so looking for one that I truly LOVE, and this is</li>
            <li> After shampooing, I apply it all over my scalp and let it rest for as long as possible before rinsing out.</li>
            <li> This is different from other SheaMoisture deep treatment masques&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for a few years</li>
            <li> However, when I was completely natural the product was too heavy</li>
            <li> I then use the Shea Moisture Yucca and Baobob volumizing conditioner on my hair (not my scalp), clip my hair about 5 inches from my scalp and shampoo just my scalp with the Shea Moisture African black soap deep cleansing shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Mango Butter, Avocado Oil, African Black Soap Extract, Sea Salt, Cetyl Esters, Kaolin Clay, Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Behentrimonium Chloride, Salicylic Acid, Willow Bark Extract, Neem Oil, Tea Tree Oil, Sorbitol Esters, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Vitamin E, Rosemary Extract, Sage Extract, Plantain Extract, Honeysuckle Flower Extract, Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract</li>
            <li> He uses it with Shea Moisture African Black Soap Deep Cleansing Shampoo.</li>
            <li> wish the tub lasted longer, I don&#x27;t get more than 5 treatments out of each one, and it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I recently found out my itchy dry scalp was due to a severe case of eczema.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it on dry hair and got pretty bad results.</li>
            <li> but it did not get rid of the dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> was so fluffy, shiny, soft and thick looking I nearly big chopped on the spot!</li>
            <li> Little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I use the African Black Soap shampoo and conditioner every day and put this on and leave it on every few days.</li>
            <li> Started using this when I stopped using conventional shampoo (almost a year ago!) and had a really dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I used SheaMoisture Deep Treatment Conditioner Masque in the past, for my damaged relaxed hair it did wonders.</li>
            <li> That conditioner alone leaves my thick, tightly coiled hair so soft and moisturized.....</li>
            <li> I bought it to use during the winter when my scalp gets a little dry.</li>
            <li> When I purchased from this seller it looks dark like a mud wash.  </li>
            <li> : They don&#x27;t sell the black soap shampoo, but they do sell basically all the other black soap products.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture products are $10 or less at Target and Walgreens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The days that I use it typically my scalp does not itch at all.</li>
            <li> I just coat my scalp and sit around for about a half hour before rinsing it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Moisture Purification Masque is a staple in my hair care routine -- all other conditioner pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> scalp was seriously cleared up by the shampoo and conditioner from this line, but I needed a little extra dandruff-fighting</li>
            <li> Like, couldn&#x27;t even shake my head without little flakes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the tamper seal was missing, and it&#x27;s watery.</li>
            <li> I typically use it at least 2x a week, plus the days that I shampoo instead of co-wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past few months!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time when I had such awful dandruff and itching on my scalp that I just wanted to cry and didn&#x27;t think I could go on.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> almost all the products I was using had at least 1 ingredient from the list.</li>
            <li> My thick, type 4 hair was the cleanest it has been in my life and was literally squeaking.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick but runny.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> So, this is not good for those who colors their hair like me.  </li>
            <li> previously had the worst possible dandruff.</li>
            <li> Since using this my dandruff has decreased significsntly.</li>
            <li> Once you apply it, let it stay and wash it off, all your grey comes out too! :(</li>
            <li> just a month, Shea Moisture has taken my scalp from the worst dandruff I&#x27;ve known to basically clear.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked when I used this</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> I hate at-home, &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal. I have fine curly hair, not ethnic, and it&#x27;s been a game changer. Started using this when I stopped using conventional shampoo (almost a year ago!) and had a really dry scalp. I hate at-home, &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34; remedies, they never seemed to soothe my itchy, flaky scalp. Then I tried this and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It not only hydrates the scalp, but it&#x27;s a fantastic all-over hair conditioner. It leaves your hair so silky after you wash it out. It can get slightly oily (it has shea butter, coconut oil, and all that good stuff), but I typically cleanse my hair a few days later and it&#x27;s not an issue. I love that on the label, every single ingredient listed has its &amp;#34;layman&#x27;s term&amp;#34; for each ingredient. All of the ingredients are wholesome and have worked great in my no-poo routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the tub lasted longer, I don&#x27;t get more than 5 treatments out of each one, and it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side. But I haven&#x27;t found anything else out there to compare to this!</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life?? It does what the product claims. My hair is hydrated and extra soft. Although the scent is strong in application, when my hair is finished the scent is amazing!</li>
            <li> I use this on my psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as for hair conditioning. Apply, let sit, and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soothing, especially on elbows.</li>
            <li> You can get it from Walgreens for much cheaper. I don&#x27;t know why the seller is charging such a high mark up on this, plus an extra $11.00 on shipping. I love Amazon and usually come here first for items, but I was looking to see if I could repurchase this here like with the rest of my beauty items, and I came across this. The same Masque, at the SAME size is only 9.99 at walgreens. It&#x27;s the same everything. One of the best points about the shea moisture line is that it&#x27;s low priced for very high value, and beyond affordable enough to be a standard in your beauty regimen. A little bit also really goes a long way with this line, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about eating through it quickly. If you can&#x27;t find this at a more reasonable price on here from a different seller, then buy it from walgreens or the walgreens website.</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price. This product sells for around $10 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target ( stores and online) and a variety of drugstores. This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products. They make a fine product at a reasonable price. This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> Not too keen on scent - perhaps &#x27;cause I&#x27;m a guy? &amp;#60;shrug&amp;#62; ... but seems to work great for helping with dry scalp... I have very thick wavy/curly hair and this has helped tremendously (along with Head &amp; Shoulders) to rid of dandruff and give my hair a nice healthy shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dandruff for over 20 years -- I&#x27;ve tried everything. I placed a generous layer of this purification masque on my scalp and hair. I then used a Tresemme conditioner with a lot of &amp;#34;slip,&amp;#34; along with water, to rinse out the masque and detangle my hair. I then use the Shea Moisture Yucca and Baobob volumizing conditioner on my hair (not my scalp), clip my hair about 5 inches from my scalp and shampoo just my scalp with the Shea Moisture African black soap deep cleansing shampoo. After rinsing, I apply and rinse out the Shea Moisture African black balancing conditioner (truly one of the best conditioners I have ever used). By the second treatment, my dandruff was gone. My hair is silky smooth and super moisturized. After letting my hair air dry, I only have to use a couple of styling products to have long lasting curls for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Now, this DC has AWESOME slip! As soon as you apply it, it just MELTS the tangles away! And when you rinse it out, it&#x27;s still soft and detangled. I just love this condish! I just wish you could leave it in. ~.~ But if you get the Balancing Condish from this line, you can leave it in and it does the same thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend! I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s the best deep condish you&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
            <li> This stuff gets your scalp clean, but it still moisturizes. my strands felt extremely soft and my flaky dandruff was gone. Since using this my dandruff has decreased significsntly. I love it, just wished it came it s bigger option. I can only get 2 uses out of one jar. (I have medium-long hair)</li>
            <li> This product is the best for cowashing!! I love the smell &amp; how soft it makes my hair feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> i liked this mask because the  smell was purifying however I&#x27;m not in love with it but it does what its supposed to do</li>
            <li> I use Shea Moisture Purification Masque to deep condition my super dense, kinky coily, Afro-textured hair. It has super duper slip, imparts tons of moisture to my hair and smells like ripe plantains (Yum!).The second ingredient is coconut oil--an oil scientifically proven to penetrate hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To deep condition, I apply coconut oil to my freshly washed hair followed by SM Purification Masque on top (This boosts my hair&#x27;s moisture levels AND saves product). Then, I cover my hair with a plastic cap and deep condition for 20-30 minutes on low-heat under my hooded dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Moisture Purification Masque is a staple in my hair care routine -- all other conditioner pale in comparison. I buy it from Walgreens -- I stock up during the BOGO sales that happen every couple of months. I hope they never stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Mango Butter, Avocado Oil, African Black Soap Extract, Sea Salt, Cetyl Esters, Kaolin Clay, Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Behentrimonium Chloride, Salicylic Acid, Willow Bark Extract, Neem Oil, Tea Tree Oil, Sorbitol Esters, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Vitamin E, Rosemary Extract, Sage Extract, Plantain Extract, Honeysuckle Flower Extract, Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract</li>
            <li> I love most Shea Moisture products, but some of the hair products that work well have scents that leave much to be desired. I am sensitive to synthetic scents but love a great smelling product. Not so with this hair purification mask. It smells delicious!&lt;br /&gt;I used it to help my itchy braids and it worked well. I used it on my 6 year  old daughter&#x27;s tangle prone hair and she did not cry at all ( for once in 6 years). It detangles thick hair beautifully and leaves a wonderful healthy shine to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Most Shea Moisture products are $10 or less at Target and Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;A fair trade certified product that smells and works great for a great price. It does not get any better. You will not be disappointed with purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> My husband has dandruff, possibly mild psoriasis, and this works amazingly well. He says his hair &amp; scalp feel like they did when he was 7 years old.  He jokes that he has Ken hair now (Ken &amp; Barbie). He wants me to buy it by the case!  He uses it with Shea Moisture African Black Soap Deep Cleansing Shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my favorites. After shampooing, I apply it all over my scalp and let it rest for as long as possible before rinsing out.It feels wonderful and calms down my itchy scalp immediately.</li>
            <li> It helps moisten my scalp but what but the problem is that-- it washes off my hair color.  So, this is not good for those who colors their hair like me.  Once you apply it, let it stay and wash it off, all your grey comes out too! :(</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brand! I recently found out my itchy dry scalp was due to a severe case of eczema. Learning I have eczema at almost 40 years old was a mind blower. My doctor have me a list of ingredients to stay away from and almost all the products I was using had at least 1 ingredient from the list. It was a huge relief to finally come across SheaMoisture. Not only is it all natural, but my hair and skin never felt better. A lot of people are complaining about the price, which I would as well IF I bought it from this seller. It goes on sale at CVS and Walgreens regularly for Buy One Get One FREE. Even online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it was white.  When I purchased from this seller it looks dark like a mud wash.  I&#x27;m wondering if the product has been tampered with or did shea moisture changed the colour.  I don&#x27;t want to use it until I get some input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to ok, color does change with time due to natural ingredients.  I changed my review to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this condition. I typically use it at least 2x a week, plus the days that I shampoo instead of co-wash. It has done wonders for my scalp. The days that I use it typically my scalp does not itch at all.</li>
            <li> I tried it...even finished the container. However, it did nothing for me. The only thing that it did was make my scalp tingle but it did not get rid of the dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I am blond and white.  But I also have psoriasis and this did not help me a bit.  I used it with the shampoo and conditioner and have not seen any improvement at all</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse natural hair and this product made my hair so soft and it was easy to detangle. It also gave me a tingling feeling  to my scalp. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Please get it online at Walgreens it&#x27;s tons cheapter than here!! I have been using this for the past few months! I&#x27;ve been natural for a few years and I just started back just co-washing so I use this after my oil rinsing when I wash. it makes my hair super soft, easy to detangle, and my curls pop!  absolutely love SheaMoisture Purification masque!  Need to stock up! Please continue to make this product...forever! :-)</li>
            <li> This is the gentlest most wonderful hair treatment.  I have been suffering from scalp psoriasis and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that is gentle on my skin and restorative of my hair.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a deep hair conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> I used SheaMoisture Deep Treatment Conditioner Masque in the past, for my damaged relaxed hair it did wonders. However, when I was completely natural the product was too heavy so I searched to find something much better. I always feel like the trick with SheaMoisture is that you use the products as described; however, I didn&#x27;t have any scalp issues but decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves the hair feeling like butter (soft). I do not apply heat to my hair. I leave it on between 30-45mins with a cap.&lt;br /&gt;2. Detangles and has amazing slip&lt;br /&gt;3. Re-hydrates my curls and has my entire head of hair popping. Each strand will be hydrated, moist and defined&lt;br /&gt;4. Does have a strong smell, but I became used to it after the first use&lt;br /&gt;5. Doubles as a scalp treatment, so you can apply directly to the scalp and massage. Will reduce itchy scalp&lt;br /&gt;6. Little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;7. Has clay in it so, it can double for one of those clay masque treatments like terressentials. Also, can use as a substitute for the clay masque in the Maximum Hydration Challenge many Type 4 hair beauties are doing.&lt;br /&gt;8. Has clay in it so do not use it as a styler. This is different from other SheaMoisture deep treatment masques&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around I love the product. I cannot see myself using another. I might give SheaMoisture Superfruit Masque a try by spring/summer as a way to give my hair a break, but only if I tell that I need to do that. All in all, in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s good to know I have 4a fine, dense hair with low porosity.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work IMO, but I only use it once a week so that could be why. I will use it 3x a week and see if it improves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there is no candy with this smell/flavour, it&#x27;s ridiculous. When I put this in my hair, I feel relax, I hope my hair does too. This product doesn&#x27;t contain protein so I alternate between this and a protein-conditioner every week. This makes my scalp feels great and remove all product build-up.</li>
            <li> The product gets 5 stars but the rip off price from this seller gets 0 stars. I was very aware of the higher price I paid for this when I bought it but I didn&#x27;t have a choice since no one sells it in my area and at the time drugstore.com and walgreens.com was sold out. This product is overpriced by 7-8.00 and that&#x27;s just ridiculous. I will definitely not be ordering this from Amazon anymore. If I can&#x27;t find it in stock else where I will just have to wait or go without!!</li>
            <li> It works! Reduces flaking. You don&#x27;t have to use it every day. I use the African Black Soap shampoo and conditioner every day and put this on and leave it on every few days. It works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen&#x27;s Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioning system, which is very good. That conditioner alone leaves my thick, tightly coiled hair so soft and moisturized..... But Shea Moisture&#x27;s Purification Masque is better, and is also a fraction of the cost. I love this product because the ingredients are wholesome and natural. It leaves my hair feeling, soft, silky, smooth, moisturized and LOVED! The only drawback to this product is the size. I honestly wish they sold this product in a bigger size. When I actually find it in stores, I try to grab at least two containers and have to remind myself not to hoard since its rare you actually find it on shelves to begin with. And make sure you use it pretty much as recommended. The first time I tried it on dry hair and got pretty bad results. The second time I shampooed with a sulfate-free cleanser (L&#x27;Oreal Everstong), applied the Purification masque to damp hair, and let that baby marinade for over an hour. It yielded wonderful results. It&#x27;s become my hair treat :).</li>
            <li> I never opened this as I had bought the same brand of shea soap bar and it had too much of an odor, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  My hair feels and smells great after using it.  When I apply it, my hair just soaks it up and it instantly feels softer.  Plus i can easily untangle my hair with my fingers after applying this product.  I have probably went through at least 10 deep conditioners in the past year or so looking for one that I truly LOVE, and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with everyone else though, buy it from somewhere cheaper like Target or Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I started off with the Shea Moisture Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner. I loved the shampoo and the conditioner wasn&#x27;t the best but I was invested enough to try the rest of their line. Walgreens had a BOGO (Buy one get one free) sale so I bought this the purification mask, the black soap shampoo, the hibiscus milk and my favorite shea butter shampoo. I love this stuff! I read a review on Walgreens that said this product gives you hair enough slip that it practically detangles itself. I decided to try it as a pre poo detangler and I am thrilled with the results! This product has lessened my detangling time. You can work through just about anything with this stuff. I generally use a wide tooth comb but it seems to be even more effective if you finger detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea Moisture products have been a hit or miss for me. I love the Shea Butter Shampoo and Deep Conditioner Treatment, The Black Soap Purification Masque, and The Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Also the shea moisture line is sold in stores and on their respective websites (walgreens and target) for 9.99, so don&#x27;t let them price gouge you here! Walgreens offers free shipping for all orders over $25. I always get my shea moisture stuff from walgreens</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love how it moisturizes my hair without making it feel greasy. I bought it to use during the winter when my scalp gets a little dry. It removed product build-up very well. My husband uses it now to remove the pomade he uses too.</li>
            <li> Although most people use this as a conditioner or something I substituted this amazing product for shampoo. I used this for the first time when I had such awful dandruff and itching on my scalp that I just wanted to cry and didn&#x27;t think I could go on. And I  never have dandruff problems like that so I just had to do something pronto.  I was so shocked when I used this and it detangled,cleansed, and even moisteried my hair beyong my beliefs. My thick, type 4 hair was the cleanest it has been in my life and was literally squeaking. And it was so moisterized that I didn&#x27;t have to add another cycle or conditioner. I just it once and that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, it could change your hair&#x27;s health and regimen greatly.......... ;) ☆★☆★♡♥♡♥</li>
            <li> Great product. Put it on at night and sleep in a conditioning cap. Wash out in the a m. Love the exfoliant in willow bark.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and look for it in your local beauty supply store, Target, and/or Walmart. I&#x27;ve used this product several times before with great results. This was my first time purchasing it through Amazon, and only did so because it was convenient as I ordered a few items. I received my shipment today.First thing I noticed right out of the box is the color which is usually white, but this stuff is dark brown. Also, the tamper seal was missing, and it&#x27;s watery. For whatever reason this product didn&#x27;t qualify for a refund or replacement so it will be going in the trash. Lesson learned - I will never order this online again. I&#x27;ll make the extra trip to buy locally.</li>
            <li> I liked this deep conditioner a lot, but It was tricky to use at first. I have been transitioning to natural hair for quite a while now and one of my major problems is dry hair. I picked this up hoping it would solve the problem and it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I left it on for 30 minutes then rinsed with cool water and the natural part of my hair was so fluffy, shiny, soft and thick looking I nearly big chopped on the spot! I was amazed at how moisturized my hair became, even the stringy relaxed ends felt soft to the touch. However the second time I used it my hair didn&#x27;t feel quite the same, it felt really clean, it was still shiny but it definitely wasn&#x27;t as moisturized as the first time. I was so perplexed as to why but the reason was very simple. I left it on a LOT longer than the directions suggested. To test my theory the third time I used it I left it on for 30 minutes again and my hair was once again very moisturized, fluffy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is great, it really helped my hair go from really dry to super moisturized. Be aware of the directions and the time it says to leave it on! The only downside is that I use this up very quickly. The consistency is thick but runny. It has the consistency of yogurt. It smells like bananas but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I definitely recommend if your hair needs some rejuvenation! It&#x27;s a great DC, and I also think this would work as a great cowash if left on longer!</li>
            <li> I love ALL the products in Shea Moisture&#x27;s African Black Soap line.&lt;br /&gt;I previously had the worst possible dandruff. Like, couldn&#x27;t even shake my head without little flakes.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp was seriously cleared up by the shampoo and conditioner from this line, but I needed a little extra dandruff-fighting power.&lt;br /&gt;So I got this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I use it right before I shower. I only put it on my scalp. It says to go to the ends of the hair, but I have really healthy hair so that&#x27;s not a necessary step for me. I just coat my scalp and sit around for about a half hour before rinsing it off in the shower. I follow up with the shampoo/conditioner from this line.&lt;br /&gt;In just a month, Shea Moisture has taken my scalp from the worst dandruff I&#x27;ve known to basically clear. It&#x27;s the BEST EVER.&lt;br /&gt;I get this stuff from the SheaMoisture (free shipping on $35) site, or from Walgreens (free shipping on $25).&lt;br /&gt;A quick note on Walgreens: They don&#x27;t sell the black soap shampoo, but they do sell basically all the other black soap products. Instead of the black soap shampoo, they make a head-to-toe baby wash with chamomile, and that could be an acceptable substitute (I find the conditioner did more for my dandruff than the shampoo, but ideally you should try the black soap shampoo) as chamomile is an anti-inflammatory. And since dandruff is, many times, an inflammatory issue, it&#x27;ll do the trick :)</li>
