            <li>I think it&#x27;s perfect, but probably won&#x27;t appeal to those who are used to a thicker textured lotion.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 5 years with great results.</li>
            <li>When my health food store didn&#x27;t carry it, I was so happy to find it online.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, absorbs great...</li>

            <li>It feels good too.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin and is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Amazing i use it as a face moisturizer does not clog my pores and its like a tall drink of water for my skin.</li>
            <li>I got the fragrance-free kind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become out of reach for many.</li>
            <li>And the best part is even if you use it only once a day, and wash your hands many times, it seems the moisture stays in your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion - perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting smell and texture.</li>
            <li>I use more oily ones at night.</li>
            <li>The best lotion for dry feet</li>
            <li>It is kind of watery and absorbs quickly, but does not hydrate too well.</li>
            <li>Nice to have something that is actually good for the skin naturally.  </li>

            <li>Yes, it has a scent, but it&#x27;s a light one...</li>
            <li>I have tried both the original and the fragrance free lotions.  </li>
            <li>I have bought the original lotion.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>And it does make my skin nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice and light, not sticky or greasy, so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It makes a real difference in keeping out skin feeling youthful, healthy and soft (we&#x27;re in our 60s).</li>
            <li>It REALLY saves a LOT of money!</li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin and helps maintain/put in moisture without being heavy.  </li>

            <li>I need a good, light fragrance-free lotion to use as a base for estrogen to be added to it.</li>
            <li>and it really helps to keep back the oil.</li>
            <li>Although it came in time, this lotion arrived piping hot, like it had been sitting in the sun for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use lotions with perfumes.</li>
            <li>This product helps to keep my skin soft and seems to diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have the nicest smell, but you only notice it for the first second you put it on.</li>
            <li>Will buy these products again, and we highly reccommend it to people living in low humidity.</li>
            <li>But it really has a sour goats milk scent...  </li>

            <li> I use this as a face lotion. I have oily skin and it really helps to keep back the oil. I got the fragrance-free kind and it doesn&#x27;t have the nicest smell, but you only notice it for the first second you put it on.</li>
            <li> I have bought the original lotion.  The fragrance is only slightly off-putting.  I have bought the  fragrance-free lotion and the bar soap.  We live where it is dry, dry, dry.  My husband and I both use the Goat&#x27;s Milk soap and lotion every day.  It makes a real difference in keeping out skin feeling youthful, healthy and soft (we&#x27;re in our 60s). Will buy these products again, and we highly reccommend it to people living in low humidity.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy film. I highly recommend it, although it is somewhat expensive. If price is no object, Kiehl&#x27;s   products are the ultimate.</li>
            <li> The best lotion for dry feet I have ever used.  I have been using it for about 5 years with great results.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is allergic to chemicals and fragrance loves this lotion.  When my health food store didn&#x27;t carry it, I was so happy to find it online.  Nice to have something that is actually good for the skin naturally.  It feels good too.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the original and the fragrance free lotions.  The sented lotion was too strong for me.  I really enjoy the fragrance lotion.</li>
            <li> What happened? The cost of this has gone through the roof. It&#x27;s become out of reach for many.</li>
            <li> Amazing i use it as a face moisturizer does not clog my pores and its like a tall drink of water for my skin. plus it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> when used along with the soap it really seems to soften my skin. And the best part is even if you use it only once a day, and wash your hands many times, it seems the moisture stays in your skin.</li>
            <li> Although it came in time, this lotion arrived piping hot, like it had been sitting in the sun for a long time. Makes me wonder if it will retain its effectiveness and still be useable.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use lotions with perfumes. This lotion is a lifesaver! Yes, it has a scent, but it&#x27;s a light one...I&#x27;m assuming it smells like goat&#x27;s milk. But it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin and is a great moisturizer! Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> i use it daily and I am very satisfied. No pesky &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;,  my skin absorb it immediately, no greasy film. I work in the garden every day and  have a &amp;#34;farmers tan&amp;#34; which is not too beneficial to the skin. This product helps to keep my skin soft and seems to diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - perfect for daily use. Not greasy, no odor, great for sensitive skin. However, the price on Amazon is extortionate! I bought it for less than seven dollars at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, absorbs great... But it really has a sour goats milk scent...  I wish it was unscented...</li>
            <li> It has an interesting smell and texture. It is kind of watery and absorbs quickly, but does not hydrate too well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom, it&#x27;s her go to moisturizer, for hands, elbows, face etc.</li>
            <li> Luv luv this lotion-not greasy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I need a good, light fragrance-free lotion to use as a base for estrogen to be added to it.

I think it&#x27;s perfect, but probably won&#x27;t appeal to those who are used to a thicker textured lotion.</li>

            <li> Hard-to-find item! Packed carefully and shipped timely. Great product for sensitive skin and helps maintain/put in moisture without being heavy.  Aids in healing. Thank you for offering this item online.</li>
            <li> Moisturized very well. Leaves residue feel in my hands thats a bother however</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time, and I like it especially in the morning when I do not want a lotion that is oily. I use more oily ones at night.</li>
