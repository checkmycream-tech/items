            <li>Philosophy did an awesome job with this product.  </li>
            <li>But you can also wear no perfume at all, and instead the wonderful Cashmere Mist will envelop you in that perfectly perfumed balance between cloying and undetectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It works great and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love the Philosophy line of products - especially Amazing grace.  </li>
            <li>It works great and with my Amazing Grace spray it works great</li>
            <li>It lasts a good 3 months</li>
            <li>Love this scent, and it does not affect my allergies!</li>
            <li>There is something definitely amazing about Philosophy&#x27;s Amazing Grace Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It is an effective anti-perspirant.</li>

            <li>I love the fragrance of amazing grace and find this to be a good value.</li>
            <li>I love this product but just the amazing grace.</li>
            <li>I love all of the philosophy products and I use the amazing grace perfume all the time</li>
            <li>works and smells...  amazing :-)</li>
            <li>I have allergies to most products that r scented but not this one.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love,love, love..</li>
            <li>I am so glad my mom gave this to me.</li>
            <li>- you do not have to wear Cashmere Mist perfume to be able to wear the anti-p/deodorant.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it is ineffective as an antiperspirant/deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It smells lovely and clean, but it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and clean, but it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume</li>
            <li>Neither the Amazing Grace nor the Pure Grace gave off anything more than a timid suggestion of their true selves.</li>
            <li>When I spotted Amazing Grace and Pure Grace</li>
            <li>She was right, the fragrance is very light, you almost don&#x27;t smell it at all.  </li>
            <li>I have loved Philosophy products for years, especially their flagship fragrances Amazing Graze and Pure Grace.</li>
            <li>I was excited to know that I could purchase this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Amazing Grace antiperspirant for several months and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, upon first discovering Amazing Grace and Pure Grace in that unprecedented, clever form, I was sooo *stoked*</li>
            <li>the only good thing about the transaction.</li>
            <li>; See, Stella McCartney Stella, CLEAN Fresh Laundry, Nanette Lepore, annnnd this list could go on</li>
            <li>Now I call that success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve no doubt it would be a lucrative success.</li>
            <li>I think it was Shower Fresh</li>
            <li>But it is just right for me because I don&#x27;t engage in any of the activities I just described, and I rarely even leave the house except at the &amp;#34;cooler&amp;#34; times of day, morning and evening.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d snap ALL of them right up if there were anti-perspiring/deodorants of Chanel No. 5, Coco Mademoiselle, Tory Burch,</li>
            <li>Philosophy offers this same deodorant in Pure Grace, and it is equally as great.</li>
            <li>This visible, streaky white solid has no fragrance, no anti-perspirant properties, nor truly effective *deodorant* properties, and at a price 3 times that of my good ole reliable Irish Spring Speedstick, and even costlier than any of the &amp;#34;Clinical Strength&amp;#34; drugstore brands . . .</li>

            <li>think the Philosophy deodorants had just come out at the time I first bought them.</li>
            <li>Although it works as well as other deoderants, ot does not smell like amazing grace at all and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, non-staining, non- darkening, and it has a soft, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this item.  </li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>have, fortunately, found an actual &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; anti-perspirant/deodorant that works terrifically, by Donna Karan Cashmere Mist.</li>

            <li>I know the scents aren&#x27;t super intense in any form, but when the entire reason anyone would purchase this product is the fragrance, it should really deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild, pleasant and not overwhelming, and is not at all messy, but the real clincher is that I don&#x27;t sweat.  </li>
            <li>But do not see why the price is so high..</li>
            <li>I tried most of the ones the drug stores carry and was not satisfied with any of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But to my surprise and utter dismay, there really wasn&#x27;t any fragrance at all!</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m somewhat sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>Though many fragrances do come in body wash and body lotion form, even now only a few perfume makers offer deodorants with their product line.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for heavy duty activities like athletics, gym training, running, or spending more than 15 minutes at a time in the suffocating humid heat of Houston and most of the South.</li>

            <li>Really keeps me dry!</li>
            <li>Here in Houston, at least, wetness protection is just as indispensably important as odor control.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m a big fan of Philosophy products generally I will not be ordering this one again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since that was a few years ago, I somewhat recently bought another Pure Grace deodorant on the chance that it might&#x27;ve been improved since my initial experience.</li>

            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this product but just the amazing grace. I have allergies to most products that r scented but not this one. I also get complemented on my smell</li>
            <li> I use a lot of different products in the Philosophy Amazing Grace line, but I was so disappointed in this. It has NO SCENT at all.  It is unpleasant to apply due to a hard, waxy, unspreadable texture--like scraping a hard waxy candle under your arms! And most importantly, it is ineffective as an antiperspirant/deodorant.  Amazon allowed return of this product...the only good thing about the transaction.</li>
            <li> I love all of the philosophy products and I use the amazing grace perfume all the time so I figured that I would try this deodorant. I was sadly disappointed when I got it and it was sticky to put on and felt extremely dry and almost gritty.</li>
            <li> Although it works as well as other deoderants, ot does not smell like amazing grace at all and 18.00 is alot to pay for plain ole&#x27; deoderant. I wont buy again</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Have been using it for a year!!! It works great and with my Amazing Grace spray it works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Amazing Grace antiperspirant for several months and I love it.  It&#x27;s the only solid that works for me.  It&#x27;s gentle, non-staining, non- darkening, and it has a soft, fresh scent.  One stick lasts 4-5 months.  This won&#x27;t interfere with other fragrances, and it doesn&#x27;t get a strange, heavy smell by the end of the day.  Really keeps me dry!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m a big fan of Philosophy products generally I will not be ordering this one again.  Was not impressed with the texture of the product - was too hard.  And the scent didn&#x27;t present well in this format.  Bummer :(((</li>
            <li> Love,love, love..But do not see why the price is so high..</li>
            <li> Philosophy did an awesome job with this product.  I was having trouble finding a deodorant that really worked for me. I tried most of the ones the drug stores carry and was not satisfied with any of them. I would use them and an hour later would smell like I didn&#x27;t put any on at all.  My mom called one day and said I have this deodorant I am going to bring to you, give it a try and see if you like it.  I was skeptical at first when she told me you don&#x27;t sweat or smell with it. She was right, the fragrance is very light, you almost don&#x27;t smell it at all.  Every once in a while I catch a faint hint of it when I first put it on.  I can work all day and go walking with my friends in the afternoon with no problems and no worries of smelling or sweating.  I am so glad my mom gave this to me.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this item.  no smell  and It was crumbling.. I ended up throwing it away  after spending $22.00 dollars.  I would not order this again.</li>
            <li> works and smells...  amazing :-)</li>
            <li> Love this scent, and it does not affect my allergies!</li>
            <li> There is something definitely amazing about Philosophy&#x27;s Amazing Grace Deodorant.  It works!!! Really.  The fragrance is mild, pleasant and not overwhelming, and is not at all messy, but the real clincher is that I don&#x27;t sweat.  Now I call that success. Philosophy offers this same deodorant in Pure Grace, and it is equally as great.</li>
            <li> What an enormous disappointment! I have loved Philosophy products for years, especially their flagship fragrances Amazing Graze and Pure Grace. When I spotted Amazing Grace and Pure Grace *deodorant* while at a department store several years ago, I bought two of each - two for me, two for my mom. (We buy stuff for each other all the time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What stupendous genius to create a perfumed deodorant! Though many fragrances do come in body wash and body lotion form, even now only a few perfume makers offer deodorants with their product line. I wish they would. I&#x27;ve no doubt it would be a lucrative success. I&#x27;d snap ALL of them right up if there were anti-perspiring/deodorants of Chanel No. 5, Coco Mademoiselle, Tory Burch, Chlo&amp;eacute; See, Stella McCartney Stella, CLEAN Fresh Laundry, Nanette Lepore, annnnd this list could go on but you get the idea. Since I&#x27;m fantasizing, I&#x27;ll go ahead and dream big: how about they all be anti-perspirants, too! Here in Houston, at least, wetness protection is just as indispensably important as odor control. It would be risky to wear one without the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Philosophy deodorants had just come out at the time I first bought them. But I suspect the deodorants were then soon discontinued, since I didn&#x27;t see them anywhere again for years. Anyhow, upon first discovering Amazing Grace and Pure Grace in that unprecedented, clever form, I was sooo *stoked* to add another layer of fragrance along with the 3-in-1, lotion, and perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to my surprise and utter dismay, there really wasn&#x27;t any fragrance at all! Neither the Amazing Grace nor the Pure Grace gave off anything more than a timid suggestion of their true selves. I know the scents aren&#x27;t super intense in any form, but when the entire reason anyone would purchase this product is the fragrance, it should really deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that was a few years ago, I somewhat recently bought another Pure Grace deodorant on the chance that it might&#x27;ve been improved since my initial experience. It hasn&#x27;t. This visible, streaky white solid has no fragrance, no anti-perspirant properties, nor truly effective *deodorant* properties, and at a price 3 times that of my good ole reliable Irish Spring Speedstick, and even costlier than any of the &amp;#34;Clinical Strength&amp;#34; drugstore brands . . . Well, I find it absolutely worthless and, of course, a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have, fortunately, found an actual &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; anti-perspirant/deodorant that works terrifically, by Donna Karan Cashmere Mist. It smells lovely and clean, but it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume - you do not have to wear Cashmere Mist perfume to be able to wear the anti-p/deodorant. But you can also wear no perfume at all, and instead the wonderful Cashmere Mist will envelop you in that perfectly perfumed balance between cloying and undetectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s not all. It is an effective anti-perspirant. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for heavy duty activities like athletics, gym training, running, or spending more than 15 minutes at a time in the suffocating humid heat of Houston and most of the South. But it is just right for me because I don&#x27;t engage in any of the activities I just described, and I rarely even leave the house except at the &amp;#34;cooler&amp;#34; times of day, morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got off track there but I had a point. I was contrasting the performance of the Philosophy deodorant and the Donna Karan anti-p/deodorant. When it&#x27;s as hot and muggy as it is here in Southeast Texas, you can break a sweat just going from your house to your car or from your car into work, or into and out of the grocery store. We scurry between air-conditioned havens the way Northerners scurry between cozy, heated retreats from the biting cold. So a deodorant needs to help us make it to wherever we&#x27;re going without turning into a wilted, sweaty, stinky mess. Philosophy&#x27;s attempt just doesn&#x27;t cut it.improved since my initial experience. It hasn&#x27;t.

            <li> I like this stuff. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s discontinued or not. I like the scent of this and it&#x27;s not overbearing. I&amp;#34;m somewhat sensitive to fragrance. When I was having a hard time finding this to re-order and I didn&#x27;t feel like spending the price to buy this again, I took a chance on Secret I think it was Shower Fresh and that was the most awful stuff. My head was spinning from the scent of the Secret. That stuff was awful. I do wish this was not as expensive, but I really do like it.</li>
            <li> hardly notice the scent. :(</li>
            <li> I love the Philosophy line of products - especially Amazing grace.  I was excited to know that I could purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Great transaction..great shipping time. Love this product. .have used for years.&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy site is always out....Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of amazing grace and find this to be a good value. It lasts a good 3 months</li>
            <li> I do not often wear antiperspirant deodorant and when I do, I hate it to clash with my favorite scents...No problem here. I can have it all when I use this product. It works great and smells great.</li>
