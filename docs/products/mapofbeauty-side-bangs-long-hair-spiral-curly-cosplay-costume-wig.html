            <li>Definitely a good deal for the price!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how great it looks for the price.</li>
            <li>shiny looks real, nice waves and came with a good wig cap.</li>
            <li>but the cap and the wefts are very easily seen if the wig isn&#x27;t perfectly styled.</li>
            <li>Tons of hair, great value, quality was really good</li>
            <li>Beautiful wig, fits perfectly, looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of time and a lot of patience to move all of the hairs until they look good.</li>
            <li>This wig is really gorgeous - full, great curls and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This wig is lovely!</li>
            <li>For the price these are amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the colour</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like it doesn&#x27;t have a part, to be honest.</li>
            <li>kind of tacky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it actually is honestly, but myea gonna use it for my Fem!dave cosplay and probably also for my fem!Shizuo.</li>
            <li>The curls were a bit frizzy and tangled when I received it, however, and it&#x27;s tricky to brush out as the curls snarl very easily.</li>
            <li>It can tangle very easily so brace yourselves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wearable and looks good from a distance, but overall, it isn&#x27;t very good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great wig, exactly the color in the picture and</li>
            <li>This wig was definitely better than what I was expecting for a $10 wig.</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>I am going to use it for my Elsa cosplay and the color is perfect for the lighter blonde hair color.</li>
            <li>On the picture it looks better then</li>
            <li>I needed the perfect blonde wig for a costume and almost gave up until I found this one.</li>
            <li>I received my wig today and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>ok but the quality was just ok.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Beautiful wig,  got it for my 7 year old neice for our family vacation to Disney world.  </li>
            <li>This is a good starter wig (But I don&#x27;t see getting much use out of it)</li>
            <li>Easily.</li>
            <li>I own many wigs and this one fell apart so fast.</li>
            <li>In the end, I went ahead and brushed it anyway and found that the curls hold fairly well, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Quick Delivery (which is Very Important to Me),</li>
            <li>I got the light blonde curly long wig, which the color was perfect the quality of the fibers are good, though they are much more easily tangled</li>
            <li>However, I did wash it and it dried pretty nicely and worked great for my cosplay!</li>
            <li>sometimes it is worth spending a bit more money.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap wig, cause</li>
            <li>I purchase the expedited shipping and it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more is different colors, and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>Impressive, considering I wore it to a con for ~8 hours straight, including dashing around outside with 30-40 mph wind gusts that certainly blew it around my face but didn&#x27;t manage to shift it on my head.</li>
            <li>The wig is very full, has lots of curls, and looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>but the quality overall is good.</li>
            <li>The wig is good quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Ordered the light blonde wig cause I&#x27;m doing a femlink cosplay, this wig is super nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly this light blonde wasn&#x27;t the color I was going for</li>
            <li>Amazing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this wig for everyday wear, but it&#x27;s great for costuming and cosplay.</li>
            <li>Its a generic nice wig.</li>
            <li>As far as getting better wigs that hold together</li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t like the top part near the bangs because some of the netting is showing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice blonde color though.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fair, and thankfully due to my years of experience I can fix it&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair actually looks really nice and the color is exactly as picture.</li>
            <li>&amp; it was so pretty</li>
            <li>Great wig except for the fact that it came late and tangled</li>
            <li>I actually hoped to be able to part them in the middle and it still look ok</li>
            <li>My Major problem is the top of the wig, you can see straight through at certain points and it doesn&#x27;t go all the way around the head.</li>
            <li>It fit really nicely, stayed in place all day, and had very little movement around while I was wearing it!</li>
            <li>My main issues are that it comes in smelling like chemicals and that the bangs are too long, but not long enough to tuck anywhere (we ended up pinning it to the side with a gorgeous looking butterfly pin and it looked lovely, though, so</li>
            <li>But this wig you can&#x27;t do much with.</li>
            <li>Of course, brushing a curly wig causes the curls to fall out, so I didn&#x27;t really know how to handle it.</li>
            <li>Very please</li>
            <li>Too much hair falls to the front.</li>
            <li>The light blonde is a really dramatic color and looks great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a good wig but don&#x27;t want to shell out a ridiculous amount of money.</li>
            <li>The wig is pretty and the fibers are soft...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost a white blonde, but I was hoping it would be lighter, so I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>So pleased with the quality at such a low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Super long (bangs,as well)  </li>
            <li>I had to cut it a little bit to get a more natural result and the color is way lighter than shown in the picture</li>
            <li>This wig is super long!</li>
            <li>The material is really soft and looks realistic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft but it also tangles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, though, which I suppose is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars.</li>
            <li>and it is also very soft.</li>
            <li>but it is so pretty that I didn&#x27;t want to send it back.</li>
            <li>A little tangled but easily fixable.</li>
            <li>But, I decided to braid it for my 5 year old&#x27;s &#x27;Elsa&#x27; costume and with pining it 7-9 bobby pins it was falling  off b/c</li>
            <li>I keep having problems with the bangs falling directly in my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but you can&#x27;t expect that when the price is a good as this.</li>
            <li>Decent for the price but would have to figure out how to get it to style to differently or cut bangs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little thin in the back at the top, as costume wigs can be, but overall, really great!</li>
            <li>then i expected and its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>i got the blonde one, as long as you wear a hat or something with it it looks real!</li>
            <li>its so fun to suddenly have long blonde hair</li>
            <li>for such an inexpensive wig, and i have had a few over the yrs for my costumes this one is beautiful, long, natural looking and super super soft, shocking soft actually.</li>
            <li>(For attached picture, I am the one in pink, obviously haha.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price, but it&#x27;s not a great wig.</li>

            <li> And one last thing, the top of this wig is very thin.</li>
            <li> The hair is very long and there are bangs that are short and look a bit different than pictured.</li>
            <li> The bangs are shaped differently than I expected, but similar enough to the picture.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair or a big head</li>

            <li> However, it gets a little bit frizzy after a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> This wig is very small in the head size and in that aspect feels a lot like lesser wigs (such as party city</li>

            <li> The bangs are really long (a few inches past my chin)</li>
            <li> I was a bit frightened due to the fact some people complained about seeing the wig&#x27;s interior through the wig for the lighter colored ones, but I couldn&#x27;t see anything.</li>
            <li> it was too small (cap part of the hair)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, not</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall if you have: short/ thin hair, or a small head.</li>
            <li> It came in with almost no tangles, and the ones I could find were very small and almost unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> Another thing: the part on this wig is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I have to advise buyers not to purchase this wig.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.</li>
            <li> This wig was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s not too bad).</li>

            <li> Its a generic nice wig. You&#x27;re getting what you paid for. As far as getting better wigs that hold together sometimes it is worth spending a bit more money. This wig is just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the loose hairs came out, having to shake the wig around a bit to get anymore loose hairs out. The bangs were very long so I have to cut them. ( might just do a fringe). Also I don&#x27;t like the top part near the bangs because some of the netting is showing. I have to adjust the hair in places so it won&#x27;t show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice blonde color though. But this wig you can&#x27;t do much with.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for Luna Lovegood cosplay. I liked the colour and I figured a little trimming could make it look fairly similar to her hair. When it arrived in the mail, I was upset. It&#x27;s very soft but it also tangles. Easily. Of course, brushing a curly wig causes the curls to fall out, so I didn&#x27;t really know how to handle it. In the end, I went ahead and brushed it anyway and found that the curls hold fairly well, which is nice. But this wig tends to shed quite a bit and the hairs get pulled out at the bottom and personally, I don&#x27;t like being covered in wig hair. Another thing: the part on this wig is very hard to find. It&#x27;s almost like it doesn&#x27;t have a part, to be honest. It takes a lot of time and a lot of patience to move all of the hairs until they look good. But even then, the hair just falls back into your eyes, of course blinding you and making your eye balls sting like heck. And one last thing, the top of this wig is very thin. The wefts are visible, making it look kind of tacky.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, though, which I suppose is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars. It&#x27;s wearable and looks good from a distance, but overall, it isn&#x27;t very good quality. I&#x27;m afraid I have to advise buyers not to purchase this wig.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.</li>
            <li> This wig is super long! I had to cut it a little bit to get a more natural result and the color is way lighter than shown in the picture but the quality overall is good.</li>
            <li> Ordered the light blonde wig cause I&#x27;m doing a femlink cosplay, this wig is super nice. It&#x27;s thick, not shiny looks real, nice waves and came with a good wig cap. It is a lot longer then i expected and its exactly what I wanted. A little tangled but easily fixable.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig, fits perfectly, looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great wig, exactly the color in the picture and the curls are just as voluminous. I&#x27;d say my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little thin in the back at the top, as costume wigs can be, but overall, really great!</li>
            <li> This wig is really gorgeous - full, great curls and gorgeous. It is perfect for cosplay. It is also very, very long. Definitely a good deal for the price!</li>
            <li> This wig was definitely better than what I was expecting for a $10 wig. It fit really nicely, stayed in place all day, and had very little movement around while I was wearing it! Impressive, considering I wore it to a con for ~8 hours straight, including dashing around outside with 30-40 mph wind gusts that certainly blew it around my face but didn&#x27;t manage to shift it on my head. The curls were a bit frizzy and tangled when I received it, however, and it&#x27;s tricky to brush out as the curls snarl very easily. However, I did wash it and it dried pretty nicely and worked great for my cosplay! I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a good wig but don&#x27;t want to shell out a ridiculous amount of money. (For attached picture, I am the one in pink, obviously haha.)</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It is exactly what I expected. The bangs are shaped differently than I expected, but similar enough to the picture. The hair actually looks really nice and the color is exactly as picture. I am going to use it for my Elsa cosplay and the color is perfect for the lighter blonde hair color. I would definitely buy this wig again in a different color.</li>
            <li> I have been using wigs for almost ten years now and have bought from a lot of different sellers. I got the light blonde curly long wig, which the color was perfect the quality of the fibers are good, though they are much more easily tangled but then again some wigs just do that. My Major problem is the top of the wig, you can see straight through at certain points and it doesn&#x27;t go all the way around the head. I use wigs for cosplay and naturally I have long hair, this wig cannot house long hair at all. This wig is very small in the head size and in that aspect feels a lot like lesser wigs (such as party city wigs)&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s fair, and thankfully due to my years of experience I can fix it&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you have: short/ thin hair, or a small head. This is a good starter wig (But I don&#x27;t see getting much use out of it) If you have long hair or a big head like I do I think it&#x27;s best if you keep looking.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good. I&#x27;m not fond of it but it does its work.. On the picture it looks better then it actually is honestly, but myea gonna use it for my Fem!dave cosplay and probably also for my fem!Shizuo. c:</li>
            <li> i got the blonde one, as long as you wear a hat or something with it it looks real! i straightened mine and cut the ends of it and cut the bangs. its so fun to suddenly have long blonde hair hahah</li>
            <li> Tons of hair, great value, quality was really good</li>
            <li> I needed the perfect blonde wig for a costume and almost gave up until I found this one. It was affordable and awesome.</li>
            <li> Honestly this light blonde wasn&#x27;t the color I was going for but it is so pretty that I didn&#x27;t want to send it back. I will definitely use it for a future costume. It can tangle very easily so brace yourselves.</li>
            <li> a bit frizzy and it dosn&#x27;t like to sit well its itchy and uncoftrable</li>
            <li> This wig is lovely! I was a bit frightened due to the fact some people complained about seeing the wig&#x27;s interior through the wig for the lighter colored ones, but I couldn&#x27;t see anything. The material is really soft and looks realistic. My main issues are that it comes in smelling like chemicals and that the bangs are too long, but not long enough to tuck anywhere (we ended up pinning it to the side with a gorgeous looking butterfly pin and it looked lovely, though, so I suppose it&#x27;s not too bad). It came in with almost no tangles, and the ones I could find were very small and almost unnoticeable. Amazing, especially for the price. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I wore it twice &amp; it was so pretty BUT it must be babied so it doesn&#x27;t get looking in disarray. Put it on a sub &amp; was trashed in less than an hour. It&#x27;s Super long (bangs,as well)  Quick Delivery (which is Very Important to Me),</li>
            <li> Awesome wig! It looks so beautiful and fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great wig except for the fact that it came late and tangled</li>
            <li> The wig is good quality especially for the price. The bangs are really long (a few inches past my chin) but I can work with that. I actually hoped to be able to part them in the middle and it still look ok and I can! The color is lighter than it appeared to be on my monitor. It&#x27;s almost a white blonde, but I was hoping it would be lighter, so I&#x27;m ok with that. I would not recommend this wig for everyday wear, but it&#x27;s great for costuming and cosplay. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overly shiny, myself.</li>
            <li> This wig was a disappointment. I own many wigs and this one fell apart so fast. there was no volume to it what so ever, and you can see the netting everywhere. I recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap wig, cause that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li> The wig is very full, has lots of curls, and looks exactly like the picture.  However, it gets a little bit frizzy after a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> The light blonde is a really dramatic color and looks great. The hair is very long and there are bangs that are short and look a bit different than pictured. I can&#x27;t believe how great it looks for the price. I would describe the thickness as medium and it is also very soft. Perfect for a novice cosplay costume or a great addition to a halloween costume. I purchase the expedited shipping and it was worth every penny! I received the wig in about two days. Very please and I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Beautiful  hair! But, I decided to braid it for my 5 year old&#x27;s &#x27;Elsa&#x27; costume and with pining it 7-9 bobby pins it was falling  off b/c it was too small (cap part of the hair)</li>
            <li> for such an inexpensive wig, and i have had a few over the yrs for my costumes this one is beautiful, long, natural looking and super super soft, shocking soft actually.</li>
            <li> For the price these are amazing. But the bangs don&#x27;t fall like in the picture. I keep having problems with the bangs falling directly in my face.</li>
            <li> Too much hair falls to the front. feels like you are wearing it backwards. Decent for the price but would have to figure out how to get it to style to differently or cut bangs.</li>
            <li> So pleased with the quality at such a low price. It&#x27;s not perfect, but you can&#x27;t expect that when the price is a good as this.</li>
            <li> I received my wig today and I absolutely love it. It fits perfectly. I will definitely be ordering more is different colors, and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> The wig is pretty and the fibers are soft...but the cap and the wefts are very easily seen if the wig isn&#x27;t perfectly styled. I would not recommend this wig to cosplayers. You can&#x27;t style the fringe in a side swept fashion, the wefts in the front WILL be seen. It&#x27;s okay for the price, but it&#x27;s not a great wig.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig,  got it for my 7 year old neice for our family vacation to Disney world.  She dressed up as Rapunzel,  and this wig was perfect.</li>
            <li> ok but the quality was just ok.</li>
            <li> Wig will work for my dress-up needs.</li>
