            <li>These items are not as good as they say.</li>

            <li>This is an instance where you hope for a good product from the description and reviews ... and what you receive is SO MUCH MORE!</li>

            <li>These colors are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors and love this product-will reorder!</li>
            <li>Love, love them!</li>
            <li>pretty and great quality</li>
            <li>the more I practice.</li>
            <li>and im sooo pleased ..</li>
            <li>They looked sparkly but they have more of a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Love the color combination...</li>
            <li>Love the colors in this array of mineral shadow.</li>
            <li>You only have to use the smallest amount for fabulous, flawless color.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and it makes your eyes stand out.</li>
            <li>Super, colors pop and stay on all day :)</li>
            <li>All in all, I am one very satisfied customer and highly recommend this for anyone who has a sensitivity to eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Would look great on someone much younger!</li>
            <li>Everything was exact and love the product</li>
            <li>so they won&#x27;t get used up quickly.</li>
            <li>Colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>You must have good brushes to apply it, and one little trick I use to keep the powder from falling on to my cheeks is to lightly spray my brushes with water before applying.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product, and I am definitely ordering more colors.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I wish the colors were darker, other that the product is great!</li>
            <li>They are highly pigmentation, goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>They go great w/ a soft pink blush as well as a plum blush.</li>
            <li>These were presented in a small bag and the colors were very nice.</li>
            <li>The makeup does not wear well and wears off very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the first time im using this product</li>
            <li>They go on so smooth, not too light &amp; not to heavy.</li>
            <li>It gets the purple look I need and the colors are just as pictured, which is unusual for ordering makeup online I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It arrives in a cute drawstring bag you can use again for other things.</li>
            <li>Love the darker of the purples and they show really well on my dark skin.</li>
            <li>The quality is high so these stay on all day.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I cannot think of another eye shadow that I&#x27;ve tried that blends as nicely as these do.</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, I can finally wear purple/plum eyeshadows with no irritation, redness, itching, or weeping of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am an african american female and I love the pigmentationon my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Would have preferred matt for my mature eyes.</li>
            <li>Items are very small not much material for the price, three colors in larger quantities would be more appreciated.</li>
            <li>Since this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used loose powder, I feel pretty certain that I will be less messy with it</li>

            <li> Fine if you  just want a very subtle look.</li>
            <li> Containers are small, but i guess i really didn&#x27;t read how big they were</li>
            <li> NOT Bare Minerials quality.</li>
            <li> I expected the containers to be a bit larger.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day long!</li>
            <li> The only slight downside I&#x27;ve found is that it is messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got plenty of other eyeshadows to use</li>
            <li> The other leading mineral powder concealer makes my face itch to no end.</li>
            <li> The shadows are extremely pigmented.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight sparkle but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This makes the shadow stick plus has the added effect of making the color a little bolder too.</li>
            <li> There is surprisingly little fallout from them.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to apply since they come in pots rather than boxes</li>
            <li> $3-4 per jar ain&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy with purchase.</li>

            <li> pretty and great quality</li>
            <li> Containers are small, but i guess i really didn&#x27;t read how big they were $3-4 per jar ain&#x27;t bad.  I&#x27;ve got plenty of other eyeshadows to use so they won&#x27;t get used up quickly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors but didn&#x27;t realize they were shimmery. Would have preferred matt for my mature eyes. Would look great on someone much younger!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and came in neat bag wrapped up! Cute for gifting!!</li>
            <li> These were presented in a small bag and the colors were very nice.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, I can finally wear purple/plum eyeshadows with no irritation, redness, itching, or weeping of my eyes. This is a fantastic product, and I am definitely ordering more colors. It stays on all day long! The only slight downside I&#x27;ve found is that it is messy. You must have good brushes to apply it, and one little trick I use to keep the powder from falling on to my cheeks is to lightly spray my brushes with water before applying.

All in all, I am one very satisfied customer and highly recommend this for anyone who has a sensitivity to eyeshadows. You won&#x27;t have it with this brand!</li>
            <li> These items are not as good as they say. The makeup does not wear well and wears off very fast. I would not order again. Product seems to be of inferior quality. NOT Bare Minerials quality. Very unhappy with purchase.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I wish the colors were darker, other that the product is great!</li>
            <li> Super, colors pop and stay on all day :)</li>
            <li> Great colors and you can use them anytime!  They are easy to use and it makes your eyes stand out.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and love this product-will reorder!</li>
            <li> The colors are just amazing &amp;lt;3 staying power is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;this is the first time im using this product and im sooo pleased ..&lt;br /&gt;Item was neatly and properly packed&lt;br /&gt;would recommend</li>
            <li> Re-application needed throughout the day as shadow does not wear well. Fine if you  just want a very subtle look. I expected the containers to be a bit larger.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these colors! They go on so smooth, not too light &amp; not to heavy. The 4 different colors can be matched so up differently to give you a couple of different looks. They go great w/ a soft pink blush as well as a plum blush. Love, love them!</li>
            <li> Package was leaking product</li>
            <li> These colors are beauuuutiful! I used to use an eyeshadow primer to make my shadows last. It&#x27;s not necessary with these. I&#x27;ve never heard of Grace My Face products...I look forward to purchasing the mineral powder concealer. The other leading mineral powder concealer makes my face itch to no end.</li>
            <li> These colors are awesome but I think the lighting in the picture is misleading. They looked sparkly but they have more of a matte finish. There is a slight sparkle but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Great product and came in a timely manner!!</li>
            <li> Use a primer before using these. They are highly pigmentation, goes on smoothly.  Colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Items are very small not much material for the price, three colors in larger quantities would be more appreciated.</li>
            <li> Love the darker of the purples and they show really well on my dark skin. I am an african american female and I love the pigmentationon my skin tone. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Love the color combination...nice compliments!</li>

The quality is high so these stay on all day. They are hard to apply since they come in pots rather than boxes but I will get used to it.</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing.  The quality is excellent.  The shadows are extremely pigmented.  There is surprisingly little fallout from them.  They go on very smoothly and blend beautifully.  Seriously, I cannot think of another eye shadow that I&#x27;ve tried that blends as nicely as these do. I&#x27;m so happy I purchased these.</li>
