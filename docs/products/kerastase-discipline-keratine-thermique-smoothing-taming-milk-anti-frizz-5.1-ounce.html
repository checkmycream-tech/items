            <li> [For those of us with super dry ends: My stylist recommended supplementing a little of the Kerastase Nutritive Nectar Thermique on just the ends and that works extremely well.</li>

            <li> Expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have long, curly/wavy, very dry, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I put a quarter size dollar dollap and some Oleo Relax onto my wet hair and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> only from the middle down to the ends, otherwise it will feel heavy and greasy</li>
            <li> (Note: I can&#x27;t recommend applying the Nectar Thermique to the entire shaft of hair, as the product is very intense and caused my hair to feel dirty and greasy.</li>
            <li> Down fall little pricey!</li>

            <li> This product has been AMAZING for my hair.  I have long, fine hair that gets frizzy with the slightest humidity.  I have tried so many products - high and low-end and Kerastase has always been one of my favorite brands.  I have used Oleo Relax for years but I just bought the Keratine Thermique and it is the closest thing to a miracle product I have ever used.  I put a quarter size dollar dollap and some Oleo Relax onto my wet hair and blow dry.  Ever since I started using this product, my frizz is gone!  Even on humid and rainy days, my hair looks amazing.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Doesnt make much sense to &amp;#34;towel dry&amp;#34; but then you have to rinse your hair?</li>
            <li> love, leaves my hair so soft and makes it easy blow dry.  use sparingly and only from the middle down to the ends, otherwise it will feel heavy and greasy</li>
