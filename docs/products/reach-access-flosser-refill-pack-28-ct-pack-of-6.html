            <li>Good product and a good price.  </li>
            <li>The package came in good condition &amp; nothing had been opened or damaged.</li>
            <li>I find it surprisingly repulsive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good buy.</li>

            <li>My dentist always asks what I use to floss with because this system is so good</li>
            <li>Received product extremely quick and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; (as I call them) flossers work much better &amp; this seller was great about getting my purchase out in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this transaction and would deal with them again.</li>
            <li>My gums are very pleased</li>

            <li>I cannot say more good things about it.</li>
            <li>Nice set of refills for my Reach Flosser.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love Reach Access Flossers!</li>
            <li>I think this is the best way to floss, but I would like them to last longer</li>
            <li>I have to shop this way more often.</li>
            <li>I believe they help your teeth hygiene better than if you do not use them.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite floss.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to hunt for in different stores and great price too!</li>
            <li>You can do a much better job because you are working with a handle.  </li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>These fit into the reach flossed</li>
            <li>Simple and works great</li>
            <li>This is the best product ever, I love without any mint flavor, it&#x27;s handy, strong enough for tight contacts</li>
            <li>Keep looking until you find the real, unflavored Reach Access Flosser refills, and enjoy your clean mouth! :-)</li>
            <li>Great bargain for something I have been using for a long time.</li>
            <li>But these mint-flavored refills leave a sickly sweet, and somewhat minty, taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Was simple to add to my order and at a really good price.</li>
            <li>I have heard a good recommendation regarding this product and decided to buy as a present to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li>and it all comes with super saver shipping - and these are saving my husbands</li>
            <li>used to be able to find these at my local drug store, and when they stopped carrying them, I was glad to find them on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick delivery too.</li>
            <li>me, the whole point of flossing is to have a clean, fresh mouth.</li>
            <li>- he&#x27;s too lazy to floss, the dentist is happy with these-</li>
            <li>Since I discovered the Reach flossing system, I have been able to floss daily.  </li>
            <li>I now have a large supply of these, they were inexpensive and they came right to my door.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and I love them because I need the extra help.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use than dental floss.</li>
            <li>I just keep one ready to go at all times in my toothbrush holder with my toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Well, I really hit the jack pot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have paid more for a larger quantity instead of having to reorder so frequently.</li>
            <li>Why pay this high price ?</li>
            <li>I suffer from TMJ and highly recommend the reach handle flosser.</li>
            <li>This reach instrument, with refills, is easy, and so simple, to floss multiple times a day!  </li>
            <li>I bought this refill pack as it&#x27;s cheaper than a new flosser each time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered exactly what was pictured above -- the unflavored Reach Access Flosser Refill</li>
            <li>I was glad to find these at Amazon, they are hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li>Now, the refills are getting harder to find in stores, I have been fortunate enough to find them online.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together, and I cannot floss with regular floss.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of flosser refills in this package, but the individual blister packs can be cut off of the main strip to make a travel-size package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I love these, but except for the few which come with the Flosser handle in the stores, you cannot find the unflavored refills, at least not near me.  </li>
            <li> day I thought, hey, why not see if 1) these are being sold on Amazon 2) by someone with a high rating and 3) who also has lots of sales behind the high ratings.  </li>
            <li> we order these along with deodorent, hand soap and baby clothes soap all in bulk through AMAzon - it costs less than the local grocery store</li>
            <li> This little gadget has turned me into a daily flosser.  </li>
            <li> The picture above IS the unflavored because the flavored is green in color.  </li>
            <li> Traditional flossing is a pain and the back teeth are hard to get to, and I always had to stop if the circulation got cut off on my finger tips!  </li>
            <li> I have a really hard time getting regular floss in my molars.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time reaching the back of my mouth to floss.</li>
            <li> This helps when your teeth are tight against each other.</li>
            <li> ME3 AND A HALF MONTHS</li>
            <li> When I found it on Amazon, I snatched up a few packs.</li>
            <li> Ever get just plain tired of going to the store to buy personal care products?</li>
            <li> The unflavored are beginning to become a little hard to find.</li>
            <li> The CVS flossers were tough to get in between</li>
            <li> I used to hate going to the dentist for the simple reason, I knew that among what ever else she may do to me, I would be guaranteed to lie to her, about what?</li>
            <li> The reason I went to Amazon to purchase this product is that I have been unable to find the unflavored variety in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Well, this is the worst one on my list because the stores are so often out of them!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product and a good price.  The fact they are not flavored matters not.  I don&#x27;t require jazzed up products.</li>
            <li> we order these along with deodorent, hand soap and baby clothes soap all in bulk through AMAzon - it costs less than the local grocery store and it all comes with super saver shipping - and these are saving my husbands teeth - he&#x27;s too lazy to floss, the dentist is happy with these-</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than dental floss. I just keep one ready to go at all times in my toothbrush holder with my toothbrushes. Have another in the guest bathroom for any guests.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time getting regular floss in my molars. The &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; (as I call them) flossers work much better &amp; this seller was great about getting my purchase out in a timely fashion. The package came in good condition &amp; nothing had been opened or damaged.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find these at Amazon, they are hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> I think this is the best way to floss, but I would like them to last longer than a couple weeks before they break from use.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together, and I cannot floss with regular floss.  Since I discovered the Reach flossing system, I have been able to floss daily.  Now, the refills are getting harder to find in stores, I have been fortunate enough to find them online.</li>
            <li> Ever get just plain tired of going to the store to buy personal care products? Well, this is the worst one on my list because the stores are so often out of them!  I&#x27;m constantly searching, searching...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I thought, hey, why not see if 1) these are being sold on Amazon 2) by someone with a high rating and 3) who also has lots of sales behind the high ratings.  Well, I really hit the jack pot.  I now have a large supply of these, they were inexpensive and they came right to my door.  Sheesh.  I have to shop this way more often.</li>
            <li> Very good for getting into &amp;#34;ditches&amp;#34; between teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time reaching the back of my mouth to floss. The Dr. Butler tool was good, but this Reach Floss product is the best. The unflavored are beginning to become a little hard to find. There is amazon and [...] but amazon is cheaper for now.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever, I love without any mint flavor, it&#x27;s handy, strong enough for tight contacts it&#x27;s a must have on your daily dental care.</li>
            <li> I believe they help your teeth hygiene better than if you do not use them.</li>
            <li> I used to hate going to the dentist for the simple reason, I knew that among what ever else she may do to me, I would be guaranteed to lie to her, about what? Flossing!  Traditional flossing is a pain and the back teeth are hard to get to, and I always had to stop if the circulation got cut off on my finger tips!  This reach instrument, with refills, is easy, and so simple, to floss multiple times a day!  Now, when the dentist ask, do you floss, the answer is a proud YES!</li>
            <li> I love these, but except for the few which come with the Flosser handle in the stores, you cannot find the unflavored refills, at least not near me.  So I order from Amazon.  I don&#x27;t like peppermint, nor Scope in my toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I FLOSS MORNING AND NIGHT AND EACH HEAD LASTS ME 5 DAYS SO 1 28 HEAD PACK LASTS ME3 AND A HALF MONTHS</li>
            <li> These refills are the only way I can get myself to floss.&lt;br /&gt;Now someone just needs to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me the Reach Access Flosser (unflavored), which worked great. I like this brand because the floss is finer than similar generic flossers that you can find at places like CVS. This helps when your teeth are tight against each other. The CVS flossers were tough to get in between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the unflavored version, but you can&#x27;t find it anywhere. When I found it on Amazon, I snatched up a few packs.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> $3.99 on Drugstore.com Why pay this high price ?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for years, with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Easiest way in the world to floss your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Once you start, you won&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this transaction and would deal with them again. A+</li>
            <li> These are my favorite floss. it is hit and miss to find the unflavored in stores. Happy to find them on line.</li>
            <li> Received product extremely quick and in excellent condition. Would definitely buy again. Don&#x27;t have to hunt for in different stores and great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hater - I love, love, love Reach Access Flossers! But all the local stores quit stocking the unflavored refills, and started stocking these &amp;#34;mint-flavored&amp;#34; refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the whole point of flossing is to have a clean, fresh mouth. Well, that, and it makes visits to the dentist much more pleasant. But these mint-flavored refills leave a sickly sweet, and somewhat minty, taste in my mouth. I find it surprisingly repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these &amp;#34;unflavored&amp;#34; refills, but the product shipped to me was actually the mint-flavored refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: move on. Keep looking until you find the real, unflavored Reach Access Flosser refills, and enjoy your clean mouth! :-)</li>
            <li> Excellent!  As advertised.  Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This product works well instead of putting your hands in your mouth to floss..  You can do a much better job because you are working with a handle.  Recommend doing flossing this way especially kids would like this method.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It fits my flosser perfectly and is at a good price. I cannot say more good things about it.</li>
            <li> The dentist has been trying to get me to floss for 20 years. This little gadget has turned me into a daily flosser.  My gums are very pleased</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Can reach every area of my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a product I am very happy with. I am sure that will buy it again soon.&lt;br /&gt;  Ed W.</li>
            <li> I ordered exactly what was pictured above -- the unflavored Reach Access Flosser Refill and I received the flavored variety.  The reason I went to Amazon to purchase this product is that I have been unable to find the unflavored variety in retail stores.  The picture above IS the unflavored because the flavored is green in color.  I had to send it back and wanted to exchange it for the flavored but there was no way to do that using the return format I was given.  There was no phone number to contact the supplier to see whether they even had the unflavored variety.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of flosser refills in this package, but the individual blister packs can be cut off of the main strip to make a travel-size package.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be able to find these at my local drug store, and when they stopped carrying them, I was glad to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The mint ones are especially refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;A good buy.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for this item.  Was simple to add to my order and at a really good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Reach flosser since they became available &amp; it is the best flosser I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;  My dentist always asks what I use to floss with because this system is so good</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores anytime! I suffer from TMJ and highly recommend the reach handle flosser.</li>
            <li> Only 28 in the pack.  I&#x27;d rather have paid more for a larger quantity instead of having to reorder so frequently.</li>
            <li> Love these. Have ordered multiple times from this supplier. Quick delivery too.</li>
            <li> I have heard a good recommendation regarding this product and decided to buy as a present to my granddaughter. It is a perfect  and practical. The product made it&#x27;s way in 48 hours.</li>
            <li> these are great.  I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores.  These fit into the reach flossed and I love them because I need the extra help. I recommend them</li>
            <li> I bought this refill pack as it&#x27;s cheaper than a new flosser each time.  Each sections tears off.  Simple and works great</li>
            <li> Nice set of refills for my Reach Flosser.</li>
            <li> Great bargain for something I have been using for a long time.</li>
