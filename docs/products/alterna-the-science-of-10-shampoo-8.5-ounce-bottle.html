            <li>Very, very good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have not used this yet because i am using A Hair Vitamin Shampoo that is working great</li>
            <li>Another concern for me is that products that contain silicone make my hair look great but make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sooo happy I found it.  </li>
            <li>Great aroma, texture, packaging and result.</li>
            <li>Love!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shampoo and conditioner also, but their are others that are cheaper and just as good.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also extremely pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>From Onesta to Nano works, iv tried a lot of good stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>One of the best products ever, makes hair super healthy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing -</li>
            <li>I also would recommend this product to anyone since I have seen such great results and am very happy with how my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best shampoo I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>It is As good, and possibly Better than Pureology Nano works.</li>
            <li>everyone that has used this has noticed how much more their Hair has improved  .No</li>
            <li>but someday i will give this a try,but i will say my Kids Hair looks much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product,[Alterna</li>
            <li>, I think they&#x27;re just OK.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, has really improved my hair texture.  </li>
            <li>After years of trial and error, mostly error, I&#x27;ve found my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love Alterna 10.  </li>
            <li>I have used it many years ago</li>
            <li>all their products, the Ten line stood out as one of the best shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>A shampoo/conditioner liter duo set can save you even more, and often pop up on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>i love love love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten</li>
            <li>The keratin treatment gives me the hair I was never born with (board-straight, healthy and shiny) but</li>
            <li>When using this shampoo with its conditioner it is manageable, shiny, healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s better than the alterna Cavier.  </li>
            <li>I love this line</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and it makes it soft, beautiful and shiny.</li>
            <li>As someone who has tried nearly everything, I&#x27;m really impressed - definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>after just a couple uses my hair feels great, soft and shiny</li>
            <li>As good as their old White truffle lux line that is no longer in production, and i thought that was the best hair product on Earth.</li>
            <li>plus, it was easy to buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s nothing special on my head.  </li>
            <li>I have rather fine hair</li>
            <li>Alerna is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>Frizz,or dry ends seems to be great at repairing damaged Hair from all sorts of things especially Hair tools,leaves their Hair with a nice Shine and more Healthy looking Hair.</li>
            <li>Easy transaction and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I did not think it was anything special.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair and scalp clean and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>After only two uses, and with out the conditioner mind you, I am Very impressed with The Ten.</li>
            <li>on a good day, it tends to do a kinky, dry impression of a Brillo pad, waving in the breeze.   </li>
            <li>Granted, my hair is not back to the way it was, but I honestly don&#x27;t think that any product could help it.  </li>
            <li>So, it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>If your on the fence, let this review be the push over that fence, its worth the price.</li>
            <li>The smell its fresh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try the Caviar line next; Alterna makes amazing products and it&#x27;s possible that this is the best thing on earth for other people -- just not me.</li>
            <li>Super expensive but super great!  </li>
            <li>But I also mix conditioners until I get the right mix.  </li>
            <li>I does exactly what it states, you can see and feel an immediate change of your hair within the first time of use!  </li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and I love it!!  </li>
            <li>maybe try finding one of these first.</li>
            <li>Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day???</li>
            <li>Alterna 10 is an absolute 11!</li>
            <li>The first time or two</li>
            <li>So first of all, it lasts.  </li>
            <li>I also highlight so anything that will consistently work to improve the condition of my hair a must.</li>
            <li>After I got my first keratin treatment, I continued to use it because it&#x27;s sulfate-free.  </li>
            <li>I normally tend to color my hair 4-6 times a year (used to be more) since I was 14 years old. .</li>
            <li>I can smell it throughout the whole day too!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably a worthwhile investment, and the larger salon sizes help keep the cost reasonable.</li>
            <li>No more frizzies, leaves hair silky but with good volume.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t know if I would spend this much on shampoo if my hair wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please and would purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>so yeah, ironic gift...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a spendy item, but considering how much time and money people tend to put into their hair</li>
            <li>It came fast to my house after i bought it...</li>
            <li>&quot;  Lots of money for something that really doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>But what the real thing I noticed is that my hair is actually much fuller, softer and stronger than it was before I used this brand.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and have to use gentle products.</li>
            <li>I did receive the items fast, no problem, and would purchase again from seller.</li>
            <li>This Alterna shampoo made a surprising difference to my hair - at least as much as anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I like the scent as well as the texture but for half the price I can get caviar which performs as well or even better.</li>
            <li>I have used  a variety of high end shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I think I tend to damage my hair as the normal woman  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair which was thinning, probably due to both age and chemical processing.  </li>
            <li>It has four times the product for about 25% more money than the 8 oz bottles, and brings the price down immensely, pretty much in line with other high-end brands.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Yes it is pricey, but if you want manageable, soft hair get it!  </li>
            <li>The bottles are not flexible and you can see the top is very narrow.  </li>
            <li>Before I got my first keratin treatment, I could always count on Alterna Ten to make my hair look smooth and young looking, without weighing it down or stripping the color.  </li>
            <li>I previously had bought Joico K-Pak for my damaged hair, and I definitely think that this product works better.  </li>
            <li>A dime-size dot of the shampoo is MORE than enough for my medium-length guy&#x27;s hair, and just a half pump of the conditioner is sufficient.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li>I only bought it because of the price, which was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>the Alterna Ten keeps it looking that way much longer.  </li>
            <li>It is incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I have family members comment on my hair all the time because its sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes my natural color.  </li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s really no way to explain how much better this product is than other luxury</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not a magic transformation into the hair of my dreams, but after only a week, my hair feels smoother, less dry with a better texture and much more of a tendency to stay where I put it.</li>
            <li>Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  </li>
            <li>It is straight hair, shoulder length hair with no natural bounce.  </li>
            <li>I found the Ten line to not only cut down on tangles and friz, but it leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair was immediately soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>This much can be a big commitment, but I&#x27;ve seen Alterna Ten sample packets...</li>
            <li>It really is worth the money both in terms of the fact that you don&#x27;t have to buy it very often because a little goes a long way and because it truly does improve your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s with color-treated shoulder length fine, but slightly wavy hair, with a tendency to frizz in humid or wet weather.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it makes my long thick hair feel like silk.  </li>
            <li>So, I was left with severely damaged hair (gets very kinky and coarse when wet).  </li>
            <li>I am 47 years young and have maybe under 10 grey hairs in my lifetime.  </li>
            <li>You have to turn it upside down and really pound it on something</li>

            <li> Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  </li>
            <li> It is straight hair, shoulder length hair with no natural bounce.  </li>
            <li> I found the Ten line to not only cut down on tangles and friz, but it leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair was immediately soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> This much can be a big commitment, but I&#x27;ve seen Alterna Ten sample packets...</li>
            <li> It really is worth the money both in terms of the fact that you don&#x27;t have to buy it very often because a little goes a long way and because it truly does improve your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s with color-treated shoulder length fine, but slightly wavy hair, with a tendency to frizz in humid or wet weather.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes my long thick hair feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> So, I was left with severely damaged hair (gets very kinky and coarse when wet).  </li>
            <li> I am 47 years young and have maybe under 10 grey hairs in my lifetime.  </li>
            <li> You have to turn it upside down and really pound it on something</li>
            <li> : Pricey, but larger sizes and the fact that a little goes a LONG way offsets this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair products are a little out of my area of expertise, but I was fortunate enough to have discovered Alterna a couple of years ago when a friend of mine received a case of all their products after doing some work with them.</li>
            <li> I use about half as much Alterna Ten as Bumble &amp; Bumble or the other brands I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I have dry blonde hair</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s concentrated, it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The only other shampoo that comes close is the Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> With the dryness this time of year, my hair had gotten dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt leave it dry or brittle.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have always purchased whatever the product my hairdresser recommended but after I found this alterna Ten I have stopped trying all other product lines!  </li>
            <li> You only need a little of the product when shampooing.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way - a dime size is all it takes.  </li>
            <li> : Having mentioned that this is an expensive shampoo/conditioner, I also have to point out that it is very, very condensed.</li>
            <li> I use other Alterna styling products along with this.</li>
            <li> I do use one other cheaper shampoo alternating it maybe once or twice a year</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was in Europe a few months ago, and even though I had a converter for my Flat iron, there must have still been some sort of electrical problem because my flat iron got so hot that it badly burnt my hair and then melted.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive for not so special results.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing I have to say is that the shape of the bottle is not conducive to pouring.  </li>
            <li> Okay, understand that I really hate my hair</li>
            <li> Even though the bottle is rather small, it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> Once you can get it out the product is really great, but sadly I don&#x27;t use it a lot because it is very expensive and then so hard to get out that it takes the pleasure out of using it.</li>
            <li> the price is less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I feel like this not only didn&#x27;t solve that, but was actually less moisturizing than a million other, infinitely less expensive things I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly unhealthy hair, but it tends to be a bit on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the Science of Ten shampoo and conditioner for about a month now, and sad to say</li>
            <li> and then it is still hard to get out.  </li>
            <li> The holy grail it is not, at least for this user.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that can become a bit unmanageable.</li>
            <li> it is a big one, is it is VERY hard to get out of the bottle, sometimes almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get sick of it - I just had to give it up due to price.</li>
            <li> and I thought she was a little crazy because it was so expensive.  </li>

            <li> I bought this for my Family and it turned out to be a big hit in my House,everyone that has used this has noticed how much more their Hair has improved  .No Frizz,or dry ends seems to be great at repairing damaged Hair from all sorts of things especially Hair tools,leaves their Hair with a nice Shine and more Healthy looking Hair.I have not used this yet because i am using A Hair Vitamin Shampoo that is working great but someday i will give this a try,but i will say my Kids Hair looks much better.</li>
            <li> Good product. Excellent Job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was in Europe a few months ago, and even though I had a converter for my Flat iron, there must have still been some sort of electrical problem because my flat iron got so hot that it badly burnt my hair and then melted.  So, I was left with severely damaged hair (gets very kinky and coarse when wet).  I have been using this product for about a month and I think it is helping.  Granted, my hair is not back to the way it was, but I honestly don&#x27;t think that any product could help it.  I bought this item along with the conditioner and hair masque.  I previously had bought Joico K-Pak for my damaged hair, and I definitely think that this product works better.  However, I don&#x27;t know if I would spend this much on shampoo if my hair wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> I did not think it was anything special.  Very expensive for not so special results.</li>
            <li> Okay, understand that I really hate my hair - always have...on a good day, it tends to do a kinky, dry impression of a Brillo pad, waving in the breeze.   This Alterna shampoo made a surprising difference to my hair - at least as much as anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. No, it&#x27;s not a magic transformation into the hair of my dreams, but after only a week, my hair feels smoother, less dry with a better texture and much more of a tendency to stay where I put it. As someone who has tried nearly everything, I&#x27;m really impressed - definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this shampoo and I thought she was a little crazy because it was so expensive.  I have been using it for about 3 months and my hair is healthier and I am very happy with the results.  I would recommend using the conditioner with the shampoo.  I also would recommend this product to anyone since I have seen such great results and am very happy with how my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Love this product,[Alterna The Science of 10 Shampoo, 8.5-Ounce Bottle]] after just a couple uses my hair feels great, soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I really did. I&#x27;ve been using both the Science of Ten shampoo and conditioner for about a month now, and sad to say, I think they&#x27;re just OK. I don&#x27;t notice any staggering improvement in the condition of my hair, though believe me I tried. I don&#x27;t have particularly unhealthy hair, but it tends to be a bit on the dry side. I feel like this not only didn&#x27;t solve that, but was actually less moisturizing than a million other, infinitely less expensive things I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s nothing special on my head.  The holy grail it is not, at least for this user.  Another thing is the smell -- it&#x27;s not horrendous, but it reminds me of Ojon, the only shampoo I ever threw away because the scent made me gag.   So, it was worth a shot. I&#x27;ll try the Caviar line next; Alterna makes amazing products and it&#x27;s possible that this is the best thing on earth for other people -- just not me. C&#x27;est la vie. Or, c&#x27;est le cheveux I guess.</li>
            <li> I bought the conditioner also, and together, my hair is beautiful!! I do not need to comb my hair when I get out of the shower and I used to have to use a detangler. No frizzies, my highlights and lowlights GLOW, I have the softest hair and it shines!! Love!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have dry blonde hair and it makes it soft, beautiful and shiny. Even though the bottle is rather small, it lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, has really improved my hair texture.  No more frizzies, leaves hair silky but with good volume.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing - I didn&#x27;t get sick of it - I just had to give it up due to price. It makes your hair feels stronger, softer and healthier. I felt like I was spoiling my hair with it!</li>
            <li> Very, very good shampoo.  Does what it says it will do.  My hair was immediately soft and not dry. With the dryness this time of year, my hair had gotten dry and brittle.  Now it&#x27;s soft and shiney.  I&#x27;m very please and would purchase it again.  Only negative thing I have to say is that the shape of the bottle is not conducive to pouring.  I would rather have a squeeze type bottle.  Oh, and follow instructions.  You only need a little of the product when shampooing.</li>
            <li> A dont Lake this shampu  my heir star to feil</li>
            <li> After years of trial and error, mostly error, I&#x27;ve found my favorite shampoo.  It leaves my hair and scalp clean and smelling fresh.  It doesn&#x27;t strip color, or get greasy like some conditioning shampoos.  I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love Alterna 10.  I have used it many years ago and I have come back to it.  I have the Keritin treatment on my hair once a year.  Alerna is sulfate free.  I also use the 10 masque.  I would recommend this to anyone and the price is less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes my long thick hair feel like silk.  The only problem I have with it, and it is a big one, is it is VERY hard to get out of the bottle, sometimes almost impossible.  The bottles are not flexible and you can see the top is very narrow.  You have to turn it upside down and really pound it on something and then it is still hard to get out.  Once you can get it out the product is really great, but sadly I don&#x27;t use it a lot because it is very expensive and then so hard to get out that it takes the pleasure out of using it.</li>
            <li> Pros: One of the best products ever, makes hair super healthy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Pricey, but larger sizes and the fact that a little goes a LONG way offsets this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair products are a little out of my area of expertise, but I was fortunate enough to have discovered Alterna a couple of years ago when a friend of mine received a case of all their products after doing some work with them. He&#x27;s bald...so yeah, ironic gift...but it worked out well for me, ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all their products, the Ten line stood out as one of the best shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thick, curly hair that can become a bit unmanageable. I found the Ten line to not only cut down on tangles and friz, but it leaves my hair incredibly soft and smooth. I imagine that this is a dream product for women with shoulder-length or longer hair - there&#x27;s really no way to explain how much better this product is than other luxury shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con to Alterna Ten is the price. For value shoppers, you&#x27;ll want to check out the 33.8 oz / 1 liter size. It has four times the product for about 25% more money than the 8 oz bottles, and brings the price down immensely, pretty much in line with other high-end brands. A shampoo/conditioner liter duo set can save you even more, and often pop up on Amazon. This much can be a big commitment, but I&#x27;ve seen Alterna Ten sample packets...maybe try finding one of these first. Even one use shows how awesome this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Having mentioned that this is an expensive shampoo/conditioner, I also have to point out that it is very, very condensed. A dime-size dot of the shampoo is MORE than enough for my medium-length guy&#x27;s hair, and just a half pump of the conditioner is sufficient. My liter bottles therefore last me 18 months plus (no kidding), again massively offsetting the cost. I use about half as much Alterna Ten as Bumble &amp; Bumble or the other brands I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Alterna has created a heck of a product in their Ten line. It&#x27;s a spendy item, but considering how much time and money people tend to put into their hair it&#x27;s probably a worthwhile investment, and the larger salon sizes help keep the cost reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo.Easy transaction and quick shipping.Thank-You</li>
            <li> i love love love this shampoo. I have type 4c hair and this works soooo wellll on my hair. it doesnt leave it dry or brittle. It came fast to my house after i bought it... plus, it was easy to buy. thank you</li>
            <li> WOW!  Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day??? This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten like I do, this information is of mega importance!  Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  I started using their line and stopped using another line that contained gluten (unbeknownst to me) and guess what - My hair started growing like a weed!!!  Alterna 10 is an absolute 11!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair which was thinning, probably due to both age and chemical processing.  The first time or two I used this, my reaction was, \\&quot;Eh.\\&quot;  Lots of money for something that really doesn&#x27;t do much.  Except that was back in January.  It is now the end of April, and I am still on the same bottle of shampoo and the same bottle of conditioner, which I use every day.  So first of all, it lasts.  But what the real thing I noticed is that my hair is actually much fuller, softer and stronger than it was before I used this brand.  I have used Nioxin before, and I didn&#x27;t have this type of response.  It really is worth the money both in terms of the fact that you don&#x27;t have to buy it very often because a little goes a long way and because it truly does improve your hair.</li>
            <li> Superb product.  Makes a noticeable difference in the condition and texture of hair.  I have very curly hair and have to use gentle products. I also highlight so anything that will consistently work to improve the condition of my hair a must. When I use this, I see improvement.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best shampoo I have ever used!  The only other shampoo that comes close is the Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Shampoo.  But I also mix conditioners until I get the right mix.  I use Alterna The Science of 10, Root Awakening, and Wella Balsam.  Some times just Root Awakening and Wella Balsam.  this is the one that works the best for me.  Mixing conditioners is only one part-mix them in one hand.  The shampoo makes all the difference for me.</li>
            <li> I like the scent as well as the texture but for half the price I can get caviar which performs as well or even better.</li>
            <li> I only bought it because of the price, which was reasonable.  It&#x27;s a great shampoo and conditioner also, but their are others that are cheaper and just as good.  I did receive the items fast, no problem, and would purchase again from seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alterna Ten shampoo and conditioner for about three years.  It&#x27;s expensive, but I really feel it&#x27;s worth the money.  I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s with color-treated shoulder length fine, but slightly wavy hair, with a tendency to frizz in humid or wet weather.  Before I got my first keratin treatment, I could always count on Alterna Ten to make my hair look smooth and young looking, without weighing it down or stripping the color.  After I got my first keratin treatment, I continued to use it because it&#x27;s sulfate-free.  The keratin treatment gives me the hair I was never born with (board-straight, healthy and shiny) but the Alterna Ten keeps it looking that way much longer.  The smell is also extremely pleasant.  Because it&#x27;s concentrated, it lasts a long time.  I shampoo every two to three days, and a bottle lasts me four to six months.  Another concern for me is that products that contain silicone make my hair look great but make my skin break out. That&#x27;s not an issue with Alterna ten.</li>
            <li> Item was just as I bought in the salon!</li>
            <li> I have used  a variety of high end shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners. From Onesta to Nano works, iv tried a lot of good stuff. After only two uses, and with out the conditioner mind you, I am Very impressed with The Ten. It is As good, and possibly Better than Pureology Nano works. Because just using the shampoo alone, it feels like i used nano works shampoo and conditioner. This stuff is seriously awesome. As good as their old White truffle lux line that is no longer in production, and i thought that was the best hair product on Earth. I can Not wait to get the conditioner of this stuff! Cant recommend enough! If your on the fence, let this review be the push over that fence, its worth the price.</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVES THE PRODUCT.THANKS E.P</li>
            <li> Super expensive but super great!  I have rather fine hair and this provides a boost in body.  A little bit goes a long way - a dime size is all it takes.  I use other Alterna styling products along with this.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and I love it!!  I does exactly what it states, you can see and feel an immediate change of your hair within the first time of use!  Yes it is pricey, but if you want manageable, soft hair get it!  I do use one other cheaper shampoo alternating it maybe once or twice a year (j Beverly Hills rescue and fragile).  I am 47 years young and have maybe under 10 grey hairs in my lifetime.  It is straight hair, shoulder length hair with no natural bounce.  When using this shampoo with its conditioner it is manageable, shiny, healthy hair.  It is incredibly soft.  I have family members comment on my hair all the time because its sooo soft.  I normally tend to color my hair 4-6 times a year (used to be more) since I was 14 years old. . However I have not colored my hair the last 2 years.  My husband likes my natural color.  I think I tend to damage my hair as the normal woman  I love this product and I&#x27;m sooo happy I found it.  I feel it&#x27;s better than the alterna Cavier.  Over the years I have always purchased whatever the product my hairdresser recommended but after I found this alterna Ten I have stopped trying all other product lines!  I love this line and I hope that they will always have it.  The smell its fresh.  I can smell it throughout the whole day too!  Love it</li>
            <li> The best of the best when it comes to shampoo. Great aroma, texture, packaging and result. You get what you pay for.</li>
