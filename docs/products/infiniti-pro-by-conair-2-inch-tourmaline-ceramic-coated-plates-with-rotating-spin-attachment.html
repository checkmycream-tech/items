            <li>Great for the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the best it has ever looked from using a ceramic Iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great straightener!  </li>
            <li>This is the best bumpers you could use for any type hair.</li>
            <li>Ive bought all kinds some even over 100 dollars that were supposed to be the best and nothing worked.</li>

            <li>this works amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>Great Straightener!!!</li>
            <li>Manufacturers gave a habit of discontinuing some of the best products.</li>
            <li>have one at home and one at the gym because it is awesome.</li>
            <li>I love this!!!</li>
            <li>I am in love!!!</li>
            <li>and I thought the price was very fair.  </li>
            <li>very good.</li>
            <li>But, I loved the price, so I&#x27;ll keep it!</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, humidity will cause hair to re-curl or frizz no matter how great it looked after you straightened it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this one as a cheaper alternative that does a great job.</li>
            <li>so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This styler is great b/c</li>
            <li>It works great and is still working well.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this purchase, and it is quieter than the instyler.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the quality and performance...</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Its a great straightener.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This is my favorite!!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s very nice and seems to work well</li>
            <li>This is a perfect product for people with wavy hair, but not the best for super curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Effective!</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re just wanting a good straightener, this will work great for you, however</li>
            <li>I wanted easy way to do flips that I have perfect length for.</li>
            <li>The price was as good as I could find anywhere.  </li>
            <li>She had an iron already but this one is superior in quality.</li>
            <li>decided against another because I found it noisy and didn&#x27;t really do a good job</li>
            <li>So I recommend using some good protective products and go for it.  </li>
            <li>bought for my baby sister she loves it working good no problem......</li>
            <li>a good idea but not for me</li>
            <li>Does a good job on my bangs though.</li>
            <li>so I got this thinking it might be a good replacement.  </li>
            <li>This one is great because you can regulate the temperature and it has nice curve to so</li>
            <li>Straightens her hair most beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Recipient had tried another and loved it so was delighted to have one of her own.  </li>
            <li>Does an excellent job in straightening my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my Infiniti Conair rotating hair product.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Found it on amazon very reasonably priced and am very happy with the decision.</li>
            <li>I love the rotating barrel!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments, and was even asked if I had a Brazilian Blowout!  </li>
            <li>It works like magic!  </li>
            <li>Love this styler!  </li>
            <li>I love this straightener!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS THING!</li>
            <li>This things amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product because it doesnt &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but my hair looks AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The price was good, but if you use straighteners often I would spring for a better one.</li>
            <li>The temperate gets nice and ht</li>
            <li>It got warm</li>
            <li>Plus it does a nice job of straightening my hair and giving it volume.  </li>
            <li>The multi-directional barrel is nice, but it takes a minute to figure out how to use it.  </li>
            <li>The ProStyler did a great job at straightening my hair, but BOARD straight, like a chi and with the casing, you cannot curl the ends, I don&#x27;t care WHAT the packaging says!!!</li>
            <li>If you have a good grip and your arm does not tire easily, this is nice.</li>
            <li>Great for those quick makeup needs.  </li>
            <li>This is a good value for someone with fine or medium textured hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has super curly hair and this straightener is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Easy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so surprised that this doesn&#x27;t have many reviews, I think this is the best hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy my hair is straight shiney and has body, also it is very easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Even the instructions are very detailed as to how to use the item to straighten your hair, but there is no mention whatsoever about how to curl the hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product, easy storage and transportable.</li>
            <li>I wish it came with a better user manual.</li>
            <li>, it sounds nothing like a blowdryer, more like a power tool.</li>
            <li>And, most of all, it does remove frizz.  </li>
            <li>After many phone calls and emails, I did receive a refund, but it took months.  </li>
            <li>My daughter wanted to be able to straighten and use it to curl her hair, but it won&#x27;t curl.  </li>
            <li>Its does make your hair shiner and gives it more body.</li>
            <li>so I was confident in the brand.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it is shiny and healthy</li>
            <li>with many settings.</li>
            <li>Okay if you are even thinking about buying a overpriced Instyler do not buy it</li>
            <li>This is more than the description.</li>
            <li>and I love it for me as well.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I had people compliment me on how great his coat looked, straight &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m pleased with that too.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Compared to that I say this is much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure how to feel about this product..</li>
            <li>but sometimes i feel that my hair gets more damaged after using it.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair straightener, they should all have rotation.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This product is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I used to have the maxi-glide which is much better.  </li>
            <li>so glad I purchased it</li>
            <li>and I have used it more times in 1 week than I used the Instyler</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>This hair pro styler straightens well, was hoping for more shine in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really love this styler.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the Instyler, which cost more than $100, but the ConAir Styler does the job for me.</li>
            <li>, I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure</li>
            <li>1....strike 2 was when she wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the way it wasn&#x27;t flat-ironing or curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I just took my braids out and knew that I would have more resistant hair, I slept</li>
            <li>Love the product .</li>
            <li>love it, a must have.</li>
            <li>Love Conair products</li>
            <li>It works ok, but I  don&#x27;t feel that it straightens as well as</li>
            <li>she dont spend money and time any more</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I can return it tomorrow.</li>
            <li>My mom wanted a Styler like the one on tv, this one is much better because you can control where you want the drum go to and it twist itself when u close it</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love the motorized rotating barrel</li>
            <li>this takes the static out of your hair...</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>There is much more barrel exposure to do the job.</li>
            <li>well, flat, This is the best hair tool I have ever used</li>
            <li>My final advice: there are many excellent and cheap imitations of the \\&quot;InStyler\\&quot;, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>That being put out there and acknowledged, this product is still one of the best I have ever used, it was efficient and the finished results lasted a long time for me.  </li>
            <li>Had this for two years and still works just a good as the day I got it, my mother in law used it and loved it too, so we got her the same one for Christmas!!</li>
            <li>So far, it is working great.</li>
            <li>Like most of you, I bought this as a cheap alternative to the \\&quot;InStyler\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>i love that it leaves my hair smooth</li>
            <li>Do not have as much hair loss.....very easy to use!!</li>
            <li>Great for long hair not for short hair... item is really great!</li>
            <li>I was excited that I would be able to reverse the rotation of the barrel -</li>
            <li>It is sooooo easy to use.  </li>
            <li>button is easy to accidentally push while using, I dislike that.  </li>
            <li>I find it easy to use</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>My hair glided easily through the straightener without any snags.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>What i look for is something that wont break or burn my hair easily and something that straightens easily too.</li>
            <li>The easy &#x27;left&#x27; and &#x27;right&#x27; choice for the roller is awesome.</li>
            <li>But, this straightens very good, better than the other one I had.  </li>
            <li>Gets nice and hot and I like the brush</li>
            <li>Light weight and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>it works perfectly, Warning this should be use by professionals only or one who has experience in in hot ironing because it gets very hot and starch easy</li>
            <li>I need to see if there are replacement brushes because the brushes make a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>The ability to change the direction of the roller is a huge plus</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t realize how cheap it looked.</li>
            <li>The bristles that should hold my hair straight during the straightening process aren&#x27;t really effective.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL, NICE LOOKING UNIT</li>
            <li>And the rotating feature makes my hair glossy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I started with the Pantene keratin shampoo and conditioner and tressemee conditioner keratin smooth, then washed it all out and put the Pantene leave in keratin, as well as the tressemme keratin serum and Tressemme keratin heat</li>
            <li>Ihave such a sense of accomplishment using both tools and getting a great result.  </li>
            <li>It will straighten and smooth as advertised.  </li>
            <li>hair nice and smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>The only thing that doesn&#x27;t make this a perfect 5 star is that it doesn&#x27;t really straighten my roots</li>
            <li>It not only makes my hair silky and bone straight, with beautiful texture, but it lasts!</li>
            <li>It gets nice and hot quickly, which is a plus, I had mine cranked</li>
            <li>Oh and if you do purchase , please make sure the iron is curling your hair the right direction.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and straightens quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get this</li>
            <li>Sooooooo worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this for Christmas.</li>
            <li>so I am still getting used to it, but its definitely the best straightener I have used so far.</li>
            <li>The product is only as good as its operator.</li>
            <li>I saw the ProStyler in a CVS ad for $40 and went on Amazon to look at the reviews which were good enough for me to try it out.  </li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, it is a good item.</li>
            <li>I opted to pay the full price for it</li>
            <li>I really like this way better than the Instyler.</li>
            <li>For those with more texture, get the real In Styler.  </li>
            <li>Again, not a bad product per se, just misleading.</li>
            <li>but on my super thick hair, it does awesomely!  </li>
            <li>I am a novice when using styling tools, but found this one pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am using the flat iron now and that does fairly well.</li>
            <li>If you want your hair to be frizz free and super straight you should get a ceramic plate hair straightner, they work much better and are much faster too!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and the CHI straightener, which all stylists swear by, gets too hot for my hair and makes it look like straw.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>and I was a loyal Chi user and still bought this</li>
            <li>love the rotating part and especially the removable brushes on each end of the top side.</li>
            <li>I better return it and save my money for a new maxi-glide.</li>
            <li>Not even a straightening hot comb can do that!  </li>
            <li>When I saw that this was similar but got much better reviews and was cheaper, I had to try it out!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, has a temp setting, and auto shut off!!</li>
            <li>My ends look as if they were professionally done, my hair is straight and shiny, and when shaking my head, oh my god, I love the motion!</li>
            <li>This products is cheap to the touch and it pulls too much voltage</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair straight, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results I get with the Infiniti.  </li>
            <li>have used it on my own short hair to give it body</li>
            <li>I loved the way this made my hair look so much that I bought a second one for travel!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>These things are indestructible if you treat them right.</li>
            <li>a (left,off, right) button the switches the direction the roller goes in.  </li>
            <li>The Instyler was all right, but it seemed it was always blinking to show it was heating, my hair had a burned smell, the bristles would break my hair off..</li>
            <li>it was all right.</li>
            <li>it is going when you&#x27;re trying to use it on your hair and if you didn&#x27;t happen to choose the right direction, it fries your hair.</li>
            <li>Either it does not help the shine or I have not got the hang of using it right</li>
            <li>:) The tool isn&#x27;t heavy or clunky, but just right to get the job done. :)</li>
            <li>Less stress on your hair, good product for all hair types.  </li>
            <li>Finally, although the roller has great, steady movement, and the brushes seem fine, your hair doesn&#x27;t look polished, it looks dry.</li>
            <li>She has VERY VERY curly hair,</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not a horrible product and for some would be good if what you&#x27;re looking for an easy straightener to use maybe once or twice a week vs daily due to the damage done on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Similar products cost much more.  </li>
            <li>This thing is more like a true straightner, so be prepared to really not have any life, or movement to your hair when your done....</li>
            <li>It relaxed the curl pattern enough for me to be able to comb my hair with no pain and</li>
            <li>It straightens pretty well, but it leaves crimp marks in the hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with practice one could avoid the crimp marks, but I sent it back after one use.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a traditional straightener.</li>
            <li>:) If you want something to manage your hair, especially if it&#x27;s like mine, you need to buy this and do it</li>
            <li>really hot</li>
            <li>It is way more affordable and does the exact same job.</li>
            <li>First let me say I bought this for my dog.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I was a curling iron like an instyler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product that doesn&#x27;t burn the s</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s much quicker!  </li>
            <li>I recently saw the Pro Styler by Conair on clearance and it looked like it was designed better.  </li>
            <li>At the regular price of $53.00 it is a better product, at $13.00 which is what I paid, it is a steal.</li>
            <li>The more time you take to section your hair into smaller sections, the flatter and longer it lasts.  </li>
            <li>, I also noticed that if left my hair feeling and looking damaged at the ends instead of the \\&quot;polished\\&quot; healthy look like the InStyler.</li>
            <li>and FEELS healthy and shiny after use, so I don&#x27;t worry about using daily if I choose to.</li>
            <li>Sedu is the best it does not ruin your hair but straighten it out like how Hair salon does but quite expensive.  </li>
            <li>when I first used it..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and effective, very easy to use, with much less risk of burning yourself compared to the InStyler as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>with the barrel hidden inside you can never really tell which way works best for the directions you need.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super thick and very long but this straightener worked perfect!</li>
            <li>I find better results with the cheapy Andis flat iron.</li>
            <li>My flat iron does a much better job.  </li>
            <li>returned this ProStyler and bought the InStyler and love it SO much better because while it&#x27;s still hard for me to do curls,</li>
            <li>This is amazing to smooth out thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>a pretty large styling iron.</li>
            <li>The reviews, the price, the result have all equaled out for a positive experience for me.</li>
            <li>I will be buying one for my sis from here soon much cheaper;-)</li>
            <li>But make sure to use it properly or you will damage your hair by not having it on the correct heat level for your particular hair type.</li>
            <li>My hair looks like its been professionally blown out every time I use it, and its quick.  </li>
            <li>Overall it may work fine on thinner/light weight hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of wavy, fine hair that is all one length, above my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>really makes my very frizzy hair absolutely straight.</li>
            <li>The plate is also curves, so it doesn&#x27;t make your hair pin straight, it has volume.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy the ProStyler after I used my friend&#x27;s and couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it straightened my hair.</li>
            <li>straight.</li>
            <li>You really have to overdirect it to get it to do anything....</li>
            <li>My hair is really think and wavy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make it look stick straight, like someone mentioned before...</li>
            <li>it has body to it but still straight.  </li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t bone straight, which isn&#x27;t what i wanted anyway.  </li>
            <li>, I just remove the bristles to prevent breakage or it can bone straight</li>
            <li>I would not recommend, even if you do make it through your whole head without messing it up you do not get all the volume and straightness you would from the InStyler.  </li>
            <li>It pulled my hair an made it very frizzy.</li>
            <li>It is much like trying to use a curling iron if three sides were encased in plastic.</li>
            <li>You just end up with some very distinctive crimped lines in your hair that may require water and a blow dryer to get out.</li>
            <li>I have very curly and frizzy hair and</li>
            <li>The noise is much quieter than a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair</li>
            <li>; well this product did the trick and left my hair smooth, shiny, and managable.  </li>
            <li>It took them out, but I still don&#x27;t feel this works very well.  </li>
            <li>and now it still working very well.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, frizzy hair, and after using the styler, my hair is smooth with curl if and where I want it.</li>
            <li>ALWAYS HAVE BEEN VERY FOND OF CORNAIR PRODUCTS AND DECIDED TO GIVE THIS INFINITI PRO STYLER A SHOT,</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t straighten hair very well.</li>
            <li>i  the shea butter, curl smoothie and wore my hair in a bun with that in there for a whole day before attempting this experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hair was so straight</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to hair straightener because i have a lot of hair and highlighted too.</li>
            <li>I can say i really like this tool and recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>It only took me an hour to her hair and it looked so smooth and shiny, not burnt.  </li>
            <li>and I have very kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li>This styler doesn&#x27;t work incredibly fast or with the possibility of curing one&#x27;s hair as one goes, as I thought it would, but it does work well.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend as a hair straightener.</li>
            <li>My hair are straight</li>
            <li>my daughter owns one and she has been using it for 5 years... Very durable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and expected this product to straighten much better.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product but can get heavy after awhile.</li>
            <li>This does not have a clamp lock, or a safe way to lay it down in case you need to, while it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li>it using a comb attachment, and then I have to use a curling iron or flat iron to get it really smooth.</li>
            <li>You can also pop out the barrel and clean it when necessary.</li>
            <li>I know how my hair is, but as far as getting my hair straight or doing the flip, it wasn&#x27;t so hot.</li>
            <li>Do your research, and make sure that the barrel is completely exposed, unless you like dry hair. . .</li>
            <li>Now to be honest I have to go over each section twice, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair so soft straight and shiny!</li>
            <li>I can wear it naturally curly or straight!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and completely straight!</li>
            <li>I purchased both this and the instyler and found both to be helpful in styling my coarse, fine, 1/2 relaxed, 1/2 natural 3-4ab hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just in love with this product &amp; cheaper than other ones out there!</li>
            <li>Half the price of Instyler, quiter than instyler, straightens way better than instyler</li>
            <li>Most stores are closing the Conair Pro Styler at half the price which you can purchase it</li>
            <li>I have SUPER coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s worth the price and works better than the InStyler, which is much more expensive, in some ways.</li>
            <li>I had to play with the heat settings a bit because I turned it up too high</li>
            <li>This styles much better than a regular flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I liked using less heat than a flat iron and not burning the hell out of my hair as this seemed much gentler.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a lot of the RenPure spray, particularly on the new growth portion.  </li>
            <li>and this got my hair straight but natural looking with out making it look fried or frizzy.</li>
            <li>But for someone with long or thick hair this would be a great styler.</li>
            <li>and when I did it dried out my hair even more.  </li>
            <li>Normally, when I want to straighten my hair</li>
            <li>pretty much does both of these processes at the same time!</li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t have the patience to try and figure it nor do I have the time since I normally straighten my hair for work.</li>
            <li>This took my normal 1 hour hair straightening job and made it a 30 min breeze.</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t drop $100 on a hair tool.</li>
            <li>For ME, the InStyler was worth the extra $50.</li>
            <li>A poor imitaion of a good product.  </li>
            <li>I have thick and kind of kinky hair</li>
            <li>Yes, it does have the option of changing the spin from left to right, but</li>
            <li>It does not rotate I turn the switch to left or right</li>
            <li>I actually prefer it over my chi which is saying a lot right there.</li>
            <li>Still need to figure out about the right or left option..</li>
            <li>I put it on the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; setting when I go into my hair from the right, and the left setting</li>
            <li>I live in a city</li>
            <li>My manager even noticed my new hair look and complimented me.</li>
            <li>I live this tool, if you want volume or some shine to your hair use this.</li>
            <li>mash&amp;#34; my new growth curls</li>
            <li>This has also fried my hair and broken off so many pieces because the hair is easily caught in between various nooks of the styler.</li>
            <li>I love this, I have long curly hair, well frizzy when long.</li>
            <li>I was particularly pleased that my hair had no &#x27;artificial straightening marks&#x27;  that you would see using a small flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have VERY naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s got very wavy hair and for shows he&#x27;s supposed to have flat, straight hair.</li>
            <li>it just feels as big as the first irons that came out.</li>
            <li>After using the setting listed for my hair, my hair left hot as fire even after a minute of running the straightner through.  </li>
            <li>If it is humid, I have to do again, but usually just the top layer.  </li>
            <li>I bought the ProStyler first, obviously because it was $50 cheaper</li>
            <li>Seems easy to use but takes a little time for her hair</li>
            <li>Sadly I had to return because it smelled like it was going to start a fire while turning on and letting them warm up in preparation for first time use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long, thick, and wavy; and the ProStyler does a good job straightening it.</li>
            <li>This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>My advice it to get this product, just be careful as it gets very hot</li>
            <li>I washed my hair yesterday and even after using my temperature controlled hot comb and flat iron to lay this stuff out, my hair just wasn&#x27;t trying to straighten.</li>
            <li>I bought This thinking it was the instyler, and I was, at first a little disappointed, but it turns out to be a pretty awesome straightener.</li>
            <li>I have tried many wet to dry straighteners</li>
            <li>Those of us with very very curly thick hair knows deep in our hearts that there is no product that is going to give us silky smooth straight hair (that looks natural).</li>
            <li>The only con is that it is LOUD (as much as the inslyler)  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and when I cut my hair short it got really curly.</li>
            <li>Overall, it looked natural smooths and shiny for for the whole day</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is just me, old ham hands.  </li>
            <li>I would deffinately recommend this product to anyone who wants a simple way to straighten their hair without frying it.</li>
            <li>With NO blow-out, this took 14  minutes for her entire head and it was pin straight.</li>
            <li>the roots of my hair were the only things straight on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Efficient, near instantaneous results.</li>
            <li>, I already have body to my hair but this tamed it and put it in place with a natural wave.</li>
            <li>This was way to big and bulky and did not heat up as much as I thought.</li>
            <li>The old one I had for years and years stopped working, and it is no longer made.</li>
            <li>my hair is medium length with natural waves and can get frizzy at times.</li>
            <li>Really needed on with tension combs and this was the only one I could find.  </li>
            <li>It also \\&quot;crimps\\&quot; the hair if you don&#x27;t get with it and move fast enough!!</li>
            <li>but mine is getting old</li>
            <li>I thought wow...</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old worn out instyler.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>i have thick wavy coarse hair and this product not only straightens as good as a Chi</li>
            <li>As much as I love my hair, it&#x27;s been quite a challenge my entire life to tame.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and and made my usually frizzy and fly-away</li>
            <li>And it works so much quicker and without burning his hair like my other straight iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, your hair needs to be almost dry, it is not a dryer.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron heat up really well.</li>
            <li>I read some of the other reviews about this product that made me laugh.</li>
            <li>However, I have noticed my hair looks a little dry if I use it very often; I believe that this will happen if any kind of flat iron/blow dryer used with the same frecuency.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this at all , when using at low temperature it did nothing to my hair when using on high temp.</li>
            <li>My hair was not soft, but not dehydrated but really straight.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is that for styling different parts of your head, particularly if you have different lengths and different hair textures you willl really prefer the prostyler.  </li>
            <li>sooo heavy, big, huge in fact, I gave it away.</li>
            <li>When dry, I then sprayed on the RenPure Originals Brazilian 4 day straight leave in spray and then followed with the prostyler and the instyler.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the on/off button would be better as a slide  switch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really tempted to purchase a second one in case I wear out my current iron.</li>
            <li>This product is simply Amazing, I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to achieve the salon look at home because I recently cut my very curly thick hair in short layers and when I tried the combination of the blow dryer and hot curler it left me with very dry flat hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, as I&#x27;ve tried so many others only to be dissapointed, but amazed at the outcome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m latin and we tend to have very hard to manage hair, on top of that</li>
            <li>Still love it &amp; use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li>it worked fine and no more snags!</li>
            <li>It would be stick straight and stick flat against my head if I pulled the straightener through, or the wave would just be pressed flat, but still be \\&quot;bumpy\\</li>
            <li>The barrel barely makes contact with my hair.</li>
            <li>AS FAR AS BURNING THERE HAIR TO FALLING APART IN A SHORT TIME.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The iron is working as advertised!  :O)</li>
            <li>I did my 9 year old&#x27;s hair last</li>
            <li>Took my naturally very curly hair to smooth and silky in MUCH less time than my usual blow dryer/flat iron combo.  </li>
            <li>have long, super thick, course wavy hair and this straightens it out so fast</li>
            <li>When putting this little miracle to my hair with the proper protection, my hair became straight instantly within 25 minutes as opposed to the 1 1/2 hours it would have taken with my flat iron and temperature controlled hot comb with no results.</li>
            <li>this pro styler gives my hair a silky finish and does not leave my hair damaged and flat to my head as a normal flat iron would.</li>
            <li>It did not straighten very well and would take multiple tries.</li>
            <li>and I like to straighten it and then put in soft big waves with a big barrel curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The rotating part is pretty pointless as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>It was half the price as the Instyler and did the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>BECAUSE there are no directions included other than &amp;#34;Pull thru hair slowly for straight hair and quickly for body.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I have thick, naturally wavy hair, this is better than using a flat iron, it replaces me having to use a round brush to dry and a flat iron afterwards if I want to go with straight or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, super thick naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I only wish I had not given away my second free in styler as now mine is starting to die slowly.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, and it has always been a problem to straighten my hair so it naturally straight looking in the past.  </li>
            <li>Recommended to style straight or slightly curly look.</li>
            <li>If you have thin to medium consistance and not too long you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>It gets kind of annoying the first couple times you use it but after that youre use to it.</li>
            <li>After just minutes of owning this product, I can say it works wonders on super thick course hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Now is the akward time when the hair are not long and not short.</li>
            <li>The manual says nothing about the roller&#x27;s Left Off or Right functions, so not exactly sure</li>
            <li>I have pretty long slightly frizzy/curly hair and no matter if I had the roller on or off, my hair would still get caught up in something and torn out.</li>
            <li>Btw I have super thick curly hair and was definitely suprised with this one!</li>
            <li>I really beats the difficult to maneuver InStyler at more than half the price.</li>
            <li>It took 4 times as long to get my hair silky straight with this as opposed to a regular hair straightener, which negates any other reason one might have for using it.</li>

            <li> Great straightener!  </li>
            <li> This is the best bumpers you could use for any type hair.</li>

            <li> But, I loved the price, so I&#x27;ll keep it!</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, humidity will cause hair to re-curl or frizz no matter how great it looked after you straightened it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this one as a cheaper alternative that does a great job.</li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite!!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s very nice and seems to work well</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product for people with wavy hair, but not the best for super curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Effective!</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re just wanting a good straightener, this will work great for you, however</li>
            <li> I wanted easy way to do flips that I have perfect length for.</li>
            <li> The price was as good as I could find anywhere.  </li>
            <li> She had an iron already but this one is superior in quality.</li>
            <li> decided against another because I found it noisy and didn&#x27;t really do a good job</li>
            <li> So I recommend using some good protective products and go for it.  </li>
            <li> bought for my baby sister she loves it working good no problem......</li>
            <li> a good idea but not for me</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my bangs though.</li>
            <li> so I got this thinking it might be a good replacement.  </li>
            <li> This one is great because you can regulate the temperature and it has nice curve to so</li>
            <li> Straightens her hair most beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Recipient had tried another and loved it so was delighted to have one of her own.  </li>
            <li> Does an excellent job in straightening my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Infiniti Conair rotating hair product.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Found it on amazon very reasonably priced and am very happy with the decision.</li>
            <li> I love the rotating barrel!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments, and was even asked if I had a Brazilian Blowout!  </li>
            <li> It works like magic!  </li>
            <li> Love this styler!  </li>
            <li> I love this straightener!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS THING!</li>
            <li> This things amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product because it doesnt &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but my hair looks AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The price was good, but if you use straighteners often I would spring for a better one.</li>
            <li> The temperate gets nice and ht</li>
            <li> It got warm</li>
            <li> Plus it does a nice job of straightening my hair and giving it volume.  </li>
            <li> The multi-directional barrel is nice, but it takes a minute to figure out how to use it.  </li>
            <li> The ProStyler did a great job at straightening my hair, but BOARD straight, like a chi and with the casing, you cannot curl the ends, I don&#x27;t care WHAT the packaging says!!!</li>
            <li> If you have a good grip and your arm does not tire easily, this is nice.</li>
            <li> Great for those quick makeup needs.  </li>
            <li> This is a good value for someone with fine or medium textured hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair and this straightener is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Easy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so surprised that this doesn&#x27;t have many reviews, I think this is the best hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely happy my hair is straight shiney and has body, also it is very easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Even the instructions are very detailed as to how to use the item to straighten your hair, but there is no mention whatsoever about how to curl the hair.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product, easy storage and transportable.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a better user manual.</li>
            <li> , it sounds nothing like a blowdryer, more like a power tool.</li>
            <li> And, most of all, it does remove frizz.  </li>
            <li> After many phone calls and emails, I did receive a refund, but it took months.  </li>
            <li> My daughter wanted to be able to straighten and use it to curl her hair, but it won&#x27;t curl.  </li>
            <li> Its does make your hair shiner and gives it more body.</li>
            <li> so I was confident in the brand.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it is shiny and healthy</li>
            <li> with many settings.</li>
            <li> Okay if you are even thinking about buying a overpriced Instyler do not buy it</li>
            <li> This is more than the description.</li>
            <li> and I love it for me as well.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I had people compliment me on how great his coat looked, straight &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m pleased with that too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> Compared to that I say this is much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure how to feel about this product..</li>
            <li> but sometimes i feel that my hair gets more damaged after using it.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair straightener, they should all have rotation.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This product is just ok.  </li>
            <li> I used to have the maxi-glide which is much better.  </li>
            <li> so glad I purchased it</li>
            <li> and I have used it more times in 1 week than I used the Instyler</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> This hair pro styler straightens well, was hoping for more shine in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this styler.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Instyler, which cost more than $100, but the ConAir Styler does the job for me.</li>
            <li> , I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> You just have to make sure</li>
            <li> 1....strike 2 was when she wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the way it wasn&#x27;t flat-ironing or curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I just took my braids out and knew that I would have more resistant hair, I slept</li>
            <li> Love the product .</li>
            <li> love it, a must have.</li>
            <li> Love Conair products</li>
            <li> It works ok, but I  don&#x27;t feel that it straightens as well as</li>
            <li> she dont spend money and time any more</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I can return it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> My mom wanted a Styler like the one on tv, this one is much better because you can control where you want the drum go to and it twist itself when u close it</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Love the motorized rotating barrel</li>
            <li> this takes the static out of your hair...</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> There is much more barrel exposure to do the job.</li>
            <li> well, flat, This is the best hair tool I have ever used</li>
            <li> My final advice: there are many excellent and cheap imitations of the \\&quot;InStyler\\&quot;, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> That being put out there and acknowledged, this product is still one of the best I have ever used, it was efficient and the finished results lasted a long time for me.  </li>
            <li> Had this for two years and still works just a good as the day I got it, my mother in law used it and loved it too, so we got her the same one for Christmas!!</li>
            <li> So far, it is working great.</li>
            <li> Like most of you, I bought this as a cheap alternative to the \\&quot;InStyler\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> i love that it leaves my hair smooth</li>
            <li> Do not have as much hair loss.....very easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Great for long hair not for short hair... item is really great!</li>
            <li> I was excited that I would be able to reverse the rotation of the barrel -</li>
            <li> It is sooooo easy to use.  </li>
            <li> button is easy to accidentally push while using, I dislike that.  </li>
            <li> I find it easy to use</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> My hair glided easily through the straightener without any snags.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> What i look for is something that wont break or burn my hair easily and something that straightens easily too.</li>
            <li> The easy &#x27;left&#x27; and &#x27;right&#x27; choice for the roller is awesome.</li>
            <li> But, this straightens very good, better than the other one I had.  </li>
            <li> Gets nice and hot and I like the brush</li>
            <li> Light weight and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> it works perfectly, Warning this should be use by professionals only or one who has experience in in hot ironing because it gets very hot and starch easy</li>
            <li> I need to see if there are replacement brushes because the brushes make a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> The ability to change the direction of the roller is a huge plus</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize how cheap it looked.</li>
            <li> The bristles that should hold my hair straight during the straightening process aren&#x27;t really effective.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL, NICE LOOKING UNIT</li>
            <li> And the rotating feature makes my hair glossy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I started with the Pantene keratin shampoo and conditioner and tressemee conditioner keratin smooth, then washed it all out and put the Pantene leave in keratin, as well as the tressemme keratin serum and Tressemme keratin heat</li>
            <li> Ihave such a sense of accomplishment using both tools and getting a great result.  </li>
            <li> It will straighten and smooth as advertised.  </li>
            <li> hair nice and smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> The only thing that doesn&#x27;t make this a perfect 5 star is that it doesn&#x27;t really straighten my roots</li>
            <li> It not only makes my hair silky and bone straight, with beautiful texture, but it lasts!</li>
            <li> It gets nice and hot quickly, which is a plus, I had mine cranked</li>
            <li> Oh and if you do purchase , please make sure the iron is curling your hair the right direction.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and straightens quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get this</li>
            <li> Sooooooo worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this for Christmas.</li>
            <li> so I am still getting used to it, but its definitely the best straightener I have used so far.</li>
            <li> The product is only as good as its operator.</li>
            <li> I saw the ProStyler in a CVS ad for $40 and went on Amazon to look at the reviews which were good enough for me to try it out.  </li>
            <li> Overall, for the price, it is a good item.</li>
            <li> I opted to pay the full price for it</li>
            <li> I really like this way better than the Instyler.</li>
            <li> For those with more texture, get the real In Styler.  </li>
            <li> Again, not a bad product per se, just misleading.</li>
            <li> but on my super thick hair, it does awesomely!  </li>
            <li> I am a novice when using styling tools, but found this one pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am using the flat iron now and that does fairly well.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to be frizz free and super straight you should get a ceramic plate hair straightner, they work much better and are much faster too!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and the CHI straightener, which all stylists swear by, gets too hot for my hair and makes it look like straw.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> and I was a loyal Chi user and still bought this</li>
            <li> love the rotating part and especially the removable brushes on each end of the top side.</li>
            <li> I better return it and save my money for a new maxi-glide.</li>
            <li> Not even a straightening hot comb can do that!  </li>
            <li> When I saw that this was similar but got much better reviews and was cheaper, I had to try it out!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, has a temp setting, and auto shut off!!</li>
            <li> My ends look as if they were professionally done, my hair is straight and shiny, and when shaking my head, oh my god, I love the motion!</li>
            <li> This products is cheap to the touch and it pulls too much voltage</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair straight, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results I get with the Infiniti.  </li>
            <li> have used it on my own short hair to give it body</li>
            <li> I loved the way this made my hair look so much that I bought a second one for travel!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> These things are indestructible if you treat them right.</li>
            <li> a (left,off, right) button the switches the direction the roller goes in.  </li>
            <li> The Instyler was all right, but it seemed it was always blinking to show it was heating, my hair had a burned smell, the bristles would break my hair off..</li>
            <li> it was all right.</li>
            <li> it is going when you&#x27;re trying to use it on your hair and if you didn&#x27;t happen to choose the right direction, it fries your hair.</li>
            <li> Either it does not help the shine or I have not got the hang of using it right</li>
            <li> :) The tool isn&#x27;t heavy or clunky, but just right to get the job done. :)</li>
            <li> Less stress on your hair, good product for all hair types.  </li>
            <li> Finally, although the roller has great, steady movement, and the brushes seem fine, your hair doesn&#x27;t look polished, it looks dry.</li>
            <li> She has VERY VERY curly hair,</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not a horrible product and for some would be good if what you&#x27;re looking for an easy straightener to use maybe once or twice a week vs daily due to the damage done on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Similar products cost much more.  </li>
            <li> This thing is more like a true straightner, so be prepared to really not have any life, or movement to your hair when your done....</li>
            <li> It relaxed the curl pattern enough for me to be able to comb my hair with no pain and</li>
            <li> It straightens pretty well, but it leaves crimp marks in the hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with practice one could avoid the crimp marks, but I sent it back after one use.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a traditional straightener.</li>
            <li> :) If you want something to manage your hair, especially if it&#x27;s like mine, you need to buy this and do it</li>
            <li> really hot</li>
            <li> It is way more affordable and does the exact same job.</li>
            <li> First let me say I bought this for my dog.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was a curling iron like an instyler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first product that doesn&#x27;t burn the s</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s much quicker!  </li>
            <li> I recently saw the Pro Styler by Conair on clearance and it looked like it was designed better.  </li>
            <li> At the regular price of $53.00 it is a better product, at $13.00 which is what I paid, it is a steal.</li>
            <li> The more time you take to section your hair into smaller sections, the flatter and longer it lasts.  </li>
            <li> , I also noticed that if left my hair feeling and looking damaged at the ends instead of the \\&quot;polished\\&quot; healthy look like the InStyler.</li>
            <li> and FEELS healthy and shiny after use, so I don&#x27;t worry about using daily if I choose to.</li>
            <li> Sedu is the best it does not ruin your hair but straighten it out like how Hair salon does but quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> when I first used it..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and effective, very easy to use, with much less risk of burning yourself compared to the InStyler as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> with the barrel hidden inside you can never really tell which way works best for the directions you need.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and very long but this straightener worked perfect!</li>
            <li> I find better results with the cheapy Andis flat iron.</li>
            <li> My flat iron does a much better job.  </li>
            <li> returned this ProStyler and bought the InStyler and love it SO much better because while it&#x27;s still hard for me to do curls,</li>
            <li> This is amazing to smooth out thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> a pretty large styling iron.</li>
            <li> The reviews, the price, the result have all equaled out for a positive experience for me.</li>
            <li> I will be buying one for my sis from here soon much cheaper;-)</li>
            <li> But make sure to use it properly or you will damage your hair by not having it on the correct heat level for your particular hair type.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like its been professionally blown out every time I use it, and its quick.  </li>
            <li> Overall it may work fine on thinner/light weight hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of wavy, fine hair that is all one length, above my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> really makes my very frizzy hair absolutely straight.</li>
            <li> The plate is also curves, so it doesn&#x27;t make your hair pin straight, it has volume.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy the ProStyler after I used my friend&#x27;s and couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> straight.</li>
            <li> You really have to overdirect it to get it to do anything....</li>
            <li> My hair is really think and wavy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it look stick straight, like someone mentioned before...</li>
            <li> it has body to it but still straight.  </li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t bone straight, which isn&#x27;t what i wanted anyway.  </li>
            <li> , I just remove the bristles to prevent breakage or it can bone straight</li>
            <li> I would not recommend, even if you do make it through your whole head without messing it up you do not get all the volume and straightness you would from the InStyler.  </li>
            <li> It pulled my hair an made it very frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is much like trying to use a curling iron if three sides were encased in plastic.</li>
            <li> You just end up with some very distinctive crimped lines in your hair that may require water and a blow dryer to get out.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair and</li>
            <li> The noise is much quieter than a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair</li>
            <li> ; well this product did the trick and left my hair smooth, shiny, and managable.  </li>
            <li> It took them out, but I still don&#x27;t feel this works very well.  </li>
            <li> and now it still working very well.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, frizzy hair, and after using the styler, my hair is smooth with curl if and where I want it.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS HAVE BEEN VERY FOND OF CORNAIR PRODUCTS AND DECIDED TO GIVE THIS INFINITI PRO STYLER A SHOT,</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t straighten hair very well.</li>
            <li> i  the shea butter, curl smoothie and wore my hair in a bun with that in there for a whole day before attempting this experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair was so straight</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to hair straightener because i have a lot of hair and highlighted too.</li>
            <li> I can say i really like this tool and recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> It only took me an hour to her hair and it looked so smooth and shiny, not burnt.  </li>
            <li> and I have very kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> This styler doesn&#x27;t work incredibly fast or with the possibility of curing one&#x27;s hair as one goes, as I thought it would, but it does work well.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend as a hair straightener.</li>
            <li> My hair are straight</li>
            <li> my daughter owns one and she has been using it for 5 years... Very durable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and expected this product to straighten much better.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product but can get heavy after awhile.</li>
            <li> This does not have a clamp lock, or a safe way to lay it down in case you need to, while it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> it using a comb attachment, and then I have to use a curling iron or flat iron to get it really smooth.</li>
            <li> You can also pop out the barrel and clean it when necessary.</li>
            <li> I know how my hair is, but as far as getting my hair straight or doing the flip, it wasn&#x27;t so hot.</li>
            <li> Do your research, and make sure that the barrel is completely exposed, unless you like dry hair. . .</li>
            <li> Now to be honest I have to go over each section twice, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so soft straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> I can wear it naturally curly or straight!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny and completely straight!</li>
            <li> I purchased both this and the instyler and found both to be helpful in styling my coarse, fine, 1/2 relaxed, 1/2 natural 3-4ab hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just in love with this product &amp; cheaper than other ones out there!</li>
            <li> Half the price of Instyler, quiter than instyler, straightens way better than instyler</li>
            <li> Most stores are closing the Conair Pro Styler at half the price which you can purchase it</li>
            <li> I have SUPER coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s worth the price and works better than the InStyler, which is much more expensive, in some ways.</li>
            <li> I had to play with the heat settings a bit because I turned it up too high</li>
            <li> This styles much better than a regular flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I liked using less heat than a flat iron and not burning the hell out of my hair as this seemed much gentler.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a lot of the RenPure spray, particularly on the new growth portion.  </li>
            <li> and this got my hair straight but natural looking with out making it look fried or frizzy.</li>
            <li> But for someone with long or thick hair this would be a great styler.</li>
            <li> and when I did it dried out my hair even more.  </li>
            <li> Normally, when I want to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> pretty much does both of these processes at the same time!</li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t have the patience to try and figure it nor do I have the time since I normally straighten my hair for work.</li>
            <li> This took my normal 1 hour hair straightening job and made it a 30 min breeze.</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t drop $100 on a hair tool.</li>
            <li> For ME, the InStyler was worth the extra $50.</li>
            <li> A poor imitaion of a good product.  </li>
            <li> I have thick and kind of kinky hair</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have the option of changing the spin from left to right, but</li>
            <li> It does not rotate I turn the switch to left or right</li>
            <li> I actually prefer it over my chi which is saying a lot right there.</li>
            <li> Still need to figure out about the right or left option..</li>
            <li> I put it on the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; setting when I go into my hair from the right, and the left setting</li>
            <li> I live in a city</li>
            <li> My manager even noticed my new hair look and complimented me.</li>
            <li> I live this tool, if you want volume or some shine to your hair use this.</li>
            <li> mash&amp;#34; my new growth curls</li>
            <li> This has also fried my hair and broken off so many pieces because the hair is easily caught in between various nooks of the styler.</li>
            <li> I love this, I have long curly hair, well frizzy when long.</li>
            <li> I was particularly pleased that my hair had no &#x27;artificial straightening marks&#x27;  that you would see using a small flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have VERY naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s got very wavy hair and for shows he&#x27;s supposed to have flat, straight hair.</li>
            <li> it just feels as big as the first irons that came out.</li>
            <li> After using the setting listed for my hair, my hair left hot as fire even after a minute of running the straightner through.  </li>
            <li> If it is humid, I have to do again, but usually just the top layer.  </li>
            <li> I bought the ProStyler first, obviously because it was $50 cheaper</li>
            <li> Seems easy to use but takes a little time for her hair</li>
            <li> Sadly I had to return because it smelled like it was going to start a fire while turning on and letting them warm up in preparation for first time use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, and wavy; and the ProStyler does a good job straightening it.</li>
            <li> This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> My advice it to get this product, just be careful as it gets very hot</li>
            <li> I washed my hair yesterday and even after using my temperature controlled hot comb and flat iron to lay this stuff out, my hair just wasn&#x27;t trying to straighten.</li>
            <li> I bought This thinking it was the instyler, and I was, at first a little disappointed, but it turns out to be a pretty awesome straightener.</li>
            <li> I have tried many wet to dry straighteners</li>
            <li> Those of us with very very curly thick hair knows deep in our hearts that there is no product that is going to give us silky smooth straight hair (that looks natural).</li>
            <li> The only con is that it is LOUD (as much as the inslyler)  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and when I cut my hair short it got really curly.</li>
            <li> Overall, it looked natural smooths and shiny for for the whole day</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is just me, old ham hands.  </li>
            <li> I would deffinately recommend this product to anyone who wants a simple way to straighten their hair without frying it.</li>
            <li> With NO blow-out, this took 14  minutes for her entire head and it was pin straight.</li>
            <li> the roots of my hair were the only things straight on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Efficient, near instantaneous results.</li>
            <li> , I already have body to my hair but this tamed it and put it in place with a natural wave.</li>
            <li> This was way to big and bulky and did not heat up as much as I thought.</li>
            <li> The old one I had for years and years stopped working, and it is no longer made.</li>
            <li> my hair is medium length with natural waves and can get frizzy at times.</li>
            <li> Really needed on with tension combs and this was the only one I could find.  </li>
            <li> It also \\&quot;crimps\\&quot; the hair if you don&#x27;t get with it and move fast enough!!</li>
            <li> but mine is getting old</li>
            <li> I thought wow...</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old worn out instyler.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> i have thick wavy coarse hair and this product not only straightens as good as a Chi</li>
            <li> As much as I love my hair, it&#x27;s been quite a challenge my entire life to tame.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and and made my usually frizzy and fly-away</li>
            <li> And it works so much quicker and without burning his hair like my other straight iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, your hair needs to be almost dry, it is not a dryer.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron heat up really well.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews about this product that made me laugh.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed my hair looks a little dry if I use it very often; I believe that this will happen if any kind of flat iron/blow dryer used with the same frecuency.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all , when using at low temperature it did nothing to my hair when using on high temp.</li>
            <li> My hair was not soft, but not dehydrated but really straight.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that for styling different parts of your head, particularly if you have different lengths and different hair textures you willl really prefer the prostyler.  </li>
            <li> sooo heavy, big, huge in fact, I gave it away.</li>
            <li> When dry, I then sprayed on the RenPure Originals Brazilian 4 day straight leave in spray and then followed with the prostyler and the instyler.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the on/off button would be better as a slide  switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really tempted to purchase a second one in case I wear out my current iron.</li>
            <li> This product is simply Amazing, I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to achieve the salon look at home because I recently cut my very curly thick hair in short layers and when I tried the combination of the blow dryer and hot curler it left me with very dry flat hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, as I&#x27;ve tried so many others only to be dissapointed, but amazed at the outcome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m latin and we tend to have very hard to manage hair, on top of that</li>
            <li> Still love it &amp; use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> it worked fine and no more snags!</li>
            <li> It would be stick straight and stick flat against my head if I pulled the straightener through, or the wave would just be pressed flat, but still be \\&quot;bumpy\\</li>
            <li> The barrel barely makes contact with my hair.</li>
            <li> AS FAR AS BURNING THERE HAIR TO FALLING APART IN A SHORT TIME.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The iron is working as advertised!  :O)</li>
            <li> I did my 9 year old&#x27;s hair last</li>
            <li> Took my naturally very curly hair to smooth and silky in MUCH less time than my usual blow dryer/flat iron combo.  </li>
            <li> have long, super thick, course wavy hair and this straightens it out so fast</li>
            <li> When putting this little miracle to my hair with the proper protection, my hair became straight instantly within 25 minutes as opposed to the 1 1/2 hours it would have taken with my flat iron and temperature controlled hot comb with no results.</li>
            <li> this pro styler gives my hair a silky finish and does not leave my hair damaged and flat to my head as a normal flat iron would.</li>
            <li> It did not straighten very well and would take multiple tries.</li>
            <li> and I like to straighten it and then put in soft big waves with a big barrel curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The rotating part is pretty pointless as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> It was half the price as the Instyler and did the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE there are no directions included other than &amp;#34;Pull thru hair slowly for straight hair and quickly for body.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair, this is better than using a flat iron, it replaces me having to use a round brush to dry and a flat iron afterwards if I want to go with straight or relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, super thick naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I only wish I had not given away my second free in styler as now mine is starting to die slowly.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, and it has always been a problem to straighten my hair so it naturally straight looking in the past.  </li>
            <li> Recommended to style straight or slightly curly look.</li>
            <li> If you have thin to medium consistance and not too long you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> It gets kind of annoying the first couple times you use it but after that youre use to it.</li>
            <li> After just minutes of owning this product, I can say it works wonders on super thick course hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Now is the akward time when the hair are not long and not short.</li>
            <li> The manual says nothing about the roller&#x27;s Left Off or Right functions, so not exactly sure</li>
            <li> I have pretty long slightly frizzy/curly hair and no matter if I had the roller on or off, my hair would still get caught up in something and torn out.</li>
            <li> Btw I have super thick curly hair and was definitely suprised with this one!</li>
            <li> I really beats the difficult to maneuver InStyler at more than half the price.</li>
            <li> It took 4 times as long to get my hair silky straight with this as opposed to a regular hair straightener, which negates any other reason one might have for using it.</li>
            <li> My curly hair which is rather thick was near my pin straight after 2 passes through it.</li>
            <li> Thick, frizzy, mid back length, and it takes serious amounts of product to make it look nice.</li>
            <li> I just blow dry my hair regular no round brush, then section it off once it is dry and start with the underneath hair and go for it.</li>
            <li> It has bristles that seperate the hair prior to straghtening, so it is flat and stays gripped well while you pull it through your hair.  </li>
            <li> A regular flat iron leaves my hair . . .</li>
            <li> i would have chosen a regular flat iron for myself.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat against your head like a traditional flat iron</li>
            <li> This thing I have to use very little hair at a time just to get it look slightly straight</li>
            <li> I usually keep the temperature on 3 out of 10, so if you have really curly hair</li>
            <li> With a flat iron it takes me close to an hour to straighten, with this iron it takes me 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> And you can make curls if you position your hair the way would to make curls using a flat iron</li>
            <li> I purchase this rotating flat iron for the holiday&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has a rotating barrel that you can use or not if you chose.</li>
            <li> flat iron w/comb&lt;br /&gt;made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a flat iron before, but I like the look.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with my flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> Eliminates curling iron &amp; flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly mixed African-American hair with tight soft curls and this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who uses a flat iron!</li>
            <li> it was flat against my head!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to using my poor old damaged instyler until I can afford to fork out the big bucks for a new one.</li>
            <li> I can wash my hair the night before allow my hair to air dry and straighten the following day with no issues.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and the Infiniti helps to smooth my hair without making it look limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this one and another styler, the Revo Styler, and decided on this one due to the fact that everyone said the barrel is smaller so it may be easier to use on my short hair.</li>
            <li> With other heating applications even Maxiglide, my hair will be straight for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair, this styler did not smooth my hair and the curl was more of a crimped wave, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> and it is bra length with long layers and bangs.</li>
            <li> I used the two appliances together on my daughter&#x27;s long, wavy hair and there was no contest.  </li>
            <li> BUT because it IS ENCASED within the plate, and only rotates when the plates are closed, there&#x27;s no way to tell which way to change it.  </li>
            <li> I also had some nice volume because I am terrible at using hot appliances with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair not so much, I have thick curly wavey frizzy hair, its a jungle</li>
            <li> only thing missing is that it doesn&#x27;t provide as much volume as I&#x27;d like, but that&#x27;s a small nitpick.</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten some hair but due to a weak wrist from a past injury</li>
            <li> I got this because I have 2 little girls that are interracial and straightening their hair become a major chore.</li>
            <li> The only thing this product does (and it does this badly), is straighten your hair-- as long as your okay with dry ends and no body.</li>
            <li> , I could not hold this very long and my arm started to get a cramp.</li>
            <li> (the hair should be to be dry though).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Having washed my hair yesterday, I didn&#x27;t blow dry it, but let my hair dry in the air while having a bit of moisture to it.</li>
            <li> It is not course but springy curls then poof at the ends after I blow dry.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look dry</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of my time and money!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave it just flat like other styling products</li>
            <li> remember, i have some repetitive stress issues in my arms and hands, and found that both together relieved any tension from another appliance and enabled me to complete the job.  </li>
            <li> other flat irons I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and live in a climate that is humid during the summer.  </li>
            <li> I do not need to use it while my haois wet or blow dry my hair in advance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair was dry at the end of the day, but i just put some castor oil on ends the hair and roller set it, with magnetic rollers in pink, and took it out in the morning.  </li>
            <li> But, this cost much less, which is always terrific!</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this tool for people that have thick hair, or cannot get other tools like this to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m STILL trying to figure out how to actually straighten curly hair with this thing, and still have a little bit of a bend to it...</li>
            <li> So a little experimentation is key.</li>
            <li> I have very thick very wavy hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and very curly.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no manual on how to use it</li>
            <li> I have always been curious about the InStyler, but I&#x27;ve seen the reviews</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> my hair frizzy, not straight or smooth&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never really heated up.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it, but worth a try as it had the brush feature.</li>
            <li> This product claimed to leave my hair shiney, it left it frizzy and dried out looking.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because i was curious after seeing the infomercials for the Instyler</li>
            <li> /&gt;So just be careful....</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I am an African American with extremely thick, curly hair and perms have never worked.</li>
            <li> Impossible to pull down smoothly, and my ends were only burned by this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t gripe too much about something that seriously delivers!</li>
            <li> But it is not very useful as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The iron is a bit big and heavy, a little harder to handle if you have some hand and wrist pain.</li>
            <li> have VERY thick coarse hair and this product straightens it with absolutely no problem in just a few minutes, my hair usually takes about a hour and a half to straighten with a normal flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the instyler in the past, will go back to it.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair every other day and just need something lighter.</li>
            <li> I like all my other Conair Infinity appliances</li>
            <li> Even in the Texas Gulf Coast&#x27;s extremely humid environment, my hair still resists the frizz.</li>
            <li> 7 DRY!!!  </li>
            <li> If i would have known it was a cheaper imitation...</li>
            <li> You are not able to tell, the roller only turns on when it&#x27;s clamped down.</li>
            <li> It is easier to hold and since the rotating barrel is not exposed you are less likely to burn yourself, which is what I hated most about the Instyler.</li>
            <li> The size of the iron was no more difficult to manage than a 2 inch flat iron, but it moved thru my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> your hair doesn&#x27;t come out stick straight (which makes it look fake).</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> have coarse thick hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you have thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Even after wrapping it up, when I took it down today, my hair was just puffy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair indeed holds a lot of humidity!</li>
            <li> It still makes the ends look flat and dull....</li>
            <li> The only cons about this is that, it is a bit on the heavy side and it is hard to lay it down correctly</li>
            <li> I used to spend at least 30 minutes doing with hair with both a blow dryer and a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This iron is less than half the price of the instyler and is easier to operate.</li>
            <li> Also, half the price of the instyler.  </li>
            <li> and I can basically straighten my hair in less than 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I am half African/American and Korean.  </li>
            <li> It pulls through her hair with ease and it cuts her hair do-ing time in half.</li>
            <li> so using regular irons actually make her hair look weird.  </li>
            <li> I suggest that you should not settle for anything less on your hair iron and just buy the expensive high quality brand like Sedu.  </li>
            <li> It is just not a good tool for me personally.</li>
            <li> There is no cool cap on the end of this device, you have to learn to style your hair with ONE HAND.</li>
            <li> My hair is too long and thick and this can&#x27;t handle the weight.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for anyone w/ thick, course &amp; dry hair...</li>
            <li> you have no ability to add a little curl.  </li>
            <li> The temperature is hard to manage and it leaves my hair feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn curly, coarse hair that is very hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> I have thick, tightly curled hair that has to be completely wet before I can pull a comb or pick through it.     </li>
            <li> It is also a little heavy.</li>
            <li> The rolling aspect of it is useless as far I my use of it goes.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a waste and would end up returning it.  </li>
            <li> and I guess I&#x27;m stuick with a dead product.  </li>
            <li> Well, I missed the Amazon return deadline by a few days and contacted Conair.  </li>
            <li> It does not smooth out my hair, it is still so frizzy.</li>
            <li> Too heavy and doesn&#x27;t straighten too well</li>
            <li> If accidentally shut it off a few times.</li>
            <li> It straightens well, but the rotating mechanism makes it heavy and clunky.</li>
            <li> WERE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THEM</li>
            <li> then dried my hair with a blow-drier and comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t straighten as well and without the round barrel</li>
            <li> Now, my styling time is cut in half!</li>
            <li> other than than I have thick curly hair and it worked and straightened it well.</li>
            <li> Did not work on thick hair, it would require very small portions of hair to be done at a time, and the small bristles did nothing to help guide the hair, and actually seem to tangle.</li>
            <li> Did not like this hair styling product, awkward to handle, made my hair feel very coarse and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning it because it&#x27;s not nearly as nice, even for about half the price.  </li>
            <li> probably because I was too lazy to return it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on thin/fine hair....</li>
            <li> The rolling part is small and I can&#x27;t for</li>
            <li> Just not happy with it it was not what I expected I can&#x27;t get it to work like it says it does</li>
            <li> conair helps her in few minutes to have always a favourite hair styling!  </li>
            <li> no more frizziness...</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the reviews on Amazon, so I was rather disappointed but in all fairness, it is hard to find the right styler.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and slightly frizzy and this straightener makes my hair shiny and sleek!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got wavy thick very coarse resistant hair, and to say the least I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> This is a must have and take my word for it, you will NOT regret owning this tool for stubborn and hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> While it heats well, it&#x27;s just way too hard to use.</li>
            <li> I recommend this if your hair is hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> Hard to work with and after spending HOURS trying ( also having my friends and coworkers try it ) still can&#x27;t do my hair with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed I had high hopes for this too.</li>
            <li> Frizz was my biggest complAINT.</li>
            <li> I got mine from CVS after seeing all the negative reviews of all the instylers and like there of.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago despite some negative reviews.</li>
            <li> My stylist used the InStyler to style my hair and had suggested that I purchase one, I have thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have medium-length, curly, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would work, so I sectioned my hair, applied a shea butter cream on it,and twisted it into a few twists to make it easier.  </li>
            <li> Being of ethnic origin, my hair just won&#x27;t act in the least bit right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after plugging this tool in and separating parts of my hair to test to see if this thing would even do wonders, let me tell you, it did!</li>
            <li> so I could travel internationally with it:(</li>
            <li> This is very hard to use on yourself, and the combs just tangle your hair.  </li>
            <li> I found the design of the product not very impressive.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are like plastic and the thin rotating part looks flimsy.</li>
            <li> no need to buy, overpriced and rotation is unnecessary</li>
            <li> were the humidity is terrible for trying to keep your hair straight.</li>
            <li> This item is the worse ever.</li>
            <li> This process takes a long time and I hate doing it.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointing and sad I wasted my money</li>
            <li> It was puffy, my ends looked just too un-managed, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to tame this stuff.</li>
            <li> I had the instyler, and could not get the hang of the roller going the \\&quot;wrong</li>
            <li> but this thing has a tendency to rip out your hair if you angle it wrong.  </li>
            <li> And my hair did get caught in the barrel once because I had the barrel rolling the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Alas alack!  </li>
            <li> and if you use it wrong your hair will get damaged or will not get the desired results.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to handle.t</li>
            <li> Also brush bristles are useless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless for me.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be cumbersome and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> but this one was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> You have to choose which direction for it to spin, but it is impossible to tell which way</li>
            <li> However, the design of this product is so bad, it cannot do any of the things</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this styler.  </li>
            <li> Geeze :(  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed w</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it did not straighten my permed hair like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this product.</li>
            <li> ( I think it was about 140.00) instead of doing monthly installments since that seems to be the worst part about purchasing from infomercials.</li>
            <li> Which ever moron decided that this didn&#x27;t need an endcap needs to use this thing every day... and see how it feels!  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> AWFUL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Buen producto solo que es un poco grande para las manos de una mujer.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;straightener&amp;#34; does NOTHING to my hair but pull it out. It doesn&#x27;t even straighten my hair. Highly disappointing and sad I wasted my money</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 yo granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it!!! I couldn&#x27;t afford the instyler so I settled for this! shes happy with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this iron after buying an instyler iron that broke on me after a short time. So far, it is working great. I have very coarse, thick, wavy hair. This iron straightens it with no problem. It will do flips, but it takes some practice. I wish it came with a better user manual. This iron is less than half the price of the instyler and is easier to operate. It does not curl hair, but the instyler didn&#x27;t either as it claimed. I read some of the other reviews about this product that made me laugh. This product will straighten your hair. HOWEVER, humidity will cause hair to re-curl or frizz no matter how great it looked after you straightened it. Don&#x27;t blame the iron! Also, it takes longer to straighten hair as you need to section it and take your time. If you fly through your hair, it will look like crap. The product is only as good as its operator.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn curly, coarse hair that is very hard to straighten. With a flat iron it takes me close to an hour to straighten, with this iron it takes me 20 minutes. And every strand is brushed and separated. I don&#x27;t even have to comb through my hair before straightening. The iron does that for me. No burned fingers either. Awesome pruduct.</li>
            <li> Daughter uses every day, EVERY day. These things are indestructible if you treat them right.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER coarse curly hair. I can make it look great with just a bit of effort! I really beats the difficult to maneuver InStyler at more than half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so surprised that this doesn&#x27;t have many reviews, I think this is the best hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I had the instyler, and could not get the hang of the roller going the \\&quot;wrong way\\&quot; on one side of my head.  This solves that problem with a (left,off, right) button the switches the direction the roller goes in.  It is sooooo easy to use.  My hair is naturally curly, and it has always been a problem to straighten my hair so it naturally straight looking in the past.  It would be stick straight and stick flat against my head if I pulled the straightener through, or the wave would just be pressed flat, but still be \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; if I clamped the iron over each section.  This does not happen with this styler.  It has bristles that seperate the hair prior to straghtening, so it is flat and stays gripped well while you pull it through your hair.  The plate is also curves, so it doesn&#x27;t make your hair pin straight, it has volume.  My hair looks like its been professionally blown out every time I use it, and its quick.  Also, half the price of the instyler.  Its a win/win!    The only con is that it is LOUD (as much as the inslyler)  Whenever he&#x27;s home when I use it, my husband asks me what the noise is, it sounds nothing like a blowdryer, more like a power tool.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  On/off button is easy to accidentally push while using, I dislike that.  But, this straightens very good, better than the other one I had.  And, most of all, it does remove frizz.  Frizz was my biggest complAINT.</li>
            <li> I got mine from CVS after seeing all the negative reviews of all the instylers and like there of.&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse thick hair it works perfectly, Warning this should be use by professionals only or one who has experience in in hot ironing because it gets very hot and starch easy take a small sample from the crown of your head first so if you burn it it wont show. I will be buying one for my sis from here soon much cheaper;-)</li>
            <li> It straightens as promised.  The only drawback is that the bristles of the brush succumbs to the heat and has melted on the side that I rotate the iron on.  I need to see if there are replacement brushes because the brushes make a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the ProStyler after I used my friend&#x27;s and couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it straightened my hair. My hair is long, thick, and wavy; and the ProStyler does a good job straightening it. I find it easy to use and I can basically straighten my hair in less than 15 minutes (the hair should be to be dry though). I used to spend at least 30 minutes doing with hair with both a blow dryer and a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on level 10 so I don&#x27;t damage my hair. However, I have noticed my hair looks a little dry if I use it very often; I believe that this will happen if any kind of flat iron/blow dryer used with the same frecuency.</li>
            <li> Gets nice and hot and I like the brush but this thing has a tendency to rip out your hair if you angle it wrong.  I ended up keeping it for some reason.... probably because I was too lazy to return it.  The rolling aspect of it is useless as far I my use of it goes.  The price was good, but if you use straighteners often I would spring for a better one.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and when I cut my hair short it got really curly. I read the reviews about this one and another styler, the Revo Styler, and decided on this one due to the fact that everyone said the barrel is smaller so it may be easier to use on my short hair. I am a novice when using styling tools, but found this one pretty easy to use. It did the job easily enough but I found that I used almost the same amount of time as just blow drying my hair straight. And my hair did get caught in the barrel once because I had the barrel rolling the wrong way. Once I figured out which way it needed to be rolling it worked fine and no more snags! I would recommend this one as a cheaper alternative that does a great job.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;m really happy with this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and and made my usually frizzy and fly-away hair nice and smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> Alas alack!  This thing needs a comb on the ends, not a set of brushes.  Perhaps it is just me, old ham hands.  But the dang thing doesn&#x27;t perform.</li>
            <li> Had this for two years and still works just a good as the day I got it, my mother in law used it and loved it too, so we got her the same one for Christmas!!</li>
            <li> This product is simply Amazing, I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to achieve the salon look at home because I recently cut my very curly thick hair in short layers and when I tried the combination of the blow dryer and hot curler it left me with very dry flat hair. But with this one pro styler by conair I am extremely happy my hair is straight shiney and has body, also it is very easy to operate. I would deffinately recommend this product to anyone who wants a simple way to straighten their hair without frying it.</li>
            <li> I have to say ..I was excited to get this but I didn&#x27;t realize how cheap it looked. The bristles on the brush are like plastic and the thin rotating part looks flimsy. Oh and if you do purchase , please make sure the iron is curling your hair the right direction. It made my hair frizzy at the roots. It straightened it once I got the hang of it but it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Infiniti Conair rotating hair product.  It arrived very quickly and I thought the price was very fair.  Similar products cost much more.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Did not work on thick hair, it would require very small portions of hair to be done at a time, and the small bristles did nothing to help guide the hair, and actually seem to tangle.</li>
            <li> My stylist used the InStyler to style my hair and had suggested that I purchase one, I have thick curly hair.  After doing some comparisons I decided on the Infiniti by Conair.  It was half the price as the Instyler and did the exact same thing.  So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results I get with the Infiniti.  This styler is great b/c it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair flat against your head like a traditional flat iron would, the brush attached prevents that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m STILL trying to figure out how to actually straighten curly hair with this thing, and still have a little bit of a bend to it...AND I&#x27;M A HAIRDRESSER!!!! This thing is more like a true straightner, so be prepared to really not have any life, or movement to your hair when your done....The tubular thing is enclosed, and does go in 2 different directions, but, big deal...It still makes the ends look flat and dull....You really have to overdirect it to get it to do anything....LOTS of work....But, I loved the price, so I&#x27;ll keep it!</li>
            <li> My hair is really think and wavy.  I left my Chi 3 hours away and decided to buy this at the grocery store.  For the price, ($50) I thought it would be a waste and would end up returning it.  Well, I&#x27;ll leave my Chi where it is and forget about it.  I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on thin/fine hair....but on my super thick hair, it does awesomely!  It doesn&#x27;t make it look stick straight, like someone mentioned before...it has body to it but still straight.  It works faster than the Chi too.  I just run it through once and don&#x27;t have to keep doing it like I would with the Chi.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> The ProStyler is amazing!!! I initially wanted to try out the InStyler when it went on sale for $65, but decided against it because of the price.  I saw the ProStyler in a CVS ad for $40 and went on Amazon to look at the reviews which were good enough for me to try it out.  I also had enough CVS ExtraBucks that I only paid $10 for it!!!!  I have thick, tightly curled hair that has to be completely wet before I can pull a comb or pick through it.     I didn&#x27;t think it would work, so I sectioned my hair, applied a shea butter cream on it,and twisted it into a few twists to make it easier.  I was thoroughly impressed. My hair glided easily through the straightener without any snags. Not even a straightening hot comb can do that!  I put it on level 10 (it goes to like 25 or 30).  My hair wasn&#x27;t bone straight, which isn&#x27;t what i wanted anyway.  It relaxed the curl pattern enough for me to be able to comb my hair with no pain and to braid it, which i couldn&#x27;t do before.    I definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Well, it broke today - stopped heating - I&#x27;ve owned it 6 weeks and have used it maybe 6 times  BECAUSE there are no directions included other than &amp;#34;Pull thru hair slowly for straight hair and quickly for body.&amp;#34;  Huh?  Why would pulling it thru quicklly give hair body?  No directions on say, how to know that the rotating barrel is rotating with the grain of your hair??  Geeze :(  I thru away the packaging and I guess I&#x27;m stuick with a dead product.  Maybe if I contact Conair?  Ugh.  Well, I missed the Amazon return deadline by a few days and contacted Conair.  After many phone calls and emails, I did receive a refund, but it took months.  Will never, ever purchase another Conair product.</li>
            <li> Es una buena plancha rotativa, de buena presentación y de buenos materiales, pero el barril rotatorio es pequeño, lo que hace que el trabajo de peinado sea mas lento que con la Instyler (cuyo barril es mucho mas grande), si el pelo es fácilmente peinable no hay problema, pero si tu cabello es rebelde piensalo 2 veces, ya que necesitaras mas tiempo en lograr resultados.</li>
            <li> Unlike the InStyler, the rotating ceramic roller is much smaller and doesn&#x27;t seem to assist in the hair styling, as does the roller on the InStyler. This is sturdy and it does have a temperature control. Overall, for the price, it is a good item.</li>
            <li> no need to buy, overpriced and rotation is unnecessary</li>
            <li> Great product! 2nd one I have bought.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the THICKEST wavy hair and a regular blow-out/flat iron took almost an hour. With NO blow-out, this took 14  minutes for her entire head and it was pin straight. Sooooooo worth the money!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the thing.  The price was as good as I could find anywhere.  My wife uses this item all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! This is my favorite!!  I am half African/American and Korean.  The Instyler was all right, but it seemed it was always blinking to show it was heating, my hair had a burned smell, the bristles would break my hair off..it was all right. But I was always on the search for the perfect styling tool.  The Infiniti is it! This Infiniti makes my hair Shiny!!!  And you can make curls if you position your hair the way would to make curls using a flat iron, I just remove the bristles to prevent breakage or it can bone straight but it has VOLUME!!!  I am buying another just in case they stop making this.  I am in love!!!</li>
            <li> This item says that is a straighten, curler and dryer all in one tool!  It does NOT curl hair in any way.  It straightens pretty well, but it leaves crimp marks in the hair.  I&#x27;m sure with practice one could avoid the crimp marks, but I sent it back after one use.  My daughter wanted to be able to straighten and use it to curl her hair, but it won&#x27;t curl.  Even the instructions are very detailed as to how to use the item to straighten your hair, but there is no mention whatsoever about how to curl the hair.  Again, not a bad product per se, just misleading.</li>
            <li> I purchase this rotating flat iron for the holiday&#x27;s. I live in a city were the humidity is terrible for trying to keep your hair straight. This flat iron heat up really well. I was not to impress with the removable brushes on the side. I do like the rotating barrel the located on the inside. Its does make your hair shiner and gives it more body. If you have short hair this is probably not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;Its a pretty large styling iron. But for someone with long or thick hair this would be a great styler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months and only used it about 3 times.  Yes, it does have the option of changing the spin from left to right, but with the barrel hidden inside you can never really tell which way works best for the directions you need.  If you do spin it the opposite that you want then you end up with tangle hair.  This has also fried my hair and broken off so many pieces because the hair is easily caught in between various nooks of the styler. I would not recommend, even if you do make it through your whole head without messing it up you do not get all the volume and straightness you would from the InStyler.  I&#x27;m so disappointed I had high hopes for this too.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be a cheaper solution for a more expensive product, the Instyler.  I got what I paid for.  A poor imitaion of a good product.  It made my hair frizzy and didn&#x27;t do, at all, what it claims to do.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and expected this product to straighten much better. It pulled my hair an made it very frizzy. This is a perfect product for people with wavy hair, but not the best for super curly hair. If you want your hair to be frizz free and super straight you should get a ceramic plate hair straightner, they work much better and are much faster too!</li>
            <li> She loves it and uses it constantly. She had an iron already but this one is superior in quality. Great!</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of my time and money!  There was absolutely no manual on how to use it and when I did it dried out my hair even more.  Not worth the money AT ALL</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and very long but this straightener worked perfect! My hair came out sleek and shiny. I love the rotating barrel!  My last conair straightener lasted 7 years so I was confident in the brand. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed w this purchase. I thought i was buying the &amp;#34;Instyler&amp;#34;. It takes me longer to straighten my hair. If i would have known it was a cheaper imitation...i would have never bought this!</li>
            <li> It has been 2 weeks and I cannot get it to work like the instruction. It does not rotate I turn the switch to left or right and it still does not rotate. At this point I convince I have a faulty item. I took it to someone who has an instuler and they cannot get it to work. I so not know what to so with it at this point</li>
            <li> Like most of you, I bought this as a cheap alternative to the \\&quot;InStyler\\&quot;. However, the design of this product is so bad, it cannot do any of the things the \\&quot;InStyler\\&quot; is promised to do. The only thing this product does (and it does this badly), is straighten your hair-- as long as your okay with dry ends and no body. The issue with this product is that, the roller is set deep into the frame of the device, with only about 20% of the roller visible. Also, it is encased in plastic on all sides, so you cannot possibly use the roller to curl because the casing is in the way. It is much like trying to use a curling iron if three sides were encased in plastic. Finally, although the roller has great, steady movement, and the brushes seem fine, your hair doesn&#x27;t look polished, it looks dry. Oh, and don&#x27;t bother trying to use this on you roots to create volume. You just end up with some very distinctive crimped lines in your hair that may require water and a blow dryer to get out. My final advice: there are many excellent and cheap imitations of the \\&quot;InStyler\\&quot;, but this is not one of them. Do your research, and make sure that the barrel is completely exposed, unless you like dry hair. . .</li>
            <li> Love it.  Took my naturally very curly hair to smooth and silky in MUCH less time than my usual blow dryer/flat iron combo.  Before and after pics posted.</li>
            <li> I purchased the In styler  about four years ago. I opted to pay the full price for it ( I think it was about 140.00) instead of doing monthly installments since that seems to be the worst part about purchasing from infomercials. I fell in love with this product. I have very thick very wavy hair and this got my hair straight but natural looking with out making it look fried or frizzy. Now to be honest I have to go over each section twice, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay. I only wish I had not given away my second free in styler as now mine is starting to die slowly. However, it lasted four years so I can&#x27;t complain about that. My advice it to get this product, just be careful as it gets very hot and if you use it wrong your hair will get damaged or will not get the desired results.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair and this works GREAT! I can wash my hair the night before allow my hair to air dry and straighten the following day with no issues. I do not need to use it while my haois wet or blow dry my hair in advance. I don&#x27;t need to add ANY products to my hair to help fight the frizz. I love this straightener.</li>
            <li> I am not the most accomplish person at using complicated styling products. I found it to be cumbersome and awkward to use. The product arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner. It is just not a good tool for me personally.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago despite some negative reviews. It works great and is still working well. Much better than a traditional straightener. The ability to change the direction of the roller is a huge plus</li>
            <li> I have always been curious about the InStyler, but I&#x27;ve seen the reviews so I was never going to buy it. When I saw that this was similar but got much better reviews and was cheaper, I had to try it out! I am quite happy with it! I have slightly mixed African-American hair with tight soft curls and this works like a charm. Normally, when I want to straighten my hair I have to blow-dry it using a comb attachment, and then I have to use a curling iron or flat iron to get it really smooth. This process takes a long time and I hate doing it. The Conair ProStyler pretty much does both of these processes at the same time! Now, my styling time is cut in half! It&#x27;s amazing! The only thing that doesn&#x27;t make this a perfect 5 star is that it doesn&#x27;t really straighten my roots so then I use the comb attachment on my blow dryer to take care of that. Other than that I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After just minutes of owning this product, I can say it works wonders on super thick course hair like mine. I washed my hair yesterday and even after using my temperature controlled hot comb and flat iron to lay this stuff out, my hair just wasn&#x27;t trying to straighten. It was puffy, my ends looked just too un-managed, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to tame this stuff. Even with my mother&#x27;s help, still nothing. the roots of my hair were the only things straight on my scalp. That was it! Even after wrapping it up, when I took it down today, my hair was just puffy and unmanageable. Being of ethnic origin, my hair just won&#x27;t act in the least bit right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after plugging this tool in and separating parts of my hair to test to see if this thing would even do wonders, let me tell you, it did! My ends look as if they were professionally done, my hair is straight and shiny, and when shaking my head, oh my god, I love the motion! :) If you want something to manage your hair, especially if it&#x27;s like mine, you need to buy this and do it today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to protect your hair from the heat of this product, buy Olive Oil heat protection serum and Olive Oil shine serum, along with Kerotin Oil. You can&#x27;t go wrong. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Having washed my hair yesterday, I didn&#x27;t blow dry it, but let my hair dry in the air while having a bit of moisture to it. When putting this little miracle to my hair with the proper protection, my hair became straight instantly within 25 minutes as opposed to the 1 1/2 hours it would have taken with my flat iron and temperature controlled hot comb with no results. This is a must have and take my word for it, you will NOT regret owning this tool for stubborn and hard to straighten hair. :) The tool isn&#x27;t heavy or clunky, but just right to get the job done. :)</li>
            <li> It does not have a big enough barrell as the Instyler does. It does not smooth out my hair, it is still so frizzy. I will I could return it.</li>
            <li> Saw one of my friends with one and wanted to try it. Found it on amazon very reasonably priced and am very happy with the decision. My manager even noticed my new hair look and complimented me. Makes your hair so soft straight and shiny! But make sure to use it properly or you will damage your hair by not having it on the correct heat level for your particular hair type.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this straightener! My hair is thick and slightly frizzy and this straightener makes my hair shiny and sleek! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had the instyler but after a year it simply quit working, would not heat up at all anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I decided against another because I found it noisy and didn&#x27;t really do a good job so thought I would try this Infiniti instead.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I have long, super thick, course wavy hair and this straightens it out so fast and it is shiny and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;No \\&quot;dents\\&quot; or frying of the ends.  I am really happy with this purchase, and it is quieter than the instyler.  My cat does not hiss at me when I use it...</li>
            <li> I got this because the InStyler was out of my price range. I should have just waited. While it heats well, it&#x27;s just way too hard to use. The rolling part is small and I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out which direction it&#x27;s supposed to spin. The bristles that should hold my hair straight during the straightening process aren&#x27;t really effective. It took 4 times as long to get my hair silky straight with this as opposed to a regular hair straightener, which negates any other reason one might have for using it.</li>
            <li> There is no cool cap on the end of this device, you have to learn to style your hair with ONE HAND. If you grab the end tip to guide it, you&#x27;re gonna burn yourself, guaranteed. Which ever moron decided that this didn&#x27;t need an endcap needs to use this thing every day... and see how it feels!  I am going to resell mine on Ebay..</li>
            <li> Efficient, near instantaneous results. My curly hair which is rather thick was near my pin straight after 2 passes through it. I was particularly pleased that my hair had no &#x27;artificial straightening marks&#x27;  that you would see using a small flat iron. Overall, it looked natural smooths and shiny for for the whole day I used it, and the next. I would definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li> Half the price of Instyler, quiter than instyler, straightens way better than instyler</li>
            <li> Too heavy and doesn&#x27;t straighten too well</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair, this styler did not smooth my hair and the curl was more of a crimped wave, waste of money. I&#x27;ve used the instyler in the past, will go back to it.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected. Too difficult to handle.t</li>
            <li> I love this, I have long curly hair, well frizzy when long. This flat iron has a rotating barrel that you can use or not if you chose. The temperate gets nice and ht with many settings. 5 gt really hot and I think it goes to 10. My only complaint is the on/off button would be better as a slide  switch. If accidentally shut it off a few times. Using the rotation barrel let me know when it was off. I&#x27;m used to it now and didn&#x27;t shut it off once today. I hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> I have thick, healthy hair. The barrel barely makes contact with my hair. Impossible to pull down smoothly, and my ends were only burned by this product. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Okay if you are even thinking about buying a overpriced Instyler do not buy it Im telling you now. This hair tool is what u need. It is way more affordable and does the exact same job. I live this tool, if you want volume or some shine to your hair use this. The only con about this tool is the noise when you use the barrell. It gets kind of annoying the first couple times you use it but after that youre use to it. Idk if the Instyler makes the same noise. But ladies save your money and buy this!</li>
            <li> This item is the worse ever. I ordered it I was locking for flat iron w/comb&lt;br /&gt;made my hair frizzy, not straight or smooth&lt;br /&gt;I just threw it in the garbage, I will not   recommend this item to any one, it is money waisted&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Levy</li>
            <li> This is more than the description. The noise is much quieter than a hair dryer. The easy &#x27;left&#x27; and &#x27;right&#x27; choice for the roller is awesome. Light weight and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this for Christmas. I read all the instructions and plugged it in and... It never really heated up. It got warm but I could still touch it without burning. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair and this straightener is amazing!  It pulls through her hair with ease and it cuts her hair do-ing time in half. I have straight hair and I love it for me as well.  Heats up fast, has a temp setting, and auto shut off!!</li>
            <li> Terrible product. You have to choose which direction for it to spin, but it is impossible to tell which way it is going when you&#x27;re trying to use it on your hair and if you didn&#x27;t happen to choose the right direction, it fries your hair. Doesn&#x27;t curl and left my hair frizzy. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> First let me say I bought this for my dog. He&#x27;s got very wavy hair and for shows he&#x27;s supposed to have flat, straight hair. This work well. I used it on him before his last show &amp; I had people compliment me on how great his coat looked, straight &amp; shiny. And it works so much quicker and without burning his hair like my other straight iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my own short hair to give it body &amp; I&#x27;m pleased with that too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too happy with it. At first I thought I was a curling iron like an instyler. But I was disappointed. Then every time I straighten my hair with it it make my hair looked fried.</li>
            <li> I almost went cross eyed using this thing. The temperature is hard to manage and it leaves my hair feeling very dry. Sorry I bought it, but worth a try as it had the brush feature.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for anyone w/ thick, course &amp; dry hair...I was skeptical at first, as I&#x27;ve tried so many others only to be dissapointed, but amazed at the outcome.  I&#x27;m latin and we tend to have very hard to manage hair, on top of that I color may hair which tends to dry/damage it; well this product did the trick and left my hair smooth, shiny, and managable.  Didn&#x27;t leave it just flat like other styling products, I already have body to my hair but this tamed it and put it in place with a natural wave. I&#x27;m just in love with this product &amp; cheaper than other ones out there!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY thick coarse hair and this product straightens it with absolutely no problem in just a few minutes, my hair usually takes about a hour and a half to straighten with a normal flat iron. this pro styler gives my hair a silky finish and does not leave my hair damaged and flat to my head as a normal flat iron would. i highly recommend this tool for people that have thick hair, or cannot get other tools like this to work.</li>
            <li> I have medium-length, curly, thick hair and I&#x27;ve used the InStyler before. It did not straighten very well and would take multiple tries. Compared to that I say this is much better. The bristles help straighten my hair and I only need to run it through sections while straightening twice at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing missing is that it doesn&#x27;t provide as much volume as I&#x27;d like, but that&#x27;s a small nitpick. It&#x27;s simple and effective, very easy to use, with much less risk of burning yourself compared to the InStyler as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can change the direction the barrel rotates, something the InStyler does not have. You can also pop out the barrel and clean it when necessary. Overall I give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s worth the price and works better than the InStyler, which is much more expensive, in some ways.</li>
            <li> This is very hard to use on yourself, and the combs just tangle your hair.  It took them out, but I still don&#x27;t feel this works very well.  I have thick and kind of kinky hair and I like to straighten it and then put in soft big waves with a big barrel curling iron.  I thought I would save time with this because it&#x27;s supposed to do both.  I&#x27;ll stick to the way I was doing it before.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair, this is better than using a flat iron, it replaces me having to use a round brush to dry and a flat iron afterwards if I want to go with straight or relaxed hair. I just blow dry my hair regular no round brush, then section it off once it is dry and start with the underneath hair and go for it. Would recommend to anyone who uses a flat iron!</li>
            <li> This things amazing. Cut my straightening time from an hour to 30 minutes. I actually prefer it over my chi which is saying a lot right there. Btw I have super thick curly hair and was definitely suprised with this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure how to feel about this product..i love that it leaves my hair smooth but sometimes i feel that my hair gets more damaged after using it. Still need to figure out about the right or left option..other than than I have thick curly hair and it worked and straightened it well. It does its job..it just feels as big as the first irons that came out.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local CVS today when it went on sale and just tried it. I&#x27;ve got wavy thick very coarse resistant hair, and to say the least I am not impressed. I find better results with the cheapy Andis flat iron. This does not have a clamp lock, or a safe way to lay it down in case you need to, while it&#x27;s hot. The manual says nothing about the roller&#x27;s Left Off or Right functions, so not exactly sure if that works or not. You are not able to tell, the roller only turns on when it&#x27;s clamped down. It gets nice and hot quickly, which is a plus, I had mine cranked cuz I know how my hair is, but as far as getting my hair straight or doing the flip, it wasn&#x27;t so hot. The iron is a bit big and heavy, a little harder to handle if you have some hand and wrist pain. Overall it may work fine on thinner/light weight hair.</li>
            <li> This product claimed to leave my hair shiney, it left it frizzy and dried out looking.  After using the setting listed for my hair, my hair left hot as fire even after a minute of running the straightner through.  My flat iron does a much better job.  returning it tomorrow.  Spend the extra $50 and get the instyler.</li>
            <li> A regular flat iron leaves my hair . . . well, flat, This is the best hair tool I have ever used but it took a bit to learn to use it well.  I have a lot of wavy, fine hair that is all one length, above my shoulders.  First, your hair needs to be almost dry, it is not a dryer.  Secondly, you need to learn about the direction of spin.  I put it on the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; setting when I go into my hair from the right, and the left setting if I go in from the left (if that makes any sense at all to you).  I loved the way this made my hair look so much that I bought a second one for travel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the quality and performance...at a fraction of the cost of the others.</li>
            <li> I bought This thinking it was the instyler, and I was, at first a little disappointed, but it turns out to be a pretty awesome straightener.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair straightener, they should all have rotation. I stocked up because every time I like something they stop making it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first product that doesn&#x27;t burn the s*** out of my hair!! Tip: use a heat protection spray (duhh)</li>
            <li> This was way to big and bulky and did not heat up as much as I thought. I recommend the instyler.</li>
            <li> This work so so well. I got it like a year ago and now it still working very well. I do recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t justify the price of the Instyler.  So I tried this.  Love it.  Has truly changed my morning attitude!  It took me maybe 3 days to figure out the best settings for my hair.  I don&#x27;t fight to straighten waves.  My hair is very thick.  This styles much better than a regular flat iron.  And it&#x27;s much quicker!  And my hair keeps the style all day!  I don&#x27;t know why...but it does.  I have used this for almost a year now.  Still love it &amp; use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Just not happy with it it was not what I expected I can&#x27;t get it to work like it says it does</li>
            <li> it worked on my moms all curl hair. My hair not so much, I have thick curly wavey frizzy hair, its a jungle</li>
            <li> This product is just ok.  I used to have the maxi-glide which is much better.  This products is cheap to the touch and it pulls too much voltage, I don&#x27;t know if anybody had a problem with that, but I only used it twice and the lights went off.  I better return it and save my money for a new maxi-glide.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s friend-Megan- has one of these.  and she tried it on my hair that is  CURLY,FRIZZY, 7 DRY!!!  After using this straightner my hair looks awesome and i have sooooo  many compliments!!!!  I LOVE IT!  ITS A MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> I purchased the instyler about a year ago, and just could not get the hang of it.  It has been collecting dust even though I paid over $100.00 for it.  I recently saw the Pro Styler by Conair on clearance and it looked like it was designed better.  I decided to give it a try.  I really like this way better than the Instyler. It is easier to hold and since the rotating barrel is not exposed you are less likely to burn yourself, which is what I hated most about the Instyler. Plus it does a nice job of straightening my hair and giving it volume.  Anyway so glad I purchased it and I have used it more times in 1 week than I used the Instyler the entire year I&#x27;ve had it.  At the regular price of $53.00 it is a better product, at $13.00 which is what I paid, it is a steal.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i was curious after seeing the infomercials for the Instyler and I was a loyal Chi user and still bought this....i have thick wavy coarse hair and this product not only straightens as good as a Chi it also adds some volume and flip to my hair...which my Chi doesn&#x27;t do.....i love this product.</li>
            <li> Styler given as gift.  Recipient had tried another and loved it so was delighted to have one of her own.  Recommended to style straight or slightly curly look.</li>
            <li> This hair pro styler straightens well, was hoping for more shine in my hair. Either it does not help the shine or I have not got the hang of using it right</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and the Infiniti helps to smooth my hair without making it look limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I really love this styler. I found it easy to use.  Like the way the brushes grip the hair. I have coarse, frizzy hair, and after using the styler, my hair is smooth with curl if and where I want it. I have had so many compliments, and was even asked if I had a Brazilian Blowout!  It&#x27;s a lot of product for a low cost. I haven&#x27;t tried the Instyler, which cost more than $100, but the ConAir Styler does the job for me. Very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a flat iron before, but I like the look.  The rotating part is pretty pointless as far as I can tell. It straightens well, but the rotating mechanism makes it heavy and clunky. I purchased the ProStyler from Target but will probably return and just get a regular, high-end flat-iron.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER OWNED A HAIR STRAIGHTENING PRODUCT JUST READ ABOUT THEM, I WAS GOING TO GET AN INSTYLER BUT I READ PEOPLE WERE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THEM AS FAR AS BURNING THERE HAIR TO FALLING APART IN A SHORT TIME.&lt;br /&gt;I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN VERY FOND OF CORNAIR PRODUCTS AND DECIDED TO GIVE THIS INFINITI PRO STYLER A SHOT, WELL GUESS WHAT, I LOVE IT IT WORKS WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS VARIUOS HEAT SETTINGS  PLUS YOU CAN REMOVE SIDE BRUSHES IF YOU LIKE.&lt;br /&gt;MADE VERY WELL, NICE LOOKING UNIT I&#x27;M SOLD.</li>
            <li> I have short curly hair and this did not work for me. I bought it because of the reviews on Amazon, so I was rather disappointed but in all fairness, it is hard to find the right styler. The old one I had for years and years stopped working, and it is no longer made. I am using the flat iron now and that does fairly well.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my daughter.  She has VERY VERY curly hair, so using regular irons actually make her hair look weird.  I saw this thing and read what it was supposed to do, so I thought I&#x27;d buy it for my wife to use it on my daughter.  It works like magic!  You just have to make sure you know what direction the cylinder is rotating in.  Don&#x27;t go against the hair&#x27;s grain.</li>
            <li> I have think African American hair. It is not course but springy curls then poof at the ends after I blow dry. This is an amazing product because it doesnt &amp;#34; mash&amp;#34; my new growth curls but truley does straighten my hair! And the rotating feature makes my hair glossy and smooth. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this styler!  So easy to use and straightens quickly.  Lasts for several days.  The more time you take to section your hair into smaller sections, the flatter and longer it lasts.  I have nothing bad to say about this styler.  Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> It didnt work for me so I returned the product.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try after reading some of the five star reviews. Well, I returned it. I will stick with my flat Iron.  I found the design of the product not very impressive.  The bristles I found would tug on my hair not help flatten. IMO this did not work for my some what wavey hair.</li>
            <li> i received this as a gift. not something i would have ever bought. it doesn&#x27;t straighten hair very well. leaves a wave at every time.  my hair is medium length with natural waves and can get frizzy at times. this product does nothing to help with either problems. i would have chosen a regular flat iron for myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter (15).  She has shoulder length hair.  Sadly I had to return because it smelled like it was going to start a fire while turning on and letting them warm up in preparation for first time use.  I ran through the house trying to see what was on fire (no joke).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so that was strike 1....strike 2 was when she wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the way it wasn&#x27;t flat-ironing or curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just be careful....</li>
            <li> Those of us with very very curly thick hair knows deep in our hearts that there is no product that is going to give us silky smooth straight hair (that looks natural). That being put out there and acknowledged, this product is still one of the best I have ever used, it was efficient and the finished results lasted a long time for me.  The size of the iron was no more difficult to manage than a 2 inch flat iron, but it moved thru my hair so much easier. The reviews, the price, the result have all equaled out for a positive experience for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased both this and the instyler and found both to be helpful in styling my coarse, fine, 1/2 relaxed, 1/2 natural 3-4ab hair.  I started with the Pantene keratin shampoo and conditioner and tressemee conditioner keratin smooth, then washed it all out and put the Pantene leave in keratin, as well as the tressemme keratin serum and Tressemme keratin heat protect keratin spray.  then dried my hair with a blow-drier and comb attachment.  When dry, I then sprayed on the RenPure Originals Brazilian 4 day straight leave in spray and then followed with the prostyler and the instyler. I used a lot of the RenPure spray, particularly on the new growth portion.  Since I just took my braids out and knew that I would have more resistant hair, I slept i  the shea butter, curl smoothie and wore my hair in a bun with that in there for a whole day before attempting this experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks like I have a keratin treatment.  Did not revert, even in yesterdays snow storm... I also sprayed it with 2 types of hair spray after.  All I can say is that for styling different parts of your head, particularly if you have different lengths and different hair textures you willl really prefer the prostyler.  I actually used both on different settings, and with all the keratin protective products, did not lose any hair.  So I recommend using some good protective products and go for it.  By the way, I bought the 3/4 inch prostyler, and the regular instyler.  I liked using less heat than a flat iron and not burning the hell out of my hair as this seemed much gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair was dry at the end of the day, but i just put some castor oil on ends the hair and roller set it, with magnetic rollers in pink, and took it out in the morning.  My hair was not soft, but not dehydrated but really straight.  I also had some nice volume because I am terrible at using hot appliances with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am all thumbs with hair styling, and dread going to the hairdresser.  Ihave such a sense of accomplishment using both tools and getting a great result.  Hope this helps!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember, i have some repetitive stress issues in my arms and hands, and found that both together relieved any tension from another appliance and enabled me to complete the job.  I no longer fear getting my hair braids out, knowing I can walk out of the house without fear.</li>
            <li> Love the product . Works great.</li>
            <li> This works great! I have long, super thick naturally curly hair and this does an excellent job of straightening it. I had to play with the heat settings a bit because I turned it up too high and my hair was so straight it was flat against my head! So a little experimentation is key. I would definitely recommend this to people and have already told several friends and family members about it. Great product.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to do what the box did - straighten and curl with one product.  The curl thing didn&#x27;t work at all... curling isn&#x27;t even mentioned in the instructions inside the box.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to hair straightener because i have a lot of hair and highlighted too. What i look for is something that wont break or burn my hair easily and something that straightens easily too. I can say i really like this tool and recommend to everyone. Leaves my hair straight, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> The iron is working as advertised!  :O)</li>
            <li> If you have a good grip and your arm does not tire easily, this is nice. I was able to straighten some hair but due to a weak wrist from a past injury, I could not hold this very long and my arm started to get a cramp. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very nice and seems to work well but I had to send mine back. I straighten my hair every other day and just need something lighter.</li>
            <li> Did not like this hair styling product, awkward to handle, made my hair feel very coarse and dry. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long slightly frizzy/curly hair and no matter if I had the roller on or off, my hair would still get caught up in something and torn out. It may just be user error however I don&#x27;t have the patience to try and figure it nor do I have the time since I normally straighten my hair for work. This thing I have to use very little hair at a time just to get it look slightly straight but it still frizzy.  Wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to the Prostyler because it cost one third of the price.  It works great.  It smooths and straightens my hair.  I have thick hair and live in a climate that is humid during the summer.  I can straighten my hair in about 15 minutes and it will stay (unless it&#x27;s humid) until the next washing.  If it is humid, I have to do again, but usually just the top layer.  You can also get a curl  by twisting the iron.</li>
            <li> Great for long hair not for short hair... item is really great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this about 2years ago &amp; it still works... love it, a must have.</li>
            <li> Easy! Effective! Lightweight non cumbersome! longlasting! I have done my research and waited patiently. I have extremely curly hair indeed holds a lot of humidity! With other heating applications even Maxiglide, my hair will be straight for a few hours. This product I straighten my hair for days even with itwrapped through my sleep. Thank God for you Conair! Now I don&#x27;t have to ever perm/relax my hair again! I can wear it naturally curly or straight!</li>
            <li> This is amazing to smooth out thick curly hair. I tried Instyler, this was easier and didn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> bought for my baby sister she loves it working good no problem......</li>
            <li> I got this because I have 2 little girls that are interracial and straightening their hair become a major chore. It can take 3 to 4 hours just to do one. I tried this out last night when I got it on the daughter that has the hardest hair to straighten. It only took me an hour to her hair and it looked so smooth and shiny, not burnt.  I recommend this if your hair is hard to straighten. It is so wonderful!!!!!!</li>
            <li> where do I begin? sooo heavy, big, huge in fact, I gave it away. Love Conair products but this was the exception</li>
            <li> This piece of machinery has worked wonders on my hair. I have tried many wet to dry straighteners but they feel like they are frying my hair. This gives it volume and doesn&#x27;t give that humid feeling. It&#x27;s also $50 cheaper than the instyler but works just the same. Great for the price!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all , when using at low temperature it did nothing to my hair when using on high temp. it laterally burned my hair . a good idea but not for me</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! It works great and I have very kinky curly hair. Everyone at work is amazed. My hair is soft and shiny and completely straight!</li>
            <li> I did my 9 year old&#x27;s hair last night.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best it has ever looked from using a ceramic Iron.&lt;br /&gt;I love the rotating part and especially the removable brushes on each end of the top side.</li>
            <li> This styler doesn&#x27;t work incredibly fast or with the possibility of curing one&#x27;s hair as one goes, as I thought it would, but it does work well.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product but can get heavy after awhile. I was disappointed that it did not straighten my permed hair like I thought it would. If i turned up the heat, it would just fry. Does a good job on my bangs though.</li>
            <li> Google cave woman hair and that is my hair type. Thick, frizzy, mid back length, and it takes serious amounts of product to make it look nice. This took my normal 1 hour hair straightening job and made it a 30 min breeze. I LOVE THIS THING! The only cons about this is that, it is a bit on the heavy side and it is hard to lay it down correctly but my hair looks AMAZING. I can&#x27;t gripe too much about something that seriously delivers! If your hair is like mine, buy this!</li>
            <li> A mi novia le gusto mucho. Funciona a la perfección y le ahorra bastante tiempo al arreglarse. Conair es una excelente marca.</li>
            <li> Great straightener!  Really needed on with tension combs and this was the only one I could find.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the best bumpers you could use for any type hair.Ive bought all kinds some even over 100 dollars that were supposed to be the best and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> The multi-directional barrel is nice, but it takes a minute to figure out how to use it.  It works ok, but I  don&#x27;t feel that it straightens as well as other flat irons I&#x27;ve used.  It is also a little heavy.</li>
            <li> for the price you expect to get something that works well not something that don&#x27;t do your hair that well.</li>
            <li> conair helps her in few minutes to have always a favourite hair styling!  she dont spend money and time any more</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this product. It stinks. Hard to work with and after spending HOURS trying ( also having my friends and coworkers try it ) still can&#x27;t do my hair with it. I will never buy again &amp; I plan on returning it. AWFUL.</li>
            <li> If you are buying this thinking it can curl and straighten (like I did) you will be disappointed.  Its a great straightener.  But it is not very useful as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, easy storage and transportable. Great for those quick makeup needs.  Need to keep away from my teenager! She&#x27;s a product taker!!  LOL!!!</li>
            <li> Most stores are closing the Conair Pro Styler at half the price which you can purchase it any where on the Web.</li>
            <li> My Instyler broke and I was looking for a replacement. This works great! Does an excellent job in straightening my hair quickly. Not any louder than the Instyler, and doesn&#x27;t take any longer. But, this cost much less, which is always terrific! Would absolutely recommend as a hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I bought the ProStyler first, obviously because it was $50 cheaper and I normally don&#x27;t drop $100 on a hair tool. I have VERY naturally curly hair and it is bra length with long layers and bangs. The ProStyler did a great job at straightening my hair, but BOARD straight, like a chi and with the casing, you cannot curl the ends, I don&#x27;t care WHAT the packaging says!!! So if you&#x27;re just wanting a good straightener, this will work great for you, however, I also noticed that if left my hair feeling and looking damaged at the ends instead of the \\&quot;polished\\&quot; healthy look like the InStyler. It also \\&quot;crimps\\&quot; the hair if you don&#x27;t get with it and move fast enough!! Overall, it&#x27;s not a horrible product and for some would be good if what you&#x27;re looking for an easy straightener to use maybe once or twice a week vs daily due to the damage done on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this ProStyler and bought the InStyler and love it SO much better because while it&#x27;s still hard for me to do curls, (I&#x27;ll likely just stick with my curling iron for this), I can straighten and curl the ends under or flip with ease AND my hair LOOKS and FEELS healthy and shiny after use, so I don&#x27;t worry about using daily if I choose to. For ME, the InStyler was worth the extra $50.</li>
            <li> Im trying to grow my hair. Now is the akward time when the hair are not long and not short. I wanted easy way to do flips that I have perfect length for. My hair are straight so I don&#x27;t need straightner, but I did wanted flips and volume.. Non of it can be done with this \\&quot;Pro styler\\&quot;. It makes my hair look dry and you can see the lines left by the plastic edges. Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I can return it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it is advertised to do.  I will pass it along to one of my sisters for their use, and also let others know how this product (does not) work.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times so I am still getting used to it, but its definitely the best straightener I have used so far. My hair is very thick and very curly.</li>
            <li> This is a total piece of s***.  Does not straighten my hair well and it damaged my strands.  I suggest that you should not settle for anything less on your hair iron and just buy the expensive high quality brand like Sedu.  Sedu is the best it does not ruin your hair but straighten it out like how Hair salon does but quite expensive.  my daughter owns one and she has been using it for 5 years... Very durable.  i plan to buy one from Amazon soon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you have thick coarse hair. If you have thin to medium consistance and not too long you&#x27;ll love this. My hair is too long and thick and this can&#x27;t handle the weight. But, I gave it to someone who loves it.</li>
            <li> She uses it a lot.  Straightens her hair most beautifully.  Seems easy to use but takes a little time for her hair so she only uses it on weekends.</li>
            <li> very good. really makes my very frizzy hair absolutely straight.</li>
            <li> I like the Instyler but mine is getting old so I got this thinking it might be a good replacement.  I&#x27;m returning it because it&#x27;s not nearly as nice, even for about half the price.  I don&#x27;t envision using it at all.  It just doesn&#x27;t straighten as well and without the round barrel you have no ability to add a little curl.  I used the two appliances together on my daughter&#x27;s long, wavy hair and there was no contest.  The one advantage the Conair version offers is it would be harder to burn yourself.  I like all my other Conair Infinity appliances but this one was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> My mom wanted a Styler like the one on tv, this one is much better because you can control where you want the drum go to and it twist itself when u close it</li>
            <li> Love. It.. I have thick, curly hair and this works amazing!!!! Love the motorized rotating barrel</li>
            <li> this takes the static out of your hair... when I first used it.. I thought wow... no more frizziness...love it</li>
            <li> Great Straightener!!! Do not have as much hair loss.....very easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Eliminates curling iron &amp; flat iron.  Less stress on your hair, good product for all hair types.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a good value for someone with fine or medium textured hair.  It will straighten and smooth as advertised.  For those with more texture, get the real In Styler.  There is much more barrel exposure to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever used that&#x27;s actually worked! I am an African American with extremely thick, curly hair and perms have never worked. As much as I love my hair, it&#x27;s been quite a challenge my entire life to tame. I would give this product 10 stars if I could. It not only makes my hair silky and bone straight, with beautiful texture, but it lasts! Even in the Texas Gulf Coast&#x27;s extremely humid environment, my hair still resists the frizz. I&#x27;ve been really tempted to purchase a second one in case I wear out my current iron. Manufacturers gave a habit of discontinuing some of the best products. lol</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and the CHI straightener, which all stylists swear by, gets too hot for my hair and makes it look like straw. This one is great because you can regulate the temperature and it has nice curve to so your hair doesn&#x27;t come out stick straight (which makes it look fake). This straightens your hair while giving it a bit of body and flow. I usually keep the temperature on 3 out of 10, so if you have really curly hair the 10 setting would probably work for you.&lt;br /&gt;I have one at home and one at the gym because it is awesome. I just wish it came with dual voltage so I could travel internationally with it:(</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old worn out instyler.  Disappointed.  Because the rotating barrel is encased in one of the outer plates, there&#x27;s not enough coverage.  Also brush bristles are useless.  I was excited that I would be able to reverse the rotation of the barrel - BUT because it IS ENCASED within the plate, and only rotates when the plates are closed, there&#x27;s no way to tell which way to change it.  Would like to return it.  It&#x27;s useless for me.  I&#x27;ve gone back to using my poor old damaged instyler until I can afford to fork out the big bucks for a new one.</li>
