            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Beyond the product the customer service with this company is beyond amazing.</li>
            <li>With that being said, this product is amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>I started wiping my makeup off with Thayer Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner and then applying this product</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great purchase!</li>
            <li>Moisturizes, but it&#x27;s not too greasy and my skin tone is nice and even.</li>
            <li>I was using another brand of rose hip oil from  the &#x27;NOW&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>When you buy this product you get tips on the best usage and if you have questions, they are very prompt in responding.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs so nicely into my skin.  </li>
            <li>It allows for the perfect amount, which isn&#x27;t much, to come out onto your hand.</li>
            <li>I use it around my eyes after my face wash routine and follow up with rose water toner and coconut oil as my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a kind of vegetal smell, but I like it), and absorbs really nicely.</li>
            <li>and wake with my face feeling rejuvenated and am thrilled.</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful orange-red color, smell is normal, not too strong and is in a glass amber bottle with an easy to use pump that gives out a perfect amount of oil.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for my very sensitive skin....</li>
            <li>I really love this oil for many reasons!</li>
            <li>I love, love this product!</li>
            <li>The packaging is lovely, the pump top makes it easy to use and the detailed instructions for the many uses of the product were GREAT!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest I choose This brand, Inflora, because of the lovely packaging.</li>
            <li>I began reading about the many benifits of Rose and looked at reviews and choose this one well once home and opened to me</li>
            <li>The bottle is very practical and their customer service is incredible.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming rose scent, which I like.</li>
            <li>all I&#x27;ve heard from them so far are good reviews!!</li>
            <li>Product came right away, and has been great.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I love using natural products and this feels great and moisturizes well!</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive and rosehip seed oil is the best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve found yet - even better than olive, and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my chest/collar bone area, where I&#x27;m developing fine lines, ahhh!</li>
            <li>I really loved this product I saw really good results I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am 26 years old and have very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I mix with my moisturizer and really love the feel.</li>
            <li>The bottle came in a zip-lock&lt;br /&gt;sandwich bag and most of the oil had leaked out into the bag.</li>
            <li>and all you are left with is your wonderful skin .</li>
            <li>Gives skin a healthy glow, although my skin has broke out some after using.</li>
            <li>it ha  never been better and i couldnt dream about a better anti wrinkle cream thats home made :)</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>is a pump bottle, and I might rather have a dropper for more control in distribution.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>They have proven to be a very reliable source and distributor of great products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin is smooth and glows in a way it hasn&#x27;t  for months!</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and it&#x27;s a versatile product.  </li>
            <li>It does everything - I love it.</li>
            <li>Really glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels now.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every night before I go to sleep and love the way my skin looks refreshed and hydrated in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Just love it...</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m able to bring it with me, by plane and in my carry-on.</li>
            <li>And, great customer service, which is much appreciated.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that its certified organic so that I know its not harming the earth.</li>
            <li>The best application is to pump a bit into your hands, warm it between your hands, and apply it by pressing into your wet skin.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, Inflora, thank you so much.</li>
            <li>line and noticed that the Inflora brand was better.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Now&#x27; brand was OK</li>
            <li>Also, I love the pump bottle that it came in.</li>
            <li>but Inflora is much better.</li>
            <li>I use the oil twice a day and my skin looks so much better</li>
            <li>This product is misleading/falsely advertised on many levels.  </li>
            <li>but I even think i&#x27;m growing more eyelashes</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m concerned that I&#x27;m going to break out even more.</li>
            <li>I immediately received communication ensuring I was pleased with their product.</li>
            <li>The Rosehip seed oil is top quality.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>Not a chemical to be seen:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not terribly convinced it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not Chilean, which is the most sought after rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying my rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li>Will surely buy again and</li>
            <li>I use it on top of a moisturizer...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i wish it had some more suggestions  and information on the package as to  </li>
            <li>(I think most of what did the drink was eating better and drinking loads of water.)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love this Product.</li>
            <li>Really lovely, has improved the texture of my skin</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels and am seeing improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this oil; my perfect daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my face but the most amazing improvement has been on my hands.</li>
            <li>It really is like love for my skin!!</li>
            <li>Fast service and very nice product t</li>
            <li>I liked that the packaging was environmentally friendly and that the product is organic.</li>
            <li>It dissipates quickly and my skin feels lovely!</li>
            <li>It is so easy to spend hundreds on these products because each brand claims they are the best and only &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love that it does not have a strong floral scent as I do not like to use anything too scented.</li>
            <li>It came quickly with a nice note from the company giving tips on how to use it.</li>
            <li>Great for that natural, healthy look.</li>
            <li>When applying this Rosehip Seed Oil, my skin softened immediately, providing a smooth and healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Good product, hydrates very well my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product, super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Most oils at this price point lack the rich scent and color this one has.</li>
            <li>First I love this pump!</li>
            <li>Hi All,  Even though my skin is in pretty good condition, it can always look better, right??</li>
            <li>great product, truly penetrates and leaves the skin smooth and soft, does not clog pores.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery too.  </li>
            <li>It is a much more economic way to get the benefit of vitamin A then some of the popular anti-aging products.</li>
            <li>the seller mentioned, there is a strong odor to it - earthy/fishy - but it dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too strong for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was very important for me to get an organic high quality rose hip oil,and this product is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great for facial uses and mixes nicely with essential oils and has a pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li>The fine lines that I have around mouth and eyes appear to be diminished somewhat.  </li>
            <li>Fine rosewater.  </li>
            <li>The oils have corrected my hyperpigmentation from sun exposure and plumped up the fine lines that had started to appear around my eyes.</li>
            <li>, I want to add that Inflora&#x27;s Lavender oil is like no other, very potent and pure, just lovely!!&lt;br /&gt;Adding a Special Merci to Lorna, who is Absolutely the Best &amp;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li>good stuff and all natural!</li>
            <li>Rose hip seed oil is one of my favorite oils and as a maker of natural skin care I have been using it in products for years.</li>
            <li>This oil feels light on your skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>It looked smooth after.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>As an acupuncturist, I test all kinds of ointments and products, and this one is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face looking smooth and youger.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say Inflora is a terrific customer orientated company who stands by their product.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a light oil to moisture my face at night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>An all round great skin care staple!</li>
            <li>started by using it on my chest and neck, and after about a week I got brave enough to try it on some eczema patches on my face.</li>
            <li>The results were great - no additional irritation and definite improvement to the eczema.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Pure Rose Hip Seed Oil is rich in bio available vitamin C and A\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what this is really capable of after longer use, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Will most certainly order again !</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, leaves your skin feeling smooth, and is a great product sold at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>I can see a significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>and I originally intended on using it on my face.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product the first time I used it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I received the warmest thank you along with more information on the oil I ordered, both very much appreciated!  </li>
            <li>(The rosehip fruit is a rich source of Vitamin C</li>
            <li>I used this product on him and he cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li>But this one was well worth it!</li>
            <li>Great product, gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>What I like about this plant based oil, is that it is absorbed easily into the skin, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely and my skin looks and feels really healthy and much younger than 47.  </li>
            <li>My arms are now super smooth</li>
            <li>(And I&#x27;ll buy the 4oz bottle next time to make it more cost effective.)</li>
            <li>I have read that many find the smell of even good and fresh rosehip oil strange</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy to have made a purchase with this company, and look forward to doing so again when I run out of the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about your product and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this product.</li>
            <li>The color of the oil is a beautiful hue of deep orange, I believe this to be a testament to its high quality and pureness.</li>
            <li>The odor was not a factor for me because it worked for what I bought it for, and the odor dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>As I continued on my journey to research more on the history and usefulness of essential oils, I couldn&#x27;t believe more people weren&#x27;t using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comparable to the Clarins product and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a great product and for also including a list of uses for the Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li>and this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>Received this oil quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>The oil is a marvelous balance of the very important essential omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids.</li>
            <li>Customer service is fantastic and really informative!</li>
            <li>FIrst - you need to know this does not smell like roses!  </li>
            <li>I probably would not use it right before a date, but it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has no artificial chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the better option.</li>
            <li>Not only are their representatives extremely kind and courteous, but they are also patient and accommodating regarding various questions and concerns.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY way I could recommend this product is if you planned on wearing a nose plug to bed (PS be kind also provide a nose plug for your partner)</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, laugh lines diminished.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy over the smell</li>
            <li>Love it makes my face feel really soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a truly a simple yet incredibly beneficial product for my daily moisturizing regime.</li>
            <li>it smelled something similar to caster oil rather than Rose oil.</li>
            <li>I researched ways to create my own moisturizer and came upon the idea of using Rosehip Oil mixed with a carrier oil, or it can be used alone.  </li>
            <li>and I added this to my nightly beauty regimen and my skin became hydrated and more revived and now my makeup glides back on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The smell is sort of strong, but in my opinion, worth it for the high quality organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be much more effective than plain vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle feels much more sanitary than typical dropper bottles, and not only are there no unnecessary fillers, but it smells better, the oil itself feels smooth and luxurious when applied, and it feels effective immediately.  </li>
            <li>Additionally the oil contains high amounts of natural vitamin C, an important nutrient for healthy skin and body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing actually.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to using RoseHip oil and so far am finding it nice to use after a shower.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and not too oily, it absorbs quick and leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>A little Rose Hip oil and my skin is refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am 42 years old and this week when I wanted to enjoy a glass of wine, I was asked for my ID for the first time in AGES!</li>
            <li>But after using it right from the first application my skin was calmer and looked nourished and hydrated .</li>
            <li>It also comes in handy when I visit the Rocky Mountains because my skin gets so dry there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping was super fast and it arrived packaged well&lt;</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin; this product has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>The pump really keeps it sanitary, fresh and helps get out just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and was told rose hip oil would help.</li>
            <li>I hesitantly used her samples over the course of two (2) months which I later learned to absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother in law for Mother&#x27;s Day, tried it, and then bought several more for myself and girlfriends.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I use it to not only wash my face but to also moisturize and my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY works!</li>
            <li>To my surprise they looked so much better the next day.  </li>
            <li>I instantly ordered some more and just got it today.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>Given the packaging of most face care oils I buy, this is a cut above.  </li>
            <li>After only three days of use, my skin feels noticeably softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I have used so many different oils and skincare products</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>I look forward to more products in the future.</li>
            <li>First, the bottle states \\&quot;100%</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This has really helped!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was interested in it for scars and sun damage.</li>
            <li>it feels light on my skin, smells natural</li>
            <li>At the rate I&#x27;m using this oil, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more soon.</li>
            <li>Rosehip seed oil is a staple for simple extraordinary skin health and makes my face feel supple, calm, and sweetly nourished.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone because I have oily and dry areas type of skin and it works great on my entire face even over my eyelids</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any one looking for a light daily facial moisturizer that wants it to be easy and light!</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and this is hands down the best!!!!</li>
            <li>was glad to find an organic oil and appreciate Inflora for offering such pure quality.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, but don&#x27;t expect the smell of roses, this oil comes from the seeds of a different type of rose anyways; if you wear makeup you can totally wear it after applying the oil.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t yet had much opportunity to see visual changes to the sun damage on my chest, but regardless of what happens with that, I am an extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have healthy, clear,  slightly dry, mature (over 60:)</li>
            <li>There is an odor when you first spray it, but the odor dissipates very soon.  </li>
            <li>As a real healthy skin fanatic, I have tried about every &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; skincare product on the market</li>
            <li>One of the top reasons I have written so much and so strongly support Infloria is because I feel that certain large companies have completely tried to tarnish any other brand, and that just isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>It feels like my skin is drinking this wonderfully pure, organic healing oil.  </li>
            <li>I am using it to heal a large scar on my face and I can see the difference after a couple of weeks of applying it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Definitely coming back for more after I&#x27;m done using this bottle!</li>
            <li>Very high quality oil.  </li>
            <li>After finding something to counteract my acne issues, I really wanted something pure to use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not completely sure that this is even rose oil or some other oil begin passed off as rose oil.</li>
            <li>The oil is very high quality, the real deal.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about this product is that is doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li>The results is that this oil has really speeded up the healing process and left my skin silky smooth, Awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>thanks to all for your comments, Take Care Ladies,  Namaste,  Zoe</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really speak on its effectiveness with me.</li>
            <li>, I have kept it away from my chin because it is very acne prone.</li>
            <li>seller was very informative of the product; much appreciated.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated how helpful the folks at Inflora were helping me.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil because I read that it really helps with razor burn-</li>
            <li>It absorbs really fast, too.</li>
            <li>I tried so many things before this, for years, that never really took the sting away.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>It really works on stretch marks too....</li>
            <li>Can already tell a difference - much softer.  </li>
            <li>but as the week went on I didn&#x27;t notice it as much.  </li>
            <li>I have used argan oil for my oily/acneic skin before, but I&#x27;m really responding to the rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>My face is definitely very moisturized when I use it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore Inflora&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li>but this one really delivers.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;Wonderful , caring and fast</li>
            <li>So very soothing, healing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil</li>
            <li>It came fast and works well.</li>
            <li>I will probably return it, because the smell really bothers me.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It does not smell like roses, but it&#x27;s a very benign smell that isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>vendor is very customer focused and ships fast.</li>
            <li>and I noticed this really helps.</li>
            <li>but it dispenses too much oil way too forcefully.</li>
            <li>It has a nutty kind of smell which goes away after few minutes</li>
            <li>It definitely works, just be prepared to mix it with some essential oils or something nice smelling.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and I love the hint of rose scent it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already made its way as a gift to some Florida relatives and we imagine we&#x27;ll buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve only had Inflora&#x27;s rosehip oil a few weeks, but after a summer in intense sun and heat, we&#x27;re already feeling its amazing reparative and moisturizing effects!  </li>
            <li>And the quality of the product itself is better than the other ones I have</li>
            <li>I usually let it sink in for a couple of minutes and follow with a spritz of rose water, - the result is absolutely silky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These essential plant compounds are absorbed easily and deeply into the skin moisturizing and healing as they support the skin tissues.</li>
            <li>Even after several days of not using it, that skin still feels way softer than before, so maybe I&#x27;ll do this weekly or for special occasions.</li>
            <li>There are many reasons why a person might want to get rosehip oil, it can be great for dry, dull hair and dandruff, dry skin, Scars (because it can quicken the healing process), sun burns, age spots, brittle nails and many other reason.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is true I am a visual Junkie!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not what I was expecting, but the feel is normal and it is really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have mainly used this product for my eczema</li>
            <li>It is a light oil which seeps right into the skin after a little massage .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product and buying from this vendor.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>As a professional esthetician I did my research, but I think I like other brands better.</li>
            <li>I always use natural skin care this oil does more for your skin than any other product.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>and WOW is all I can say!!</li>
            <li>look despite how much concealer and powder I have to use to disguise old acne scars.</li>
            <li>Multiple uses for this oil, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Smell is not ideal, but nice results!</li>
            <li>Start out a few drops, add a couple more if needed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a magical eye moisturizer, and much more affordable than the many expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>But I saw so many who recommended this, even for those with heavily oily skin, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>For a few minutes or so, it does feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>Inflora Botanica’s Rosehip seed oil’s pump bottle is especially valuable as it delivers just the right amount of oil and keeps the contents fresh as it is not constantly opened and exposed to the air.</li>
            <li>Sure makes my face feel soft and am hoping after a while I will see less wrinkles with my oil combo.  </li>
            <li>Once you try it you cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>skin has a new glow</li>
            <li>I use a few drops directly on my face twice a day and my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>I am loving Inflora Botanica&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Oil as an everyday face moisturizer, mixed with a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully natural product sold by a company with high standards.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my face, and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin has become supple and very soft.</li>
            <li>Because of this, and because I&#x27;ve wasted hundreds of dollars on things that I end up giving away after one or two tries, I rarely try new body care products any more.</li>
            <li>A co-worker first introduced me to the world of essential oils.</li>
            <li>At first I tried it as an overall face moisturizer, but my skin is too oily as is, so</li>
            <li>and i love the small bottle.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this brand as well, the oil is a higher quality.</li>
            <li>and I became aware of it only after I bought the oil.</li>
            <li>My three year old daughter has been snuggling up to me as  saying, &amp;#34;Mama, you are sooooo silky.&amp;#34;  My husband has also been using it and loves it!</li>
            <li>Without makeup, I have an odd chronic redness that looks bizarre on my yellow-undertoned olive skin, but the application of this oil visibly soothes it.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and already my sensitive, dry, and sunburned skin looks and feels hydrated, even, and glowing!  </li>
            <li>Although, as many others have stated, the scent is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li>so I do a lot of research on quality and the various benefits of buying from certain companies.</li>
            <li>Even my fine lines and wrinkles look less noticeable!  </li>
            <li>I like it so far , skin feels soft .</li>
            <li>Leavese my skin feeling soft and mosturized.</li>
            <li>As the old adage goes....the proof is in the pudding.</li>
            <li>My face seems to be adapting well so far</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>its all natural I like it and don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine gave me this rosehip seed oil to try for my sensitive rosacea skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, inexpensive and really works.</li>
            <li>It made my face feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I am 53 and want all natural organic anti aging.</li>
            <li>They say you can mix with a carrier oil, but I apply directly.</li>
            <li>skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 17 years old step daughter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, yet light and not to heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>And... it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>extremely* sensitive skin as well as allergic reactions to fragrances (including a lot of botanicals that are used in supposedly fragrance-free products from the health food store).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten unsolicited comments on how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>I feel that my pores are prone to clogging and my sensitive skin can get a bit red and bothered, so I was a little nervous about using the oil - that said, i have found that my face is super clear and the redness is calmed.</li>
            <li>But as I used the oils over the last three months now, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Not only did I not react badly to it, but it has made my skin incredibly soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently its really been helping with her face and some of the minor scars and blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when it came right down to it… stinky fish face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product little more than month and half, I can&#x27;t not see any improvement yet...</li>
            <li>It also makes a great moisturizing base before cosmetic application, and helps me achieve a natural, &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I even think an old surgical scar above my lip is starting to heal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using rosehip seed oils in general for about 6 years in place of regular anti-aging products.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne, large pores, black heads, and combination skin up until about a year ago.</li>
            <li>I use it every day on my face and also used it successfully for scar prevention on a bad frying pan burn recently.</li>
            <li>Also, there is no added fragrance, but the oil itself does have a subtle smell to it, which I&#x27;d describe more as a food-smell (like some other oils) rather than a perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li>I should have taken &#x27;before&#x27; pictures!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for several weeks, from the dry Midwest to the balmy Florida Keys.&lt;br /&gt;There was an immediate change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Within a week of starting my dry, sun damaged skin feels so soft, nourished and moist.</li>
            <li>I have consistently dry skin and have always had trouble finding the right night regimen to provide some hydration and healing overnight.</li>

            <li> I started wiping my makeup off with Thayer Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner and then applying this product</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes, but it&#x27;s not too greasy and my skin tone is nice and even.</li>
            <li> I was using another brand of rose hip oil from  the &#x27;NOW&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> When you buy this product you get tips on the best usage and if you have questions, they are very prompt in responding.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs so nicely into my skin.  </li>
            <li> It allows for the perfect amount, which isn&#x27;t much, to come out onto your hand.</li>
            <li> I use it around my eyes after my face wash routine and follow up with rose water toner and coconut oil as my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a kind of vegetal smell, but I like it), and absorbs really nicely.</li>
            <li> and wake with my face feeling rejuvenated and am thrilled.</li>
            <li> It has a beautiful orange-red color, smell is normal, not too strong and is in a glass amber bottle with an easy to use pump that gives out a perfect amount of oil.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for my very sensitive skin....</li>
            <li> I really love this oil for many reasons!</li>
            <li> I love, love this product!</li>
            <li> The packaging is lovely, the pump top makes it easy to use and the detailed instructions for the many uses of the product were GREAT!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest I choose This brand, Inflora, because of the lovely packaging.</li>
            <li> I began reading about the many benifits of Rose and looked at reviews and choose this one well once home and opened to me</li>
            <li> The bottle is very practical and their customer service is incredible.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming rose scent, which I like.</li>
            <li> all I&#x27;ve heard from them so far are good reviews!!</li>
            <li> Product came right away, and has been great.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I love using natural products and this feels great and moisturizes well!</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and rosehip seed oil is the best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve found yet - even better than olive, and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my chest/collar bone area, where I&#x27;m developing fine lines, ahhh!</li>
            <li> I really loved this product I saw really good results I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old and have very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I mix with my moisturizer and really love the feel.</li>
            <li> The bottle came in a zip-lock&lt;br /&gt;sandwich bag and most of the oil had leaked out into the bag.</li>
            <li> and all you are left with is your wonderful skin .</li>
            <li> Gives skin a healthy glow, although my skin has broke out some after using.</li>
            <li> it ha  never been better and i couldnt dream about a better anti wrinkle cream thats home made :)</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> is a pump bottle, and I might rather have a dropper for more control in distribution.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> They have proven to be a very reliable source and distributor of great products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin is smooth and glows in a way it hasn&#x27;t  for months!</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and it&#x27;s a versatile product.  </li>
            <li> It does everything - I love it.</li>
            <li> Really glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels now.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every night before I go to sleep and love the way my skin looks refreshed and hydrated in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Just love it...</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m able to bring it with me, by plane and in my carry-on.</li>
            <li> And, great customer service, which is much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that its certified organic so that I know its not harming the earth.</li>
            <li> The best application is to pump a bit into your hands, warm it between your hands, and apply it by pressing into your wet skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, Inflora, thank you so much.</li>
            <li> line and noticed that the Inflora brand was better.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Now&#x27; brand was OK</li>
            <li> Also, I love the pump bottle that it came in.</li>
            <li> but Inflora is much better.</li>
            <li> I use the oil twice a day and my skin looks so much better</li>
            <li> This product is misleading/falsely advertised on many levels.  </li>
            <li> but I even think i&#x27;m growing more eyelashes</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m concerned that I&#x27;m going to break out even more.</li>
            <li> I immediately received communication ensuring I was pleased with their product.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip seed oil is top quality.</li>
            <li> I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Not a chemical to be seen:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not terribly convinced it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Chilean, which is the most sought after rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li> Will surely buy again and</li>
            <li> I use it on top of a moisturizer...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wish it had some more suggestions  and information on the package as to  </li>

            <li> Fast service and very nice product t</li>
            <li> I liked that the packaging was environmentally friendly and that the product is organic.</li>
            <li> It dissipates quickly and my skin feels lovely!</li>
            <li> It is so easy to spend hundreds on these products because each brand claims they are the best and only &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love that it does not have a strong floral scent as I do not like to use anything too scented.</li>
            <li> It came quickly with a nice note from the company giving tips on how to use it.</li>

            <li> Great product, super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Most oils at this price point lack the rich scent and color this one has.</li>
            <li> First I love this pump!</li>
            <li> Hi All,  Even though my skin is in pretty good condition, it can always look better, right??</li>
            <li> great product, truly penetrates and leaves the skin smooth and soft, does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery too.  </li>
            <li> It is a much more economic way to get the benefit of vitamin A then some of the popular anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> the seller mentioned, there is a strong odor to it - earthy/fishy - but it dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too strong for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was very important for me to get an organic high quality rose hip oil,and this product is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great for facial uses and mixes nicely with essential oils and has a pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li> The fine lines that I have around mouth and eyes appear to be diminished somewhat.  </li>
            <li> Fine rosewater.  </li>
            <li> The oils have corrected my hyperpigmentation from sun exposure and plumped up the fine lines that had started to appear around my eyes.</li>
            <li> , I want to add that Inflora&#x27;s Lavender oil is like no other, very potent and pure, just lovely!!&lt;br /&gt;Adding a Special Merci to Lorna, who is Absolutely the Best &amp;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> good stuff and all natural!</li>
            <li> Rose hip seed oil is one of my favorite oils and as a maker of natural skin care I have been using it in products for years.</li>
            <li> This oil feels light on your skin.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> It looked smooth after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> As an acupuncturist, I test all kinds of ointments and products, and this one is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face looking smooth and youger.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say Inflora is a terrific customer orientated company who stands by their product.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light oil to moisture my face at night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> An all round great skin care staple!</li>
            <li> started by using it on my chest and neck, and after about a week I got brave enough to try it on some eczema patches on my face.</li>
            <li> The results were great - no additional irritation and definite improvement to the eczema.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> Pure Rose Hip Seed Oil is rich in bio available vitamin C and A\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what this is really capable of after longer use, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Will most certainly order again !</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly, leaves your skin feeling smooth, and is a great product sold at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> I can see a significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> and I originally intended on using it on my face.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product the first time I used it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I received the warmest thank you along with more information on the oil I ordered, both very much appreciated!  </li>
            <li> (The rosehip fruit is a rich source of Vitamin C</li>
            <li> I used this product on him and he cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li> But this one was well worth it!</li>
            <li> Great product, gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> What I like about this plant based oil, is that it is absorbed easily into the skin, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely and my skin looks and feels really healthy and much younger than 47.  </li>
            <li> My arms are now super smooth</li>
            <li> (And I&#x27;ll buy the 4oz bottle next time to make it more cost effective.)</li>
            <li> I have read that many find the smell of even good and fresh rosehip oil strange</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy to have made a purchase with this company, and look forward to doing so again when I run out of the first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about your product and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this product.</li>
            <li> The color of the oil is a beautiful hue of deep orange, I believe this to be a testament to its high quality and pureness.</li>
            <li> The odor was not a factor for me because it worked for what I bought it for, and the odor dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li> As I continued on my journey to research more on the history and usefulness of essential oils, I couldn&#x27;t believe more people weren&#x27;t using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comparable to the Clarins product and at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a great product and for also including a list of uses for the Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> and this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> Received this oil quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> The oil is a marvelous balance of the very important essential omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids.</li>
            <li> Customer service is fantastic and really informative!</li>
            <li> FIrst - you need to know this does not smell like roses!  </li>
            <li> I probably would not use it right before a date, but it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has no artificial chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> and this is by far the better option.</li>
            <li> Not only are their representatives extremely kind and courteous, but they are also patient and accommodating regarding various questions and concerns.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY way I could recommend this product is if you planned on wearing a nose plug to bed (PS be kind also provide a nose plug for your partner)</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, laugh lines diminished.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy over the smell</li>
            <li> Love it makes my face feel really soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a truly a simple yet incredibly beneficial product for my daily moisturizing regime.</li>
            <li> it smelled something similar to caster oil rather than Rose oil.</li>
            <li> I researched ways to create my own moisturizer and came upon the idea of using Rosehip Oil mixed with a carrier oil, or it can be used alone.  </li>
            <li> and I added this to my nightly beauty regimen and my skin became hydrated and more revived and now my makeup glides back on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The smell is sort of strong, but in my opinion, worth it for the high quality organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be much more effective than plain vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle feels much more sanitary than typical dropper bottles, and not only are there no unnecessary fillers, but it smells better, the oil itself feels smooth and luxurious when applied, and it feels effective immediately.  </li>
            <li> Additionally the oil contains high amounts of natural vitamin C, an important nutrient for healthy skin and body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing actually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to using RoseHip oil and so far am finding it nice to use after a shower.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and not too oily, it absorbs quick and leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> A little Rose Hip oil and my skin is refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and this week when I wanted to enjoy a glass of wine, I was asked for my ID for the first time in AGES!</li>
            <li> But after using it right from the first application my skin was calmer and looked nourished and hydrated .</li>
            <li> It also comes in handy when I visit the Rocky Mountains because my skin gets so dry there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;shipping was super fast and it arrived packaged well&lt;</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin; this product has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> The pump really keeps it sanitary, fresh and helps get out just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was told rose hip oil would help.</li>
            <li> I hesitantly used her samples over the course of two (2) months which I later learned to absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother in law for Mother&#x27;s Day, tried it, and then bought several more for myself and girlfriends.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I use it to not only wash my face but to also moisturize and my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works!</li>
            <li> To my surprise they looked so much better the next day.  </li>
            <li> I instantly ordered some more and just got it today.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> Given the packaging of most face care oils I buy, this is a cut above.  </li>
            <li> After only three days of use, my skin feels noticeably softer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> and I have used so many different oils and skincare products</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> I look forward to more products in the future.</li>
            <li> First, the bottle states \\&quot;100%</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This has really helped!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was interested in it for scars and sun damage.</li>
            <li> it feels light on my skin, smells natural</li>
            <li> At the rate I&#x27;m using this oil, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more soon.</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is a staple for simple extraordinary skin health and makes my face feel supple, calm, and sweetly nourished.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone because I have oily and dry areas type of skin and it works great on my entire face even over my eyelids</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any one looking for a light daily facial moisturizer that wants it to be easy and light!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and this is hands down the best!!!!</li>
            <li> was glad to find an organic oil and appreciate Inflora for offering such pure quality.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, but don&#x27;t expect the smell of roses, this oil comes from the seeds of a different type of rose anyways; if you wear makeup you can totally wear it after applying the oil.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t yet had much opportunity to see visual changes to the sun damage on my chest, but regardless of what happens with that, I am an extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have healthy, clear,  slightly dry, mature (over 60:)</li>
            <li> There is an odor when you first spray it, but the odor dissipates very soon.  </li>
            <li> As a real healthy skin fanatic, I have tried about every &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; skincare product on the market</li>
            <li> One of the top reasons I have written so much and so strongly support Infloria is because I feel that certain large companies have completely tried to tarnish any other brand, and that just isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> It feels like my skin is drinking this wonderfully pure, organic healing oil.  </li>
            <li> I am using it to heal a large scar on my face and I can see the difference after a couple of weeks of applying it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Definitely coming back for more after I&#x27;m done using this bottle!</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil.  </li>
            <li> After finding something to counteract my acne issues, I really wanted something pure to use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not completely sure that this is even rose oil or some other oil begin passed off as rose oil.</li>
            <li> The oil is very high quality, the real deal.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that is doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li> The results is that this oil has really speeded up the healing process and left my skin silky smooth, Awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> thanks to all for your comments, Take Care Ladies,  Namaste,  Zoe</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really speak on its effectiveness with me.</li>
            <li> , I have kept it away from my chin because it is very acne prone.</li>
            <li> seller was very informative of the product; much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated how helpful the folks at Inflora were helping me.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because I read that it really helps with razor burn-</li>
            <li> It absorbs really fast, too.</li>
            <li> I tried so many things before this, for years, that never really took the sting away.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> It really works on stretch marks too....</li>
            <li> Can already tell a difference - much softer.  </li>
            <li> but as the week went on I didn&#x27;t notice it as much.  </li>
            <li> I have used argan oil for my oily/acneic skin before, but I&#x27;m really responding to the rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> My face is definitely very moisturized when I use it in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore Inflora&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> but this one really delivers.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;Wonderful , caring and fast</li>
            <li> So very soothing, healing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil</li>
            <li> It came fast and works well.</li>
            <li> I will probably return it, because the smell really bothers me.</li>
            <li> and I am ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It does not smell like roses, but it&#x27;s a very benign smell that isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> vendor is very customer focused and ships fast.</li>
            <li> and I noticed this really helps.</li>
            <li> but it dispenses too much oil way too forcefully.</li>
            <li> It has a nutty kind of smell which goes away after few minutes</li>
            <li> It definitely works, just be prepared to mix it with some essential oils or something nice smelling.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and I love the hint of rose scent it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already made its way as a gift to some Florida relatives and we imagine we&#x27;ll buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had Inflora&#x27;s rosehip oil a few weeks, but after a summer in intense sun and heat, we&#x27;re already feeling its amazing reparative and moisturizing effects!  </li>
            <li> And the quality of the product itself is better than the other ones I have</li>
            <li> I usually let it sink in for a couple of minutes and follow with a spritz of rose water, - the result is absolutely silky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These essential plant compounds are absorbed easily and deeply into the skin moisturizing and healing as they support the skin tissues.</li>
            <li> Even after several days of not using it, that skin still feels way softer than before, so maybe I&#x27;ll do this weekly or for special occasions.</li>
            <li> There are many reasons why a person might want to get rosehip oil, it can be great for dry, dull hair and dandruff, dry skin, Scars (because it can quicken the healing process), sun burns, age spots, brittle nails and many other reason.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is true I am a visual Junkie!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I was expecting, but the feel is normal and it is really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have mainly used this product for my eczema</li>
            <li> It is a light oil which seeps right into the skin after a little massage .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product and buying from this vendor.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> As a professional esthetician I did my research, but I think I like other brands better.</li>
            <li> I always use natural skin care this oil does more for your skin than any other product.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> and WOW is all I can say!!</li>
            <li> look despite how much concealer and powder I have to use to disguise old acne scars.</li>
            <li> Multiple uses for this oil, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Smell is not ideal, but nice results!</li>
            <li> Start out a few drops, add a couple more if needed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a magical eye moisturizer, and much more affordable than the many expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> But I saw so many who recommended this, even for those with heavily oily skin, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> For a few minutes or so, it does feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> Inflora Botanica’s Rosehip seed oil’s pump bottle is especially valuable as it delivers just the right amount of oil and keeps the contents fresh as it is not constantly opened and exposed to the air.</li>
            <li> Sure makes my face feel soft and am hoping after a while I will see less wrinkles with my oil combo.  </li>
            <li> Once you try it you cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> skin has a new glow</li>
            <li> I use a few drops directly on my face twice a day and my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> I am loving Inflora Botanica&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Oil as an everyday face moisturizer, mixed with a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li> Wonderfully natural product sold by a company with high standards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my face, and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin has become supple and very soft.</li>
            <li> Because of this, and because I&#x27;ve wasted hundreds of dollars on things that I end up giving away after one or two tries, I rarely try new body care products any more.</li>
            <li> A co-worker first introduced me to the world of essential oils.</li>
            <li> At first I tried it as an overall face moisturizer, but my skin is too oily as is, so</li>
            <li> and i love the small bottle.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this brand as well, the oil is a higher quality.</li>
            <li> and I became aware of it only after I bought the oil.</li>
            <li> My three year old daughter has been snuggling up to me as  saying, &amp;#34;Mama, you are sooooo silky.&amp;#34;  My husband has also been using it and loves it!</li>
            <li> Without makeup, I have an odd chronic redness that looks bizarre on my yellow-undertoned olive skin, but the application of this oil visibly soothes it.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and already my sensitive, dry, and sunburned skin looks and feels hydrated, even, and glowing!  </li>
            <li> Although, as many others have stated, the scent is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> so I do a lot of research on quality and the various benefits of buying from certain companies.</li>
            <li> Even my fine lines and wrinkles look less noticeable!  </li>
            <li> I like it so far , skin feels soft .</li>
            <li> Leavese my skin feeling soft and mosturized.</li>
            <li> As the old adage goes....the proof is in the pudding.</li>
            <li> My face seems to be adapting well so far</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> its all natural I like it and don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me this rosehip seed oil to try for my sensitive rosacea skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, inexpensive and really works.</li>
            <li> It made my face feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I am 53 and want all natural organic anti aging.</li>
            <li> They say you can mix with a carrier oil, but I apply directly.</li>
            <li> skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 years old step daughter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, yet light and not to heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> And... it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> extremely* sensitive skin as well as allergic reactions to fragrances (including a lot of botanicals that are used in supposedly fragrance-free products from the health food store).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten unsolicited comments on how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> I feel that my pores are prone to clogging and my sensitive skin can get a bit red and bothered, so I was a little nervous about using the oil - that said, i have found that my face is super clear and the redness is calmed.</li>
            <li> But as I used the oils over the last three months now, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not react badly to it, but it has made my skin incredibly soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently its really been helping with her face and some of the minor scars and blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when it came right down to it… stinky fish face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product little more than month and half, I can&#x27;t not see any improvement yet...</li>
            <li> It also makes a great moisturizing base before cosmetic application, and helps me achieve a natural, &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I even think an old surgical scar above my lip is starting to heal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosehip seed oils in general for about 6 years in place of regular anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne, large pores, black heads, and combination skin up until about a year ago.</li>
            <li> I use it every day on my face and also used it successfully for scar prevention on a bad frying pan burn recently.</li>
            <li> Also, there is no added fragrance, but the oil itself does have a subtle smell to it, which I&#x27;d describe more as a food-smell (like some other oils) rather than a perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li> I should have taken &#x27;before&#x27; pictures!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for several weeks, from the dry Midwest to the balmy Florida Keys.&lt;br /&gt;There was an immediate change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Within a week of starting my dry, sun damaged skin feels so soft, nourished and moist.</li>
            <li> I have consistently dry skin and have always had trouble finding the right night regimen to provide some hydration and healing overnight.</li>
            <li> what i can say is that I live in an incredibly dry rough environment on the skin</li>
            <li> , I have been applying it over my entire face and in particular in a few creases that I have been working on with Reviva 10% Glycolic Acid cream.</li>
            <li> To see real results, I believe you have to be consistent and use it everyday for at least a month.</li>
            <li> It has made my face feel nourished,and has helped the small amount of redness I was having due to a mild rosacea issue.</li>
            <li> It smells natural, not &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34; but faintly and sweetly earthy.</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily mixed with a few drops of Young Living essential Oil ..</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough since I&#x27;ve used this oil</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to get rid of my scar, but I like the product.</li>
            <li> a big difference int he long run</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to vouch for some of its claims-</li>
            <li> Buy only if you want to smell like a &amp;#34;fish-face&amp;#34; I tried diluting with my moisturizer, and with a few drops of other highly scented essential oils.</li>
            <li> It even helped some dry spots I had around my eyes, they totally disappeared!  </li>
            <li> The rosewater mist is fantastic, I&#x27;ve tried expensive brands and this is just as high-quality.  </li>
            <li> The harsh winter had played havoc on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use it for my wrinkles, as well as my hands after a long day of gardening.  </li>
            <li> I have some minor scars on my arms and some hyper-pigmentaion on my face.</li>
            <li> I have ordered another bottle directly from Chile to compare, and will edit this review once again when it arrives - maybe there was nothing wrong with that first bottle after all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of things that might be helpful to know: first, a little goes a very long way, so a small bottle will last longer than you think.</li>
            <li> Like I said, my skin is combination, so it gets (or at least, used to) VERY oily, yet was dry and flaky in some areas.</li>
            <li> While this worked wonders on my age spots, I have had to mix it with other oils and essential oils</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews and comparing it to some of the other similar products, I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, the bottle indicates the product is \\&quot;certified organic\\&quot;, yet there&#x27;s no USDA - or any other - organic certification seal on the packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not similar to olive oil in color or smell (other customers here had this impression) - the color is orange, which, as I understand, is what it should be.</li>
            <li> this rosehip oil seems to help keep the dry spots from getting flaky.</li>
            <li> I also had a couple of dry, eczema spots on my face</li>
            <li> I bought it for dry skin</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 6 months for your nails to grown out completely</li>
            <li> I have been using this Inflora Rosehip Seed Oil for less than a week, but already my rosacea prone skin is less irritated and feels really soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I have read about how rosehip oil smells like fish oil when it goes bad, and conducted a really diligent research before buying my first bottle to avoid this.</li>
            <li> lips are dry, and a spot on my lower lip has had a rough patch for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my nails which were very dry, splitting, peeling, ridges and breaking .</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin sensative skin</li>
            <li> Now I know why other companies sell rosehip oil mixed with other stuff!</li>
            <li> My skin is forever in state of confusion some days its dry and on other days</li>
            <li> After my morning shave, I rub it on my face (while my face is still wet) and I can feel it helping immediately.</li>
            <li> I will update this review one the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Every night after cleansing with my face still wet, I apply this oil.</li>
            <li> Maybe an update later after a few months.</li>
            <li> so I hv to be careful what I&#x27;m using for my face</li>
            <li> Item as expected.</li>
            <li> spread the oil on my wet face every night&lt;</li>
            <li> I received the product faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I also used it a few times on my upper arms where the skin is (was!)</li>
            <li> a bit rough and bumpy.</li>
            <li> However the pump top on this particular product is terrible.</li>
            <li> I can not bare the scent unless I dilute it heavily with some other lotion.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> Bought this the other day for my girlfriend who is always complaining about her skin.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Face Treatment Oil from Clarins and I thought, there has to be something out there that is similar that isn&#x27;t $50 for a teeny bottle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try any other.</li>
            <li> I find you have to be very careful not to get it on your pillowcases and clothes.  </li>
            <li> Has bee making a huge difference in the appearance of my skin badly damaged during my last&lt;br /&gt;Hawaian vacation .</li>
            <li> should nor is it a dark color.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make any difference to the dark age spots I was trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> And to make the matter worse its very sensitive , so I was little scared using it .</li>
            <li> I also blended this oil with a few other anti-aging oils to apply in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I have added it with a few other doTerra oils and mango butter for a face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Previously I had been using a Rosehip Oil + Vitamin E mixture from another (mass-produced) brand</li>
            <li> the having the orange tint that the Infora brand had and another brand that I&#x27;d previously tried.</li>
            <li> My husband has chronic eczema and typically uses a steroid cream.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure if the bottle that I got is not very fresh and has that fish-like smell, or if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like.</li>
            <li> But the added bonus is that I&#x27;ve also been rubbing it into my hands where I&#x27;ve had a recurring skin condition for quite a while, and the dry rash is now gone after very little time using the product!</li>
            <li> Smells a little bit fishy</li>
            <li> I use a spread a few drops after I wash my face or take a shower.  </li>
            <li> I received the oil just a few days ago, and already I see it working.</li>
            <li> Lorna from Inflora suggested adding a few drops of lavender oil to improve the scent.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s one of the few oils I can use without breaking out or getting a rash.</li>
            <li> Helpful for my dried face.  </li>
            <li> The few pigmentation spots I have seem lighter and the forehead creases are smoother.  </li>
            <li> The broken veins on my cheeks are no longer as visible after a month of daily use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted money.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried so many expensive anti-aging skin care products and moisturizers, but I hadn&#x27;t found &amp;#34;the One&amp;#34;... until now!!!</li>
            <li> Somewhere in reviews or comments for this product it was mentioned that it was harvested in California - another disappointment, since this was not stated clearly in the product description</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve just begun to use it on my throat so am anxious to see if it helps there.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I have never used Rosehip oil in the past</li>
            <li> it smells like green tea!</li>
            <li> I have been using Rosehip Oil for a few years now, and Inflora has the highest quality!</li>
            <li> I had acnea in the past</li>
            <li> Another overly expensive product that&#x27;s actually affordable on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> The odor is not near as bad as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> They are not as dull looking as they were, So I am hopeful that this oil will help.</li>
            <li> It makes it hard to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Feels like, and smells like, I was putting thick olive oil on my face.</li>
            <li> He had raw red bumps from a bad sunburn weeks ago</li>
            <li> Third, it&#x27;s impossible to find out where the oil is sourced.</li>
            <li> Because who doesn&#x27;t want ridiculously silky skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get out.  </li>
            <li> Either way I was a little disappointed by this small detail.</li>
            <li> and customer service is even worse.</li>
            <li> They are in bad shape (due to age which we won&#x27;t discuss).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong on this beauty product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I have the worst cracking and dry hands</li>
            <li> I am crazy about this oil</li>
            <li> , some think it&#x27;s unpleasant, but the smell is smokey, not fishy.</li>
            <li> it smells SO BAD.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad as some may have stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I use it w/organic sesame seed oil as a base oil.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, this product broke me out horribly, even though I hadn&#x27;t had acne for ages.</li>
            <li> This product has a horrible fishy smell.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I like it so far , skin feels soft .</li>
            <li> Hi All,  Even though my skin is in pretty good condition, it can always look better, right?? So I decided to give Rosehip OIl a try since I have read and heard so many wonderful things about it over the years.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I choose This brand, Inflora, because of the lovely packaging. Yes, it is true I am a visual Junkie!! I  am here to report I Adore this oil, I have been applying it over my entire face and in particular in a few creases that I have been working on with Reviva 10% Glycolic Acid cream. The results is that this oil has really speeded up the healing process and left my skin silky smooth, Awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I want to add that Inflora&#x27;s Lavender oil is like no other, very potent and pure, just lovely!!&lt;br /&gt;Adding a Special Merci to Lorna, who is Absolutely the Best &amp;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to all for your comments, Take Care Ladies,  Namaste,  Zoe</li>
            <li> Great product, gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love using natural products and this feels great and moisturizes well!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for my very sensitive skin.... It has a peculiar scent which I don&#x27;t mind nevertheless great product... I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this oil.  I like the fact that it has no artificial chemicals in it. The fine lines that I have around mouth and eyes appear to be diminished somewhat.  Will update later.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what this is really capable of after longer use, but so far, so good! I mix with my moisturizer and really love the feel. Great product and company!</li>
            <li> Great quality, feels great on the skin</li>
            <li> This oil feels light on your skin. It is a much more economic way to get the benefit of vitamin A then some of the popular anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> great stuff not smelly which I was nervous about</li>
            <li> Excellent products and service.</li>
            <li> given to one of my children. She uses it regularly and loves</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily, diluted with fractionated coconut oil. It has made my face feel nourished,and has helped the small amount of redness I was having due to a mild rosacea issue. The odor was not a factor for me because it worked for what I bought it for, and the odor dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li> Although, as many others have stated, the scent is not very pleasant. Especially when your mind is saying &amp;#34;roses&amp;#34; and it smells like &amp;#34;fishes&amp;#34;! but I do like the way my skin is responding. I have combination skin and this rosehip oil seems to help keep the dry spots from getting flaky.</li>
            <li> FOUL ODOR. The packaging needs to be improved. The bottle came in a zip-lock&lt;br /&gt;sandwich bag and most of the oil had leaked out into the bag. Very messy.</li>
            <li> Fine rosewater.  Has a strong aroma, which makes me happy.  Because it is a spray, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting any.  I&#x27;m planning to give some as gifts later in the year.</li>
            <li> This product arrived to me in perfect condition and on time. My skin is forever in state of confusion some days its dry and on other days its on oilier side . And to make the matter worse its very sensitive , so I was little scared using it . But after using it right from the first application my skin was calmer and looked nourished and hydrated . It is a light oil which seeps right into the skin after a little massage . It has a nutty kind of smell which goes away after few minutes and all you are left with is your wonderful skin .</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Skin feels so smooth.  Multiple uses for this oil, worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is really great.  I can see a significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> While this worked wonders on my age spots, I have had to mix it with other oils and essential oils bc it smells SO BAD. Now I know why other companies sell rosehip oil mixed with other stuff! It definitely works, just be prepared to mix it with some essential oils or something nice smelling.</li>
            <li> Gives skin a healthy glow, although my skin has broke out some after using. Hoping it clears!</li>
            <li> Leavese my skin feeling soft and mosturized.</li>
            <li> so far so good. i have been adding it to my daily moisturizer along with amaranth oil. i put a good amount in the ponds face cream and mix it up until turns yellowish orangish and thats what i apply to my face. it ha  never been better and i couldnt dream about a better anti wrinkle cream thats home made :)</li>
            <li> A co-worker first introduced me to the world of essential oils. I hesitantly used her samples over the course of two (2) months which I later learned to absolutely love. As I continued on my journey to research more on the history and usefulness of essential oils, I couldn&#x27;t believe more people weren&#x27;t using this. I thought to myself - is this a gimmick that only people like me buy into? But as I used the oils over the last three months now, I can&#x27;t live without it. As the old adage goes....the proof is in the pudding. The sample my co-worker gave me was mixed with coconut oil and vanilla that can be used as a room spray, face &amp; body moisturizer, make-up remover etc...the possibilities are endless. To see real results, I believe you have to be consistent and use it everyday for at least a month. I use Rosehip Seed oil for my blemishes. It hasn&#x27;t been long enough since I&#x27;ve used this oil so I can&#x27;t really speak on its effectiveness with me.</li>
            <li> Been using this on my hair, scalp and face. Keeps everything moisturized during these winter months.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite. As a professional esthetician I did my research, but I think I like other brands better.</li>
            <li> The quality of Inflora Botanica&#x27;s Rosehip oil is impressive!  Previously I had been using a Rosehip Oil + Vitamin E mixture from another (mass-produced) brand and this is by far the better option. The pump bottle feels much more sanitary than typical dropper bottles, and not only are there no unnecessary fillers, but it smells better, the oil itself feels smooth and luxurious when applied, and it feels effective immediately.  Without makeup, I have an odd chronic redness that looks bizarre on my yellow-undertoned olive skin, but the application of this oil visibly soothes it.  It also makes a great moisturizing base before cosmetic application, and helps me achieve a natural, &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look despite how much concealer and powder I have to use to disguise old acne scars. Hopefully, Inflora&#x27;s rosehip oil will eventually help fade said scars...  In any case, what impresses me more than the product itself is the impeccable quality of Inflora&#x27;s customer service and communication.  Not only are their representatives extremely kind and courteous, but they are also patient and accommodating regarding various questions and concerns.  Shipping time was also swift and painless.  Overall, I am happy to have made a purchase with this company, and look forward to doing so again when I run out of the first bottle.  A+ for quality in every category!</li>
            <li> Smell is not ideal, but nice results!</li>
            <li> I have been so pleased with Inflora Botanica&#x27;s customer service and their products! My face seems to be adapting well so far and I have sensitive combination skin, I have kept it away from my chin because it is very acne prone. I originally bought this for my face but the most amazing improvement has been on my hands. I have the worst cracking and dry hands and since I started using this on them I have seen a vast improvement. I would recommend this product to anyone and would only buy it from this retailer on Amazon. Thank you Inflora for your amazing service and follow up!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother in law for Mother&#x27;s Day, tried it, and then bought several more for myself and girlfriends.  The smell is enchanting but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I should have taken &#x27;before&#x27; pictures!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for several weeks, from the dry Midwest to the balmy Florida Keys.&lt;br /&gt;There was an immediate change in my skin.  Lines appear to be diminished and some are no longer visible. (I&#x27;m 60.)&lt;br /&gt;My lips are dry, and a spot on my lower lip has had a rough patch for over a year.  It&#x27;s now healed!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just begun to use it on my throat so am anxious to see if it helps there.&lt;br /&gt;As the seller mentioned, there is a strong odor to it - earthy/fishy - but it dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This is a pump bottle, and I might rather have a dropper for more control in distribution.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for part of your skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I have mainly used this product for my eczema and it&#x27;s worked pretty well. NOT an instant relief, but being that its all natural I like it and don&#x27;t mind.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad as some may have stated.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I use it to not only wash my face but to also moisturize and my skin has never felt better. Beyond the product the customer service with this company is beyond amazing. They have proven to be a very reliable source and distributor of great products.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT. and customer service is even worse.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me this rosehip seed oil to try for my sensitive rosacea skin.  I use a spread a few drops after I wash my face or take a shower.  I have already seen a reduction of redness and irritability.  It feels like my skin is drinking this wonderfully pure, organic healing oil.  I am so glad this product exists!</li>
            <li> Very good product works well for me</li>
            <li> good stuff and all natural! seller was very informative of the product; much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Inflora Rosehip Seed Oil for less than a week, but already my rosacea prone skin is less irritated and feels really soft and hydrated.  I also had a couple of dry, eczema spots on my face and they are gone!  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product a week ago and am very impressed by the way my skin absorbs the oil. In fact, my skin is smooth and glows in a way it hasn&#x27;t  for months! The harsh winter had played havoc on my sensitive skin. This is a great remedy. Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my wife and she loves it. great product, truly penetrates and leaves the skin smooth and soft, does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> The rosewater mist is fantastic, I&#x27;ve tried expensive brands and this is just as high-quality.  The scent is lovely and it&#x27;s a versatile product.  Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully natural product sold by a company with high standards.  Fast delivery.  I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Buy only if you want to smell like a &amp;#34;fish-face&amp;#34; I tried diluting with my moisturizer, and with a few drops of other highly scented essential oils. But when it came right down to it… stinky fish face. I had to get up and wash my hands and face multiple times. The ONLY way I could recommend this product is if you planned on wearing a nose plug to bed (PS be kind also provide a nose plug for your partner) Otherwise… ewww.</li>
            <li> Very good product, works fine the skin, I see improvement in my scars, and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better!  I started wiping my makeup off with Thayer Witch Hazel Rose Petal Toner and then applying this product and the combination is amazing!  It&#x27;s simple, inexpensive and really works.</li>
            <li> I received the oil just a few days ago, and already I see it working. It&#x27;s pretty amazing actually. I appreciated how helpful the folks at Inflora were helping me. I would definitely recommend this product and this company. Thanks for a great purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for years and am so glad Inflora&#x27;s making it now! (I bought their Lavender Oil in February; it&#x27;s the purest, best-smelling one I&#x27;ve ever tried.) My skin is really sensitive and rosehip seed oil is the best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve found yet - even better than olive, and that&#x27;s saying something. It does everything - I love it. Inflora, please, please, please make more products!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because I read that it really helps with razor burn- and it does! After my morning shave, I rub it on my face (while my face is still wet) and I can feel it helping immediately. It&#x27;s great. It absorbs really fast, too. I tried so many things before this, for years, that never really took the sting away. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell like like roses at all...it smells good.  Really glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I know it smells like fish oil but I don&#x27;t care!!! Whatever is in it it has transformed my skin! I have tried other brands and this is hands down the best!!!! I am doing daily pictures to see the difference and WOW is all I can say!! I have recommended this product to everyone I know and all feedback is the same! Below are some of my personal results!!</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works! It does smell fishy but who cares...it goes away. I told my mom to put it on today. She&#x27;s 65 &amp; had a lot of creases and wrinkles on her chest. She put it on &amp; I couldn&#x27;t believe it! All the creases &amp; wrinkles were gone! It looked smooth after. I also put it on every night &amp; it makes my wrinkles dissapear. This stuff really does work. I used to have a hugh crease on the side of my face from sleeping I guess...&amp; it&#x27;s now gone. It really works on stretch marks too....it looks lighter &amp; smoothes the skin out. It&#x27;s like taking a wrinkled shirt &amp; ironing it out. I will DEFINENTLY buy this product again. I also keep it in the frig😀</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product. The smell is sort of strong, but in my opinion, worth it for the high quality organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product little more than month and half, I can&#x27;t not see any improvement yet...I will update this review one the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and I love the hint of rose scent it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I am impressed, I read the reviews of others and decided to give it a try. After spending tons of money in skin products,  I figured what the heck...why not give it a try? So I decided to give it a try. After finding something to counteract my acne issues, I really wanted something pure to use as a moisturizer. This product was perfect. Moisturizes, but it&#x27;s not too greasy and my skin tone is nice and even. After 3 weeks, laugh lines diminished. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that is doesn&#x27;t smell very good and I originally intended on using it on my face. I can not bare the scent unless I dilute it heavily with some other lotion. I have never used Rosehip oil in the past so all products might have a similar smell. Either way I was a little disappointed by this small detail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to using RoseHip oil and so far am finding it nice to use after a shower. Face is softer each morning. Looking forward to using it longer term.</li>
            <li> It works well-very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product the first time I used it on my skin.  It made my face feel so soft.  I only had my bottle for a week when my son visited from out of town.  He had raw red bumps from a bad sunburn weeks ago so I squirted some rosehip oil on it.  To my surprise they looked so much better the next day.  Reluctantly I did what a good mother has to do- gave him my bottle.  I instantly ordered some more and just got it today.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to get the make up off and treat my skin.  Can already tell a difference - much softer.  Now I hear my daughter in law has been using it and seeing improvement on her stretch marks and her baby is almost 2 years!  So those stretch marks has been there a while...  Can&#x27;t wait to see how it helps my granddaughter&#x27;s bottom when it gets a diaper rash.  The company is great on answering any questions.  I am not crazy over the smell but as the week went on I didn&#x27;t notice it as much.  Then my son took my bottle...  Lorna from Inflora suggested adding a few drops of lavender oil to improve the scent.  Start out a few drops, add a couple more if needed.  She is so helpful.  Can&#x27;t go wrong on this beauty product.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my face feel really soft</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying rosehip oil.  Given the packaging of most face care oils I buy, this is a cut above.  The pump really keeps it sanitary, fresh and helps get out just the right amount. I have used argan oil for my oily/acneic skin before, but I&#x27;m really responding to the rosehip oil.  I even think an old surgical scar above my lip is starting to heal.  My face is definitely very moisturized when I use it in the morning.  Thank you, Inflora! Another wonderful product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing to use a product that has 1 plant based ingredient, thank you Inflora! The color of the oil is a beautiful hue of deep orange, I believe this to be a testament to its high quality and pureness. It&#x27;s a truly a simple yet incredibly beneficial product for my daily moisturizing regime. At first I tried it as an overall face moisturizer, but my skin is too oily as is, so now I dab it beneath my eyes before bed each night. It&#x27;s a magical eye moisturizer, and much more affordable than the many expensive eye creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I also use it on my chest/collar bone area, where I&#x27;m developing fine lines, ahhh! What I like about this plant based oil, is that it is absorbed easily into the skin, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> I used this for my only night product. I love how my skin feels now.</li>
            <li> Love it. Would not go without it. I am 53 and want all natural organic anti aging. This stuff delivers!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore Inflora&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil. I&#x27;ve been using it every night before I go to sleep and love the way my skin looks refreshed and hydrated in the morning.  I have consistently dry skin and have always had trouble finding the right night regimen to provide some hydration and healing overnight. I feel that my pores are prone to clogging and my sensitive skin can get a bit red and bothered, so I was a little nervous about using the oil - that said, i have found that my face is super clear and the redness is calmed. Just love it...and i love the small bottle. I travel a lot and i&#x27;m able to bring it with me, by plane and in my carry-on. the best!</li>
            <li> Product came right away, and has been great. The oil is very high quality, the real deal. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face, and I have very sensitive skin so it&#x27;s one of the few oils I can use without breaking out or getting a rash. They say you can mix with a carrier oil, but I apply directly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have very sensitive skin; this product has been fantastic. No irritation; excellent benefits. And, great customer service, which is much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use a few drops directly on my face twice a day and my skin has never looked or felt better. Over the years I have tried so many expensive anti-aging skin care products and moisturizers, but I hadn&#x27;t found &amp;#34;the One&amp;#34;... until now!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, super fast delivery. I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was told rose hip oil would help. After only three days of use, my skin feels noticeably softer and more hydrated. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face in place of lotion after my face is washed and my skin is still a bit damp. It&#x27;s doing great things for my skin. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use in the mornings after I shave to reduce razor burn. It also comes in handy when I visit the Rocky Mountains because my skin gets so dry there. A little Rose Hip oil and my skin is refreshed and smooth. I also love the fact that its certified organic so that I know its not harming the earth. And the quality of the product itself is better than the other ones I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Inflora!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frederick</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!  I am a skincare junkie and I have used so many different oils and skincare products but this one really delivers.  It absorbs quickly and already my sensitive, dry, and sunburned skin looks and feels hydrated, even, and glowing!  Even my fine lines and wrinkles look less noticeable!  I have also noticed that it has helped with my stretch marks as well.  This is a wonderful product that can be used day and night on the face as well as all over the body....a must have and a great gift as well!</li>
            <li> I received the warmest thank you along with more information on the oil I ordered, both very much appreciated!  Oh - the oil is great too! I will definitely order from Inflora again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My sister got me this oil as a moisturizer and overall skin conditioner. It&#x27;s fantastic. No muss, no fuss. I put it on my face and neck after I get out of the shower. Works great! People are even commenting. Five stars. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil.  Has bee making a huge difference in the appearance of my skin badly damaged during my last&lt;br /&gt;Hawaian vacation . I usually let it sink in for a couple of minutes and follow with a spritz of rose water, - the result is absolutely silky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very grateful to my husband for this gift !&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful , caring and fast service . Will most certainly order again !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed :( I began reading about the many benifits of Rose and looked at reviews and choose this one well once home and opened to me it smelled something similar to caster oil rather than Rose oil. I&#x27;m sorry but I&#x27;m not completely sure that this is even rose oil or some other oil begin passed off as rose oil. Will use as body moisture for now until it&#x27;s gone will not reorder</li>
            <li> the jury is still out on the Rosehip oil, i haven&#x27;t seen a lot of results yet, but i will finish it and see.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! Every night after cleansing with my face still wet, I apply this oil. The best application is to pump a bit into your hands, warm it between your hands, and apply it by pressing into your wet skin. I am 42 years old and this week when I wanted to enjoy a glass of wine, I was asked for my ID for the first time in AGES! Really! I also blended this oil with a few other anti-aging oils to apply in the mornings. My skin has become supple and very soft. It really does work!</li>
            <li> Inflora Botanical rose hip oil is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. Once you try it you cannot live without it. I always use natural skin care this oil does more for your skin than any other product.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin feels so soft it&#x27;s just amazing! Think of it as food for your skin!</li>
            <li> Bought this the other day for my girlfriend who is always complaining about her skin. After reading some of the reviews and comparing it to some of the other similar products, I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so glad I bought this one! My girlfriend has been incredibly happy with it, even asking for more so she can share with her friends. Apparently its really been helping with her face and some of the minor scars and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This oil is miraculous! As an acupuncturist, I test all kinds of ointments and products, and this one is fabulous. A friend recommended it to me and I&#x27;m so grateful she did! I use it every day on my face and also used it successfully for scar prevention on a bad frying pan burn recently. Great stuff, Inflora, thank you so much. I look forward to more products in the future.</li>
            <li> Feels like, and smells like, I was putting thick olive oil on my face. I have only been using it for a couple of weeks and have not yet seen any difference. I have very good skin, so maybe there is no improvement to be seen.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nails which were very dry, splitting, peeling, ridges and breaking . They are in bad shape (due to age which we won&#x27;t discuss). I have only used it for one week but I can definitely tell a difference. They are not as dull looking as they were, So I am hopeful that this oil will help. It usually takes about 6 months for your nails to grown out completely so it will take some time before I will know just how good it works, but I am impressed with the way it has helped with the dryness. Maybe an update later after a few months.</li>
            <li> I love the product! I was using another brand of rose hip oil from  the &#x27;NOW&amp;#34;  line and noticed that the Inflora brand was better. The difference was in the color, feel and staying power. The &#x27;Now&#x27; brand was OK but it was white in color , instead of the having the orange tint that the Infora brand had and another brand that I&#x27;d previously tried. Inflora had a silky feel on my face and gave my face a noticeable glow.  Also, I love the pump bottle that it came in. Maybe there is a difference in the types of roses used or the extraction process that may account for the difference. The &#x27;NOW&#x27; brand is a good brand but Inflora is much better. Thank you. I have nothing but good things to say about your product and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> First of all, Lorna is wonderful.  When you buy this product you get tips on the best usage and if you have questions, they are very prompt in responding.  I use the oil twice a day and my skin looks so much better and I can wear makeup over it.  Very quick delivery too.  I would definately recommend this product for melasma and acne prone skin.  Nothing worked before until this!  Including numerous chemical peels and laser resurfacing.</li>
            <li> (Rose Water) Love it! I use it as a toner and to set my make up and its amazing! Customer service is fantastic and really informative! Will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> This product is misleading/falsely advertised on many levels.  First, the bottle states \\&quot;100% Pure Rose Hip Seed Oil is rich in bio available vitamin C and A\\&quot;. This is simply not possible as vitamin C is water soluble, therefore it can&#x27;t be contained in an oil. (The rosehip fruit is a rich source of Vitamin C but this oil was made of rosehip seeds, not fruit.)  Second, the bottle indicates the product is \\&quot;certified organic\\&quot;, yet there&#x27;s no USDA - or any other - organic certification seal on the packaging. I even checked the USDA&#x27;s website and there&#x27;s no mention of \\&quot;Inflora Botanica\\&quot; being certified organic.  Third, it&#x27;s impossible to find out where the oil is sourced. Mill Valley, CA is where the company is registered, not where the rosehip plants are grown.    Worst of all, this product broke me out horribly, even though I hadn&#x27;t had acne for ages. I wish I had listened to my gut and stayed away from this oil.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It has started the healing process of my scar and it has made my face feel smoother and glow! And the smell - it smells like green tea! I will definitely purchase again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have been using Rosehip Oil for a few years now, and Inflora has the highest quality! The bottle is very practical and their customer service is incredible. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 years old step daughter.  She loves this product, she says she has never felt her skin so moisturized before.  I also bought one for me and I love it! It even helped some dry spots I had around my eyes, they totally disappeared!  I would recommend this product to anyone because I have oily and dry areas type of skin and it works great on my entire face even over my eyelids and I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m imagining things but I even think i&#x27;m growing more eyelashes lol. The smell is not bad, but don&#x27;t expect the smell of roses, this oil comes from the seeds of a different type of rose anyways; if you wear makeup you can totally wear it after applying the oil. No allergic reactions, your skin will absorb this oil and leave your skin feeling moisturized. I am crazy about this oil</li>
            <li> Lovely product! It absorbs so nicely into my skin.  I use it for my wrinkles, as well as my hands after a long day of gardening.  So very soothing, healing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I use it in my face and neck nightly and starting to get compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> This oil feels so nourishing! I look forward to putting it on!! It really is like love for my skin!! The smell is a trustworthy smell. It smells natural, not &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34; but faintly and sweetly earthy. I love it. Definitely recommend this brand as well, the oil is a higher quality.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had Inflora&#x27;s rosehip oil a few weeks, but after a summer in intense sun and heat, we&#x27;re already feeling its amazing reparative and moisturizing effects!  It&#x27;s already made its way as a gift to some Florida relatives and we imagine we&#x27;ll buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> This product has a horrible fishy smell.  It makes it hard to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil! great quality and great packaging.</li>
            <li> Nicest rosehip seed oil I&#x27;ve used. Most oils at this price point lack the rich scent and color this one has. I&#x27;ve been using rosehip seed oils in general for about 6 years in place of regular anti-aging products. The oils have corrected my hyperpigmentation from sun exposure and plumped up the fine lines that had started to appear around my eyes. I also use it on my body to prevent scaring from cuts and scrapes. I&#x27;ve found it to be much more effective than plain vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, it&#x27;s one if my favorites. It goes on smooth and not too oily, it absorbs quick and leaves the skin soft. Definitely coming back for more after I&#x27;m done using this bottle! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Face Treatment Oil from Clarins and I thought, there has to be something out there that is similar that isn&#x27;t $50 for a teeny bottle. I remember a friend once told me she used Rosehip oil on her face. After reading tons of great reviews, I went with INFLORA and it is GREAT! It&#x27;s very comparable to the Clarins product and at such a great price. It is so moisturizing on my face and it is the only type of product (besides face wash) that I use in my regiment. Thank you so much for such a great product and for also including a list of uses for the Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and it smells and look just like olive oil... It does not smell like I read it should nor is it a dark color. I&#x27;m concerned that I&#x27;m going to break out even more. Only time will tell I guess.... May return it</li>
            <li> Helpful for my dried face.  I had acnea in the past so I hv to be careful what I&#x27;m using for my face but this oil keep my skin alive!Love it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make any difference to the dark age spots I was trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face looking smooth and youger. I have very dry skin sensative skin and this helps tremendously. Just dont order the one with vitamin e in it if he have allergies or swnsativities cause it will make your face breakout or flake.</li>
            <li> I am loving Inflora Botanica&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Oil as an everyday face moisturizer, mixed with a carrier oil.  It absorbs nicely and my skin looks and feels really healthy and much younger than 47.  I used to use coconut derived moisturizers, until I found out recently I have a coconut sensitivity.  I researched ways to create my own moisturizer and came upon the idea of using Rosehip Oil mixed with a carrier oil, or it can be used alone.  But the added bonus is that I&#x27;ve also been rubbing it into my hands where I&#x27;ve had a recurring skin condition for quite a while, and the dry rash is now gone after very little time using the product! This is a terrific and quality oil that I will continue to buy and the customer service is equally terrific!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the botanical name is (Rosa mosqueta) , which is supposed to be the best rose oil for scars.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming rose scent, which I like. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to get rid of my scar, but I like the product. I use it w/organic sesame seed oil as a base oil.</li>
            <li> Another overly expensive product that&#x27;s actually affordable on Amazon. It came fast and works well. I have two toddlers so I do a lot of research on quality and the various benefits of buying from certain companies. Some companie saturate the market and warn you to away from anything on Amazon as an &amp;#34;inferior product&amp;#34;. It is so easy to spend hundreds on these products because each brand claims they are the best and only &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; brand.  I am happy to say Inflora is a terrific customer orientated company who stands by their product. Even though you are ordering it online, they make you feel as though you are shopping at a local family owned company committed to selling quality products people can afford. I immediately received communication ensuring I was pleased with their product. They offer 100% satisfaction guarantee. It is obvious they are passonate about what they do, and I appreciate that. One of the top reasons I have written so much and so strongly support Infloria is because I feel that certain large companies have completely tried to tarnish any other brand, and that just isn&#x27;t the case. The Rosehip seed oil is top quality. It soaks in quickly, leaves your skin feeling smooth, and is a great product sold at a terrific price. My husband has chronic eczema and typically uses a steroid cream. I used this product on him and he cleared up significantly. I am very pleased with both the product and the company.</li>
            <li> An excellent Rosehip Seed Oil, that is both organic and pure in quality.  I found the oil to be excellent.  When applying this Rosehip Seed Oil, my skin softened immediately, providing a smooth and healthy glow.  I recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I really love this oil for many reasons! First I love this pump! It allows for the perfect amount, which isn&#x27;t much, to come out onto your hand. Every morning after my shower, I give it a squirt and rub it on my face. It&#x27;s moisturizing, yet light and not to heavy on my skin. My face looks refreshed after I&#x27;ve put it on, but not oily. I love the smell as well. It is earthy and doesn&#x27;t have a perfume - like smell. I&#x27;ve recently turned 40 and started noticing that indeed I have some wrinkles. This has really helped! I can already tell a difference. I highly recommend this to any one looking for a light daily facial moisturizer that wants it to be easy and light!</li>
            <li> it smells like fish oil</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I bought it as part of a switch to using oils for my skin care, and this rosehip oil is great. I also appreciate the Inflora sent me an email with details of possible uses for the oils. Seems like a great company and eager to answer questions and provide good customer support. Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> FIrst - you need to know this does not smell like roses!  It has a bit of a fishy odour to it - BUT this is the best moisturizer I have ever used!  I have healthy, clear,  slightly dry, mature (over 60:) skin and I can see and feel the difference in a week.  The few pigmentation spots I have seem lighter and the forehead creases are smoother.  I am sold on this product!! And... it&#x27;s all natural.  Not a chemical to be seen:)</li>
            <li> Great on time  delivery. Item as expected. Only just received.  Will use later.</li>
            <li> I find you have to be very careful not to get it on your pillowcases and clothes.  It&#x27;s very hard to get out.  I&#x27;m not terribly convinced it works.</li>
            <li> I am editing this review to correct that the oil does not come from California-grown rosehip. Lorna, the company owner, has contacted me and explained that she gets it from a supplier in Chile, where the best rosehip oil comes from. The initial confusion happened when I read one of the customers saying that the oil comes from California. I am still not sure if the bottle that I got is not very fresh and has that fish-like smell, or if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like. I have ordered another bottle directly from Chile to compare, and will edit this review once again when it arrives - maybe there was nothing wrong with that first bottle after all. As I have written before, I still like the way my skin looks and feels after I use the Inflora Botanica oil. They have great customer service, too.      My initial review:    I have read about how rosehip oil smells like fish oil when it goes bad, and conducted a really diligent research before buying my first bottle to avoid this. I have read that many find the smell of even good and fresh rosehip oil strange, some think it&#x27;s unpleasant, but the smell is smokey, not fishy. Well, the one I got does smell like fish oil. It&#x27;s not similar to olive oil in color or smell (other customers here had this impression) - the color is orange, which, as I understand, is what it should be. It&#x27;s not Chilean, which is the most sought after rosehip oil. Somewhere in reviews or comments for this product it was mentioned that it was harvested in California - another disappointment, since this was not stated clearly in the product description and I became aware of it only after I bought the oil. I could give it two stars, but I still like what it does to my skin, hence three stars. I will probably return it, because the smell really bothers me.</li>
            <li> Smells like fish oil.</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is a staple for simple extraordinary skin health and makes my face feel supple, calm, and sweetly nourished.&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to find an organic oil and appreciate Inflora for offering such pure quality. I will definitely keep a regular supply in my aesthetics kit.</li>
            <li> I love the Inflora Rosehip Seed Oil!!  The packaging is lovely, the pump top makes it easy to use and the detailed instructions for the many uses of the product were GREAT!!  I have never had such a thorough and personal communication on anything I have bought from Amazon.  But the really best feature of this product is that it works!  I am using it to heal a large scar on my face and I can see the difference after a couple of weeks of applying it twice a day.  The encouraging words from the seller are wonderful and healing also.</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily mixed with a few drops of Young Living essential Oil .. I can see remarkable softness in the lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product I saw really good results I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil.  It&#x27;s 100% pure and feels wonderful on my skin.  Rosehip Seed Oil is an age defying must for beautiful skin.  The pump on the bottle allows ease in dispensing.  Yes I will buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> Great product and amazing customer service</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I use it on my face, my hands, and my feet.  The broken veins on my cheeks are no longer as visible after a month of daily use.  There is an odor when you first spray it, but the odor dissipates very soon.  I wish rosehip was a sunblock!</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t use this yet,,,I have to go through  recipe,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels when using this product but am not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my rosehip seed oil.  I have added it with a few other doTerra oils and mango butter for a face moisturizer.  Sure makes my face feel soft and am hoping after a while I will see less wrinkles with my oil combo.  Received this oil quickly and was packaged well.  Will surely buy again and next time I will be buying the larger bottle!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This oil is good. It&#x27;s not what I was expecting, but the feel is normal and it is really moisturizing. I liked that the packaging was environmentally friendly and that the product is organic.</li>
            <li> Fast service and very nice product t</li>
            <li> good but some time make my skin break out. smell is not that good like earthy.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. It shipped fast without any trouble. I use it around my eyes after my face wash routine and follow up with rose water toner and coconut oil as my moisturizer. I also use the Rosehip oil on blemishes, bug bites, scratches and in my daughters diaper wipe solution. She has not had one rash since I started using it. I like that the company is based out of Oregon too. Organic American made. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As a real healthy skin fanatic, I have tried about every &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; skincare product on the market so I consider myself somewhat of an expert critic.  This product is great.  Don&#x27;t expect it to smell like roses or feel oily.  It doesn&#x27;t.  What I like best is it gives my skin a dewey look and feel.  I use it on top of a moisturizer...add a bit a blush, some lip gloss and eye makeup and I am ready to go.  Great for that natural, healthy look.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light oil to moisture my face at night.&lt;br /&gt;I spread the oil on my wet face every night&lt;br /&gt;i wake up in the morning with no need to put a day cream,so i only need to use it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;my skin has a new glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;it was very important for me to get an organic high quality rose hip oil,and this product is great.&lt;br /&gt;shipping was super fast and it arrived packaged well&lt;br /&gt;i wish it had some more suggestions  and information on the package as to  how i can use the product.but i googled it.</li>
            <li> I received the product faster than expected. So far I am loving this product. I was interested in it for scars and sun damage. I have some minor scars on my arms and some hyper-pigmentaion on my face. While I cannot say yet wether it will make a big difference int he long run; I do think it is helping. I love that it does not have a strong floral scent as I do not like to use anything too scented. Meanwhile my face and skin where I have used it feels great.</li>
            <li> The pump top is great! It keeps this wonderful oil fresh! Rose hip seed oil is one of my favorite oils and as a maker of natural skin care I have been using it in products for years. The oil is a marvelous balance of the very important essential omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids. These essential plant compounds are absorbed easily and deeply into the skin moisturizing and healing as they support the skin tissues. Additionally the oil contains high amounts of natural vitamin C, an important nutrient for healthy skin and body. Rosehip seed oil is one that has been demonstrated to help minimize scaring and mitigate what the years do to our skin. Inflora Botanica’s Rosehip seed oil’s pump bottle is especially valuable as it delivers just the right amount of oil and keeps the contents fresh as it is not constantly opened and exposed to the air. An all round great skin care staple!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now. I use it in conjunction with virgin coconut oil to cleanse my face, and an apple cider vinegar/water mix as a toner. (For any who may want to know, it&#x27;s 1 part ACV to 2 parts water.) I am 26 years old and have very fair skin. I have struggled with acne, large pores, black heads, and combination skin up until about a year ago. (I think most of what did the drink was eating better and drinking loads of water.) With that being said, this product is amazing on my skin. Like I said, my skin is combination, so it gets (or at least, used to) VERY oily, yet was dry and flaky in some areas. But I saw so many who recommended this, even for those with heavily oily skin, so I decided to give it a try. It is wonderful!! For a few minutes or so, it does feel like it&#x27;s sitting on top of my skin. But it definitely soaks in eventually and makes my skin feel like velvet. It did brighten my skin tone a bit, but I will say that for me, it has not helped with acne scarring whatsoever. (That was one of the claims I saw while doing my research.) I wish it had, but it has not.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the bottom line is YES I would recommend this. I&#x27;ve had several friends incorporate it into their routines and all I&#x27;ve heard from them so far are good reviews!!</li>
            <li> This is lovely oil!  It came quickly with a nice note from the company giving tips on how to use it. You can use it in your hair, skin, and face!  It smells like &amp;#34;grandma&#x27;s powder room!&amp;#34; I often use it as a night cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Within a week of starting my dry, sun damaged skin feels so soft, nourished and moist. My three year old daughter has been snuggling up to me as  saying, &amp;#34;Mama, you are sooooo silky.&amp;#34;  My husband has also been using it and loves it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I used to use Vitamin E oil for my acne scarring, but the consistency was too sticky and gooey. This rosehip oil is the perfect consistency-- it feels light on my skin, smells natural (it&#x27;s a kind of vegetal smell, but I like it), and absorbs really nicely. At the rate I&#x27;m using this oil, I&#x27;ll definitely buy more soon. Definitely recommend. Great customer service from Inflora as well.</li>
            <li> I love this Product. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to vouch for some of its claims- what i can say is that I live in an incredibly dry rough environment on the skin and I use this oil before bed- and wake with my face feeling rejuvenated and am thrilled.</li>
            <li> Really lovely, has improved the texture of my skin, I use it every day in place of facial moisturizers. The company is really responsive and great.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and I love this rosehip oil!  My skin was drying out during the winter months and I added this to my nightly beauty regimen and my skin became hydrated and more revived and now my makeup glides back on smoothly. I use it each night and sometimes during the morning after I wash my face. It gives my face a glow even when I have foundation and powder on because it is so hydrating!</li>
            <li> The best oil. Don&#x27;t try any other. I&#x27;ve wasted money. I love it.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it&#x27;s supposed to be good for sun damage and it doesn&#x27;t have any additives - just the rosehip seed oil. A bit of background - I have *extremely* sensitive skin as well as allergic reactions to fragrances (including a lot of botanicals that are used in supposedly fragrance-free products from the health food store). Because of this, and because I&#x27;ve wasted hundreds of dollars on things that I end up giving away after one or two tries, I rarely try new body care products any more. But this one was well worth it! Not only did I not react badly to it, but it has made my skin incredibly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by using it on my chest and neck, and after about a week I got brave enough to try it on some eczema patches on my face. The results were great - no additional irritation and definite improvement to the eczema. Yay! I also used it a few times on my upper arms where the skin is (was!) a bit rough and bumpy. My arms are now super smooth and I&#x27;ve gotten unsolicited comments on how soft my skin is. This led me to try it a couple of times all over my body. Even after several days of not using it, that skin still feels way softer than before, so maybe I&#x27;ll do this weekly or for special occasions. (And I&#x27;ll buy the 4oz bottle next time to make it more cost effective.) Because who doesn&#x27;t want ridiculously silky skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things that might be helpful to know: first, a little goes a very long way, so a small bottle will last longer than you think. Also, there is no added fragrance, but the oil itself does have a subtle smell to it, which I&#x27;d describe more as a food-smell (like some other oils) rather than a perfume-y smell. I probably would not use it right before a date, but it is not unpleasant. And as someone who has to use unscented and fragrance-free everything, it does not irritate me (skin or allergies) at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only got this oil about three weeks ago, so I haven&#x27;t yet had much opportunity to see visual changes to the sun damage on my chest, but regardless of what happens with that, I am an extremely satisfied. If you want skin like butter, give this Inflora Rosehip Seed Oil a try!</li>
            <li> I love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Good product, hydrates very well my skin. Smells a little bit fishy but it&#x27;s not too strong for me. The only thing I was expecting that the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  I have been using organic oils for a while and read some information regarding Rosehip Seed Oil specifically and, after reading reviews on INFLORA, I decided to place an order. The odor is not near as bad as I had expected.  It dissipates quickly and my skin feels lovely!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I love the way it feels and am seeing improvements in my skin. It does not smell like roses, but it&#x27;s a very benign smell that isn&#x27;t an issue. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! vendor is very customer focused and ships fast. This is great for facial uses and mixes nicely with essential oils and has a pleasant light scent. Actually, its almost no scent! I highly recommend using this product and buying from this vendor. My doctor and herbalist recommend this product as well.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality rosehip oil. It has a beautiful orange-red color, smell is normal, not too strong and is in a glass amber bottle with an easy to use pump that gives out a perfect amount of oil. There are many reasons why a person might want to get rosehip oil, it can be great for dry, dull hair and dandruff, dry skin, Scars (because it can quicken the healing process), sun burns, age spots, brittle nails and many other reason. I bought it for dry skin and I noticed this really helps. I use it with or without lavender essential oil and Tamanu oil (Foraha Madagascar). I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this oil; my perfect daily moisturizer. However the pump top on this particular product is terrible. I thought I would like it but it dispenses too much oil way too forcefully.</li>
