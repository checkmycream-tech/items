            <li>Its so amazing</li>
            <li>i ordered this for my wife and she looks so amazing in it.</li>
            <li>so i added my own,</li>
            <li>then my own hair.  </li>
            <li>My new best friend.</li>
            <li>I purchased this wig for a burlesque performance and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>and I have to say I just popped it on and it fit perfectly and was styled ready to go out of the package.</li>
            <li>In my experience, the more you comb a curly wig, the frizzier the ends get.</li>
            <li>but all in all a lovely wig</li>
            <li>I love that I can brush it to make the curls \\&quot;fluffier\\&quot; and have more volume</li>
            <li>Initially I was impressed with the wig when I took it out of the box.  </li>
            <li>This wig is just lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely wig</li>
            <li>, so many people said I looked like Katy Perry.  </li>
            <li>I am beyond pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It is fairly shiny when you first receiver it</li>
            <li>The wig looks and feels like real hair, I love it!</li>
            <li>It has adjustable hooks inside the wig so you can tighten or loosen for a custom fit.</li>
            <li>It is a veri natrual fit, feel, and look.</li>
            <li>The hair is smooth, silky but it does have a bit of a synthetic shine.</li>
            <li>Was totally expecting this wig to be cheap, but so glad I took the risk!!</li>
            <li>but once I received (within 2 days) I opened and it was packaged in a nice white box with a net protecting the hair BEAUTIFULLY</li>
            <li>* brush them out for true Bettie Page style waves.  </li>
            <li>I use wigs frequently for photoshoots and own quite a collection.</li>
            <li>but i decided to work with it because most synthetic wig dont come right out the pack ready to wear, they have to be styled.</li>
            <li>and I do love how soft it is!</li>
            <li>but most people think it looks natural.</li>
            <li>The wig cap is a good size, I have long hair, and it accommodated it along with my giant melon, very comfortably.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only suitable for the trash bin.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>When i first saw it i wanted to return it</li>
            <li>Where the hair parts on the top it is white.</li>
            <li>Not only is the wig exactly as pictured online, but it feels so much nicer than many of my synthetic hair wigs.</li>
            <li>It was gorgeous straight out of the box and required little to no styling.</li>
            <li>purchased this piece for a character I&#x27;m doing, but it&#x27;s so nice that I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;ll be wearing it out on other occasions.</li>
            <li>The color is a beautiful raven black and if it ever comes out in platinum blonde, I will buy it in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li>This natural blonde is convinced that brunettes may, in fact, have more fun.</li>
            <li>It comes with the curls very separate</li>
            <li>so you need to *gently</li>
            <li>I ordered it on the 9th and received it on the 11th, extremely fast shipping</li>
            <li>So that being said, i like it but had to do too much to it, if you want a nice realistic wig for less than fort bucks try divatress.com, im not affiliated just a customer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much exactly as pictured once I brushed it out well.</li>
            <li>so that kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>use like other reviews says, it&#x27;s perfectly clean, silky ready to wear as is once it is taken out of the box</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a total mess and won&#x27;t be suitable for the photoshoot it was supposed to feature in.  </li>
            <li>I wore it out the first night I had it and received numerous compliments on my \\&quot;hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>or I can smooth it down with my hands and let them lay tighter.</li>
            <li>So i smoothed the creases with my curling iron, trim the bangs, tweezed the part to make it wider, brushed out the curls into waves and added frizz serum to tame them and the wig is very thick and full, so the end result was beautiful, it even lost some of the shine by brushing it.it has no combs in it</li>
            <li>so it doesnt look natural at all</li>
            <li>Not at all natural looking on my tan skin</li>
            <li>however I did use my straightening iron on lowest heat to smooth out a few inches</li>
            <li>you cannot treat this like human hair and go at it with the curling iron, it will cause the hair to straighten if the curling iron is too hot, even on low setting</li>
            <li>I will definitely be doing a touch of styling to loosen up a few of the curls, but this piece will not require anything more than my standard wash and brush, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a bit shiny out of the packaging, just let it sit out or wear it around the house for a few hours - that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>In the sun it gives off that fake shine but still looks nice.</li>
            <li>The curls stay in a state of giant poof and the bangs won&#x27;t lay properly and are pretty impossible to get looking nice.</li>
            <li>So sexy, well made, thick, and heat resistant!!</li>
            <li>Only wish it was a little longer, the wig is much shorter than pictured.</li>

            <li> Only wish it was a little longer, the wig is much shorter than pictured.</li>
            <li> The skin top part is very thin</li>
            <li> but it was stuffed in a 5 by 6inch flat box which caused creases in the hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly, when I followed the instruction sheet and rinsed it exactly as they said, the hair just went frizzy and all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because based on other reviews and pictures</li>
            <li> It had a very shiny artificial look to the hair and the curls looked like frizzy ringlets.</li>
            <li> , the ends of the bang had a jagged uneven edge.</li>
            <li> The bangs can get a bit messy but it&#x27;s nothing that I would worry about.</li>
            <li> I didnt wash before use as the instructions enclosed describe until after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side this is one of the few wigs that doesn&#x27;t make my head itch</li>
            <li> So shinny and black and silky!</li>
            <li> Therefore I am not satisfied with this product and will request a refund.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it was niceli packaged and it looked just as advertised if not better.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re black, don&#x27;t get it because it still looks fake.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase from this brand again as I believe the photo is misleading, and their customer service utterly poor.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed by the wig as it is extremely (borderline ridiculous) curly and does not look at all like the product pictured.</li>
            <li> The curls get a bit messy but it&#x27;s nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t go so well for me.</li>

            <li> Love this wig! It did require styling out of the box, but what wig doesn&#x27;t. In my experience, the more you comb a curly wig, the frizzier the ends get. Not so, here. The wig cap is a good size, I have long hair, and it accommodated it along with my giant melon, very comfortably. All in all, a great wig, and I would own it in a rainbow of colors!</li>
            <li> Great wig, very full!</li>
            <li> The wig received is not the one ordered, I ordered I1 and received color 1. Therefore I am not satisfied with this product and will request a refund. Further to this, the wig is of a low quality.</li>
            <li> I like this wig but if you&#x27;re black, don&#x27;t get it because it still looks fake. too shiny. but all in all a lovely wig</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig. I was looking for a Bettie Page style wig and found this. It was gorgeous straight out of the box and required little to no styling.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one for a photoshoot 50&#x27;s style and I have to say its just perfect. The wig looks and feels like real hair, I love it! I have never worn a wig before and I have to say I just popped it on and it fit perfectly and was styled ready to go out of the package. It has adjustable hooks inside the wig so you can tighten or loosen for a custom fit. Its so amazing I shall wear it out with my retro Bette look!</li>
            <li> i ordered this for my wife and she looks so amazing in it. when you look at the at it when its on you cant tell its a wig</li>
            <li> The wig arrived immediatli and well before the estimated time [in which they emailed me with all the xact dates and tracking numbers]. When I got it, it was niceli packaged and it looked just as advertised if not better. It is a veri natrual fit, feel, and look. I am terribli satified since I bought this for everiday and its PERFECT. The seller was also veri polite and answered all the questions about taking care of a wig! Luv it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig for a burlesque performance and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  The style is perfect for my Bettie inspired costuming!  It comes with the curls very separate so you need to *gently* brush them out for true Bettie Page style waves.  The hair is smooth, silky but it does have a bit of a synthetic shine.</li>
            <li> Was totally expecting this wig to be cheap, but so glad I took the risk!! These people made a customer for life, I am a model and I am always looking to switch up my look. So sexy, well made, thick, and heat resistant!! My new best friend. &lt;3</li>
            <li> Only wish it was a little longer, the wig is much shorter than pictured.</li>
            <li> I use wigs frequently for photoshoots and own quite a collection. This one is really beautiful and the color hits the spot. Just what I was looking for! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed by the wig as it is extremely (borderline ridiculous) curly and does not look at all like the product pictured. It looks like between the stocking fee and the return shipping cost, returning the item is going to cost me a lot, so I will use it for Halloween instead. I will not purchase from this brand again as I believe the photo is misleading, and their customer service utterly poor.</li>
            <li> I like to experiment with wigs/fashion in my night life. This piece is great. I wore it out the first night I had it and received numerous compliments on my \\&quot;hair\\&quot;. Not even my friend who is a hair extension/wig addict could tell I was wearing a wig until I told her! Everyone just thought I got a great haircut ;) It is a bit shiny out of the packaging, just let it sit out or wear it around the house for a few hours - that quickly goes away. I love that I can brush it to make the curls \\&quot;fluffier\\&quot; and have more volume or I can smooth it down with my hands and let them lay tighter. I did have to brush it about once an hour to keep the volume up, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Just 2 minutes in the ladies room which I do for lipstick anyway. I can also move the bangs around to my liking. I was worried they might be too short, but they weren&#x27;t at all. It&#x27;s pretty much exactly as pictured once I brushed it out well. The color is a beautiful raven black and if it ever comes out in platinum blonde, I will buy it in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> Initially I was impressed with the wig when I took it out of the box.  Sadly, when I followed the instruction sheet and rinsed it exactly as they said, the hair just went frizzy and all over the place.  It&#x27;s a total mess and won&#x27;t be suitable for the photoshoot it was supposed to feature in.  It&#x27;s only suitable for the trash bin.  If you buy this product...don&#x27;t follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on the 9th and received it on the 11th, extremely fast shipping but it was stuffed in a 5 by 6inch flat box which caused creases in the hair. It had a very shiny artificial look to the hair and the curls looked like frizzy ringlets. The skin top part is very thin so it doesnt look natural at all and if ur looking for a blunt cut bettie page type bang like i was then youre in for a dissapointment, the ends of the bang had a jagged uneven edge. When i first saw it i wanted to return it but i decided to work with it because most synthetic wig dont come right out the pack ready to wear, they have to be styled. So i smoothed the creases with my curling iron, trim the bangs, tweezed the part to make it wider, brushed out the curls into waves and added frizz serum to tame them and the wig is very thick and full, so the end result was beautiful, it even lost some of the shine by brushing it.it has no combs in it so i added my own, like i said i had to put a lot of work into it to like it and thats why i gave it only three starts. you cannot treat this like human hair and go at it with the curling iron, it will cause the hair to straighten if the curling iron is too hot, even on low setting u may want to spritz the hair with water before curling it. So that being said, i like it but had to do too much to it, if you want a nice realistic wig for less than fort bucks try divatress.com, im not affiliated just a customer.</li>
            <li> This wig is just lovely. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on as soon as I received it. The curls get a bit messy but it&#x27;s nothing too bad. It is fairly shiny when you first receiver it but most people think it looks natural. In the sun it gives off that fake shine but still looks nice. Where the hair parts on the top it is white. Not at all natural looking on my tan skin so that kind of sucks. Does not change how I feel about the wig though. The bangs can get a bit messy but it&#x27;s nothing that I would worry about. It&#x27;s a lovely wig and I&#x27;m definitely going to buy the blonde when I can spare the money.</li>
            <li> Received yesterday and was worried after reading some of the reviews but once I received (within 2 days) I opened and it was packaged in a nice white box with a net protecting the hair BEAUTIFULLY, I pulled it out and it fell GORGEOUSLY, it was more beautiful then my own hair.  So shinny and black and silky! I am pleasantly impressed and would recommend this wig to anyone.  I got it for a halloween costume for a Betty Mae Page inspired vintage pin-up girl from the 40&#x27;s or 50&#x27;s and it has the perfect vintage look.  I didnt wash before use as the instructions enclosed describe until after a few uses.  It doesnt say you have to wash before use like other reviews says, it&#x27;s perfectly clean, silky ready to wear as is once it is taken out of the box however I did use my straightening iron on lowest heat to smooth out a few inches so it wasnt so curly and it came out perfectly!!  I was very happy with it and no one could believe it was a wig.  Would be perfect for a Katy Perry look also, so many people said I looked like Katy Perry.  Very good quality and good purchase in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased with this purchase. Not only is the wig exactly as pictured online, but it feels so much nicer than many of my synthetic hair wigs. It moves like a dream - all bouncy curls and whatnot. I can&#x27;t take it off of my head! I will definitely be doing a touch of styling to loosen up a few of the curls, but this piece will not require anything more than my standard wash and brush, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this piece for a character I&#x27;m doing, but it&#x27;s so nice that I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;ll be wearing it out on other occasions. This natural blonde is convinced that brunettes may, in fact, have more fun.</li>
            <li> To preface this, I&#x27;ve been working with wigs for years. Unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t go so well for me. The curls stay in a state of giant poof and the bangs won&#x27;t lay properly and are pretty impossible to get looking nice. I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because based on other reviews and pictures, I must&#x27;ve gotten a goofed up wig that just slipped through the cracks. On the plus side this is one of the few wigs that doesn&#x27;t make my head itch and I do love how soft it is!</li>
            <li> It came with the bangs all bent and I can not fix them.</li>
