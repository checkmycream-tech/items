            <li>It&#x27;s ok, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>Okay I have tried everything</li>
            <li>color not quite right, but covers good........</li>
            <li>I bought Medium color first and its a bit too fair for summer</li>
            <li>, it looks great, natural and does not come off on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know about the light</li>
            <li>I have a fairly light complection and have the age spots on both arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>LOOK FANTAASTIC AND SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>I bought the tan, as I&#x27;m pretty tan most of the time and wanted to use this when I was by the pool on vacation.</li>
            <li>and tan to have a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Rivers need to stick to making people laugh not ripping them off.  </li>
            <li>This is the most natural looking cover-up I have ever used.</li>
            <li>If you are fair you probably won&#x27;t want the tan as it is dark</li>
            <li>THANKS!  </li>
            <li>It was pretty transparent on my legs.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>sure to apply the cream fast and let dry for 10 min before putting on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I use this to cover those and it works real well.  </li>
            <li>This product looks so nice that I wear it all year &#x27;round -- all over my body.</li>
            <li>and I live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>THE RIGHT TO BARE LEGS</li>
            <li>Unlike some products, this one really hides the flaws and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Only a person with very dark skin tone would be able to use it.</li>
            <li>old.  </li>
            <li>The sponge top is ridiculous</li>
            <li>This stuff was hard to put on....did not go on smoothly and came off on everything.  </li>
            <li>and we go bare legged all year.  </li>
            <li>If you use this by moisturizing first, wait a few minutes for moisturizer to soak in, then wet your hands and shake the water off, squeeze a LITTLE into your hands and apply with up and down strokes, giving a little more to areas you need more coverage, let dry about 10 minutes while putting on make up or doing other things</li>
            <li>This does not cover blur veins very well, but helps a little.  </li>
            <li>Tan is pretty dark and Im pretty tan, its a little dark for me.</li>

            <li> Tan is pretty dark and Im pretty tan, its a little dark for me.</li>
            <li> The formula is very thick, however, and you must work quickly to blend it in.</li>
            <li> I read reviews where they said by doing this it doesn&#x27;t dry well</li>
            <li> , I also let it dry for 10 to 15 minutes before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> Would certainly not recommend the Tan.</li>
            <li> I use some lotion on my skin then squirt some in my hand and work the lower half of my leg then repeat with upper half.</li>
            <li> overall not perfect 49 year old legs.....</li>
            <li> What a mess trying to get an even application.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise the product was to dark, in fact a weird dark orange which is not suitable for any African American mix</li>
            <li> I used a little of one tube, the rest went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> It made my legs a little tanner but did not cover any of my vein issues.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little work to get it off and get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> too much trouble putting on and washing off.  </li>
            <li> Stays on all day, does not easily transfer.  </li>
            <li> The skin my legs is pretty bad looking from years of sun damage and skin cancer</li>
            <li> and I think the Medium would probably work on her, not sure though as she hasn&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase again, very messy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Apply a little at a time and rub it in, don&#x27;t forget the backs of your legs ladies!!</li>
            <li> BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to cover up broken veins.  </li>
            <li> not happy how the product came out.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have some tan it wouldn&#x27;t have been as bad.</li>
            <li> Sorry I was very disappointed as it rubbed off on anything  </li>
            <li> hate this product</li>

            <li> I bought the Tan Cover Up after I bought the Medium because the coverage is so great. The Medium was good but the Tan is great for my coloring and in the summer when you want a tan, this just fit me perfectly. I will probably mix Medium and Tan during the winter. My legs look flawless and Amazon&#x27;s price point is so much cheaper than QVC, you get three tubes to QVC&#x27;s one. I also pull the spongy thing off the top, since it&#x27;s glued just rip it off. I use some lotion on my skin then squirt some in my hand and work the lower half of my leg then repeat with upper half. I read reviews where they said by doing this it doesn&#x27;t dry well but I haven&#x27;t had any problem, I also let it dry for 10 to 15 minutes before getting dressed. If you are fair you probably won&#x27;t want the tan as it is dark but I found the Medium to be perfectly beige no hint of Tan in it, I don&#x27;t know about the light but My daughter is milky white and I think the Medium would probably work on her, not sure though as she hasn&#x27;t tried it yet. If you have age spots or marks on your skin I found this to cover wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The product was incredibly disppointing. Only a person with very dark skin tone would be able to use it. I used a little of one tube, the rest went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Product works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t rub off.  Unlike some products, this one really hides the flaws and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I am 75 yrs. old.  I have a fairly light complection and have the age spots on both arms and legs.  I use this to cover those and it works real well.  I mix the the med. and tan to have a more natural look.  My legs and feet look real good when I use it.  I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> Not the color of my tan. So it looks a bit orange. If I didn&#x27;t have some tan it wouldn&#x27;t have been as bad.</li>
            <li> I am an biracial women with a nature tan.  I purchased this product to cover up broken veins.  To my surprise the product was to dark, in fact a weird dark orange which is not suitable for any African American mix person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joan Rivers need to stick to making people laugh not ripping them off.  How much more money do you need, you are olddddd!</li>
            <li> Tan is pretty dark and Im pretty tan, its a little dark for me.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  What a mess trying to get an even application.  Should have sent it back.  Would certainly not recommend the Tan.</li>
            <li> Sorry I was very disappointed as it rubbed off on anything  I wore can&#x27;t even give the rest away after friends saw how it was.  looked good when put on but comes off on everything.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> I am soooooooo pleased and It was on my steps in 2 days.  I am a happy camper.  THANKS!  FOR THE PRODUCT THE RIGHT TO BARE LEGS mY COUSIN TOLD ME ABOUTHTHIS PRODUCT, AND I USED HERS MY LEGS LOOK FANTAASTIC AND SMOOTH.  I PURCHSED THE TAN COLOR.</li>
            <li> I love this product I been using it for years, i would wear a dress or skirt with out.&lt;br /&gt;And i found more on Amazon at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to apply the cream fast and let dry for 10 min before putting on your clothes. Now I even use it on my face under my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;A.B</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.  It was pretty transparent on my legs. I bought the tan, as I&#x27;m pretty tan most of the time and wanted to use this when I was by the pool on vacation. It made my legs a little tanner but did not cover any of my vein issues.  Not ever the spider veins.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> color not quite right, but covers good........</li>
            <li> good product but the color was to light</li>
            <li> This product looks so nice that I wear it all year &#x27;round -- all over my body. ;-)</li>
            <li> I will not purchase again, very messy and hard to apply. does not cover as advertised.  This was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it...too much trouble putting on and washing off.  I&#x27;d rather use the tanning lotion where you put it on every day and it gets you darker.</li>
            <li> not happy how the product came out. They make everything look good on TV!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I hate this product and i would not recommend this product, it looks aweful!</li>
            <li> The skin my legs is pretty bad looking from years of sun damage and skin cancer and I live in Hawaii where it&#x27;s hot and we go bare legged all year.  If you use this by moisturizing first, wait a few minutes for moisturizer to soak in, then wet your hands and shake the water off, squeeze a LITTLE into your hands and apply with up and down strokes, giving a little more to areas you need more coverage, let dry about 10 minutes while putting on make up or doing other things, it looks great, natural and does not come off on your clothes.  Takes a littler practice.  The sponge top is ridiculous so don&#x27;t even try to squeeze the makeuo through it.  It takes a little work to get it off and get rid of it.  This does not cover blur veins very well, but helps a little.  I like this stuff more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Gave it 4stars because of the applicator sponge problem.</li>
            <li> I have veins on my legs and this product covers them well. Will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, won&#x27;t buy again. Color is too orangey. I prefer Sally Hansen airbrush legs in deep glow.</li>
            <li> excellent sevice and excellent product</li>
            <li> This stuff was hard to put on....did not go on smoothly and came off on everything.  Made your legs feel as tho they were encased in tights.  Didn&#x27;t like it at all.  Am back to my &amp;#34;Banana Boat&amp;#34; self tanning cream.</li>
            <li> This is the most natural looking cover-up I have ever used. The formula is very thick, however, and you must work quickly to blend it in. It blends best on moisturized skin, and using my hands instead of the sponge provided.</li>
            <li> Okay I have tried everything and I have blue and red spider veins and overall not perfect 49 year old legs.....&lt;br /&gt;Mix with a tiny bit of lotion (optional) and cover every area that you have flaws.  Apply a little at a time and rub it in, don&#x27;t forget the backs of your legs ladies!! I bought Medium color first and its a bit too fair for summer so I bought the TAN also, and I LOVE IT!  Stays on all day, does not easily transfer.  I used a bit of bronzing powder mixed with baby powder and dusted my legs with a big makeup brush after application because it can be a bit tacky.  No pantyhose for me this summer!! I wore it all day outside in the heat with shorts and it did not come off at all.  Washes off with soap and water. Ladies at work think I have perfect legs!!&lt;br /&gt;My advice: Buy it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Joan Rivers, you ROCK!!!</li>
