            <li>This is my favorite Parfum spray of all time.  </li>
            <li>I love it and try not to ever be without it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all alcohol now, and barely a trace of this incredible perfume&#x27;s scent can be noticed.</li>
            <li>But as long as I can own it, i don&#x27;t mind!!! ^____^</li>
            <li>The fragrance did not seem as strong as the gift I received, but I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Wow, great scent.</li>
            <li>I get plenty of compliments when wearing this fragrance so glad to see it available will be ordering it again</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift and it seemed like a good price for an otherwise high priced cologne!</li>
            <li>Enjoy the smell of this Parfum  was a gift and</li>
            <li>I am grateful Amazon still makes it available.</li>
            <li>so she was really excited to receive this.</li>
            <li>Has the original scent once sprayed but wears off after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It made her Christmas special.</li>
            <li>Ordered this along with some more items and it was shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>the cost per oz. was better and the portability (purse size) made the smaller size a better deal.</li>
            <li>I feel so lucky that I still can purchase from Amazon even though I have to have someone bring it to me in Thailand.</li>
            <li>YES - I will definitely be purchasing more it !</li>
            <li>I believe you will enjoy the lovely scent especially put together with the lotion.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is powerful, almost overbearing.</li>
            <li>Just the demographic sean john intended no less I am sure</li>
            <li>Right now it is the only&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>So I knew that my woman was not finna feeel this, and I was right....</li>
            <li>Something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>Must be the right mix for me.</li>
            <li>I fit into the older woman description and have nothing but&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this brand disappeared from the local market so fast, but I&#x27;m glad that it still available from reliable sellers at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>A USED OPENED PKG IN THE FIRST PLACE</li>
            <li>Its exactly what you would find at any department store.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and not a knock-off.</li>
            <li>Its also a reasonable price for size.</li>
            <li>One spray is much too much.</li>
            <li>The scent was soft, smooth, light, slightly &amp;#34;woodsy,&amp;#34; and sensual.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not available in Thailand any more.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE NEW IN BOX.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong and heavy enough&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had a hard time finding it elsewhere, but the scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li>But clearly these bottles were manufactured a while ago and the line has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is so soft and sensual.  </li>
            <li>She says, \\&quot;It&#x27;s too harsh\\&quot;, I say, \\&quot;It&#x27;s too old ladyish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for the classy working woman.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more subtle scent.</li>
            <li>It appeared watered down and the smell isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>if I smelled this on some broad on the street I would be like.....</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this lovely scent!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Long lasting and magnificant scent.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume however this had to be a fake!</li>
            <li> It is impossible to locate inretail stores, so I am glad I found my source.</li>
            <li> DUE</li>
            <li> but I guess it was due to storm in the east coast .</li>
            <li> The product is watered down.</li>
            <li> hands down no question</li>
            <li> I chose this fragrance because I received a gift previously.</li>
            <li> I didnt kno the bottle was so small i would have never paid 20.00 for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> This is a cologne to wear everyday and the scent is never overpowering or cloying.</li>
            <li> It is one of the very few perfumes that I have that</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find one that blends well with the oils in your skin.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> delivery was late</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED, ESPECIALLY  WHEN I READ THAT I CANNOT RETURN IT</li>
            <li> To bad it can&#x27;t be watered down.</li>
            <li> It has become difficult to find.</li>
            <li> and she was afraid to run out because it&#x27;s discontinued</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think the perfume was old...very yellow in color. I know its a risk as they dont make it anymore, but it doesnt smell like it should....:(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this brand disappeared from the local market so fast, but I&#x27;m glad that it still available from reliable sellers at Amazon.com. This is the real deal and not a knock-off. Price was great too! If this is the fragrance your lady likes, I would recommend this 1.0 oz. parfum spray size of Sean John&#x27;s Unforgivable Woman. I would have purchased the 4.0 oz. size, but the cost per oz. was better and the portability (purse size) made the smaller size a better deal. Also, my wife was astonished when she opened the gift wrapped box on Christmas Eve, as she thought that the perfume was discontinued and unavailable. It made her Christmas special.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is so soft and sensual.  I am always asked what I&#x27;m wearing, and where do I purchase it from.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my mom, she loves it, very pleased. Its also a reasonable price for size. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It is one of the very few perfumes that I have that I can&lt;br /&gt;wear with anything.  It isn&#x27;t too strong and heavy enough&lt;br /&gt;so I get compliments all the time.  Right now it is the only&lt;br /&gt;one I am wearing and I love it.  Wish it were back on the&lt;br /&gt;shelves in the stores have sell perfumes or parfumes.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed by Puff Daddy and I am King that I got Unforgivable for my partner. Oh what the hell happened? I took a whiff and was like...if I smelled this on some broad on the street I would be like.....No! So I knew that my woman was not finna feeel this, and I was right....She says, \\&quot;It&#x27;s too harsh\\&quot;, I say, \\&quot;It&#x27;s too old ladyish\\&quot;. Wouldn&#x27;t make me wanna hit that. Or even be around a woman condoning this aroma...On to the next one..</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product and wore it for years. But clearly these bottles were manufactured a while ago and the line has been discontinued. It&#x27;s all alcohol now, and barely a trace of this incredible perfume&#x27;s scent can be noticed. Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> this was the perfect gift for my girlfriend. this is her favorite scent and she was afraid to run out because it&#x27;s discontinued so she was really excited to receive this.</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful it makes me feel like I am rich and unforgettable smells like the 50&#x27;s when perfumes were romantic an  not over powering it speaks for it&#x27;self&lt;br /&gt; p.diddy hit this one out the park wonderful!!!!!  you will not regret  this purchase</li>
            <li> Enjoy the smell of this Parfum  was a gift and the person who received it loved it  so I know I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for a lady!! Yay</li>
            <li> love it, i get compliments all the time, i hope they never discontinue it. it&#x27;s hard to find one that blends well with the oils in your skin.</li>
            <li> I chose this fragrance because I received a gift previously. The fragrance did not seem as strong as the gift I received, but I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It appeared watered down and the smell isn&#x27;t right. It also doesn&#x27;t last. Has the original scent once sprayed but wears off after about 20 minutes. Something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> Luv this and it is a great price. Speedy delivery also.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! The product is watered down. You can&#x27;t even get a hint of fragrance 5 minutes after you put it on. .</li>
            <li> I do really love this perfume. Long lasting and magnificant scent. Unfortunately it is not available in Thailand any more. I feel so lucky that I still can purchase from Amazon even though I have to have someone bring it to me in Thailand. But as long as I can own it, i don&#x27;t mind!!! ^____^</li>
            <li> perfect scent for my 63 yo mother in law. Just the demographic sean john intended no less I am sure</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE NEW IN BOX.  THERE WAS NO WRAPPER ON BOX AND BOX WAS STAINED, MAKES ME WONDER ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE ITEM.  DISAPPOINTED, ESPECIALLY  WHEN I READ THAT I CANNOT RETURN IT DUE TO IT BEING A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL.  IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN WHY WAS IT SENT TO ME AS A USED OPENED PKG IN THE FIRST PLACE</li>
            <li> I purchased Unforgivable because I happened on a sample in retail catalog.  The scent was soft, smooth, light, slightly &amp;#34;woodsy,&amp;#34; and sensual.  I received many compliments while wearing it.  Consequently, when I ran out, I purchased another one.  In addition, I purchased it for a friend for her birthday and she loves it!!!!  Unforgivable for women by Sean John is an excellent parfum spray, and I would recommend it for women who enjoy wearing beautiful scents for any occasion.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this lovely scent!</li>
            <li> I love the perfume however this had to be a fake!</li>
            <li> I didnt kno the bottle was so small i would have never paid 20.00 for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know it was discontinued but I&#x27;m glad I could still find it will buy it again hands down no question</li>
            <li> Love this product - no problem with order.</li>
            <li> I have loved this light spray since it was introduced some years ago. It is impossible to locate inretail stores, so I am glad I found my source. This is a cologne to wear everyday and the scent is never overpowering or cloying.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SCENT OF THIS PERFUME IT IS NOT OVERPOWERING.</li>
            <li> This is really the best perfume...</li>
            <li> Wow, great scent. I fit into the older woman description and have nothing but&lt;br /&gt;compliments on the scent. Must be the right mix for me. I&#x27;m loving it!!!</li>
            <li> Its exactly what you would find at any department store. Only deference is the price.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I just wish it was easier to get.  I keep hearing that he has discontinued it and can&#x27;t understand why!  Every time I wear it, somebody asks me what scent it is.  So, I have to keep surfing the net to try and find someplace that still has it.  It has made the quantity so scarce and the price is sky rocketing.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle of cologne for the price!  I bought this as a Christmas gift and it seemed like a good price for an otherwise high priced cologne!</li>
            <li> Ordered this along with some more items and it was shipped really fast. I&#x27;ve always liked this scent and the price was really great so I ordered two.</li>
            <li> She loves it , Great fragrance priced right .&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was late but I guess it was due to storm in the east coast .</li>
            <li> I get plenty of compliments when wearing this fragrance so glad to see it available will be ordering it again</li>
            <li> This scent lingers and the body lotion is great too and every time I wear it my husband of thirty years tells me I smell good what&#x27;s the scent and then smiles and knows it is the sean john scent.  Anyway I would definitely recommend this - I believe you will enjoy the lovely scent especially put together with the lotion.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite women&#x27;s perfume. It has become difficult to find. I am grateful Amazon still makes it available.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for Co worker</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, 100% recomendado, llegó todo a tiempo, Nice Job Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent! If you know this fragrance, you get it ! YES - I will definitely be purchasing more it !</li>
            <li> Purchased this for the girlfriend.  Had a hard time finding it elsewhere, but the scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the smell it lasts all day and is not overpowering. I recommend this for the classy working woman.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Parfum spray of all time.  I love it and try not to ever be without it and that&#x27;s a fact!  The price is awesome and for that reason, I will always purchase this fragrance from Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is powerful, almost overbearing. I prefer a more subtle scent. One spray is much too much. To bad it can&#x27;t be watered down. Phew!</li>
