            <li> They only real problem I had with this kit is the hairspray. It turned out to be medium hold, which is good, but it isn&#x27;t the non-sticky &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; hold product I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Love my products at home but I can&#x27;t always stuff the bigger products in my travel cases! This way I have everything I need on the go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great set. So good that even for the fine hair hairspray isn&#x27;t necessary. If I could, I&#x27;d replace it with extra hair body conditioner or foam. Or - nothing. Anyway: almost five stars.</li>
            <li> Great for travel. It&#x27;s a staple in my overnight bag.</li>
            <li> The travel bottles of Moroccanoil are smaller than the 3.2 or 3.5 TSA size so I was able to put more items in my 1 ltr travle bag when flying out for a week.  I only carried on so I needed to also fit sunblock and after sun lotion into the 1 ltr bag amongst a few other items.  Great size!</li>
            <li> Perfect for weekend getaways.  Love the shampoo and conditioner, leaves my hair fresh smelling and silky.  Travel bag is great.</li>
            <li> Good hair products, especially the Morocccanoil itself and convenient  travel case.  All the bottles are refillable except the hairspray so they can be re-used.</li>
            <li> I love this products. It does wonders to my Virgin hair and it smells super clean and fresh. The hair is so soft and shiny after use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel or just even small size for the cabinet. Love the smell. The spray is great for in my purse as well.</li>
            <li> It´s arrived on time. It´s so cute this travel kit. It was more than I expected. I really loved the Moroccanoil Travel Kit!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and excellent travel kit.</li>
            <li> I love this product so I was very happy to see all my products in a travel size.  Loved it so much I bought 3.  Arrived 2 days early which I was very happy about. Came just in time for my trip.</li>
            <li> Very handy for traveling !</li>
            <li> Love the oil but everything else was just okay so not worth the money to me. Will keep buying the oil though--lightly scented, thicker than argan oil and help dry hair quicker when blow drying</li>
            <li> Love all the Moroccanoil products I&#x27;ve tried!  The scent is heavenly and my hair is shiny, manageable, and stopped breaking.  I don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often.  This kit was expensive, but love the travel size bottles I can refill and take with me everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> my wife loves moroccanoil</li>
            <li> Seriously the perfect travel kit with everything you need! I plan on buying more in the future since I travel often. This way I can bring all my favorite hair products in one bag.</li>
            <li> I love the products!!!  Best ever. I was introduced to the product several months ago.  Great for travel.  I rated a 3 as the travel size hair spray stopped working after about 1/2 the product was used, in spite of trying everything with the nozzle, (washing, checking opening, etc), it refused to spray again.</li>
            <li> Love the Moraccan Oil. It&#x27;s so great to have the travel size now too!! This stuff smells just amazing and works so well.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner.  Packaged very well. ALL BRAND NEW in NEW PACKAGING.  Nothing expired.  Will buy from this seller again.  If you haven&#x27;t tried Moroccanoil, you are missing out!  In my humble opinion, as I have tried most every other brand of comparable products, MOROCCANOIL IS THE BEST!  No comparison.  Plus, the scent is awesome.  Worth the money.  If you give it a try, I believe that you will like it.</li>
            <li> I consider myself quite a critical person, and haven&#x27;t found much satisfaction in the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. Yet Moroccanoil is now my favorite. Though the bottles are small and the price is quite expensive, but if you are planning on going to a romantic vacation, this is the toiletries you should travel with, because the fragrance and the effect simply do magic to your hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this and it sat in my closet for a year. Pulled it out to use it and the hairspray did not work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Everything went as advertised on schedule. Great!</li>
            <li> This travel kit was on time.  I had to go on travel after I received it and the only problems for travel is that one of the bottles is glass and that is always a problem when it is in my travel bag.  The product came highly recommended by my stylist.</li>
            <li> Years ago I started to use &amp;#34;Morrocon Oil&amp;#34; on my hair. It makes it so shiny &amp; manageable. I admit, I tried an &#x27;imitation&#x27; brand last year &amp; it just was NOT as good!!. Now I also LOVE the shampoo &amp; conditioner that came in this travel kit!! Glad I found this on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Wanted to try but didn&#x27;t want to purchased a large container, now is use all the time it is an excellent product and it came fast, I am very happy</li>
            <li> My wife loves this line of products</li>
            <li> This is a great product and this package works very well when traveling.</li>
            <li> Love it Thanks, perfect for traveling and hair care, I undersatand the bag, couse i change it and my spay had an accidnt it doenst work any more, and its new</li>
            <li> Love moroccanoil products, it&#x27;s nice to have the small products for carry on bags.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccan oil and this travel kit was perfect to travel with. I went away for a week and it was more than enough.</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to Moroccanoil products so I ordered from Amazon for the best price online. Plus - this arrived within the date specified by the seller. All in all a great purchase, a great product, and I will be back!</li>
            <li> purchased for the mini size hairspray! Great products but  wish you didn&#x27;t have to buy in a kit and could purchase just the hairspray. Fast ship quality product</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products in the past and they just don&#x27;t work on my hair .This one I love it and tell everyone about it .I would highly recommend this product.</li>
