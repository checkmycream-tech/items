            <li> A little bit larger than the ones I&#x27;ve gotten before</li>

            <li> Missing 15 caps!</li>
            <li> Too bad I can only use 10 of the 25 bottles.</li>
            <li> They are horrible, the inserts that make the drops come out are very dificult to pull out so you cannot refill them, if you use a pliar the plastic breaks off in your hand</li>

            <li> Ok, so here it is, my review... Great bottle and as described. I guess I did not see they were empty bottles, I thought they were samples of Young Living oils. Not an issue, will use the for my Doterra oils to blend assorted scents.</li>
            <li> These little bottles are great for sending a sample or keeping in your purse or pocket for use during the day.</li>
            <li> i loved them - they are perfect for what I need.  just right for sample giving.  Additionally I use for portion control so I can keep my bottle on the shelf and use the sample bottle at my vanity or my purse!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought I was ordering</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase.  Would buy again.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These are tiny, but a great size for samples. Only trouble is that it&#x27;s hard to get drops out of them and the drops themselves are very very small</li>

            <li> These are the perfect size to sample/share essential oils with friends, family, and anyone else who wants to try them out without making a purchase commitment.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as stated and very nice little bottles, I guess I wasn&#x27;t paying attention when it said 2ml as opposed to 2oz. My mistake so I kept them, I&#x27;m not returning a product when I could have avoided the error by reading lol, but for what they are, as a 2ml these are very nice bottles.</li>
            <li> quite small, almost too small. IT depends what you need them for.  It is hard to transfer oils into such small bottles.</li>
            <li> this is what I needed.</li>
            <li> They are horrible, the inserts that make the drops come out are very dificult to pull out so you cannot refill them, if you use a pliar the plastic breaks off in your hand&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase from the company who sold them but i would not get Young Livungs bottlles again</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles and carry a dozen different essential oils around with me at all times.  This makes for a light load!</li>
            <li> Really handy little bottles for samples</li>
            <li> The package only came with 10 of the 25 caps. Missing 15 caps! Otherwise the bottles have been great. The orifice reducers were easy to insert. The white caps are nice to write on with a fine permanent marker. Too bad I can only use 10 of the 25 bottles. I would give this one star since I can&#x27;t use most of the bottles, but the product is great and if I had received all the caps I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Perfect size! A little bit larger than the ones I&#x27;ve gotten before so I like being able to give bigger samples if needed and just to keep my personal keychain stocked with more! Came fast too with a great price. I will be getting more of these</li>
            <li> These 2ml essential oil sample bottles are perfect for sharing or travel.&lt;br /&gt;I like them because they have the droppers included with the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomended!</li>
            <li> the product was as I expected but it took a bit longer than I thought it would to receive it.</li>
            <li> need them and a great value</li>
            <li> These bottles are perfect for making up oils for my son, who has some physical, mental, and emotional concerns, to take to school to use if needed to calm him and help him continue to participate in class. Did discuss with teacher prior before allowing him to take them and have them for emergency intervention.&lt;br /&gt;Next up...mixing and sending some oils to my daughter in NC and mixing up some oils for pain that a friend has been suffering with the last couple of years. Should complement her acupuncture very nicely.</li>
            <li> Great product;  great price.  Recommend to those that just want to let others sample an oil before purchasing a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> We, as a family, share the fragrances we each purchase.  These make easier than toting the large container.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> great bottles to give samples of oils to family and friends.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely what I was looking for.  Use them for sampling oils in my oil business&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the great service.  Probably gonna order more.</li>
            <li> These sample bottles has helped my business tremendously. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> These are great for mixing small batches of essential oils. I do wish the lids were a bit slimmer.</li>
            <li> These are just what I wanted.  Very good for samples of oils. I would recommend this to those who want to do samples</li>
