            <li>Excellent perfume, I love it.</li>
            <li>Good value and a nice switch from others u might use!</li>
            <li>This is more of a &amp;#34;hug scent&amp;#34; (a pleasant surprise for those already blessed with a hug from you!).  </li>
            <li>Great rose smell.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li>It was a good price.</li>
            <li>And was do glad I did!</li>

            <li>Great price and fairly quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Rose by Paul Smith.</li>
            <li>It is a very mild rose perfume that give you a warm feeling.</li>
            <li>This perfume lacks the powdery smell that most rose perfumes have, and I&#x27;m so glad for that.</li>
            <li>I guess everyone has their interpretation of &amp;#34;rose scented&amp;#34; is suppose to smell like, for me, this perfume&#x27;s rose scent isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>smaller bottle is easier on the hand for application, and perfect for someone exploring to find their signature.  </li>
            <li>Nice light scent.</li>
            <li>Just lovely.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it and get compliments from the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Both me and hubbie love it.</li>
            <li>It was a much better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s now one of my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>packaged and elegant.</li>
            <li>And I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Lovely and flowery, sweet.  Still love it!</li>
            <li>I like the smell the fresh cut rose.</li>
            <li>But this is very light and with lovely fresh floral scent that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The perfume is light and elegant, not the pungent and sickly sweet that many &amp;#34;English Rose&amp;#34; scented sprays boast.  </li>
            <li>This was a great purchase especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful rose scent that is not too heavy or intense.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I received this today, and tried it on immediately, because I love Paul Smith&#x27;s florals..</li>
            <li>My new Favorite!</li>
            <li>I purchased a smaller bottle of Paul Smith Rose perfume in 2011 and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Nice, soft scent...</li>
            <li>its like smelling a natural rose all the time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
            <li>I gained many compliments wearing it and it lasts for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>It does not linger strongly, so if you are looking for a bold rose scent that has a wide radius, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>It smells just like fresh cut roses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If your wife want a perfume that smells like fresh cut roses.....</li>
            <li>I would recommend this perfume to anyone who loves rose perfumes, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>If you like the fragrance of roses then this perfume will be right for you.</li>
            <li>It is all about the smell...and this is just right.</li>
            <li>Pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and is the exact product.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the most affordable quality perfumes I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>if u love roses, ill love this perfume!</li>
            <li>So, you need to chose the seller more carefully.</li>
            <li>Not quite as much staying power as I&#x27;d like but still my all time fav.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very elegant, feminine and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The pure rose smell is delicate, but not faint.</li>
            <li>I used it sparingly, worried that I would not be able to find it again, but was delighted to find it on Amazon, and a larger bottle for the same price that I paid for the small bottle while abroad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the same over five times, and I am familiar with the perfume&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish is that it would last a little bit longer would love if it were more concentrated</li>
            <li>Similar to Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s English Rose, but more complex.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have bought this perfume for my mother-in-law on several occasions and she absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive nose, most EDP really bothers me and makes me feel nauseated.</li>
            <li>Scent lasts all day long and you don&#x27;t need that much.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s undermining the vague rose scent that is there.</li>
            <li>The larger bottle is for the confident... and for those of us who are fearful that we won&#x27;t be able to find it in the future.</li>

            <li> It smells just like fresh cut roses.&lt;br /&gt;I love this and I wear this every day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************************&lt;br /&gt;Just to let people know...&lt;br /&gt;As it says under my name, I wrote this review for \\&quot; Paul Smith Rose\\&quot;, instead of \\&quot;Paul Smith for Women\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;They are 2 different products. I have no idea why Amazon is putting those 2 together.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, I love it. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased a smaller bottle of Paul Smith Rose perfume in 2011 and fell in love.

This is more of a &amp;#34;hug scent&amp;#34; (a pleasant surprise for those already blessed with a hug from you!).  In that way, it does linger throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller bottle is easier on the hand for application, and perfect for someone exploring to find their signature.

            <li> Best rose floral fragrance ever! Similar to Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s English Rose, but more complex. Very elegant, feminine and long lasting. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> My signature scent...originally purchased at Selfridge&#x27;s, London.  Great price and fairly quick delivery.  Scent lasts all day long and you don&#x27;t need that much.  Lovely and flowery, sweet.  Still love it!</li>
            <li> i dont have it is a real Paul Smith Rosa because the smell is different and weird. I bought the same over five times, and I am familiar with the perfume&#x27;s smell. So, you need to chose the seller more carefully.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wonderfully packaged. Excellent arrival.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase especially considering the price. This perfume has definitely made it way to the number 1 used perfume in my collection. This is a wonderful rose scent that is not too heavy or intense. The only thing I wish is that it would last a little bit longer would love if it were more concentrated but besides that very very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of complements on this perfume.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent. Pretty packaging. Hope to get lots of compliments. I use parfum daily, and like a parfum that is not real heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>

            <li> I guess everyone has their interpretation of &amp;#34;rose scented&amp;#34; is suppose to smell like, for me, this perfume&#x27;s rose scent isn&#x27;t that strong. But some other scent is. I can&#x27;t place the scent but it&#x27;s pretty strong and it&#x27;s undermining the vague rose scent that is there.</li>
            <li> Love this product and do sad is discontinued</li>
            <li> I bought this based on people&#x27;s reviews only. I was pleasantly surprised. It does smell like roses and I like it a lot.</li>

Presaging the spring, this is a timeless and absolutely feminine rose EDP, smelling absolutely delicious on my skin! And it was cheaper on Amazon than on other sites.

            <li> Both me and hubbie love it. Very elegant and feminine rose fragrance. Just got it in mail today. 100 ml for 37 is a steal.</li>
            <li> I saw this perfume while visiting my family in England. It was a much better price on Amazon. I love the fragrance and I wear it in the daytime for work.If you like the fragrance of roses then this perfume will be right for you. I would purchase this again and especially if it is fulfilled by Amazon as I find them to be trustworthy source for fragrance.</li>

            <li> This perfume lacks the powdery smell that most rose perfumes have, and I&#x27;m so glad for that. The pure rose smell is delicate, but not faint. I would recommend this perfume to anyone who loves rose perfumes, especially for the price. This is definitely one of the most affordable quality perfumes I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
