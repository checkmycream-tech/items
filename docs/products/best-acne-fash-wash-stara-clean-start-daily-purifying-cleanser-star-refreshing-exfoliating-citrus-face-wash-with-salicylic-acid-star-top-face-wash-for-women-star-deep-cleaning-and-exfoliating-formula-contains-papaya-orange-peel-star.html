            <li>I must say, it also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>am seriously loving this face wash, I may never used anything else.</li>
            <li>A Clean Start works great and my complexion has a glow.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but this product is perfect for all skin types!</li>
            <li>I can very comfortably recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>The smell is invigorating, compared to the medicinal smell of most purifying cleansers.</li>
            <li>now I just need to make sure she doesn&#x27;t try to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This may be my favorite product from this skin care line.</li>
            <li>Love what it has done for my face and to the men out there - get your act in gear and start using products like this.  </li>
            <li>face wash almost has an effervescence to it when using it which I love.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not abrasive or drying like many face cleaners out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using it and my skin looks and feels better already.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that this is paraben free!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the best results once bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li>And the greatest thing is that it&#x27;s very affordable, taking in consideration the natural ingredients used to create this face cleanser.</li>
            <li>This product is quickly turning into one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>It lathers well, leaves me feeling refreshed and awake, and I got quick results!</li>
            <li>This cleanser accomplished everything I needed and more!  </li>
            <li>My skin is clearing up and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>It works very well, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture, and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the 2nd skincare product that I have ordered from Bella Yasa and again I am both pleased and delighted with the results.  </li>
            <li>First off I cannot tell you how much I love this face wash; I am converted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin feeling clean</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lathers nicely and makes your face feel clean, but it has caused me to break out worse than before, but my sister loves it and is probably going to purchase her own bottle!</li>
            <li>my skin feels fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this, just over a month, my skin has cleared up tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It has a surprisingly fresh smell (not perfume-y) and the salicylic acid</li>
            <li>It was worth it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft, smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>My skin glows and looks healthier more and more everyday.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin that wants an effective face wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel type cleanser that is not only great for cleansing one&#x27;s face of impurities and makeup, but is one of the few that actually smells good.</li>
            <li>The first use of Clean Start Daily Purifying Cleanser was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>smells like oranges and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t really help with acne!</li>
            <li>Provided deep cleansing and exfoliation without drying my skin and causing even more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean without stripping it of natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Effective enough to rid my face of acne, but gentle for my sensitive</li>
            <li>You will notice a new glow right after the first time you wash your face with it...</li>
            <li>It depends on the person, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I am very acne prone and this product is helpful.</li>
            <li>I feel like you can really tell it&#x27;s getting in there and cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li>think people should know that the cleanser really purged my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried other acne wash products and they didn&#x27;t clear up my skin and make it feel and look as nice as this wash.</li>
            <li>A true daily purifying cleanser that works gently on your face skin.</li>
            <li>Such a plus as I am super picky with what I put on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for combination or oily skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 2.5 weeks everyday, and my skin feels super soft, seems much more balanced, and is finally clearing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few time with full make up on and it all came right off; there was no need for make up remover.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a month of use, I am going to post some before/after pictures, so I will update with a new review in a month.</li>
            <li>I broke out a little more in other areas but it quickly cleared up.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin; I have since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and am prone to break outs.  </li>
            <li>I use this product every morning and night and it leaves my skin feeling as soft as a babies bottom!</li>
            <li>I love that it got deep down and cleaned everything out!</li>
            <li>I wanted a cleanser that left my face feeling clean, but didn&#x27;t dry it out or irritate it.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only been a few days,but so far i&#x27;m enjoying.</li>
            <li>No matter how &#x27;gentle&#x27; facial cleansing products said they were, they would ALWAYS cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The orangey appearance and smell is a plus...very natural feeling.</li>
            <li>I love that this is sensitive enough to use everyday, but I can still feel it working on my face.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use everyday yet strong enough to cleanse my skin of all impurities.</li>
            <li>My 24 year old daughter and I both purchased the daily purifying cleanser for different reasons.</li>
            <li>The only draw back for me is that I can only use it once a week because my skin is very sensitive to salicyclic acid.</li>
            <li>I have never had acne or had major skin problems, I would say I just have the occasional hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser and other skincare products by Bella Yasa, your skin will thank you for it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is quickly turning into one of my favorites! Now face washing doesn&#x27;t seem like a chore anymore. The smell is invigorating, compared to the medicinal smell of most purifying cleansers. Gentle enough to use everyday yet strong enough to cleanse my skin of all impurities. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase more products!!</li>
            <li> My 24 year old daughter and I both purchased the daily purifying cleanser for different reasons. She has acne prone skin and I have sensitive, combination skin. I wanted a cleanser that left my face feeling clean, but didn&#x27;t dry it out or irritate it. I have been using my face wash at night and my daughter uses hers in the morning and at night. I&#x27;m very pleased with the cleanser ... and it smells amazing! My daughter is quite impressed as well... now I just need to make sure she doesn&#x27;t try to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; mine when she runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve been using the same face wash for over 10 years so to take a chance and change was a big deal for me. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and it&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s a gel type cleanser that is not only great for cleansing one&#x27;s face of impurities and makeup, but is one of the few that actually smells good. It leaves my face feeling soft, smooth and clean. It&#x27;s also  feels non greasy and lightweight. The only draw back for me is that I can only use it once a week because my skin is very sensitive to salicyclic acid. However, if my skin wasn&#x27;t sensitive then i would definitely recommend this as an everyday wash.</li>
            <li> This may be my favorite product from this skin care line. I use this product every morning and night and it leaves my skin feeling as soft as a babies bottom! I have very sensitive skin, but this product is perfect for all skin types! I must say, it also smells amazing. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing! smells like oranges and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. other products that i have used/tried in the past leaves my skin feeling rough as if i haven&#x27;t cleaned it in days. it&#x27;s only been a few days,but so far i&#x27;m enjoying.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin; I have since I was a teenager. No matter how &#x27;gentle&#x27; facial cleansing products said they were, they would ALWAYS cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little leery of purchasing this product, because I felt that I would have the same results -- broken out skin. However, I was very wrong! This stuff is amazing! It works very well, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture, and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin that wants an effective face wash.</li>
            <li> It depends on the person, I have very oily skin and it does well with getting rid of excess oil but doesn&#x27;t really help with acne! I love the smell and it lathers nicely and makes your face feel clean, but it has caused me to break out worse than before, but my sister loves it and is probably going to purchase her own bottle! Wish it didn&#x27;t break me out so I could continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love that this is sensitive enough to use everyday, but I can still feel it working on my face. I can also tell that it purges my skin. I am very acne prone and this product is helpful.</li>
            <li> Love what it has done for my face and to the men out there - get your act in gear and start using products like this.  Looking rough for the women just don&#x27;t cut it anymore</li>
            <li> First off I cannot tell you how much I love this face wash; I am converted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and am prone to break outs.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this, just over a month, my skin has cleared up tremendously.  It has even cleared out some deep blackheads that I&#x27;ve had for years.  It has greatly reduced my breakouts too.  My skin has never looked or felt this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash almost has an effervescence to it when using it which I love.  I feel like you can really tell it&#x27;s getting in there and cleaning your skin. I&#x27;ve used it a few time with full make up on and it all came right off; there was no need for make up remover. The face wash has a great scent and leaves you skin feeling baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you try this one out!</li>
            <li> Recently I had started having breakouts and wanted to start a skin regimen that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Did not clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Provided deep cleansing and exfoliation without drying my skin and causing even more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Effective enough to rid my face of acne, but gentle for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd skincare product that I have ordered from Bella Yasa and again I am both pleased and delighted with the results.  The first use of Clean Start Daily Purifying Cleanser was fabulous.  The cleanser felt like silk gliding on my face and I could actually feel it working. This cleanser accomplished everything I needed and more!  It&#x27;s paraben and oil-free, so my skin feels fresh and clean.  My skin glows and looks healthier more and more everyday.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this great skin in a bottle!  I highly recommend this cleanser and other skincare products by Bella Yasa, your skin will thank you for it!</li>
            <li> Every day I use this cleanser twice a day. I have combination skin. It helps keep my skin feeling clean and I don’t see any only residue. Some deep cleansing facial washes tend to make my skin dry. A Clean Start works great and my complexion has a glow. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> A true daily purifying cleanser that works gently on your face skin. It&#x27;s not abrasive or drying like many face cleaners out there. You will notice a new glow right after the first time you wash your face with it... And the greatest thing is that it&#x27;s very affordable, taking in consideration the natural ingredients used to create this face cleanser. I can very comfortably recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love It!  Used it today and my face feels so refreshed.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the best results once bottle is empty.  Thank you again!</li>
            <li> What an amazing product! I&#x27;ve just started using it and my skin looks and feels better already. The few pimples I had are now shrinking and I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for me in weeks to come. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> After my pregnancy, my skin totally freaked out. I was in need of a total skin regimen make-over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously loving this face wash, I may never used anything else. It has a surprisingly fresh smell (not perfume-y) and the salicylic acid definitely is helping to tame my breakouts. I LOVE that this is paraben free! Such a plus as I am super picky with what I put on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 2.5 weeks everyday, and my skin feels super soft, seems much more balanced, and is finally clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use, I am going to post some before/after pictures, so I will update with a new review in a month.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome gift! This cleanser seriously rocks! I have never had acne or had major skin problems, I would say I just have the occasional hormonal breakouts. My forehead is constantly congested and I noticed a dramatic difference after using this cleanser. It is such a relief, I don&#x27;t have to style my bangs to hide the embarrassing blemishes on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think people should know that the cleanser really purged my skin. I broke out a little more in other areas but it quickly cleared up. Don&#x27;t let it scare you or detour you. It was worth it. I love that it got deep down and cleaned everything out! Love!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Leaves skin clean without stripping it of natural oils.  Highly recommend for combination or oily skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this face wash when my skin was changing and breaking out from pregnancy hormones. My skin is clearing up and feels so smooth. I have tried other acne wash products and they didn&#x27;t clear up my skin and make it feel and look as nice as this wash. I will be buying and using this for now on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this light-weight gel cleanser! It lathers well, leaves me feeling refreshed and awake, and I got quick results! The orangey appearance and smell is a plus...very natural feeling. I still have acne-proned skin at 24 y/o and this cleanser has worked great for me!</li>
