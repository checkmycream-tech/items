            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great relief from both and helps aching orbital bones</li>

            <li>I am very happy with this product I have used it for 4 or more years the service is great here</li>
            <li>The price is good too.  </li>

            <li>Good price on this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for another hundred miles--</li>
            <li>good product, nice way to receive it.</li>
            <li>but it is not uncomfortable at all, feels great!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this anymore in drug stores, and I use it not just for eyes, but for a nice mister for my face.</li>
            <li>I tried it, I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The spray is more convenient than eyedrops.</li>
            <li>better than the ones over the counter...  </li>
            <li>I love the way this product helps  keep my eyes comfortable!  </li>

            <li>most of the bottle misted defectively and sent a jet of water into your eyes instead of  spray</li>
            <li>and it really does work great</li>
            <li>I have used Natures Tears EyeMist for many years.  </li>

            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how many time this has helped me dislodge something</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>My eyes feel better, look better (no redness)</li>
            <li>Love the product because I do not like putting drops in my eyes, just a mist spray does it for me.</li>
            <li>When you mist, it also helps your face.:)</li>
            <li>This mist is handy to help you feel clean and refreshed at any time during your day.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for dry eyes...</li>
            <li>Quick and effective way to moisturize your eyes and eyelid area.</li>
            <li>I rotate between Natures Tears and my own fine mist spray bottle (available on Amazon) filled with distilled water.  </li>
            <li>and I also spray these in my old dogs&#x27; eyes and it seems to have greatly relieved their problems with eye discharge.</li>
            <li>where else thanks for a good site</li>
            <li>This product delivers maximum relief and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super Product!  </li>
            <li>This product is just what I needed, and it is chemical free.</li>
            <li>but this eye mist is great, especially on flights.</li>
            <li>This product I find very useful for spraying into my eyes as well as cleaning them.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and a quick refresher to the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I do not think that those with severe dry eye would find a great benefit from this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad Amazon carries it because it&#x27;s no longer available where I live.      </li>
            <li>This comes in handy in so many ways if you have dry eyes.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>A quick spray</li>
            <li>These little canisters fit in my purse, a pocket, or in the top drawer of my desk, and provide an immediate, cool, refreshing spritz of micro-fine, preservative-free moisture to my eyes...and face....which is also lovely when I feel a hot flash coming on.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this natural and easy solution for my chronic problem!</li>
            <li>Natures Tears EyeMist is by far the most effective and least invasive eye moisturizer that I have ever tried and believe me I have tried just about every kind of drops and sprays around.</li>
            <li>They are even useful for flushing out the bothersome gnats that are prevalent and can get in your eyes while doing yard-work.  </li>
            <li>Now they are a rare find.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>Today, I ordered two more cases just to be safe--you never know how long a good thing will last.  </li>
            <li>Soothes dry eyes better than any eye drops I&#x27;ve found!  </li>
            <li>I have used another product, which is also excellent, but this one is as good and is less expensive.</li>
            <li>so most likely will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li>The spray is is much easier to use and surrounding eye tissue gets a moisture lift too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THE most refreshing solution to my dry, itchy, puffy, red eyes.</li>
            <li>I use a shot before going to the movies to ensure I have the best possible vision, I have a sprayer next to my bed for when my eyes dry at night.  </li>
            <li>Previous bottles: easy to press to get a light mist.</li>
            <li>Getting up to wash my hands and put drops in my eyes isn&#x27;t always easy, especially at work.</li>
            <li>The EyeMist is easy to use and gives instant relief for my burning and itching eyes.  </li>
            <li>I think this product would be best for those who have trouble with eyelids and mild to moderate dry eye.</li>
            <li>No irritation and the spray really soothes dry eyes- better than drops for me.  </li>
            <li>Some work well,others are either too misty or a straight stream, (which can hurt your eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Try it, it really helps.</li>
            <li>Much safer to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dry and easily irritated eyes all my life.</li>
            <li>The order arrived a day early and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The problem is, all the bottles in this latest purchase don&#x27;t operate as easily as previous bottles.</li>
            <li>I have severe dry eye and have tried every over the counter product available.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it provide immediate relief, but it actually makes my eyes feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, I found several suppliers, but decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>It is a very useful complement to your dry eye treatment routine.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>You can quickly spray this light mist across your open eyes as frequently as you wish and avoid dry eye symptoms while working at the computer or throughout your day.</li>
            <li>The mist is natural, refreshing and highly effective for the tired, dry eyes.</li>
            <li>approx 10 - 12&amp;#34; away from your face and press the button to provide a spray while you are moving the can at that distance from left to right or right to left whichever you prefer.  </li>
            <li>Cant live without this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out these.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are also very sensitive to chemicals in some soaps, make-up, creams and cleaning products.</li>
            <li>I ordered them for years direct from the factory, but the price was high and did not include shipping (unless you ordered lots which I sometimes did).  </li>
            <li>I just now received the manufacturer&#x27;s response, and am grateful that the bottle will be adjusted, that will bring this product back to five stars, thanks!</li>
            <li>I suffer with dry eyes and find the mist a wonderfully refreshing and moisturizing alternative to my dry eyes eye drops.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry eyes due to allergies, and nothing gives me relief better than this</li>
            <li>travel quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>at work and nearly every room of my home.</li>
            <li>If is not messy.  </li>
            <li>(It sounds like I&#x27;ve been partying but no - allergies and old age-</li>
            <li>This is a godsend for someone like me who has extremely sensitive eyes and cannot do eyedrops.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for maybe 7-8 years my last order the nozzles on half of them did not work, kind of not a fine mist but a straight spray, not sure if these are real from the original factory or not.</li>
            <li>Had tried many other dry-eye relief products with not much relief.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry eyes and use this spray several times a night.</li>
            <li>The bottle only lasted a few sprays, so I suspect the mfg put in a lot less in each bottle to make it seem like we are getting a good deal.</li>
            <li>This is nice and refreshing, once you get used to the concept of keeping your eyes open while intentionally spraying water in them, but the claim that it won&#x27;t disturb makeup is laughable - i&#x27;m following the instructions to the letter and still end up with water running down my face.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have sand in my eyes all the time, but using this, it feels like my eyes really calm down</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and find it really helps with my dry eye condition.  </li>
            <li>but it is soothing in the middle of the night or on a hot, dry hike!</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it for people who have dry eyes or because of any paralyzing of the face.  </li>
            <li>These bottles: hard to press down, spray that finally comes is more forceful, i finally figured out</li>

            <li> Airplanes, trains, or the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of eye drops for dry eye.</li>

            <li> I HAVE DRY EYES AND THE MIST FROM THIS SPRAY</li>
            <li> My eyes get so dry and drops don&#x27;t always work</li>
            <li> Airplanes are SOOOO DRY.</li>
            <li> The cost definitely beats the cost that I have been paying for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> It has been a tremendous help with my dry eye problem even though it is quite expensive</li>

            <li> (And besides, I&#x27;m such a believer I routinely give out cans to friends and strangers when I see them struggling with typical eye drops.)</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of moistening the eyes in middle of night without having to deal with landing drops on the eye and not all over the face, but the &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; package purchased this last time is a total rip-off.</li>
            <li> No more holding open my eye to drag gel across it and then being fuzzy vision for an hour.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using water to lubricate my eyes, but I have been using this product for three weeks for my chronic dry eyes and this eye mist really works.</li>
            <li> Natures Tears is just plain old high quality water that works on reducing dry eyes without the use of artificial chemicals.  </li>
            <li> My doctor prescribed Restasis but it is too expensive and I was told I won&#x27;t see results for the first 3 months.  </li>

            <li> This non-toxic mist hydrates the eye w/o all the chemicals found in other lubricating eye drops...  </li>
            <li> This also doesn&#x27;t leave that icky white residue that sits on my eyelashes when I use other drops.  </li>
            <li> and the redness goes down a lot!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a few months</li>
            <li> ( I have Graves disease) for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This product is the &amp;#34;only game in town&amp;#34; for dry eye AND contact lens wearers!  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think this product would be best for those who have trouble with eyelids and mild to moderate dry eye. I do not think that those with severe dry eye would find a great benefit from this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also kinda weird to spray yourself in the eyes but it is not uncomfortable at all, feels great!</li>
            <li> This comes in handy in so many ways if you have dry eyes. Remember it does not replace eyedrops but works with them.(I thank you for making the actual amount clearer!!!)</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Rohto Dry Eye which I can only use four times a day. This is the only combination of dry eye treatment that actually works without blurring my vision and I&#x27;ve tried everything: Systane, Refresh, Blink, Freshkote, etc.  This also doesn&#x27;t leave that icky white residue that sits on my eyelashes when I use other drops.  I&#x27;ve been using these for about four months now and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The very last box of 12 had only one can.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Love it</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of tear replacement products, but these are the best.  Within a minute of using these, my eyes feel relief.  I use them about 3-4 times a day and I also spray these in my old dogs&#x27; eyes and it seems to have greatly relieved their problems with eye discharge.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of eye drops for dry eye. Helpful for short periods. Convenient to carry and has no preservative.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is with the spray nozzles.They need to step up their quality control.Some work well,others are either too misty or a straight stream, (which can hurt your eyes.</li>
            <li> The spray is more convenient than eyedrops.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I highly recommend this product.  It has been a tremendous help with my dry eye problem even though it is quite expensive and I can&#x27;t obtain it locally.  Personally, I would hope one day they can either carry locally or have bigger size of the product.[[ASIN:B004HGM3KI Natures Tears EyeMist Twin Case (Pack of 12 bottles)]]</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry eyes... better than the ones over the counter...  please do NOT increase the price... and keep the quality of the bottles...  thank you.  excellent product.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of moistening the eyes in middle of night without having to deal with landing drops on the eye and not all over the face, but the &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; package purchased this last time is a total rip-off. The bottle only lasted a few sprays, so I suspect the mfg put in a lot less in each bottle to make it seem like we are getting a good deal. I don&#x27;t like deceptive practices, so most likely will not be buying it again. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product helps  keep my eyes comfortable!  I suffer from dry eyes due to allergies, and nothing gives me relief better than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel quite frequently.  I am able to carry it onboard the plane in my handbag, separately, and in addition to my quart bag of liquid cosmetic items.</li>
            <li> most of the bottle misted defectively and sent a jet of water into your eyes instead of  spray</li>
            <li> Natures Tears EyeMist is by far the most effective and least invasive eye moisturizer that I have ever tried and believe me I have tried just about every kind of drops and sprays around. The mist is natural, refreshing and highly effective for the tired, dry eyes. It is great spray to keep on hand at work to battle computer screen fatigue. This is a must purchase for anyone suffering from dry, itchy, irritated eyes!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product I have used it for 4 or more years the service is great here and I look no where else thanks for a good site</li>
            <li> I always have one of these nearby...at work and nearly every room of my home. I&#x27;ve had dry and easily irritated eyes all my life. My eyes are also very sensitive to chemicals in some soaps, make-up, creams and cleaning products. Getting up to wash my hands and put drops in my eyes isn&#x27;t always easy, especially at work. These little canisters fit in my purse, a pocket, or in the top drawer of my desk, and provide an immediate, cool, refreshing spritz of micro-fine, preservative-free moisture to my eyes...and face....which is also lovely when I feel a hot flash coming on. Another bonus...I like how the spray sets and also refreshes my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;One of the BEST products ever!  One recommendation for use...close your eyes until you feel the spray on your face, then open them to receive the cooling mist. This is easier than trying to keep your eyes open while pressing on the trigger.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and find it really helps with my dry eye condition.  The cost definitely beats the cost that I have been paying for the last few years.  I definitely will recommend this company for future purchases.  Thank you, Richard W. Fisher</li>
            <li> Natures Tears is just plain old high quality water that works on reducing dry eyes without the use of artificial chemicals.  I was skeptical about using water to lubricate my eyes, but I have been using this product for three weeks for my chronic dry eyes and this eye mist really works.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  It is easy to use and a quick refresher to the eyes.  I use eye drops in the morning and evening.  If my eyes start to itch or burn I just spray them with the EyeMist.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The price is good too.  If is not messy.  I highly recommended it for people who have dry eyes or because of any paralyzing of the face.  It is also good for a good eye cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for maybe 7-8 years my last order the nozzles on half of them did not work, kind of not a fine mist but a straight spray, not sure if these are real from the original factory or not.</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyes, skin and hair moist.  That is al I asked for it to do and it has succeeded.</li>
            <li> Super Product!  Soothes dry eyes better than any eye drops I&#x27;ve found!  Highly recommend!  I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a few months and it really does work great, I&#x27;ll never use eye drops again!  The spray is is much easier to use and surrounding eye tissue gets a moisture lift too!</li>
            <li> This is nice and refreshing, once you get used to the concept of keeping your eyes open while intentionally spraying water in them, but the claim that it won&#x27;t disturb makeup is laughable - i&#x27;m following the instructions to the letter and still end up with water running down my face.</li>
            <li> I have used another product, which is also excellent, but this one is as good and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried Natures Tears EyeMist on a whim several years ago and was hooked.  I&#x27;m SO glad Amazon carries it because it&#x27;s no longer available where I live.      It&#x27;s THE most refreshing solution to my dry, itchy, puffy, red eyes. (It sounds like I&#x27;ve been partying but no - allergies and old age- HA!)    Antihistamine eye drops can only be used twice a day.    Thicker drops leave a sticky or dry residue in my eyelashes.      The EyeMist can be used whenever I need it - even with eye makeup.  I recommend it to everyone and may share one of my 12.     MAY share ; - }</li>
            <li> I have used Natures Tears EyeMist for many years.  I suffer with dry eyes and find the mist a wonderfully refreshing and moisturizing alternative to my dry eyes eye drops. You can quickly spray this light mist across your open eyes as frequently as you wish and avoid dry eye symptoms while working at the computer or throughout your day. It is a very useful complement to your dry eye treatment routine.</li>
            <li> The order arrived a day early and was exactly as advertised.  A great product and perfectly fulfilled by the supplier.</li>
            <li> This product is the &amp;#34;only game in town&amp;#34; for dry eye AND contact lens wearers!  A spray usually dislodges a problem particle! You should open your eyes, hold the can approx 10 - 12&amp;#34; away from your face and press the button to provide a spray while you are moving the can at that distance from left to right or right to left whichever you prefer.  You will love it and never want to use anything else.  I wear contact lenses and I can&#x27;t tell you how many time this has helped me dislodge something so I don&#x27;t have to remove the lens.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years. I use this product repeatedly throughout my flights to avoid dry, inflamed eyes.  The problem is, all the bottles in this latest purchase don&#x27;t operate as easily as previous bottles. (I still have those bottles so I can compare.)  Previous bottles: easy to press to get a light mist. These bottles: hard to press down, spray that finally comes is more forceful, i finally figured out that if i hold the bottle further from my face that helps. I just now received the manufacturer&#x27;s response, and am grateful that the bottle will be adjusted, that will bring this product back to five stars, thanks!</li>
            <li> Cant live without this. I have dry eye and HATE to touch my eye or use drops. I have tried almost all stuff from drops to gel and this is my go to. Airplanes, trains, or the end of a long day. No more holding open my eye to drag gel across it and then being fuzzy vision for an hour.</li>
            <li> I have blepheritis and dry eyes. This product I find very useful for spraying into my eyes as well as cleaning them.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously overpriced for what is essentially water, but when I wake up in the morning and my eyes are stuck, a quick misting gets me going.</li>
            <li> This mist is handy to help you feel clean and refreshed at any time during your day.  It is a life/face saver.</li>
            <li> Quick and effective way to moisturize your eyes and eyelid area.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I needed, and it is chemical free. The 12 pack reduces the price per bottle.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry eye and have tried every over the counter product available.  My doctor prescribed Restasis but it is too expensive and I was told I won&#x27;t see results for the first 3 months.  The EyeMist is easy to use and gives instant relief for my burning and itching eyes.  I feel like I have sand in my eyes all the time, but using this, it feels like my eyes really calm down and the redness goes down a lot!  Thank you for making this natural and easy solution for my chronic problem!</li>
            <li> Good price on this product.  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I HAVE DRY EYES AND THE MIST FROM THIS SPRAY HELPS SOLVE MY PROBLEM.  I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR FOLKS WHO FIND USING DROPS DIFFICULT.</li>
            <li> I have siogren&#x27;s. This helps! I couldn&#x27;t find anything like this locally. Try it, it really helps. I just had to get use to spraying my eyes.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! No irritation and the spray really soothes dry eyes- better than drops for me.  The only downside is that it&#x27;s expensive.  I rotate between Natures Tears and my own fine mist spray bottle (available on Amazon) filled with distilled water.  Great relief from both and helps aching orbital bones( I have Graves disease) for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years, it is wonderful!! My eyes feel better, look better (no redness) I can&#x27; be without it.</li>
            <li> Love the product because I do not like putting drops in my eyes, just a mist spray does it for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this anymore in drug stores, and I use it not just for eyes, but for a nice mister for my face.</li>
            <li> good product, nice way to receive it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nature&#x27;s Tears for over ten years.  Not only does it provide immediate relief, but it actually makes my eyes feel clean and fresh.  I use them all the time and I must admit they are addictive.  I use a shot before going to the movies to ensure I have the best possible vision, I have a sprayer next to my bed for when my eyes dry at night.  They are even useful for flushing out the bothersome gnats that are prevalent and can get in your eyes while doing yard-work.  I even use them when my eyes tire while driving.  A quick spray and I&#x27;m good for another hundred miles--and I don&#x27;t have to tilt my head and take my eyes off the road!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to find Nature&#x27;s Tears in various drug stores.  Now they are a rare find.  I ordered them for years direct from the factory, but the price was high and did not include shipping (unless you ordered lots which I sometimes did).  Then I thought of Amazon.com.  Why not, they have everything else I need.  Sure enough, I found several suppliers, but decided on this one.  I was suspicious at first--12 cans for such a low price.  I suspected expired product, made in China knock-off, or some other problem.  What I got in two days was 12 cans individually packaged and fresher (expired 18 months later) than the ones just received from the factory in Grants Pass (expired one year later).  Today, I ordered two more cases just to be safe--you never know how long a good thing will last.  (And besides, I&#x27;m such a believer I routinely give out cans to friends and strangers when I see them struggling with typical eye drops.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out these.  I have super dry eyes and use this spray several times a night.</li>
            <li> GREAT alternative to all the toxic eye drops we have on our shelves here in the U.S.  This non-toxic mist hydrates the eye w/o all the chemicals found in other lubricating eye drops...  Much safer to use.  Getting GREAT results!</li>
            <li> Does not really last long like a regular eye drop but it is soothing in the middle of the night or on a hot, dry hike!</li>
            <li> I tried it, I liked it.  Had tried many other dry-eye relief products with not much relief.  This product delivers maximum relief and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> My eyes get so dry and drops don&#x27;t always work but this eye mist is great, especially on flights. Airplanes are SOOOO DRY. It fits in the quart-sized bag for TSA. When you mist, it also helps your face.:)</li>
            <li> met all expections of eye soothing care and also ease of operational use,transport and availabity.</li>
            <li> This is a godsend for someone like me who has extremely sensitive eyes and cannot do eyedrops.  The 12-pack is convenient, as I need a bottle in my purse, at work, at home....  Item arrived quickly and exactly as stated.</li>
