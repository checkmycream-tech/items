            <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>this stuff is simply amazing!</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job though, but leaves a distinctive oiliness, so I have to follow with a toner to remove the oil.</li>
            <li>it leaves your face feeling good.</li>
            <li>Good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best face scrubs overall and the best one offered by Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>

            <li>Love this scrub!</li>
            <li>handy like we did</li>
            <li>but it is kind of a pain to use.</li>
            <li>skin feeling nice</li>
            <li>If you love St.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial scrub I have found, regardless of your skin type.</li>
            <li>-Smell isn&#x27;t as appealing as the Orange Cleanser  </li>
            <li>I would have given it a 5 if the scent was better and if it were easier to use.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years now and know how I should be using it</li>
            <li>I mostly like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s but</li>
            <li>this one is NOT my favorite.  </li>
            <li>hey, it smells like pumpkin pie and who doesn&#x27;t LOVE the smell of pumpkin pie?</li>
            <li>If I feel my skin needs a bit more, then I use my clarisonic brush w/ this - if not, I just use my fingers and wash with a washcloth, etc.</li>
            <li>It just makes your skin look and feel glowy and lovely.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product is great.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle scrub that makes your skin feel good.  </li>
            <li>I love how clean this leaves my face feeling</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>easy application    </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower, makes on/off really easy.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the best application method I&#x27;ve found so far: make sure your hands and face are wet, take a finger and scoop out a &amp;#34;dime-sized&amp;#34; amount and rub between your hands to warm and loosen it up.</li>
            <li>When rinsed off, and it&#x27;s easy to rinse off, it eaves your face exceptionally smooth.  </li>
            <li>I especially love it because my forehead feels less oily since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much water to come up to a nice consistency.</li>
            <li>The Citrus facial scrub is very nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry patches and troublesome skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>The two pack is a great deal, since the only store I&#x27;ve ever known that I can just walk in and buy it at is Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this, so glad I picked up the two pack!</li>
            <li>Made my face very smooth and soft  after I used BB face lotion.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the fact that it is natural</li>
            <li>Lovely citrus aroma, this scrub leaves your face feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is a natural product.  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients, and, although it says citrus, I smell more spicy notes like cinnamon or nutmeg.</li>
            <li>so I bet a lot of people are dipping their germy fingers right into the jar.</li>
            <li>Kandee Johnson was right...</li>
            <li>Then we apply to the face like a mask and walk around for 10-15 minutes smelling the yummy citrus spice bouquet and then either remove with a moist wash cloth or can be done right before a shower and can be scrubed off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft and ready to soak up whatever fabulous moisturizer you have waiting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix it so it turns into a more normal consistency, and then use the scrub normally on my face.</li>
            <li>Ever so gently wash my face and the result is just radient!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for in a scrub.</li>
            <li>this is labeled as such but it feels more like a combo of orange peels and wax.  </li>
            <li>but after a few uses I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and think it smells good.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any potential buyers who need a good facial scrub.</li>
            <li>absolutely give it 2 thumbs up and would recommend it to anyone who needs a good daily scrub or just for the occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell was just so sweet and delicious, and the little thing in the scrub was small and gentle enough to clean my skin.</li>
            <li>The price was also really reasonable reason being for my purchase.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and mild and can be used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>You can use it as a daily cleanser - which I am doing now...and the exfoliation (as far as how &#x27;strong&#x27; you want the exfoliation process to be) is up to you.  </li>
            <li>Then I make sure my clean face is wet before I sprinkle some water onto the dry scrub.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it has natural ingredients, secondly, it smells so yummy you feel like eating it and last but not least, your face feels very smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>laughed at the reviews that said it was too pasty or hard because although the jar is small it is filled with a more concentrated paste that, when some is scooped out and mixed with a few drops of water becomes a more spreadable product - AND THE DIRECTIONS TELL YOU THAT</li>
            <li>And even then it will be hard to apply and most of it will end up on the bathtub floor!</li>
            <li>I used it over my face and neck, it left my skin feeling soft and took off almost all of my eye makeup (I use a lot of eye makeup and need eye makeup remover to get it off, this is the first product out of all the face washes I&#x27;ve tried to get it pretty much all off in one shot).</li>
            <li>I used this for a little less than a week now, it feels great.</li>
            <li>A little bit on wet fingers is all you need to get a good slough.</li>
            <li>The product does seem to work as it used to but is not nearly as user friendly because it is such a struggle to dig it out of the jar.</li>
            <li>It is over 99% natural, no funky chemicals.</li>
            <li>Ive&#x27;s scrub, Dr. Brandt Microdermabrasion scrub, Cosmedicine Meta-morphosis but want to go natural</li>
            <li>My skin feels as soft as a baby</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and refreshed and glow after I use it.</li>
            <li>face feel soft.</li>
            <li>She says it makes her skin soft &amp; helps keep the teeny bumps she can get on her face from developing.  </li>
            <li>this product does wonders for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The scrub is not ultra-fine, but hasn&#x27;t harmed my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Another downside is that it takes a lot of water to take off scrubs (not just this one) completely, so I like to use it in the shower,</li>
            <li>and it is not the old home-grown company that it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I feel it does not work nearly as well as my apricot scrub from St. Ives</li>
            <li>It works well without being too harsh on the skin and leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an exfoliator, but it&#x27;s gentle enough on your skin to be used every day.</li>
            <li>So, this is the only thing I use before SPF moisturizer for three seasons and my skin rarely gets too oily now that I use a &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; product, and I just add an extra layer of moisturizer in winter.</li>
            <li>also highly recommend following up with a toner after using this product.</li>
            <li>only beef is that I prefer products do not come in jars due to a higher cross contamination potential but due to the thick paste it probably makes more sense, but then, probably most people do not have skin care spatulas</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to as it is not as creamy as most other scrubs I&#x27;ve seen and used.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating agent is large enough to actually get off the dead skin cells unlike many other supposed creams meant to do the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too grainy, but just enough to buff the skin and gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li>It just helps your skin feel extra soft and will remove any microscopic bits of the product that remain in your pores.</li>
            <li>How to use scrub: pull out just a bit of what&#x27;s in the jar (less than a dime&#x27;s size) into dry, clean hands.</li>
            <li>I dont know if I received an old product, but it just does not look right to me at least.</li>
            <li>oil in it--not the really noxious stuff, just enough for scent and leaves your face soft without that dried out feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This exfoliator is gentle enough not to tear the skin, but rough enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s still gentle enough to use everyday without any red spots or upsetting my generally sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very thick paste that you smooth over your face.  </li>

            <li> also highly recommend following up with a toner after using this product.</li>
            <li> only beef is that I prefer products do not come in jars due to a higher cross contamination potential but due to the thick paste it probably makes more sense, but then, probably most people do not have skin care spatulas</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to as it is not as creamy as most other scrubs I&#x27;ve seen and used.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating agent is large enough to actually get off the dead skin cells unlike many other supposed creams meant to do the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too grainy, but just enough to buff the skin and gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li> It just helps your skin feel extra soft and will remove any microscopic bits of the product that remain in your pores.</li>
            <li> How to use scrub: pull out just a bit of what&#x27;s in the jar (less than a dime&#x27;s size) into dry, clean hands.</li>
            <li> I dont know if I received an old product, but it just does not look right to me at least.</li>
            <li> oil in it--not the really noxious stuff, just enough for scent and leaves your face soft without that dried out feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is gentle enough not to tear the skin, but rough enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s still gentle enough to use everyday without any red spots or upsetting my generally sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick paste that you smooth over your face.  </li>
            <li> Natural and a companion to other products    </li>
            <li> If you need a good, simple scrub, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and it got even drier shortly after the birth of my second child.</li>
            <li> Normally this would be a 5 star review, but one star comes off due to difficulty in use, and the other is that it is a bit of a deception that this family owned product quietly slipped into the possession of a mega corporation.</li>
            <li> and this works wonders at scrubbing away every last dry patch in just one use.</li>
            <li> Two containers in the package will last you a very long time...!</li>
            <li> Since then, my skin has gone back to normal, but I still use this scrub every other day to keep up with the dead skin.</li>
            <li> So many bad reviews on this product are simply because the people did not realize you are supposed to add a couple drops of water to the paste while it is in your hand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hang out on your skin, and even if you have oily skin like I do, (I believe Burt&#x27;s Bees recommends it for dry skin)</li>
            <li> you need to keep the jar dry.</li>
            <li> ; and my face is combination/oily three seasons of the year, dry in winter.</li>
            <li> have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> For dry skin, try a moisturizing alcohol-free toner.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for years and use it only occasionally because it is so messy.</li>
            <li> The product has always been thick but never hard as it is now.</li>
            <li> Feel as though it gets rid of all dirt deep down.</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount, so one jar lasts me several months.</li>
            <li> It leaves a little oily like feeling after I wash it away though, but I think it&#x27;s the essential oil they added in it.</li>
            <li> The jar it comes in is a little cumbersome in the shower, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> My skin did feel a little different, smoother, but I think that was just the scrub doing it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> My daughter does not suffer from acne or serious blemishes but her small pore sensitive skin cannot tolerate numerous facial products.  </li>
            <li> I thought other reviewers who noted this were over-reacting, but they are not.</li>
            <li> And your skin absorbs the oil in a few minutes, prevent the skin from being dry.</li>
            <li> Dig a little out and rub it between some wet fingers, then smear it all over.</li>
            <li> It might feel a little weird to apply and use at first, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals that damage the skin by over-drying it.  </li>
            <li> , it is, as the previous reviewer said, a paste.</li>
            <li> I used this to exfoliate all the dead skin on my face, and followed it with a heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We use a small plastic spatula to scoop into the palm of the hand and mix just a few drops in to form a spreadable paste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and dry, but the directions say to mix some water in your hands with it to make it smoother.</li>
            <li> A small plastic scooper added to the box would be a plus.</li>
            <li> I use a buff puff and a small amount of scrub.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if I will keep my subscription.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very harsh, but you can feel it scrubbing which I like a lot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is hard.</li>
            <li> but the product is very hard and oily compared to jars that I&#x27;ve bought at a drug store.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and you need to mix it with water to make a smoother paste in your hand and then use it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it will crumble and feel nearly impossible to spread.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it was a bad batch, or a change in formula.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not too grainy, but just enough to buff the skin and gentle enough to use daily. It will awhile. A little bit on wet fingers is all you need to get a good slough. It is over 99% natural, no funky chemicals. If you love St.Ive&#x27;s scrub, Dr. Brandt Microdermabrasion scrub, Cosmedicine Meta-morphosis but want to go natural, this is it. My skin feels as soft as a baby and it glows.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face scrubs overall and the best one offered by Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell like a blend of pumpkin pie spices and citrus but everyone in our family loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I laughed at the reviews that said it was too pasty or hard because although the jar is small it is filled with a more concentrated paste that, when some is scooped out and mixed with a few drops of water becomes a more spreadable product - AND THE DIRECTIONS TELL YOU THAT IF YOU READ THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use a small plastic spatula to scoop into the palm of the hand and mix just a few drops in to form a spreadable paste. Then we apply to the face like a mask and walk around for 10-15 minutes smelling the yummy citrus spice bouquet and then either remove with a moist wash cloth or can be done right before a shower and can be scrubed off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft and ready to soak up whatever fabulous moisturizer you have waiting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef is that I prefer products do not come in jars due to a higher cross contamination potential but due to the thick paste it probably makes more sense, but then, probably most people do not have skin care spatulas handy like we did so I bet a lot of people are dipping their germy fingers right into the jar. A small plastic scooper added to the box would be a plus.</li>
            <li> I am a bit on the verge with this one. I love the smell and the fact that it is natural but it is kind of a pain to use. It is very thick and you need to mix it with water to make a smoother paste in your hand and then use it. And even then it will be hard to apply and most of it will end up on the bathtub floor! I think it does a good job though, but leaves a distinctive oiliness, so I have to follow with a toner to remove the oil. I have had mine for years and use it only occasionally because it is so messy.</li>
            <li> Just makes ya want to wash your face! I use a buff puff and a small amount of scrub. Ever so gently wash my face and the result is just radient! You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cleanser that won&#x27;t over-dry, but will still do the job... this is the one.  It might feel a little weird to apply and use at first, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals that damage the skin by over-drying it.  This exfoliator is gentle enough not to tear the skin, but rough enough to get the job done.  Plus, you can feel good about using it knowing it hasn&#x27;t been harming any animals!!</li>
            <li> I used this for a little less than a week now, it feels great. The smell was just so sweet and delicious, and the little thing in the scrub was small and gentle enough to clean my skin. My skin feels soft and refreshed and glow after I use it. It leaves a little oily like feeling after I wash it away though, but I think it&#x27;s the essential oil they added in it. And your skin absorbs the oil in a few minutes, prevent the skin from being dry. After using several times, I feel my skin improved and complexion reduced. Great product!</li>
            <li> I am a Burt Bees fan and when I saw this scrub, I wanted to try it.  I&#x27;m not disappointed.  It&#x27;s a very thick paste that you smooth over your face.  You can immediately smell the citrus and honey and you rub it on.  When rinsed off, and it&#x27;s easy to rinse off, it eaves your face exceptionally smooth.  And my face feels that way all day.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. The price was also really reasonable reason being for my purchase. I would recommend this product to any potential buyers who need a good facial scrub.</li>
            <li> Wonderful in everyway, use it every couple days.makes face feel soft. Feel as though it gets rid of all dirt deep down. â™¥ it.</li>
            <li> I dont know if I received an old product, but it just does not look right to me at least. I still like it some some reason.</li>
            <li> I love how clean this leaves my face feeling and my husband says it makes my face feel softer. I use it once or twice a week and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first but after a few uses I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and think it smells good. I especially love it because my forehead feels less oily since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> The Citrus facial scrub is very nice. Smells like pumpkin pie to me. Made my face very smooth and soft  after I used BB face lotion. I like it !!</li>
            <li> Lovely citrus aroma, this scrub leaves your face feeling soft and moisturized.  Doesn&#x27;t take much water to come up to a nice consistency.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is great.  I also use it on my head, which I shave.  I love that it is a natural product.  I can feel it exfoliating and cleaning my skin.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> My daughter does not suffer from acne or serious blemishes but her small pore sensitive skin cannot tolerate numerous facial products.  She says it makes her skin soft &amp; helps keep the teeny bumps she can get on her face from developing.  She loves this facial scrub and waited for this out-of-stock item to arrive rather than use something else.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and it got even drier shortly after the birth of my second child. I used this to exfoliate all the dead skin on my face, and followed it with a heavy moisturizer. Since then, my skin has gone back to normal, but I still use this scrub every other day to keep up with the dead skin. I only use a small amount, so one jar lasts me several months.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial scrub I have found, regardless of your skin type. Not just a cream with some \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; in it, it is, as the previous reviewer said, a paste. The jar it comes in is a little cumbersome in the shower, but no big deal. Dig a little out and rub it between some wet fingers, then smear it all over. I follow it up with a facial cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t hang out on your skin, and even if you have oily skin like I do, (I believe Burt&#x27;s Bees recommends it for dry skin) it leaves your face feeling good. The two pack is a great deal, since the only store I&#x27;ve ever known that I can just walk in and buy it at is Whole Foods. If you need a good, simple scrub, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> this product does wonders for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This scrub is great! All natural ingredients, and, although it says citrus, I smell more spicy notes like cinnamon or nutmeg. It&#x27;s very thick and dry, but the directions say to mix some water in your hands with it to make it smoother. The scrub is not ultra-fine, but hasn&#x27;t harmed my sensitive skin. And best of all, it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order in the timeframe promised, in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Pros:  -Feels great. Feels like a thorough scrub.  -Leaves skin feeling nice (no side effects or anything for me)  -Burts Bees! Natural and a companion to other products    Cons:  -Smell isn&#x27;t as appealing as the Orange Cleanser  -Not easy application    I really like this product. It was exactly what I was looking for in a scrub. I would have given it a 5 if the scent was better and if it were easier to use.    How to use scrub: pull out just a bit of what&#x27;s in the jar (less than a dime&#x27;s size) into dry, clean hands. I put it on my fingers instead of in my palm so it&#x27;s easier to rub in. Then I make sure my clean face is wet before I sprinkle some water onto the dry scrub. I mix it so it turns into a more normal consistency, and then use the scrub normally on my face. Another downside is that it takes a lot of water to take off scrubs (not just this one) completely, so I like to use it in the shower, but that&#x27;s not always practical cause you need to keep the jar dry.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing facial scrub. Kandee Johnson was right...this stuff is simply amazing! Firstly, it has natural ingredients, secondly, it smells so yummy you feel like eating it and last but not least, your face feels very smooth after using it. It&#x27;s gentle and mild and can be used on a daily basis. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years. The product has always been thick but never hard as it is now. I don&#x27;t know why it is hard. I thought other reviewers who noted this were over-reacting, but they are not. The product does seem to work as it used to but is not nearly as user friendly because it is such a struggle to dig it out of the jar. Maybe it was a bad batch, or a change in formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the latter since the Burt&#x27;s Bees was purchased by Clorox in 2007. It sort of creeps me out that Clorox owns it and it is not the old home-grown company that it used to be.  Normally this would be a 5 star review, but one star comes off due to difficulty in use, and the other is that it is a bit of a deception that this family owned product quietly slipped into the possession of a mega corporation.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle scrub that makes your skin feel good.  My husband and I use this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Never breaks me out and is very light but gets the job done! You can&#x27;t find this stuff in any store, I thought they stopped making it</li>
            <li> Love this scrub! It took a little getting used to as it is not as creamy as most other scrubs I&#x27;ve seen and used. Here&#x27;s the best application method I&#x27;ve found so far: make sure your hands and face are wet, take a finger and scoop out a &amp;#34;dime-sized&amp;#34; amount and rub between your hands to warm and loosen it up. Apply, scrub, and rinse. I use it in the shower, makes on/off really easy. This has a bit of (orange peel?) oil in it--not the really noxious stuff, just enough for scent and leaves your face soft without that dried out feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard estheticians say &amp;#34;treat like with like,&amp;#34; and my face is combination/oily three seasons of the year, dry in winter. So, this is the only thing I use before SPF moisturizer for three seasons and my skin rarely gets too oily now that I use a &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; product, and I just add an extra layer of moisturizer in winter. It isn&#x27;t very harsh, but you can feel it scrubbing which I like a lot. Good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I got these the shipping was great, the packaging was nice(the container is glass...) but the product is very hard and oily compared to jars that I&#x27;ve bought at a drug store. That&#x27;s not to say that the product isn&#x27;t functional. I&#x27;ve used it for many years now and know how I should be using it so that&#x27;s not the problem. I just think the quality isn&#x27;t as great. Not sure yet if I will keep my subscription. I&#x27;ll give it another chance and see what happens because it is cheaper than buying it in store.</li>
            <li> I mostly like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s but this one is NOT my favorite.  Maybe my expectation was off but I was wanting a scrub...this is labeled as such but it feels more like a combo of orange peels and wax.  Didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling refreshed at all.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliating scrub I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin and this works wonders at scrubbing away every last dry patch in just one use. The exfoliating agent is large enough to actually get off the dead skin cells unlike many other supposed creams meant to do the same. But, it&#x27;s still gentle enough to use everyday without any red spots or upsetting my generally sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please just remember to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. So many bad reviews on this product are simply because the people did not realize you are supposed to add a couple drops of water to the paste while it is in your hand. Otherwise it will crumble and feel nearly impossible to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend following up with a toner after using this product. It just helps your skin feel extra soft and will remove any microscopic bits of the product that remain in your pores. For dry skin, try a moisturizing alcohol-free toner. For oily skin, check out the ones made for acne or that say oil-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely give it 2 thumbs up and would recommend it to anyone who needs a good daily scrub or just for the occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey, it smells like pumpkin pie and who doesn&#x27;t LOVE the smell of pumpkin pie?</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to have this in a jar, it should be in a squeeze tube.  I feel it does not work nearly as well as my apricot scrub from St. Ives</li>
            <li> Wonderful - wish I would have tried this years ago.  You can use it as a daily cleanser - which I am doing now...and the exfoliation (as far as how &#x27;strong&#x27; you want the exfoliation process to be) is up to you.  If I feel my skin needs a bit more, then I use my clarisonic brush w/ this - if not, I just use my fingers and wash with a washcloth, etc. as to not over do it.  It just makes your skin look and feel glowy and lovely.  I bought this based off makeup artist Kandee Johnson&#x27;s recommendations - and I guess she does know her stuff. :)  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this product. It works well without being too harsh on the skin and leaves my face feeling smooth. Great for dry patches and troublesome skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day! Love it. Two containers in the package will last you a very long time...!</li>
            <li> I literally just stepped out of the shower and had to write this review! This scrub is great I used it over my face and neck, it left my skin feeling soft and took off almost all of my eye makeup (I use a lot of eye makeup and need eye makeup remover to get it off, this is the first product out of all the face washes I&#x27;ve tried to get it pretty much all off in one shot). I was nervous because I read that someone said it left their face feeling waxy but I didn&#x27;t find that this scrub left any residue once I rinsed it off. My skin did feel a little different, smoother, but I think that was just the scrub doing it&#x27;s job! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this, so glad I picked up the two pack!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while now.  It&#x27;s really good.  It&#x27;s an exfoliator, but it&#x27;s gentle enough on your skin to be used every day. It also smells like pumpkin pie. Yum. Great product.</li>
