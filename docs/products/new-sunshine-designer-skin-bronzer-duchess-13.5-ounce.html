            <li>love it and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>My wife loved it, she said it was great for tanning.</li>
            <li>I would compare it to designer skins monarchy that came out 6 years ago or so :) awesome lotion!</li>
            <li>I prefer coconut scented tanning lotions, but this has a pleasant smell too.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, and applies easily.</li>
            <li>This lotion is wonderful, and let me tell you, I don&#x27;t say that lightly.</li>
            <li>how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item was good</li>
            <li>And it smells soooooo good kind of</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion of all time!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>It is the best smelling lotion I have gotten, and I have also had Spellbound and Pretty and Reckless both by Designer Skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of this lotion!</li>
            <li>Plus it smells amazing, even hours after you don&#x27;t have that stinky tanning smell.</li>
            <li>those two are the absolute best.</li>
            <li>love it love it  smells awesome and makes my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li>this is AWESOME and smells good even after you tan which as you know , many lotions change and smell gross after you bake.</li>
            <li>This by far is one of the best tanning lotions on the market in my opinion!!</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best cream ever made.</li>
            <li>It is a very light color.</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly, smells amazing but isn&#x27;t helping me get ANY color.</li>
            <li>Its thicker than regular lotion, but almost kind of melts when it touches your skin and makes it so easy to spread around thoroughly and evenly, and soaks into your skin wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands but the bronzing affect is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>So I got it off here for a better deal.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so healthy</li>
            <li>my wifes favorite,  you cannot beat the price and quality of this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok, I love Designer Skin products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update after more uses.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the milky smoothness of this bronzer.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>but this was recommended and a top seller at the salon I go to</li>
            <li>The color I get with indoor tanning is better than some I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I just ordered obsidian by designer skin hoping I have better luck with that one.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is more for mosturizing in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so I have smelled many different lotions this one is the best</li>
            <li>and it came with a free Designer Skin Lip Shine!</li>
            <li>great product and a whole lot cheaper on here than in salons</li>
            <li>Queen is a better for for me.</li>
            <li>I love lotions that have the butter in it.</li>
            <li>My starter lotion (Australian Gold&#x27;s fierce D fense) was great while it lasted but this gave me so much more!</li>
            <li>Pro - smells great, overall a nice lotion.  </li>
            <li>On a good note it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li>Very good just what you buy at the tanning salon only a lot cheaper</li>
            <li>If your like me than Queen which is a huge bronzer factor will work better.</li>
            <li>While I loved the lotion the salon sold me, it didn&#x27;t do much after 3 weeks</li>
            <li>First things first, I am an experienced tanner who has a gorgeous golden/brown color and achieves tans very well.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent it leaves me with after I tan!</li>
            <li>Packaging was great, the bottle itself was all sealed up nice and tight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I only use bronzing lotions in my Diamond level tanning bed, and I get great color from this product.</li>
            <li>I felt confident getting into the tanning bed, feeling like I was really going to soak up some rays!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super light and yummy.</li>
            <li>natural bronzer really helped go over tanning plateau for awhile... ..  smells great like a sugar cookie....</li>
            <li>This lotion will forever remain on my rotation because I love it just that much.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and was delivered ahead of schedule!</li>
            <li>The bronzers are good fast acting too and the milk in it feels so good on my skin and makes it feel hydrated all day instead of dry!</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time I have purchased this item from this seller, and it is exactly what you would buy in the salon and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>Very very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>So first, the scent.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself has a natural bronzer in it, the lotion is light brown.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying this again :)</li>
            <li>I got this delivered on a Sunday and first thing</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Received product extremely fast!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and keeps my skin so soft and hydrated all day after.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy with the difficult packaging (the plastic wrap was melted to the bottle), but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>Lotion is great just as expected, same one they sell in the salon for a lot cheaper!!</li>
            <li>This was the real deal not a fake</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion if you have naturally fair skin and don&#x27;t want to turn orange, but you still want a little bronzer in your lotion.</li>
            <li>So idk if its the real lotion or not?</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin hydrated very well</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li>I really like Dutchess a lot.</li>
            <li>and they just wash off anyways, really.</li>
            <li>The lotion was delivered when expected in original packaging!</li>
            <li>The bronzer has a nice dark natural brown color with no orange tint...</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve decided that the tingle factor lotions get me more dark.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>But it has a small amount which gives you the perfect little boost of color and it doesn&#x27;t give you that gross dha smell!</li>
            <li>I was also told by my tanning salon that New Sunshine (their supplier of this lotion) prohibits the sale of this product online.</li>
            <li>This bottle that I received had a New Sunshine sticker on it.</li>
            <li>, I compared my bottle to the one at my tanning salon and it was exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>First Bronzing lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought that was white instead of a bronze color.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few tanning lotions that doesn&#x27;t have a really strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>It definitely helped make my tan so much darker</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have any odor after and my skin stayed soft.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s not for someone with sensitive skin...  </li>
            <li>but thought I&#x27;d give a review in the event someone with sensitive skin was considering it.</li>
            <li>leaves skin super soft....  just not as dark as reviews said</li>
            <li>This is a new all natural bronzer that actually bronze&#x27;s once on the skin and leaves no streaks or color on the skin till you tan.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and generally buy unscented lotions</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have reason to believe that this product is not actually what it promises to be - considering that New Sunshine does not allow the sale of it&#x27;s products online.</li>
            <li>It also says on the back of the bottle &amp;#34;only sold in professional tanning salons&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> The first time I used it I noticed I was at least a shade darker than I had been.</li>
            <li> So I ended up actually feeling darker(which is crazy because I&#x27;m already dark), and my skin feeling healthier(yes, healthier and more goregeous!)</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on so smooth and silky especially since it has a milk base which is very hydrating</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> considering I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was also told that it is possible to purchase these bottles empty and that people who sell these products online typically fill the bottles with a mock lotion.</li>
            <li> And do not listen to people who claim that this lotion is not real</li>
            <li> Be careful if you chose to purchase this product online.</li>
            <li> Not sure it is actually tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I was made aware (from my tanning salon) that it is illegal to sell Designer Skin products online.</li>
            <li> I want my skin to be dark from melanin, not from bronzer.</li>
            <li> I have gotten at least 3 shades darker than where I had plateaued,  unless using an extra dark bronzer...</li>
            <li> Not super dark brown.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, no sticky residue and leaves you feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> but i wear typically wear all black</li>
            <li> and I thought it was time to add a little bronzer which was why I chose this lotion.</li>
            <li> just in the few days I have used it</li>
            <li> The scent is a brown sugar type and it&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I usually put after tan lotion on as soon as I get out of the bed to maximize my tan and lock in moisture (I recommend Designer Skin Spa Luxury or Maui Babe after sun)</li>
            <li> after justa few uses!</li>
            <li> it is the delivery was suppose to be 2/20/2015 and never heard or reviewed until Monday 2/23/2015 late afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> creamy/tropical/beachy with a subtle hint of perfume, but no overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> Its not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a dark lotion anyway because I was afraid of staining my clothes/hands</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product  - great service!</li>
            <li> love it and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> It definitely helped make my tan so much darker</li>
            <li> I got my lotion....I bought a packet at my tanning salon and the lotion in the bottle I got is darker then the lotion I bought at the salon? So idk if its the real lotion or not?</li>
            <li> this is AWESOME and smells good even after you tan which as you know , many lotions change and smell gross after you bake.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful, and let me tell you, I don&#x27;t say that lightly. First things first, I am an experienced tanner who has a gorgeous golden/brown color and achieves tans very well. But that shouldnt alter your opinion of this wonderful lotion. So first, the scent. Its smells like tropical/floral vanilla (if you can imagine that) so it smelled wonderful going on, smelled delicious while I was tanning, and smelled even better afterwards! I&#x27;ve got it on now because I just got home from tanning and I don&#x27;t even wanna shower! I would go out on the town for drinks or on a date with my boyfriend. I smell just like I would after putting on lotion from bath and body works! So the scent got a BIG A+ in my book. Second, the lotion itself. Its wonderful, as are all designer skin products! Its not too thick and not too thin. Its thicker than regular lotion, but almost kind of melts when it touches your skin and makes it so easy to spread around thoroughly and evenly, and soaks into your skin wonderfully. I felt confident getting into the tanning bed, feeling like I was really going to soak up some rays! Third, the result. The lotion itself has a natural bronzer in it, the lotion is light brown. Not super dark brown. Which is perfect, because when I get done tanning I want my skin to be dark from melanin, not from bronzer. But it has a small amount which gives you the perfect little boost of color and it doesn&#x27;t give you that gross dha smell! The lotion also has a milk moisturizer, which I&#x27;ve never used before and I love it! I usually put after tan lotion on as soon as I get out of the bed to maximize my tan and lock in moisture (I recommend Designer Skin Spa Luxury or Maui Babe after sun) those two are the absolute best. But, after tanning I feel as if I don&#x27;t need to use an after tan lotion, even though I do anyways. So I ended up actually feeling darker(which is crazy because I&#x27;m already dark), and my skin feeling healthier(yes, healthier and more goregeous!) after justa few uses! This lotion will forever remain on my rotation because I love it just that much. And do not listen to people who claim that this lotion is not real, I compared my bottle to the one at my tanning salon and it was exactly the same. I buy all my designer skin products on amazon and none have been phony! I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this product! Very happy with the results. The bronzer has a nice dark natural brown color with no orange tint...no oompa loompa skin! The lotion goes on so smooth and silky especially since it has a milk base which is very hydrating considering I have dry skin. And it smells soooooo good kind of creamy/tropical/beachy with a subtle hint of perfume, but no overpowering smell. Definitely buying this again :)</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this lotion! It doesn&#x27;t stain your hands but the bronzing affect is phenomenal. The first time I used it I noticed I was at least a shade darker than I had been. Dries quickly, no sticky residue and leaves you feeling moisturized. Beautiful bronze color NOT orange or streaky. I prefer coconut scented tanning lotions, but this has a pleasant smell too.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, and applies easily. This sells for  $80 at my tanning salon, so I saved $40 buying it on Amazon. I only use bronzing lotions in my Diamond level tanning bed, and I get great color from this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We had this lotion in out store for a short time and never got to use it. So I got it off here for a better deal. It&#x27;s the same lotion was all wrapped up when I got it in the mail.uswd for a week and can already tell the difference in my color. It also has a great smell to it. No after tanning burn smell.. will buy again</li>
            <li> Great service!  And the product is amazing!  Makes my skin feel so healthy and I have gotten a wonderful tan just in the few days I have used it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and was delivered ahead of schedule!</li>
            <li> One of my fav lotions!Smells awesome!</li>
            <li> my wifes favorite,  you cannot beat the price and quality of this</li>
            <li> Very good just what you buy at the tanning salon only a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok, I love Designer Skin products but this was one not my fav. My daughter loves it though</li>
            <li> Great for the skin. Bronzing agent is great!</li>
            <li> This lotion tans well but makes my skin feel weird.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greedy but somehow still feel slimy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started indoor tanning about 3-4 weeks ago. While I loved the lotion the salon sold me, it didn&#x27;t do much after 3 weeks and I thought it was time to add a little bronzer which was why I chose this lotion. I didn&#x27;t want a dark lotion anyway because I was afraid of staining my clothes/hands and I also suck at evenly applying to my back. I got this delivered on a Sunday and first thing Monday I went to test it out. After todays use I do notice a nicer color. My starter lotion (Australian Gold&#x27;s fierce D fense) was great while it lasted but this gave me so much more! I don&#x27;t care for the smell (so sweet/sugary) but I didn&#x27;t have any odor after and my skin stayed soft. I&#x27;ll update after more uses. Lotion color is similar to my Fierce D fense lotion and doesn&#x27;t stain my hands or clothes (almost a beige color) but i wear typically wear all black</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion on Thursday and it was shipped out Friday and I had it Saturday! I love the smell of this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t stink or anything. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> The lotion was outdated on the bottom.  I pulled the bottom piece off and it expired. Very unfortunate.  I am not happy with this purchase at all.  Not sure it is actually tanning lotion. Balls up and flakes off.</li>
            <li> I love the milky smoothness of this bronzer. It&#x27;s a lighter bronzer and doesn&#x27;t over power your skin.  Keeps your skin hydrated very well and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This by far is one of the best tanning lotions on the market in my opinion!! Smells great and doesn&#x27;t give you that orangey look that some lotions give. Highly recommend!! The lotion was delivered when expected in original packaging! Very happy with this seller!</li>
            <li> My wife loved it, she said it was great for tanning. No oily residue.</li>
            <li> love it love it  smells awesome and makes my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> Lotion is great just as expected, same one they sell in the salon for a lot cheaper!!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make me stink after tanning and getting sweaty... But I&#x27;ve decided that the tingle factor lotions get me more dark. So for anyone that prefers bronzers, definitely go with this!</li>
            <li> Received product extremely fast! Packaging was great, the bottle itself was all sealed up nice and tight. The smell is amazing! I cannot wait to try it out!</li>
            <li> Pro - smells great, overall a nice lotion.  When I used it, I got a lot of compliments hours later on how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - it&#x27;s not for someone with sensitive skin...  I have sensitive skin and generally buy unscented lotions but this was recommended and a top seller at the salon I go to so I tried it but I ended up being allergic to the perfume chemicals in it and it gave me hives.  They also wouldn&#x27;t exchange it since it had been opened so I gave it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this elsewhere but thought I&#x27;d give a review in the event someone with sensitive skin was considering it.</li>
            <li> I was made aware (from my tanning salon) that it is illegal to sell Designer Skin products online. It also says on the back of the bottle &amp;#34;only sold in professional tanning salons&amp;#34;. I was also told that it is possible to purchase these bottles empty and that people who sell these products online typically fill the bottles with a mock lotion. I was also told by my tanning salon that New Sunshine (their supplier of this lotion) prohibits the sale of this product online. The staff at the salon I tan at also compared the lotion to their bottle of Duchess and the lotion itself did not match the color of their bottle of Duchess.  This bottle that I received had a New Sunshine sticker on it. Therefore, I have reason to believe that this product is not actually what it promises to be - considering that New Sunshine does not allow the sale of it&#x27;s products online. Be careful if you chose to purchase this product online. You never know what you could be putting on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!!! Fragrance is nice too!!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few tanning lotions that doesn&#x27;t have a really strong perfume smell. The scent is a brown sugar type and it&#x27;s not strong at all. The color I get with indoor tanning is better than some I&#x27;ve tried. Also it doesn&#x27;t turn your hands yellow because of the bronzer. It is a very light color.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly, smells amazing but isn&#x27;t helping me get ANY color. I just ordered obsidian by designer skin hoping I have better luck with that one.  This lotion is more for mosturizing in my opinion. Not bronzing at all.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion of all time! It goes on smooth and keeps my skin so soft and hydrated all day after. Plus it smells amazing, even hours after you don&#x27;t have that stinky tanning smell. My tanning salon sells this for $90, I asked someone if I could compare them side by side and this lotion is 100% legitimate Duchess by Designer Skin. I highly recommend this lotion if you have naturally fair skin and don&#x27;t want to turn orange, but you still want a little bronzer in your lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! It is the best smelling lotion I have gotten, and I have also had Spellbound and Pretty and Reckless both by Designer Skin. Also I work in a Tanning salon so I have smelled many different lotions this one is the best it&#x27;s super light and yummy. This was the real deal not a fake and it came with a free Designer Skin Lip Shine! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> great product and a whole lot cheaper on here than in salons</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this lotion! Especially after tanning. The bronzers are good fast acting too and the milk in it feels so good on my skin and makes it feel hydrated all day instead of dry! I would compare it to designer skins monarchy that came out 6 years ago or so :) awesome lotion!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference since I&#x27;ve been using this. First Bronzing lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought that was white instead of a bronze color. On a good note it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li> The item was good it is the delivery was suppose to be 2/20/2015 and never heard or reviewed until Monday 2/23/2015 late afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Bridget Russo</li>
            <li> natural bronzer really helped go over tanning plateau for awhile... ..  smells great like a sugar cookie.... leaves skin super soft....  just not as dark as reviews said</li>
            <li> I really like Dutchess a lot. I just think I&#x27;m way past the point that the bronzer will do much for me! I love the fresh scent it leaves me with after I tan! Queen is a better for for me. I love lotions that have the butter in it. It leaves your skin moisturized all day long. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I&#x27;m a huge fan of this lotion. I have just been tanning since I have been 17 now I&#x27;m 30. If your like me than Queen which is a huge bronzer factor will work better. This is a good started lotion for someone who has not been tanning forever!</li>
            <li> Very pleased!  Very very fast shipping.  Would definitely order again</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy with the difficult packaging (the plastic wrap was melted to the bottle), but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I have purchased this item from this seller, and it is exactly what you would buy in the salon and it works amazing. I have never used a bronzer that has no color to wash off after putting on the skin. This is a new all natural bronzer that actually bronze&#x27;s once on the skin and leaves no streaks or color on the skin till you tan. I tan 4 days a week 365 days a year (for years) and this is by far the best cream ever made. I have gotten at least 3 shades darker than where I had plateaued,  unless using an extra dark bronzer...and they just wash off anyways, really. This IS the best cream out there, and for this value? You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> The color was not what I thought and I didn&#x27;t like the flower smell after going tanning.</li>
