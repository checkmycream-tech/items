            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Retin-A, another retinol product, sells for much more, so the price of this one is a steal.</li>
            <li>I love using this every day.</li>
            <li>And the price is way better than at Sephora or Ulta.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an investment, I was on the fence about it for years, but it works SO much better than the junk you get at drug stores and retailers and</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but</li>

            <li>Retinol helps to repair acne and fine lines at the cellular level and with regular use, you will have flawless skin.</li>
            <li>Got here so quickly!</li>
            <li>Great product that I have used for several years.</li>
            <li>This has retinol in it, which is a very powerful acne and antiaging treatment.</li>
            <li>def worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love this product it fights acne and yet is gentle.</li>
            <li>Works great with other Murad acne products.</li>
            <li>Goes on very light and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this seller and the product to anyone looking for this kind of facial treatment.</li>
            <li>I want her to value her skin and treat it right.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The products worked great and her face cleared up within days of some serious face-washing.  </li>
            <li>Cleared up my skin quick and made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got naturally oily skin, so it&#x27;s hard to find a moisturizer that won&#x27;t make my skin look greasy and gross and this is the perfect balance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suppose to be a light moisturizer, but still left my skin feeling greasy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li>However, as she is young, she really doesn&#x27;t need a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; - just something to dab.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin though, and for any one else out there, I wish this warning had been on the reviews, if you have oily skin only use a small amount of this moisturizer, it will make you even more oily if you use very much of it.  </li>
            <li>I rarely break out using this routine and i love this murad routine because it doesn&#x27;t cause dryness which was my number one problem with other acne treatments in the past.</li>
            <li>It looks supple and feels soft.</li>
            <li>It protects my face from adult acne and helps reduce it.</li>
            <li>Even though it is expensive for a teen - I feel it is worth it because it is good quality, and she will make it last.  </li>
            <li>not sure it&#x27;s worth the price, even though it was MUCH cheaper on Amazon than the Murad website.  </li>
            <li>This lotion normally tightens my pores and helps smooth out my skin; it&#x27;s usually noticeable within a few days.</li>
            <li>This lotion doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive combination skin.  </li>

            <li> Great product that works.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin quick and made my skin very soft.Just hoping it doesn&#x27;t stop after a few weeks or so like some medicines does.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  It makes my skin have an even color to it. A dewy look. It looks supple and feels soft.</li>
            <li> excellent product and excellent service!!</li>
            <li> Great product that I have used for several years. Goes on very light and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  Would recommend this product to others who have difficulty skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and it has cleared my acne!! I used to use Clinique, and I will never go back to it. This lotion doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive combination skin.  Amazing product. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Can feel a better texture to skin. Looks clearer.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! And it smells good too!</li>

I haven&#x27;t noticed any extra problems, but then I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement either.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. Feels awesome and visibly improves my skin every night. I only need to put a little bit on, too.</li>
            <li> I love using this every day. It protects my face from adult acne and helps reduce it. I would recommend this seller and the product to anyone looking for this kind of facial treatment.</li>
            <li> Once a month for like 2 weeks my acne goes terribly out of control. I like using this as a preventative measure daily, and sometime 2 times daily to treat my acne from flaring up so it will look like I don&#x27;t have acne.</li>
            <li> I have spent 30 years and literally thousands of dollars on products at the drugstore, infomercials, and through the doctor, this serious is so calming yet powerful! Just what I needed... And the price is way better than at Sephora or Ulta. You miss out on your points, but save the money! ;)</li>
            <li> I have tried so many solutions and Murad is by far and away the best acne solution I have ever tried. I highly recommend it to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. No problems.</li>

            <li> love this lotion- i have oily skin and i always put this on every night before i go to bed after i washed my face with murad acne clarifying cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;it actually helps me control my oiliness AND my acne. love it always restock on this baby. I rarely break out using this routine and i love this murad routine because it doesn&#x27;t cause dryness which was my number one problem with other acne treatments in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I received some samples of Murad and I gave them to my pre-teen who was experiencing some break-outs.  The products worked great and her face cleared up within days of some serious face-washing.  I ordered a bottle of the acne wash - and I wanted a good lotion so her face wouldn&#x27;t dry out.  However, as she is young, she really doesn&#x27;t need a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; - just something to dab.  I thought I might as well stick with the same product line - and I WAS SO PLEASED.  It is a very light lotion, very light fragrance, just perfect for anyone with sensitive skin - and I feel better about her washing her face and learning a good skin regiment with good products.  Even though it is expensive for a teen - I feel it is worth it because it is good quality, and she will make it last.  I want her to value her skin and treat it right.  Thank you Murad!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Got here so quickly!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about a month now. I can&#x27;t say this lotion has helped my skin at all! It makes my skin somewhat oily and I&#x27;ve gotten even more random pimples which I believe is from the oily-ness. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this as an addition to using the Murad Cleanser and Clearing Solution.  It&#x27;s ok, but not sure it&#x27;s worth the price, even though it was MUCH cheaper on Amazon than the Murad website.  It&#x27;s suppose to be a light moisturizer, but still left my skin feeling greasy and I was shiny by noon.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but I feel like the version I received from Amazon is different from the tubes I bought at Ulta/Sephora. I suspect that I received old/expired product. It&#x27;s less expensive (which is why I went with Amazon) but it does nothing for my skin. This lotion normally tightens my pores and helps smooth out my skin; it&#x27;s usually noticeable within a few days. I&#x27;ve used it off and on for years and this is first time I have been disappointed.</li>
