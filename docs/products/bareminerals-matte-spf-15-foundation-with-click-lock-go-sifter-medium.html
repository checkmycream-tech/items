            <li>Shipping took awhile, otherwise its good</li>
            <li>Also the coverage is so good</li>
            <li>The click, lock and go cover is a good idea though.</li>

            <li>I really love this makeup!</li>
            <li>Very good price and quick shipping</li>
            <li>Good price and came quickly!</li>
            <li>SPF 15 is awesome too because I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting another product on my sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>I was so dissapointed because it really was good coverage!</li>
            <li>this MATTE finish Bare Minerals is the best!  </li>
            <li>I was already a huge fan of the bareMinerals products, but this one is even greater!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin being able to breath and not look caked on.</li>
            <li>Have been using the product for many years.  </li>
            <li>A container lasts for many months.</li>
            <li>I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years now and continue to love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product ..</li>
            <li>, bareMinerals is my favorite choice.  </li>
            <li>the matte works so much better for me.</li>
            <li>I kept it to see if it gets better with more practice</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how many complection flaws this product will brush out of sight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it ... would definately recommend it</li>
            <li>My skin is more oily so every four hours</li>
            <li>I have the airbrush system also, and it&#x27;s nice, but for the effort it takes to clean it after each application</li>
            <li>I bought 6 of these for a year long mission trip I&#x27;m going on and I am very happy with the amount of money I saved buying it on Amazon than Ulta or their website.</li>
            <li>the new lock and go lid is a great idea, and saves the product from spilling it could use some tweaking.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this product for years now and love the light but efficient coverage that it provides.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t color the most important on processing a make up order?  </li>
            <li>I love the matte, I was using the original for years but</li>
            <li>or so I need a touch up, but other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li>It had never occured to me that it may be bareMinerals, ya know considering they pride themselves on being good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 now and liquid makeups just don&#x27;t cover the same as they did when I had young, flawless skin.  </li>
            <li>Plus it arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>Almost worth it.</li>
            <li>I am sure that with this attitude you will loose many more in the future...</li>
            <li>This is a nice loose powder product.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping and exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>I really hope they NEVER discontinue this product because I will use it forever!</li>
            <li>my first time using it ...</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of bareMinerals.</li>
            <li>Have always loved Bare Minerals, but sometimes still felt shiny mid morning...</li>
            <li>How difficult is it really to doublecheck what you send to your customers Flawless Beauty Care?  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And the coverage doesn&#x27;t compare to that of true bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using bare escentuals product for several years now and am pleased with just about anything I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is minimal which is nice, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the matte finish and the regular.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have really high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li>I find that over the last year or more (since implementation of the new lid) some product is left in the container that you cannot get to when using it up.  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural, not like you are wearing  make-up.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and I not allergic to this foundation.</li>
            <li>I usually have to buy a light one and a darker one and mixing them together.</li>
            <li>obviously i like the bare minerals product, as I have been using their products for nearly 2 decades.  </li>
            <li>If you have been thinking of trying Bare Minerals....</li>
            <li>i have really red cheeks from the meds i take and this tones it right down ....</li>
            <li>In the mornings, I&#x27;m typically pressed for time getting ready for work and this is the fastest method.  </li>

            <li> The best foundation ever!! It leaves my skin being able to breath and not look caked on. I have sensitive skin and I not allergic to this foundation. I highly recommend this foundation.</li>
            <li> I was already a huge fan of the bareMinerals products, but this one is even greater!  It has helped my face look less oily throughout the day, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  SPF 15 is awesome too because I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting another product on my sensitive face.  It doesn&#x27;t spill out all over the place either because you can twist the edge to lock it.  So awesome!  I really hope they NEVER discontinue this product because I will use it forever!</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for many years.  Looks very natural, not like you are wearing  make-up.  A container lasts for many months.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  It came when promised</li>
            <li> This mineral foundation has small white balls in it that end up on your face when you apply it.  Not a bargain, threw it out.</li>
            <li> Shipping took awhile, otherwise its good</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish. I have ordered this product for years now and love the light but efficient coverage that it provides. If you have been thinking of trying Bare Minerals....don hesitate! You will love it! Especially if you have been using a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> The coverage is minimal which is nice, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the matte finish and the regular. Good price and came quickly! Would buy it again here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years now and continue to love it.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This is not authentic bareMinerals make up and its VERY obvious from the packaging to the color and coverage. Just compare what you get online to a jar you got from a store. The print on the lid and on the bottom of the jar are different.  And the coverage doesn&#x27;t compare to that of true bare Minerals.  I can&#x27;t believe I they can sell fake stuff on this reputable site.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years; it works for me.</li>
            <li> If you have acne prone skin DO NOT USE THIS.  Oh my god I had been using it for months and had been struggling with acne problems.  It had never occured to me that it may be bareMinerals, ya know considering they pride themselves on being good for sensitive skin.  Maybe it was just my skin, but by the end of the day my face was producing oils to try and get this stuff of me.  Sometimes it would sting my skin by the end of the day.  I was so dissapointed because it really was good coverage!</li>
            <li> Very good price and quick shipping</li>
            <li> I love this product ..I use it as a powder finish over my foundation, and it makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 now and liquid makeups just don&#x27;t cover the same as they did when I had young, flawless skin.  I have the airbrush system also, and it&#x27;s nice, but for the effort it takes to clean it after each application, bareMinerals is my favorite choice.  In the mornings, I&#x27;m typically pressed for time getting ready for work and this is the fastest method.  Also the coverage is so good and I feel it makes my face look younger than anything else.</li>
            <li> Nothing comes close.. I&#x27;ve tried off brands but nothing compares! I love the matte, I was using the original for years but the matte works so much better for me.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I thought! Color and texture not for me. To flakey</li>
            <li> Everyone raves about mineral makeup but I don&#x27;t like the way that it looks on me.  Maybe my skin type - I&#x27;m on the dryer side these days - just isn&#x27;t suited for this type of foundation.  Even when I prep my face with moisturizer, etc., it doesn&#x27;t apply well and I don&#x27;t see it covering those areas where I have slightly enlarged pores.  I kept it to see if it gets better with more practice but I don&#x27;t have really high hopes for it.  The click, lock and go cover is a good idea though.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how many complection flaws this product will brush out of sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets a 4 star because it is too expensive. Almost worth it.</li>
            <li> this is a great product ... my first time using it ...i have really red cheeks from the meds i take and this tones it right down .... love it ... would definately recommend it</li>
            <li> I love it, won&#x27;t use anything else!!!</li>
            <li> obviously i like the bare minerals product, as I have been using their products for nearly 2 decades.  the new lock and go lid is a great idea, and saves the product from spilling it could use some tweaking.  I find that over the last year or more (since implementation of the new lid) some product is left in the container that you cannot get to when using it up.  I feel that is a waste of product/money...  That is the only reason i couldn&#x27;t give 5 stars</li>
            <li> I really love this makeup! It goes on smooth and stays on for hours. My skin is more oily so every four hours or so I need a touch up, but other than that it&#x27;s great! It is a little expensive, but it works better than any other foundation I&#x27;ve used from drugstores. I bought 6 of these for a year long mission trip I&#x27;m going on and I am very happy with the amount of money I saved buying it on Amazon than Ulta or their website. Plus it arrived very fast!</li>
            <li> Very nice color. Perfect!  Me being bi-racial, I have a hard time finding makeup that matches my color. I usually have to buy a light one and a darker one and mixing them together. This does perfectly. Thanks</li>
            <li> NOT SO \\&quot;FLAWLESS\\&quot;. This order was a waste of my time!  I received a wrong make up color, different that I ordered.  Isn&#x27;t color the most important on processing a make up order?  How difficult is it really to doublecheck what you send to your customers Flawless Beauty Care?  Maybe if you would have acknowledged your mistake and sent me immediately the correct item, I would order from you again.  But no, you were not professional enough to do that and that is how you just lost a customer.  I am sure that with this attitude you will loose many more in the future...</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of bareMinerals. I like the product, but unfortunatly I got a shade to dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> makes my skin less greasy</li>
            <li> Still leaves my skin shiny</li>
            <li> Have always loved Bare Minerals, but sometimes still felt shiny mid morning... this MATTE finish Bare Minerals is the best!  Will continue to purchase this.... dont ever discontinue this type please!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and exactly what I wanted!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bare escentuals product for several years now and am pleased with just about anything I&#x27;ve tried.  This is a nice loose powder product.</li>
