            <li>and you have a nice glow the remainder of the day.</li>
            <li>it takes about 3 minutes to warm up, and steam lasts about 20 25 minutes before you need to add more water, but you shouldn&#x27;t be steaming your face for more than 20 minutes anyway</li>
            <li>Turn on ozone button as well, for more steam.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Its a tabe top mini steamer, so it does its job.</li>
            <li>Just could be designed better.</li>
            <li>First of all, when this worked, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I even steam my 7yr old daughter (from a great distance) and it helps if she has</li>
            <li>If you use with awareness, this product is fine.</li>
            <li>Works great especially that I am a mobile esthetician</li>
            <li>#1since it(vapor nozzle) can be unarmed to easily fit in my utility box</li>
            <li>This is a very nice item just like the ones we have seen used at the local spas in town.</li>
            <li>I really like it is a great product, is really easy to use, not heavy at all</li>
            <li>nice if you need to add some lavender or tea tree essential oil into the top nozzle (trap door to add some drops).  </li>
            <li>Distilled or spring water can be added easily to the top without any mess or fuss..very easy to use!!</li>
            <li>It is tabletop style and is great for plug in on counter for right after your shower or fresh facial cleanse.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and provides a steady amount of comfortably heated steam.  </li>
            <li>and I really recommend it!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly like the one used where I get facials.</li>
            <li>i also love the compartment for essential oils, so chic!</li>
            <li>If the coil is still hot, it will melt the container wall (no leak) which happened to us.</li>
            <li>After I use this facial steamer for many months I noticed&lt;br /&gt;work</li>
            <li>Broke the first time we tried to use it.</li>
            <li>Need to be careful if you have to remove to add more water and the coils are still hot.</li>
            <li>Not so easy to twist back into place.</li>
            <li>Such a huge inconvenience.</li>
            <li>This steamer is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It turned out to be a very relaxing experience and the time flew.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional esthetician, and I brought the stemer to offer at home services; I can say it was really worth it</li>
            <li>the hot water splash in your face, completely recommend it !</li>
            <li>It works well, just heats up really quickly and because certain parts are made of plastic, you have to turn it off shortly after.</li>
            <li>Used it once worked fine second time it completely stops working and shorts my plugs.</li>
            <li>Smaller pores, skin feels tighter and smooth, just find a toner you like for after and a mask if you have time...beneficial for younger or mature skin types.  </li>
            <li>I use this for sinus issues with essential oils to open up stuffed passages but also gives a nice facial at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of getting this as a gift for my adult children.</li>
            <li>In about 20 minutes my face is soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like the professional in salons</li>
            <li>performance is very similar,  to one professional and looks professional.</li>

            <li> This steamer is better than I expected.  What a pleasant surprise.  It is easy to use and provides a steady amount of comfortably heated steam.  I thought I might be bored sitting in the steam for a few minutes.  It turned out to be a very relaxing experience and the time flew.  I&#x27;m thinking of getting this as a gift for my adult children.</li>
            <li> I love this steamer!! I use it weekly, makes my skin radiant and it&#x27;s exactly like the one used where I get facials. I put a moisture mask on my face, turn the steamer on and relax. In about 20 minutes my face is soft and dewy. Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I purchased my silver fox about 6 yrs ago and it still works perfect!  I am purchasing one for a friend and saw some reviews I don&#x27;t agree with, so I thought I&#x27;d put in my 2 cents.  It is tabletop style and is great for plug in on counter for right after your shower or fresh facial cleanse.  I just kneel down and spend 5-10 min doing some breathing exercises while steaming...nice if you need to add some lavender or tea tree essential oil into the top nozzle (trap door to add some drops).  Distilled or spring water can be added easily to the top without any mess or fuss..very easy to use!! Turn on ozone button as well, for more steam.  My skin feels great after!  Smaller pores, skin feels tighter and smooth, just find a toner you like for after and a mask if you have time...beneficial for younger or mature skin types.  Firm believer in steaming and this is a good mini version that get it done!&lt;br /&gt;Love just before a date night with my husband because it gets the blood circulating and you have a nice glow the remainder of the day. I use every to every other day because I have oilier skin and need a deeper cleanse often, especially in hotter Texas summer months.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After one use it has paid for itself, considering the cost of a facial at a spa.  Remember there are different models. The most expensive model has an extended attachment that allows you to lay on you back.</li>
            <li> I use this for sinus issues with essential oils to open up stuffed passages but also gives a nice facial at the same time.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this steamer!! i have a bunch of facial treatments at home that i do and this steamer is the perfect fit!! i also love the compartment for essential oils, so chic! i would 100% reccomend this product. it takes about 3 minutes to warm up, and steam lasts about 20 25 minutes before you need to add more water, but you shouldn&#x27;t be steaming your face for more than 20 minutes anyway</li>
            <li> No, i received this item in lieu of the model number that I ordered; twice. I will be returning both items. Such a huge inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Works great especially that I am a mobile esthetician</li>
            <li> Used it once worked fine second time it completely stops working and shorts my plugs. To have this happen in front of a client was so unprofessional. Of course when I try to get a refund I&#x27;m 1 day over the return date. Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It works well, just heats up really quickly and because certain parts are made of plastic, you have to turn it off shortly after.</li>
            <li> I still have it. It&#x27;s not cheaply made and it still works. Use distilled water with it and don&#x27;t put any oils and other stuff in here. I even steam my 7yr old daughter (from a great distance) and it helps if she has a cold, sinus, or even just to clean her pores. Recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional esthetician, and I brought the stemer to offer at home services; I can say it was really worth it #1since it(vapor nozzle) can be unarmed to easily fit in my utility box #2 extended arm, for safety deasons, is great feature #3 It&#x27;s performance is very similar,  to one professional and looks professional. Expecting to buy another F-100 I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Its a tabe top mini steamer, so it does its job. Just could be designed better. The heating coils are close to the walls of the plastic water container. Need to be careful if you have to remove to add more water and the coils are still hot. Not so easy to twist back into place. If setting the container in wrong angle the walls will touch the heat coil. If the coil is still hot, it will melt the container wall (no leak) which happened to us. If you use with awareness, this product is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like the professional in salons</li>
            <li> First of all, when this worked, I loved it.  The steam production was great.  However, I tried to use this after only 2 uses and it no longer works.  Unfortunately, I threw away all of the packing material so now I need to figure out how and if I can return it.  What an expensive adventure!</li>
            <li> After I use this facial steamer for many months I noticed&lt;br /&gt;work perfect, if you dont  respect the line of water and put more&lt;br /&gt; is possible the hot water splash in your face, completely recommend it !</li>
            <li> This is a very nice item just like the ones we have seen used at the local spas in town.</li>
            <li> I really like it is a great product, is really easy to use, not heavy at all and I really recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Broke the first time we tried to use it. Very poor quality product.</li>
