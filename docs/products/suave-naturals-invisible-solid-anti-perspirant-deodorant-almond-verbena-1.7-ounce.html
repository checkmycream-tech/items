    <ol>
            <li>AWESOME!</li>
            <li>This almond verbena smell is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>almond and verbena are a great combination.</li>
            <li>The anti-perspirant works great.</li>
            <li>This is one of the great ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very effective for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;When looking for a clinical protection antiperspirant you want to get the best because of the high cost.  I can say that this is one of the best ones out there.</li>
            <li>loved the scent.</li>
            <li>Likewise, it provides superior protection on work-out days.</li>
            <li>This is a nice alternative, at a great price.</li>
            <li>I thought this &#x27;clinical protection&#x27; worked every bit as good as when I have used the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that I can still feel wetness, though, so it&#x27;s not the greatest anti-perspirant...</li>
            <li>certain, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>This is a lotion type anti-perspirant which goes on nicely and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>The scent stayed nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I honestly look forward to putting it on because it smells like a spa.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it&#x27;s advertised to be effective for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>fragrance is nice but did not clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li>This is an effective anti-perspirant with an almond verbena fragrance.</li>
            <li>The fragrance on this product is quite nice</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap works beyond good</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to be able to change it up.</li>
            <li>For me I apply right after I shower in the morning and get great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding that I need closer to 4 or 5 to get a good amount of deodorant on and feel like I&#x27;m getting adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>The scent of this product is definitely better than most deodorants.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat like a cookie scent, which is interesting as I have just received some cookie scented soap in the mail that will go well with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But what I truly love about this product is the scent.  </li>
            <li>The almond smell reminds me of wedding cake, and I love cake.  </li>
            <li>I would still prefer something more neutral, but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>This version has a light almond scent which is a nice alternative to the flowery ones.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>I have gotten to the point to where I love</li>
            <li>But even better, I&#x27;m also not smelling body odor.</li>
            <li>for the scent, I quite enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this product is okay.</li>
            <li>This costs so much more that I just can&#x27;t say</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I like it better than the greasy or jelly like concoctions.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like baby powder afterwards.  </li>
            <li>For the premium cost I was expecting an aroma of more commensurate quality.</li>
            <li>I love the clinical protection products out there</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I can’t get into the habit of putting my deodorant on before bed and not applying more in the morning, I tend to like Clinical Protection Deodorants.</li>
            <li>All of them recommend applying before bed time, but I have never been able to accept that.</li>
            <li>I love clinical protection deodorants...</li>
            <li>for the fragrance, it smells more like</li>
            <li>As with most clinicals, the directions suggest application at night.</li>
            <li>While its efficacy is enough to garner a recommendation, its delightful scent makes it enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>It is a gel form with a nice, fairly light scent.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a long-time user of clinical strength deodorants and love them.</li>
            <li>It is a rich luscious kind of scent.</li>
            <li>I get sweet almond and some kind of floral</li>
            <li>This deodorant went on smooth, lasted all day, and I love the almond verbena scent.</li>
            <li>I have experienced no irritation and my clothes have not been marked or stained.</li>
            <li>It blends easily with perfumes or lotions.</li>
            <li>Anti-perspirant deodorant is very mild.  </li>
            <li>It smells like cookies but not with a strong vanilla note.</li>
            <li>Although this product is labeled as offering &amp;#34;clinical protection,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not as strong as competing products from Degree and Dove.</li>
            <li>felt like the odor and wetness protection was fine.</li>
            <li>The product dispensed easily and spread smoothly.</li>
            <li>In addition these brands all offer several appealing scents and Suave Almond Verbena is a pleasant addition.  </li>
            <li>While the 24-hour use is accurate, the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; label could be misleading.</li>
            <li>But I was equally happy with the non-clinical version of this same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Suave products are sometimes &amp;#34;hit or miss.&amp;#34; A few are duds and some are great!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and sweet without being cloying or obtrusive.</li>
            <li>It seems to work about as well as its competitors though the Degree line which I first used remains my favorite.</li>
            <li>Originally when I started using this type of anti-perspirant deodorant I was almost turned off from continuing to buy it because of the price, but it won me over by the way it works.</li>
            <li>Scent is nice enough, but still smells of mass production (i.e. more like a sugar cookie than like herbal heaven).</li>
            <li>Suave Clinical Protection goes on smooth, dries quickly and has a nice, light scent that is not overpowering or loud.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good scent that is light and disappears shortly after applying.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The almond-verbena scent of this one is pleasant, not overpowering, but doesn&#x27;t seem especially to smell like either scent.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent and works perfectly - as good as the other brands.  </li>
            <li>Unless you really need it to seep in, it can be used after a shower like most people would use a deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of almonds, and I couldn&#x27;t isolate the scent of verbena, but I know that it works really well in conjunction with lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product but there is nothing to set it apart from others of the same type.</li>
            <li>It is not really bad</li>
            <li>my own scent easily combined with the deodorant which is one big difference I found.  </li>
            <li>Like all the other brands this Suave variety works great.  </li>
            <li>If you like mild scents, that is good, but I sometimes like something a little more to get me woken up in the morning</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh scent and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean and does its job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried some regular Suave deodorant recently and was very impressed with it for the price.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild and I did notice that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent that doesn&#x27;t stick around in any noticeable manner unless you&#x27;re purposely sniffing your armpits (weirdo. ;)</li>
            <li>Almost all Deodorants have a floral, fresh, or powder scent.</li>
            <li>I might actually seek out this Suave deoderant, however, on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance, and it definitely works!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to many fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Second, it smells pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>I know that’s kind of a strange way to describe a deodorant, but if you sniffed it not knowing what it was, you might want to taste it.</li>
            <li>This deodorant worked “ok” for me, but it could be more effective for others especially if they are used to this particular active ingredient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond that, the scent of this is very nice, but a bit too potent and lasts a little too long for my tastes.</li>
            <li>I was interested in trying this one because of the Almond Verbena scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really have no complaints about this product!</li>
            <li>Unless you have a severe issue that only this type of deodorant can fix, I&#x27;d go for something more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, I guess one of my concerns is how many of us actually need &amp;</li>
            <li>Would rather it be in solid form but can&#x27;t be choosy when trying to find something that&#x27;s going to make me feel confident and protected.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fine, and it seems to protect fine, I just don&#x27;t like that wet feeling.</li>
            <li>Suave makes other products using the same scent, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to choose products so there is not a mishmash of conflicting scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Off the bat, I&#x27;ll admit I generally seek out my personal hygeine items with a certainly flexibility based on what&#x27;s on sale, or what really good coupon came with the Sunday paper.  </li>
            <li>These clinical products are certainly a step above the standard anti-perspirant deodorants available and come at a steeper cost but in situations where more protection is needed are worth every penny, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The scent is a very light, clean almond, and it&#x27;s not at all heavy.</li>
            <li>I normally like a baby powder scent, but this scent is light and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the applicator types on &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants - the whole system in which you rotate the dial twice and a tiny amount comes up has never made me comfortable.</li>
            <li>know it says apply before going to bed, but who really does that?</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot, really a lot, so I’ve been using these “clinical strength” anti-perspirant deodorants since these were introduced.  </li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of almond verbena for this deodorant.</li>
            <li>It absolutely does the job for the 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do the manufacturers think we are really fooled?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much else to set it apart.  </li>
            <li>Sweating is not something a woman wants to talk about, but it&#x27;s a part of life.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it makes me sneeze quite a few times when I use it because of the strength of the smell.</li>
            <li>Greater amount of he active ingredients than name brands, and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I found this brand to work as well as other clinical strength products, but was a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li>This particular scent is really yummy.</li>
            <li>As for the new scent of this one, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>, I was just expecting a little more for clinical strength.  </li>
            <li>but I do have to put it on twice during the day since I tend to sweat more due to hot flashes and last thing I want to do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually noticed this scent with pretty much every clinical strength deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried - maybe it&#x27;s something that keeps the texture of the product stable.  </li>
            <li>It does keep me dry, but I would not say any more so than a regular strength deodorant.  </li>
            <li>This type is white, soft but it quickly disappears when applied to skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands and found that Suave&#x27;s has gotten better, especially this particular one.  </li>
            <li>At the time of this posting, the cost was within a few pennies of a brand I consider to be a little higher end, but prices fluctuate so much that the buyer will need to do her own</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way that the deodorant squeezes out of the small holes on the top.</li>
            <li>Subtle and gentle, just love it.</li>
            <li>I like to use clinical strength when I know I&#x27;ll be exerting myself, ie: during periods of heavy exercise or even when I know I&#x27;ll be out for long periods on a warm day.</li>
            <li>I usually have to use &amp;#34;scent-free&amp;#34; deodorants because I&#x27;m sensitive to many fragrances (I get migraines), but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much, but if I only use the suggested amount, it seems like the applicator drags against my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I have somewhat allergic skin, and it hasn&#x27;t triggered any sensitivity so far.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li>(remember those old shampoo commercials \\&quot;Suave does what their&#x27;s does for less\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>And not to give more details than are strictly necessary, but it takes some really heavy duty sniffing to smell it at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I think that the Suave Almond verbena regular strength deodorant has more protection for me than this one, but in all fairness, the active ingredient is different.  </li>
            <li>Although I was initially worried I would smell like marzipan, I was relieved to find the scent pleasingly subtle and warm.</li>
            <li>When shopping locally Suave Clinical Protection AntiPerspirant Deodorant is the most inexpensive one for me and usually it works just as well as Dove which is another brand I use.</li>
            <li>I tend only to need extra strength if I can&#x27;t shower right after heavy exertion, or if it is very hot.  </li>
            <li>Even when used as directed, I still experienced underarm wetness to an unpleasant degree, although it was lessened when I applied it just after a shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using several brands of &amp;#34;Clinical Strength&amp;#34; anti-perspirant deodorants for the last 4-5 years and all of them protect me better than the average solid.</li>
            <li>All of these companies package these products similarly inside a box and use a click applicator  with the most common size being 1.7 ounces.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Suave Clinical Protection line; the deodorants here work just as well as the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>The large container will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s only a minor issue with a product that works really well.</li>
            <li>But what wasn&#x27;t standard was how loud it was.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s some chalky-looking residue if I&#x27;m not careful while dressing, but not much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like there&#x27;s too much coming out at once, but at the same time, if you don&#x27;t give it enough turns there isn&#x27;t enough to cover your armpit.</li>
            <li>and it sticks to my nightclothes (which then forms a hard white spot which washing doesn&#x27;t easily remove).</li>
            <li>Although it takes a little time to dry (be careful getting dressed if you use in the morning instead of at night), it&#x27;s worth the wait as the deodorant has staying power--it actually works through hot yoga.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient (and percentage included) is pretty much the same like other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am a big fan of Suave&#x27;s products in general.</li>
            <li>The other clinical products I&#x27;ve used last much longer than that, offering two to three days of protection.</li>
            <li>But nope, it was indeed Suave, maker of hair care products, apparently trying to go in a bit of a different direction.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised when comparing prices that this is not particularly inexpensive.  </li>

            <li> I get sweet almond and some kind of floral</li>
            <li> This deodorant went on smooth, lasted all day, and I love the almond verbena scent.</li>
            <li> I have experienced no irritation and my clothes have not been marked or stained.</li>
            <li> It blends easily with perfumes or lotions.</li>
            <li> Anti-perspirant deodorant is very mild.  </li>
            <li> It smells like cookies but not with a strong vanilla note.</li>
            <li> Although this product is labeled as offering &amp;#34;clinical protection,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not as strong as competing products from Degree and Dove.</li>
            <li> felt like the odor and wetness protection was fine.</li>
            <li> The product dispensed easily and spread smoothly.</li>
            <li> In addition these brands all offer several appealing scents and Suave Almond Verbena is a pleasant addition.  </li>
            <li> While the 24-hour use is accurate, the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; label could be misleading.</li>
            <li> But I was equally happy with the non-clinical version of this same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Suave products are sometimes &amp;#34;hit or miss.&amp;#34; A few are duds and some are great!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and sweet without being cloying or obtrusive.</li>
            <li> It seems to work about as well as its competitors though the Degree line which I first used remains my favorite.</li>
            <li> Originally when I started using this type of anti-perspirant deodorant I was almost turned off from continuing to buy it because of the price, but it won me over by the way it works.</li>
            <li> Scent is nice enough, but still smells of mass production (i.e. more like a sugar cookie than like herbal heaven).</li>
            <li> Suave Clinical Protection goes on smooth, dries quickly and has a nice, light scent that is not overpowering or loud.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good scent that is light and disappears shortly after applying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The almond-verbena scent of this one is pleasant, not overpowering, but doesn&#x27;t seem especially to smell like either scent.  </li>
            <li> It has a lovely scent and works perfectly - as good as the other brands.  </li>
            <li> Unless you really need it to seep in, it can be used after a shower like most people would use a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of almonds, and I couldn&#x27;t isolate the scent of verbena, but I know that it works really well in conjunction with lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product but there is nothing to set it apart from others of the same type.</li>
            <li> It is not really bad</li>
            <li> my own scent easily combined with the deodorant which is one big difference I found.  </li>
            <li> Like all the other brands this Suave variety works great.  </li>
            <li> If you like mild scents, that is good, but I sometimes like something a little more to get me woken up in the morning</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh scent and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean and does its job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried some regular Suave deodorant recently and was very impressed with it for the price.  </li>
            <li> The scent is mild and I did notice that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light scent that doesn&#x27;t stick around in any noticeable manner unless you&#x27;re purposely sniffing your armpits (weirdo. ;)</li>
            <li> Almost all Deodorants have a floral, fresh, or powder scent.</li>
            <li> I might actually seek out this Suave deoderant, however, on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance, and it definitely works!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to many fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Second, it smells pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> I know that’s kind of a strange way to describe a deodorant, but if you sniffed it not knowing what it was, you might want to taste it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant worked “ok” for me, but it could be more effective for others especially if they are used to this particular active ingredient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond that, the scent of this is very nice, but a bit too potent and lasts a little too long for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying this one because of the Almond Verbena scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints about this product!</li>
            <li> Unless you have a severe issue that only this type of deodorant can fix, I&#x27;d go for something more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, I guess one of my concerns is how many of us actually need &amp;</li>
            <li> Would rather it be in solid form but can&#x27;t be choosy when trying to find something that&#x27;s going to make me feel confident and protected.  </li>
            <li> The scent is fine, and it seems to protect fine, I just don&#x27;t like that wet feeling.</li>
            <li> Suave makes other products using the same scent, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to choose products so there is not a mishmash of conflicting scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Off the bat, I&#x27;ll admit I generally seek out my personal hygeine items with a certainly flexibility based on what&#x27;s on sale, or what really good coupon came with the Sunday paper.  </li>
            <li> These clinical products are certainly a step above the standard anti-perspirant deodorants available and come at a steeper cost but in situations where more protection is needed are worth every penny, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The scent is a very light, clean almond, and it&#x27;s not at all heavy.</li>
            <li> I normally like a baby powder scent, but this scent is light and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the applicator types on &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants - the whole system in which you rotate the dial twice and a tiny amount comes up has never made me comfortable.</li>
            <li> know it says apply before going to bed, but who really does that?</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, really a lot, so I’ve been using these “clinical strength” anti-perspirant deodorants since these were introduced.  </li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of almond verbena for this deodorant.</li>
            <li> It absolutely does the job for the 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do the manufacturers think we are really fooled?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much else to set it apart.  </li>
            <li> Sweating is not something a woman wants to talk about, but it&#x27;s a part of life.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it makes me sneeze quite a few times when I use it because of the strength of the smell.</li>
            <li> Greater amount of he active ingredients than name brands, and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I found this brand to work as well as other clinical strength products, but was a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li> This particular scent is really yummy.</li>
            <li> As for the new scent of this one, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> , I was just expecting a little more for clinical strength.  </li>
            <li> but I do have to put it on twice during the day since I tend to sweat more due to hot flashes and last thing I want to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually noticed this scent with pretty much every clinical strength deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried - maybe it&#x27;s something that keeps the texture of the product stable.  </li>
            <li> It does keep me dry, but I would not say any more so than a regular strength deodorant.  </li>
            <li> This type is white, soft but it quickly disappears when applied to skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and found that Suave&#x27;s has gotten better, especially this particular one.  </li>
            <li> At the time of this posting, the cost was within a few pennies of a brand I consider to be a little higher end, but prices fluctuate so much that the buyer will need to do her own</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way that the deodorant squeezes out of the small holes on the top.</li>
            <li> Subtle and gentle, just love it.</li>
            <li> I like to use clinical strength when I know I&#x27;ll be exerting myself, ie: during periods of heavy exercise or even when I know I&#x27;ll be out for long periods on a warm day.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use &amp;#34;scent-free&amp;#34; deodorants because I&#x27;m sensitive to many fragrances (I get migraines), but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using too much, but if I only use the suggested amount, it seems like the applicator drags against my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I have somewhat allergic skin, and it hasn&#x27;t triggered any sensitivity so far.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> (remember those old shampoo commercials \\&quot;Suave does what their&#x27;s does for less\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> And not to give more details than are strictly necessary, but it takes some really heavy duty sniffing to smell it at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I think that the Suave Almond verbena regular strength deodorant has more protection for me than this one, but in all fairness, the active ingredient is different.  </li>
            <li> Although I was initially worried I would smell like marzipan, I was relieved to find the scent pleasingly subtle and warm.</li>
            <li> When shopping locally Suave Clinical Protection AntiPerspirant Deodorant is the most inexpensive one for me and usually it works just as well as Dove which is another brand I use.</li>
            <li> I tend only to need extra strength if I can&#x27;t shower right after heavy exertion, or if it is very hot.  </li>
            <li> Even when used as directed, I still experienced underarm wetness to an unpleasant degree, although it was lessened when I applied it just after a shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using several brands of &amp;#34;Clinical Strength&amp;#34; anti-perspirant deodorants for the last 4-5 years and all of them protect me better than the average solid.</li>
            <li> All of these companies package these products similarly inside a box and use a click applicator  with the most common size being 1.7 ounces.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Suave Clinical Protection line; the deodorants here work just as well as the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> The large container will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s only a minor issue with a product that works really well.</li>
            <li> But what wasn&#x27;t standard was how loud it was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s some chalky-looking residue if I&#x27;m not careful while dressing, but not much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like there&#x27;s too much coming out at once, but at the same time, if you don&#x27;t give it enough turns there isn&#x27;t enough to cover your armpit.</li>
            <li> and it sticks to my nightclothes (which then forms a hard white spot which washing doesn&#x27;t easily remove).</li>
            <li> Although it takes a little time to dry (be careful getting dressed if you use in the morning instead of at night), it&#x27;s worth the wait as the deodorant has staying power--it actually works through hot yoga.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient (and percentage included) is pretty much the same like other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am a big fan of Suave&#x27;s products in general.</li>
            <li> The other clinical products I&#x27;ve used last much longer than that, offering two to three days of protection.</li>
            <li> But nope, it was indeed Suave, maker of hair care products, apparently trying to go in a bit of a different direction.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised when comparing prices that this is not particularly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> The click was loud enough to wake my husband up on the other side of the door.</li>
            <li> I am never sure how much to turn it to get enough.  </li>
            <li> I had to double check this product when I got it and opened the box because it looks so similar to the other brands on the market that you traditionally associate with deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially distracting when used at night because it lingers in the air and is mixed with the scent of other products (shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from the other ones I currently have</li>
            <li> It is different than any other deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is not much different than other clinical strength deodorants.</li>
            <li> They do seem to last a little longer than regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> At 20% active ingredient, this deodorant/anti-perspirant seems essentially the same as other clinical strength deodorants I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It keeps areas dry that you want to keep dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of clinical strength deodorants, but I&#x27;ve found that there are a very limited number of scents that work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this design is to distribute wetter, less solid antiperspirant, but I wish it was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they last a long time, i can use less and at the same time, their smell is just never as strong and as annoying as baby powder scents as with regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly cheaper than other clinical anti-perspirants, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as Degree and Dove clinical products in my experience.</li>
            <li> And, my sensitive skin did not have a negative reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how it feels wet going on</li>
            <li> Why waste so much extra plastic?  </li>
            <li> It has a really wet feel to it when you apply it</li>
            <li> Part of what I like about them is their pricing structure tends to be on the cheaper side compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> $7 for one is pretty expensive, even if it is clinical protection strength.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, this works as well as any other deodorant that I have tried.</li>
            <li> with other creamy clinical strength deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, there are things I don&#x27;t like about this one.  </li>
            <li> Price is comparable with other clinical&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild---a little bit of almond scent, but not much.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, this scent, and this product work really well for</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you are an average person (i.e. average when it involves perspiration), maybe reserve this for gym days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that Suave Clinical works just about as well as Secret.</li>
            <li> One is that it has the annoying kind of application where you have to turn a wheel and little small bits of the product come out of holes.  </li>
            <li> B0009F3O8Q Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E, 13.5 fl oz (400 ml)]] than almond oil, with a slight floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li> After vigorous exercise, I do experience a little dampness but no offensive body</li>
            <li> I usually consider Suave to be \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; than other name brands</li>
            <li> Certainly not for hard sports activities, but this will give you all-day protection in the office or at school.</li>
            <li> No more stress sweating or flushing, no more embarrassing wet patches under my armpits.  </li>
            <li> The difference here is a few things.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to tell how much is left, and when you&#x27;re out, you&#x27;re out -- no way to squeeze out that extra little bit because you need one you don&#x27;t have another deodorant waiting in the wings.  </li>
            <li> I may just turn into Mary Katherine Gallager from SNL, constantly sniffing my armpits and getting weird stares from people passing by.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for some of us, it&#x27;s a bigger part than we would like it to be.</li>
            <li> versions of, for instance, Degree in the past.  </li>
            <li> Suave has followed Degree, Secret, Dove and possibly other brand names</li>
            <li> This one works just as well as my usual brand (Secret) as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I hate the baby powder stuff because it just doesn&#x27;t combine well with my natural scent.</li>
            <li> Odor was never a problem, but unfortunately it fails as an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> but they are rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I find that extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want to smell bad!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> AWESOME! Greater amount of he active ingredients than name brands, and much cheaper. Clean, fresh scent and long-lasting. Even in a Southern Afghanistan summer, this stuff lasted. I&#x27;ll never switch!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that Suave Clinical works just about as well as Secret. This is a lotion type anti-perspirant which goes on nicely and smells really nice. The scent of this product is definitely better than most deodorants. It is somewhat like a cookie scent, which is interesting as I have just received some cookie scented soap in the mail that will go well with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it says apply before going to bed, but who really does that? Unless you really need it to seep in, it can be used after a shower like most people would use a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, really a lot, so I’ve been using these “clinical strength” anti-perspirant deodorants since these were introduced.  Like all the other brands this Suave variety works great.  No more stress sweating or flushing, no more embarrassing wet patches under my armpits.  But what I truly love about this product is the scent.  The almond smell reminds me of wedding cake, and I love cake.  Yikes! I may just turn into Mary Katherine Gallager from SNL, constantly sniffing my armpits and getting weird stares from people passing by.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and sweet without being cloying or obtrusive. I would still prefer something more neutral, but it&#x27;s not terrible. Even when used as directed, I still experienced underarm wetness to an unpleasant degree, although it was lessened when I applied it just after a shower. Odor was never a problem, but unfortunately it fails as an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> I really like the Suave Clinical Protection line; the deodorants here work just as well as the more expensive brands.  This version has a light almond scent which is a nice alternative to the flowery ones.  Although it takes a little time to dry (be careful getting dressed if you use in the morning instead of at night), it&#x27;s worth the wait as the deodorant has staying power--it actually works through hot yoga.</li>
            <li> Almost all Deodorants have a floral, fresh, or powder scent. I was interested in trying this one because of the Almond Verbena scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is fairly standard. You twist the dial to push the product up. But what wasn&#x27;t standard was how loud it was. The click was loud enough to wake my husband up on the other side of the door. You have to turn it a bunch of times to get the product to start. Plan on doing that when you aren&#x27;t trying to be quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like the odor and wetness protection was fine. I had no complaints. But I was equally happy with the non-clinical version of this same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent. It smells like cookies but not with a strong vanilla note. It is a rich luscious kind of scent. It is different than any other deodorant. The scent stayed nice throughout the day. It blends easily with perfumes or lotions. I love this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant. These clinical products are certainly a step above the standard anti-perspirant deodorants available and come at a steeper cost but in situations where more protection is needed are worth every penny, in my opinion. I like to use clinical strength when I know I&#x27;ll be exerting myself, ie: during periods of heavy exercise or even when I know I&#x27;ll be out for long periods on a warm day. This deodorant went on smooth, lasted all day, and I love the almond verbena scent. I really have no complaints about this product!</li>
            <li> I have gotten to the point to where I love (yeah...need) Clinical Protection antiperspirant.  I&#x27;ve used other brands and found that Suave&#x27;s has gotten better, especially this particular one.  It keeps areas dry that you want to keep dry.  It smells fresh and clean and does its job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for a clinical protection antiperspirant you want to get the best because of the high cost.  I can say that this is one of the best ones out there.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am a big fan of Suave&#x27;s products in general. I like their stick deodorant and especially some of their hair care products. Part of what I like about them is their pricing structure tends to be on the cheaper side compared to other brands. I wish I could say that for this anti-perspirant/deodorant. $7 for one is pretty expensive, even if it is clinical protection strength. Unless you have a severe issue that only this type of deodorant can fix, I&#x27;d go for something more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this works as well as any other deodorant that I have tried. I applied it after a shower (just before bed). I&#x27;m not a fan of the applicator types on &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants - the whole system in which you rotate the dial twice and a tiny amount comes up has never made me comfortable. It feels like almost nothing has come out and there isn&#x27;t enough to cover the entire surface area. I often end up over-using it and it sticks to my nightclothes (which then forms a hard white spot which washing doesn&#x27;t easily remove). I&#x27;m guessing this design is to distribute wetter, less solid antiperspirant, but I wish it was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, the scent of this is very nice, but a bit too potent and lasts a little too long for my tastes. It&#x27;s especially distracting when used at night because it lingers in the air and is mixed with the scent of other products (shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer). Honestly, it makes me sneeze quite a few times when I use it because of the strength of the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of clinical strength deodorants, but I&#x27;ve found that there are a very limited number of scents that work for me. I hate the baby powder stuff because it just doesn&#x27;t combine well with my natural scent. But I don&#x27;t like perfume-y or fruit-scented deodorants and lotions, either. So I was intrigued by the Almond Verbena scent. I love the smell of almonds, and I couldn&#x27;t isolate the scent of verbena, but I know that it works really well in conjunction with lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, almond and verbena are a great combination. The scent is a very light, clean almond, and it&#x27;s not at all heavy. And not to give more details than are strictly necessary, but it takes some really heavy duty sniffing to smell it at the end of the day. But even better, I&#x27;m also not smelling body odor. Needless to say, this scent, and this product work really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue that I have with this product is in the dispensing. The directions call for 2-3 clicks of the deodorant. I&#x27;m finding that I need closer to 4 or 5 to get a good amount of deodorant on and feel like I&#x27;m getting adequate coverage. Maybe I&#x27;m using too much, but if I only use the suggested amount, it seems like the applicator drags against my skin. Still, it&#x27;s only a minor issue with a product that works really well.</li>
            <li> Off the bat, I&#x27;ll admit I generally seek out my personal hygeine items with a certainly flexibility based on what&#x27;s on sale, or what really good coupon came with the Sunday paper.  I might actually seek out this Suave deoderant, however, on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have somewhat allergic skin, and it hasn&#x27;t triggered any sensitivity so far.  Second, it smells pretty nice.  I get sweet almond and some kind of floral (I guess that&#x27;s the verbena -- and thankfully not a &amp;#34;mow-you-down&amp;#34; scent), along with a chemical note of something others have described as bug spray (yuk!) -- for me, it comes off more like &amp;#34;Play Doh&amp;#34;, and only faintly so.  I&#x27;ve actually noticed this scent with pretty much every clinical strength deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried - maybe it&#x27;s something that keeps the texture of the product stable.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but then everyone has a different body chemistry and I know that identical (pre-application) scents don&#x27;t turn out the same on everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s some chalky-looking residue if I&#x27;m not careful while dressing, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective for me.  I tend only to need extra strength if I can&#x27;t shower right after heavy exertion, or if it is very hot.  ...or if I&#x27;m going through menopause.  Yep, I may use this one for awhile.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of almond verbena for this deodorant. I normally like a baby powder scent, but this scent is light and soft. The anti-perspirant works great. The large container will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this every day. I shower at night, then use this deodorant. I honestly look forward to putting it on because it smells like a spa. I put it on at night because this type of deodorant works to plug the pores to prevent odor and wetness. If you put it on at night, then it has time to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; overnight and will provide you with unmatched protection the following day. I found this brand to work as well as other clinical strength products, but was a much more affordable price. I will absolutely buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Although this product is labeled as offering &amp;#34;clinical protection,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not as strong as competing products from Degree and Dove. On the plus side, it&#x27;s advertised to be effective for 24 hours. The other clinical products I&#x27;ve used last much longer than that, offering two to three days of protection. While the 24-hour use is accurate, the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; label could be misleading. It absolutely does the job for the 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, I quite enjoyed it. I&#x27;m a big fan of almond fragrances. This product smells like a blend of almond oil and baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this product is okay. It&#x27;s slightly cheaper than other clinical anti-perspirants, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as Degree and Dove clinical products in my experience.</li>
            <li> Suave products are sometimes &amp;#34;hit or miss.&amp;#34; A few are duds and some are great! This is one of the great ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice but did not clash with my perfume. And, my sensitive skin did not have a negative reaction to it. Likewise, it provides superior protection on work-out days. The downside is that it is a tad pricey for a Suave product. And, I guess one of my concerns is how many of us actually need &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34;? I wonder why this has become some sort of norm. Therefore, if you are an average person (i.e. average when it involves perspiration), maybe reserve this for gym days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For certain, this is an excellent product. It has a nice fragrance, and it definitely works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a week now.  It does keep me dry, but I would not say any more so than a regular strength deodorant.  I tested it with a brisk walk workout, and it worked well, but so do my regular sticks.  The difference here is a few things.  One is that it has the annoying kind of application where you have to turn a wheel and little small bits of the product come out of holes.  I am never sure how much to turn it to get enough.  The product page says 2 or 3 turns, but that somehow never feels like it totally covers my underarm area.  I also don&#x27;t like how it feels wet going on---I prefer a smooth-on stick.  The scent is mild---a little bit of almond scent, but not much.  If you like mild scents, that is good, but I sometimes like something a little more to get me woken up in the morning---that one is a matter of opinion!  I tried some regular Suave deodorant recently and was very impressed with it for the price.  This costs so much more that I just can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s cheap works beyond good</li>
            <li> Anti-perspirant deodorant is very mild.  I like it better than the greasy or jelly like concoctions.  This type is white, soft but it quickly disappears when applied to skin. It feels more like baby powder afterwards.  Certainly not for hard sports activities, but this will give you all-day protection in the office or at school.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is not much different than other clinical strength deodorants. The active ingredient (and percentage included) is pretty much the same like other more expensive brands. The scent is mild and I did notice that my own scent easily combined with the deodorant which is one big difference I found.  It is not really bad, I was just expecting a little more for clinical strength.  I think that the Suave Almond verbena regular strength deodorant has more protection for me than this one, but in all fairness, the active ingredient is different.  This deodorant worked “ok” for me, but it could be more effective for others especially if they are used to this particular active ingredient.</li>
            <li> At 20% active ingredient, this deodorant/anti-perspirant seems essentially the same as other clinical strength deodorants I have tried.  It works well.  After vigorous exercise, I do experience a little dampness but no offensive body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The almond-verbena scent of this one is pleasant, not overpowering, but doesn&#x27;t seem especially to smell like either scent.  Suave makes other products using the same scent, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to choose products so there is not a mishmash of conflicting scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with other creamy clinical strength deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, there are things I don&#x27;t like about this one.  It&#x27;s impossible to tell how much is left, and when you&#x27;re out, you&#x27;re out -- no way to squeeze out that extra little bit because you need one you don&#x27;t have another deodorant waiting in the wings.  The package seems deceptive.  They deodorant is in a tube inside the larger tube.  Why waste so much extra plastic?  Do the manufacturers think we are really fooled?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether to get this product depends on whether someone thinks they need a clinical strength deodorant, whether the scent is one they like, and how this one compares in price to the others.  There isn&#x27;t much else to set it apart.  At the time of this posting, the cost was within a few pennies of a brand I consider to be a little higher end, but prices fluctuate so much that the buyer will need to do her own comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product but there is nothing to set it apart from others of the same type.</li>
            <li> Scent is nice enough, but still smells of mass production (i.e. more like a sugar cookie than like herbal heaven). For the premium cost I was expecting an aroma of more commensurate quality.</li>
            <li> Suave has followed Degree, Secret, Dove and possibly other brand names I don&#x27;t know about in to the sale of \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; anti-perspirant deodorant.  All of these companies package these products similarly inside a box and use a click applicator  with the most common size being 1.7 ounces.  In addition these brands all offer several appealing scents and Suave Almond Verbena is a pleasant addition.  I usually consider Suave to be \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; than other name brands (remember those old shampoo commercials \\&quot;Suave does what their&#x27;s does for less\\&quot;? so I was surprised when comparing prices that this is not particularly inexpensive.  However a price of $4.12 an ounce as currently offered by Amazon it is definitely in the  mid to lower price range of similar products.  It seems to work about as well as its competitors though the Degree line which I first used remains my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the clinical protection products out there but they are rather expensive.  This is a nice alternative, at a great price. It has a lovely scent and works perfectly - as good as the other brands.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This particular scent is really yummy. I know that’s kind of a strange way to describe a deodorant, but if you sniffed it not knowing what it was, you might want to taste it. (Do not taste your deodorant, no matter how yummy is smells…..)&lt;br /&gt;Although I can’t get into the habit of putting my deodorant on before bed and not applying more in the morning, I tend to like Clinical Protection Deodorants. They do seem to last a little longer than regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> Sweating is not something a woman wants to talk about, but it&#x27;s a part of life. Unfortunately for some of us, it&#x27;s a bigger part than we would like it to be. I&#x27;ve been using several brands of &amp;#34;Clinical Strength&amp;#34; anti-perspirant deodorants for the last 4-5 years and all of them protect me better than the average solid. When shopping locally Suave Clinical Protection AntiPerspirant Deodorant is the most inexpensive one for me and usually it works just as well as Dove which is another brand I use. One thing I don&#x27;t follow are the instructions. All of them recommend applying before bed time, but I have never been able to accept that. For me I apply right after I shower in the morning and get great results. Originally when I started using this type of anti-perspirant deodorant I was almost turned off from continuing to buy it because of the price, but it won me over by the way it works. Now I can&#x27;t imagine not using it, so the price is no longer a factor. As for the new scent of this one, I really like it.  It&#x27;s different from the other ones I currently have and it&#x27;s nice to be able to change it up.</li>
            <li> I love clinical protection deodorants... they last a long time, i can use less and at the same time, their smell is just never as strong and as annoying as baby powder scents as with regular deodorants. This almond verbena smell is wonderful!  Subtle and gentle, just love it.</li>
            <li> Suave Clinical Protection goes on smooth, dries quickly and has a nice, light scent that is not overpowering or loud.  I apply at night, when I remember, and sometimes in the morning if I forgot the night before.  I get the same protection regardless of what time of day I apply it.  No odours or perspiration so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance, it smells more like [[ASIN:B0009F3O8Q Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E, 13.5 fl oz (400 ml)]] than almond oil, with a slight floral fragrance.  It&#x27;s a really good scent that is light and disappears shortly after applying.  I&#x27;m sensitive to many fragrances.  If something bothers me I will develop a headache within minutes of being exposed to it.  The Almond Verbena scent doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> This is an effective anti-perspirant with an almond verbena fragrance. Although I was initially worried I would smell like marzipan, I was relieved to find the scent pleasingly subtle and warm. It was truly a refreshing change from the suffocating florals and industrial strength baby powders that seem to predominate. The product dispensed easily and spread smoothly. As with most clinicals, the directions suggest application at night. I find it works as well regardless of application time. I have experienced no irritation and my clothes have not been marked or stained. While its efficacy is enough to garner a recommendation, its delightful scent makes it enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> I had to double check this product when I got it and opened the box because it looks so similar to the other brands on the market that you traditionally associate with deodorant.  But nope, it was indeed Suave, maker of hair care products, apparently trying to go in a bit of a different direction.  And it totally worked!  I thought this &#x27;clinical protection&#x27; worked every bit as good as when I have used the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; versions of, for instance, Degree in the past.  It is a gel form with a nice, fairly light scent.</li>
            <li> The fragrance on this product is quite nice and it&#x27;s light.  It works okay but I do have to put it on twice during the day since I tend to sweat more due to hot flashes and last thing I want to do is have stinky pits.  Would rather it be in solid form but can&#x27;t be choosy when trying to find something that&#x27;s going to make me feel confident and protected.  Price is comparable with other clinical&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use &amp;#34;scent-free&amp;#34; deodorants because I&#x27;m sensitive to many fragrances (I get migraines), but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s a light scent that doesn&#x27;t stick around in any noticeable manner unless you&#x27;re purposely sniffing your armpits (weirdo. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long-time user of clinical strength deodorants and love them. This one works just as well as my usual brand (Secret) as a deodorant. It&#x27;s true that I can still feel wetness, though, so it&#x27;s not the greatest anti-perspirant... but that&#x27;s not my concern. I just don&#x27;t want to smell bad! And with this, I don&#x27;t. Problem solved!</li>
            <li> I do not like this deodorant at all. I think it has to do with the application. I don&#x27;t like the way that the deodorant squeezes out of the small holes on the top. It feels like there&#x27;s too much coming out at once, but at the same time, if you don&#x27;t give it enough turns there isn&#x27;t enough to cover your armpit. It has a really wet feel to it when you apply it and I find that extremely uncomfortable. The scent is fine, and it seems to protect fine, I just don&#x27;t like that wet feeling.</li>
