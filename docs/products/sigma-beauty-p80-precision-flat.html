            <li>Dear Sigma,  I am soooo happy with the brushes I received from you!</li>
            <li>My skin looks flawless when using this brush.</li>
            <li>sigma brushes are one of the best.</li>
            <li>If you wanted to know which ones to buy, this one and the tapered one are perfect.</li>
            <li>The sigma p80 brush is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Very good for depositing and buffing out concealer.</li>
            <li>Great brush</li>
            <li>but works really great, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>Great brush for applying under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>It is really great for buffing in concealer around your nose and under your eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for buffing in concealer instead of using my fingers (which can often have the countereffect of pulling the concealer off my skin).</li>
            <li>and she loved the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good item.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I have tried the cheaper kind (Sonya Kashuk) and even the MAC, but this is my first time buying Sigma and highly impressed.</li>
            <li>I use concealer with a wand, but will soon be making my own.</li>
            <li>Arrival time very quick too!</li>

            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love this brush for concealer.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Sigma P80 brush, as I am with every Sigma brush I&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>Good quality with tightly packed dense bristles, I haven&#x27;t had the experience of any bristles falling out, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very nice brushes so far.</li>
            <li>it smooths out the product easily and evens it out.</li>
            <li>I have acne scars and this is great for buffing on my concealer and it does look cakey or obvious.</li>
            <li>You have to have a small brush for highlighting and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>This brush is great, very dense with a perfect design for concealing blemishes and small imperfections and does not waste liquid products.</li>
            <li>It is soft, gentle and washes really nicely!</li>
            <li>I love this brush and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>; that said China,,,not sure if 100% real....</li>
            <li>They are so soft and my make-up has never looked so good thanks to the use of these brushes.</li>
            <li>This is the mini brush of the larger flat top kabuki brush, and this brush is great for concealer, for setting powder, and for eye makeup.</li>
            <li>old daughter for Christmas 2014 as stocking stuffer with 5 more of these Sigma Makeup Brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like the way that this brush blends the primer and concealer effortlessly and best of all that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residual product behind, so you really are getting all of the product you are using.</li>
            <li>I love sigma, especially the Kabuki Line!</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are very soft which is nice especially for a kabuki brush</li>
            <li>I would also purchase the angled brushes and sigma&#x27;s flat top kabuki&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried if for much else though.</li>
            <li>The P80 is such a great brush for blending my concealer that my next order will definitely be a powder and blush brush!</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much, really work for concelar, the due fiber looks so neat, higly recomended for concelar or higlights</li>
            <li>now i cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>i mainly use this to apply my eyelid primer.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more products in the future from you!  </li>
            <li>I use this mostly for highlighting my upper cheek, not blush, but actual highlighter.</li>
            <li>great quality, i&#x27;m just an impatient person and prefer to use the F80 to do my makeup because this one&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li>, it is so soft, it doesn&#x27;t scratch your face or leave bristles on your face.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>surprised her with this gift and Sigma beauty</li>
            <li>surprised her with the additional gift that they sent to her</li>

            <li> and I really like how small the brush is so that if can get into every nook and cranny of your face.</li>
            <li> I bought three Sigma brushes for my wife (DUO FIBRE F80, DUO FIBRE F50, PRECISION FLAT P80)</li>

            <li> This brush is great, very dense with a perfect design for concealing blemishes and small imperfections and does not waste liquid products.</li>
            <li> The sigma p80 brush is amazing!! the quality is great! you will not be disappointed. I have acne scars and this is great for buffing on my concealer and it does look cakey or obvious. this brush is a god send! thank you sigma!!!</li>
            <li> I recently saw this brush through a youtube makeup tutorial and after that I was sold. I really like the way that this brush blends the primer and concealer effortlessly and best of all that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residual product behind, so you really are getting all of the product you are using. The bristles on the brush are very soft which is nice especially for a kabuki brush and I really like how small the brush is so that if can get into every nook and cranny of your face. I love this brush and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this brush. Very good for depositing and buffing out concealer. Especially in small places around the nose and under eye area.</li>
            <li> i love this brush. i mainly use this to apply my eyelid primer. it definitely has precision. it smooths out the product easily and evens it out. love this brush. definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes so far. Arrival time very quick too!</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic!  It is the best concealer brush I have ever used.  I have problematic skin and a lot to cover up.  This brush will do better than any you have tried no doubt!  Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Dear Sigma,  I am soooo happy with the brushes I received from you! They are so soft and my make-up has never looked so good thanks to the use of these brushes. My blush goes on evenly as does my eye shadow. With other brushes, it has gone on too heavily or fallen off the brush and landed elsewhere on my face. I will definitely buy more products in the future from you!  Sincerely,  Kimberlee Martin</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much, really work for concelar, the due fiber looks so neat, higly recomended for concelar or higlights</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do my makeup every morning without this brush! This is the mini brush of the larger flat top kabuki brush, and this brush is great for concealer, for setting powder, and for eye makeup. It is soft, gentle and washes really nicely! I wouldn&#x27;t do my makeup without it!</li>
            <li> Great brush but had a sticker over the &amp;#34;USA&amp;#34; that said China,,,not sure if 100% real....but works really great, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I love this..... expensive but worth, it is so soft, it doesn&#x27;t scratch your face or leave bristles on your face.</li>
            <li> Great brush for applying under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for highlighting my upper cheek, not blush, but actual highlighter. You have to have a small brush for highlighting and this is perfect. I haven&#x27;t tried if for much else though. I use concealer with a wand, but will soon be making my own. When I do that I will be using this for my concealer as well since I have two of these.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I initially purchased it thinking it was big enough to use to apply my foundation. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I expected! However! It is really great for buffing in concealer around your nose and under your eyes. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I have tried the cheaper kind (Sonya Kashuk) and even the MAC, but this is my first time buying Sigma and highly impressed. I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of YouTube videos and in almost every single beauty video someone was using a Sigma brush, so I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and had to buy one. The P80 is such a great brush for blending my concealer that my next order will definitely be a powder and blush brush! If you have been hesitant before, don&#x27;t be...it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I got along until I purchased this brush. It&#x27;s great for buffing in concealer instead of using my fingers (which can often have the countereffect of pulling the concealer off my skin). Good quality with tightly packed dense bristles, I haven&#x27;t had the experience of any bristles falling out, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This works well with matt foundations when you want to conceal your blemishes. My skin looks flawless when using this brush. I would also purchase the angled brushes and sigma&#x27;s flat top kabuki&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;overall sigma brushes are one of the best.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for concealer.  It does work well for under the eyes. I was surprised. If you wanted to know which ones to buy, this one and the tapered one are perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought three Sigma brushes for my wife (DUO FIBRE F80, DUO FIBRE F50, PRECISION FLAT P80) and she loved the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I surprised her with this gift and Sigma beauty surprised her with the additional gift that they sent to her (a SHORT SHADER E20 brush).&lt;br /&gt;Also she want me to say in this review that she recommends Sigma beauty brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Good item. Is as descibed on site. Purchased for my 19 yr. old daughter for Christmas 2014 as stocking stuffer with 5 more of these Sigma Makeup Brushes. All were as desceibed on site. She loves them!!</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Sigma P80 brush, as I am with every Sigma brush I&#x27;ve ever ordered. It&#x27;s definitely an asset to my makeup brush collection.</li>
            <li> I love sigma, especially the Kabuki Line!</li>
            <li> absolutely love it! now i cannot live without it! i didnt think it will make a big difference but it does!</li>
            <li> great quality, i&#x27;m just an impatient person and prefer to use the F80 to do my makeup because this one&#x27;s so small</li>
