            <li>so people have to replace them more often than they should.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love love love</li>
            <li>I really love this exfoliating mitt.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched for years for something like it and love the results.  </li>
            <li>After using the mitt, the skin is able to absorb the moisturizers more efficiently.</li>
            <li>I love this mitt.</li>
            <li>It is light and nicely assembled.</li>
            <li>It has turned my skin subple and has made lotions work event better.  </li>
            <li>I get a much better tan.</li>
            <li>Def love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and you can see it exfoliating your skin!</li>
            <li>I guess I just dont shed like most people.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 months and my feet are smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>I would warn that the size could be problematic for some people, especially men who weren&#x27;t blessed with dainty hands.  </li>
            <li>often cause I&#x27;m usually not overly thrilled with things, but this I am!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and your skin will glow.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, effective, works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Sort of feels like fine sand on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Super neat product!</li>
            <li>Skin looks so much healthier and absorbs lotions and oils better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of salt scrubs and loofahs but this mitt is not anything like those.</li>
            <li>This is the best exfoliating mitt ever, it has delivered mega results in the dead skin removal department.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly to watch how easily the dead, flaky skin and tan just rolls off.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>Great for removing dry skin, faded self tanner or berry stains.</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on time!</li>
            <li>I did not think I&#x27;d see that much skin roll off, but there was a decent amount on my legs which I found surprising since I thought shaving was exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>then I stand up and start to scrub away and its true</li>
            <li>..finger poked right out the top with first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After buying scrubs which cost the same amount as the mitt, I am already very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>start ripping at the seems with the first use!</li>
            <li>This absolutely works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had red bumpy skin on my arms and after one use, my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I was able to receive a spa like after glow without leaving the comfort of my home and without paying an astronomical price and MY HUSBAND LOVES HOW SOFT AND DESIRABLE</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Kind of gross too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And afterwards my skin was so smooth, soft &amp; glowing!!</li>
            <li>Amazing for dry skin even if you aren&#x27;t spray tanning.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this mit in my FABFITFUN box</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I stood in the shower for 5 minutes, and then turned the water off before exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>This mitt was really great for deeply exfoliating dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>Helps to make my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>price is higher then quality , my old one better than this one and it coast me only $5</li>
            <li>This item really works.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love this mitt, but as another reviewer said, it&#x27;s not very durable.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy..</li>
            <li>, I probably would not have cared all that much, because I would have thought \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>But at $19, I expected a better product.  </li>
            <li>I do not have much dislike for this product</li>
            <li>This mitt really exfoliates...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is really lightweight.  </li>
            <li>This washes out really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty cool to see the amount of dirt you see coming off, even though I use my earth therapeutics loofah/mitt several times a week.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s better than a loofah and other products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but so worth it definitely</li>
            <li>Given how well this mitt works, the $20 price tag was well worth it for me, but I might try to see what else is out there for my next one.</li>
            <li>All the dead skin rolls up and is rather satisfying to watch wash away.  </li>
            <li>I have used quite a few exfoliating products over the years and this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>is having to soak in hot water for 15 minutes and doing the actual scrub outside of the water, but the hassle is well worth the results.</li>
            <li>MY NEWLY EXFOLIATED SKIN FEELS AGAINST HIS.</li>
            <li>I have not seen layers of skin nor have I felt that my skin was significantly smoother than when I use other mechanical exfoliators.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always get a ton of grey dead skin rolling off, but it still makes my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>I made sure to apply pressure by pressing down on my skin rather than yanking the mitt back and forth.  </li>
            <li>Not a single flake, bump, rough patch...totally smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I also like the black color since some lightly colored exfoliating mitts or towels get icky looking pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliates extremely well but seems to be less effective after a couple months of use.  </li>
            <li>after standing in the shower for 10-15 minutes to soften my skin, I use this mitt to slough off my old spray tan.</li>
            <li>I will never waste money on a loofa again.  </li>
            <li>This really helped not only with smoothness, but with fighting winter</li>
            <li>Please go gently though around thinner skin areas such as wrists and collar bones.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say that it didn&#x27;t exfoliate and leave the skin feeling soft - it did.  </li>
            <li>It does exfoliate but is not harsh or abrasive.</li>
            <li>I see no dead skin on the mitt after using it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft without irritation.</li>
            <li>I used it 4 times so far since its arrival and it is barely functional.</li>
            <li>exactly what is expected of the product.</li>
            <li>If you have large hands, long nails, or are related to Paul Bunyan, this might not be for you</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t see any rolls of skin come off, but I re-read the instructions and realized I wasn&#x27;t pressing hard enough and there was too much water on the glove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not poorly made as some other reviews stated.</li>
            <li>First off, I have only used this twice after having it a little over a week.  </li>

            <li> First off, I have only used this twice after having it a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> but my skin color turned back to normal after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend saving your money and buying a sisal loofah (which I acknowledge does not last long), and a lotion with glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> Definitely exfoliates as long as you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft it took time to get the technique down pack</li>
            <li> You really have to rub hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other manufactures mitts with the same result)</li>
            <li> Dead skin rolls off, doesn&#x27;t hurt but takes a little arm muscle and time to do the whole body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried other deep exfoliators a while ago (like baiden (?))</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I can not live without this.  </li>
            <li> I get very dry scaly looking skin(stupid winter), and this gets rid of all of it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it but for about a week now so not sure about how long it&#x27;ll last but seems like it&#x27;ll hold up for 6 months like it says on box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rough, but not too rough.  </li>
            <li> The Dermasuri mitt is truly a deep exfoliator where you&#x27;ll see dead skin peel away from your body with just water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit scary at first because your skin turns a little red</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any skin being removed and I rub my skin until it is practically raw and extremely red.</li>
            <li> Works well but,soaking your face for five minutes is a little too long tobe practical</li>
            <li> and I use it every other week, so</li>
            <li> I know that the label says use every other week, but i use it everyother day with no issues.</li>
            <li> they were extremely helpful.  </li>
            <li> some other reviewers said, but I will update if it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin  being little dry, but this glove has changed all that.  </li>
            <li> how much dry, dead skin comes off each time I exfoliate with this mitt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also wondering if this mitt is overpriced because there are lots of hammam gloves or italy towels on the market for half the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: June 18, 2014 - I just downgraded this by one star because I have had this mitt for less than 1 month</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little longer</li>
            <li> Had trouble with in grown hairs and this helps exfoliate the skin</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe all the dead skin rolling off.</li>
            <li> The mitt made my dead skin peel away like I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li> The mitt fits well and helps to exfoliate without being to harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mitt for a few months now and don&#x27;t always remember to use it.</li>
            <li> I just bought a few as holiday</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t have that much dead skin on me as I thought I did.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the dead skin that falls off my body!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> you see rolls of dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li> After rubbing this on your body, you&#x27;ll see small dark rolls of skin peel away!!</li>
            <li> Also these things are quite expensive, IMO, so I believe that they definately should be sold as a set FOR THE SAME PRICE.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually a size 7 in gloves.  </li>
            <li> This still found dead skin on me.&lt;br /&gt;Loving it!</li>
            <li> I believe that I have used this according to directions, yet I have not experienced what the company and some other reviewers describe.</li>
            <li> The price is too high :(, the quality is even cheaper.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s so ridiculous</li>
            <li> Even though I use a body scrub with spa gloves every other day, I was still shocked by how much dead skin was sloughed off.  </li>
            <li> and it seems so unnecessary because there is no reason to believe that the mitt material cannot hold a stitch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like they are intentionally made poorly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely addicted to this.</li>
            <li> but it is somewhat poor quality material</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive body scrubs, just buy this!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical...and was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> So I dont think it is a wrong technique.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was first introduced to this mit in my FABFITFUN box and I absolutely loved it. It was very effective in exfoliating my skin without any pain or discomfort. My skin is softer then it&#x27;s ever been. I was able to receive a spa like after glow without leaving the comfort of my home and without paying an astronomical price and MY HUSBAND LOVES HOW SOFT AND DESIRABLE MY NEWLY EXFOLIATED SKIN FEELS AGAINST HIS.</li>
            <li> This thing is the bomb. Order and dont look back</li>
            <li> excellent product but why does company suggest replacement so soon.</li>
            <li> I love these mitts. I&#x27;ve been using these (not this brand) for over one year. This is my third pair. And that&#x27;s the problem THIS IS MY THIRD PAIR in about a year or so. These mitts (and I&#x27;ve tried other manufactures mitts with the same result) start ripping at the seems with the first use! That&#x27;s so ridiculous and it seems so unnecessary because there is no reason to believe that the mitt material cannot hold a stitch. It&#x27;s almost like they are intentionally made poorly so people have to replace them more often than they should. Also these things are quite expensive, IMO, so I believe that they definately should be sold as a set FOR THE SAME PRICE.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I get very dry scaly looking skin(stupid winter), and this gets rid of all of it. Perfect to use before self tanning, which I do. Skin looks so much healthier and absorbs lotions and oils better! Definitely worth buying! I don&#x27;t review items often cause I&#x27;m usually not overly thrilled with things, but this I am!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job it claims it does. The price is too high :(, the quality is even cheaper. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> This item really works. Had trouble with in grown hairs and this helps exfoliate the skin</li>
            <li> My second one. I love these. Great for removing dry skin, faded self tanner or berry stains.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!! I couldn&#x27;t believe all the dead skin rolling off. And afterwards my skin was so smooth, soft &amp; glowing!! I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliating mitt ever, it has delivered mega results in the dead skin removal department. I will be buying this product again</li>
            <li> I like it my skin is so soft it took time to get the technique down pack but so worth it definitely a purchase I&#x27;ll be making again</li>
            <li> I received one of these for Christmas and absolutely loved it, so I decided to buy another one. Shipping was right on time! I&#x27;m a huge fan of salt scrubs and loofahs but this mitt is not anything like those. I had no idea I had so much dirt and dead skin on my body until using this. The mitt made my dead skin peel away like I&#x27;ve never seen before. After rubbing this on your body, you&#x27;ll see small dark rolls of skin peel away!! It&#x27;s a bit scary at first because your skin turns a little red but my skin color turned back to normal after a few minutes. Best part is your skin will feel so smooth afterwards. I&#x27;m definitely addicted to this.</li>
            <li> This mitt is pretty incredible... after standing in the shower for 10-15 minutes to soften my skin, I use this mitt to slough off my old spray tan. It&#x27;s incredibly to watch how easily the dead, flaky skin and tan just rolls off. That being said, I love this mitt, but as another reviewer said, it&#x27;s not very durable. I purchased mine two months ago... and I use it every other week, so I&#x27;ve probably only used it about 4 times and there&#x27;s already a hole in the seam. I&#x27;m also wondering if this mitt is overpriced because there are lots of hammam gloves or italy towels on the market for half the price. Given how well this mitt works, the $20 price tag was well worth it for me, but I might try to see what else is out there for my next one.</li>
            <li> The mitt fits well and helps to exfoliate without being to harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> This mitt is really amazing.  Easy to use and your skin will glow.  Great product. I would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Works well but,soaking your face for five minutes is a little too long tobe practical</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and soft. I love love love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not poorly made as some other reviews stated. It is very sturdy.. The only thing I wish I had was 2 of them for both of my hands..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does exactly what is expected of the product.</li>
            <li> This absolutely works just fine.  I have been using it for about 2 months and my feet are smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I really love this exfoliating mitt.  I&#x27;ve searched for years for something like it and love the results.  If you&#x27;ve ever been to a Korean spa where they exfoliate you, this gets the same results.  All the dead skin rolls up and is rather satisfying to watch wash away.  I would warn that the size could be problematic for some people, especially men who weren&#x27;t blessed with dainty hands.  It fits just perfectly for me...and I&#x27;m usually a size 7 in gloves.  If you have large hands, long nails, or are related to Paul Bunyan, this might not be for you</li>
            <li> I am using this to exfoliate the winter skin damage.  This mitt is very efficient at removing dead skin cells.  I will never waste money on a loofa again.  After using the mitt, the skin is able to absorb the moisturizers more efficiently.</li>
            <li> These are great. I now own three. I have dry skin and as I have gotten older it sloughs off and using these in the shower works the best and the fastest</li>
            <li> This mitt was really great for deeply exfoliating dry, flaky skin. Even though I use a body scrub with spa gloves every other day, I was still shocked by how much dead skin was sloughed off.  This really helped not only with smoothness, but with fighting winter itch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not that jazzed about is having to soak in hot water for 15 minutes and doing the actual scrub outside of the water, but the hassle is well worth the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mitt for a few months now and don&#x27;t always remember to use it. When I do though, it works wonderfully. I don&#x27;t always get a ton of grey dead skin rolling off, but it still makes my skin super smooth. Please go gently though around thinner skin areas such as wrists and collar bones.</li>
            <li> Works well but overpriced.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates extremely well but seems to be less effective after a couple months of use.  Could be because my husband is now using it and doesn&#x27;t listen to me when I tell him no products are needed.  I plan to buy another for myself.  Dead skin rolls off, doesn&#x27;t hurt but takes a little arm muscle and time to do the whole body.</li>
            <li> I have to say - I used this as directed and didn&#x27;t see anything rubbing off.  That&#x27;s not to say that it didn&#x27;t exfoliate and leave the skin feeling soft - it did.  I purchased this to exfoliate before tanning and I think it&#x27;s better than a loofah and other products.  It&#x27;s rough, but not too rough.  Sort of feels like fine sand on your skin.  I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: June 18, 2014 - I just downgraded this by one star because I have had this mitt for less than 1 month and it already is coming apart at the seams.  Had this cost $5, I probably would not have cared all that much, because I would have thought \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;.  But at $19, I expected a better product.  I&#x27;m going to sew up the hole, but won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> price is higher then quality , my old one better than this one and it coast me only $5</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy to use, effective, works exactly as described.  My skin is softer and clearer.  I have used quite a few exfoliating products over the years and this is my new favorite. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this mitt. When I first used it, I didn&#x27;t see any rolls of skin come off, but I re-read the instructions and realized I wasn&#x27;t pressing hard enough and there was too much water on the glove. After I made those adjustments, rolls of skin were coming off and it felt amazing. I use the mitt about once per week and my skin feels incredible. Not a single flake, bump, rough patch...totally smooth and soft. I just bought a few as holiday gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Stephanie&lt;br /&gt;Epic Beauty Guide *com</li>
            <li> Was skeptical...and was proven wrong. Helps to make my skin super soft. Wish it was a little longer so I can reach my mid-back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive body scrubs, just buy this!</li>
            <li> Best exfoliatetor I&#x27;ve ever used - great for getting off old spray tan!</li>
            <li> I used it 4 times so far since its arrival and it is barely functional. It is light and nicely assembled. I do not have much dislike for this product but I don&#x27;t think worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 star.</li>
            <li> This mitt really exfoliates... even after using a scrub and another cloth. This still found dead skin on me.&lt;br /&gt;Loving it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolutely most favorite products out there! I can not live without this.  I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin  being little dry, but this glove has changed all that.  It has turned my skin subple and has made lotions work event better.  I have even given these as gifts to friends.  I know that the label says use every other week, but i use it everyother day with no issues.</li>
            <li> Super neat product! I initially thought it was the same thing as the exfoliating mitt I use by earth therapeutics but turns out this is meant for a different purpose. The Dermasuri mitt is truly a deep exfoliator where you&#x27;ll see dead skin peel away from your body with just water. It&#x27;s actually pretty cool to see the amount of dirt you see coming off, even though I use my earth therapeutics loofah/mitt several times a week. I&#x27;ve also tried other deep exfoliators a while ago (like baiden (?)) but it didn&#x27;t work like this one. Its great how my skin feel afterwards. It is smoother and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the rolls of skin coming off as everyone else did and didn&#x27;t feel any change in the softness of my skin. I do like using it on my face  once a week. Maybe I don&#x27;t have that much dead skin on me as I thought I did.</li>
            <li> I believe that I have used this according to directions, yet I have not experienced what the company and some other reviewers describe. I have not seen layers of skin nor have I felt that my skin was significantly smoother than when I use other mechanical exfoliators. I would recommend saving your money and buying a sisal loofah (which I acknowledge does not last long), and a lotion with glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the dead skin that falls off my body!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe I went all these years without it.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful to use before tanning.  I get a much better tan.</li>
            <li> This is simply amazing haven&#x27;t tried any others but I soak in bath for 5 to 10 mins just relax then I stand up and start to scrub away and its true you see rolls of dead skin coming off. Def love this. Haven&#x27;t had it but for about a week now so not sure about how long it&#x27;ll last but seems like it&#x27;ll hold up for 6 months like it says on box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had red bumpy skin on my arms and after one use, my skin looks and feels amazing. It&#x27;s smooth and you can see it exfoliating your skin! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This works very well.  It is really lightweight.  It does exfoliate but is not harsh or abrasive. I also like the black color since some lightly colored exfoliating mitts or towels get icky looking pretty quickly.  This washes out really well.</li>
            <li> This item broke during the second time I was using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 days for KP. I have not noticed any skin being removed and I rub my skin until it is practically raw and extremely red. So I dont think it is a wrong technique. I guess I just dont shed like most people. I see no dead skin on the mitt after using it. I can tell my skin is smoother after using it though so I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Excellent product . Definitely exfoliates as long as you follow the instructions. I exfoliate and then when I get out of the shower I put on a body butter all over my body. My skin feels like baby skin.</li>
            <li> This worked great for the first month. Then, it began to rip? I returned the item.</li>
            <li> does what it says it is going to.  follow the instructions.  they were extremely helpful.  will order again.</li>
            <li> It does work if you use it correctly but it is somewhat poor quality material..finger poked right out the top with first use.</li>
            <li> Great, rinses very easily dries quick. Bought a second one for traveling</li>
            <li> First off, I have only used this twice after having it a little over a week.  The first time I used it I stood in the shower for 5 minutes, and then turned the water off before exfoliating.  You really have to rub hard.  I read some reviews about the mitt falling apart, and I can see how that can happen.  I made sure to apply pressure by pressing down on my skin rather than yanking the mitt back and forth.  Takes some muscle to see the skin roll off!  Kind of gross too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it was about a week later after soaking in the bath.  I did not think I&#x27;d see that much skin roll off, but there was a decent amount on my legs which I found surprising since I thought shaving was exfoliating.  I have had laser hair removal, so I do not shave daily--just touch up periodically, so maybe I do not get enough exfoliation after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it does not fall apart like some other reviewers said, but I will update if it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying scrubs which cost the same amount as the mitt, I am already very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not to be gross but it&#x27;s amazing how much dry, dead skin comes off each time I exfoliate with this mitt! It leaves my skin feeling soft without irritation. I will buy this again when the times comes!</li>
            <li> Amazing for dry skin even if you aren&#x27;t spray tanning.</li>
