            <li>The price was excellent in comparison.</li>
            <li>The Belson Gold-n-Hot dryer is the best dryer, for the best price.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed that I immediately ordered 3 of them (one for my daughter in college, one for myself and one to give as a gift)because</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful, works well and delivers what it states it will.  </li>
            <li>Amazon offered the best price even with shipping charges added!  </li>
            <li>again, like me, use this perfect \\&quot;feature\\&quot; to your advantage.</li>

            <li>This product is great!</li>

            <li>This thing is very good.</li>
            <li>I have the thing on as I&#x27;m typing typing this lol, anyways, truly awesome</li>
            <li>I rollerset weekly so a good bonnet dryer is my best friend.  </li>
            <li>Not a problem because the bonnet expands beautifully to cover all of the rollers.    </li>
            <li>but it works great.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great product for the money.</li>

            <li>This Bonnet Hair Dryer is a great investment.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I made this purchase!!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>That Conair dryer is good for conditioning not drying my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the good thing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good dryer</li>
            <li>Good purchase for the price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dryer!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this dryer!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This awesome to use with leave in conditioner,sometimes I use it to dry my hair on the rollers,I get perfect curls every time ! :)</li>
            <li>I own this dryer....</li>
            <li>This dryer is compact and handy for me because I travel alot.</li>
            <li>instead of seeing it as a nuisance, let the hum lull you into a nice nap, or put on earphones and listen to an audio book, music or online tv program.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am totally loving this dryer</li>
            <li>so this came in handy for me when I&#x27;d roll my hair in steam curlers and then use this blower to set my hair.</li>
            <li>Ok, granted you would get laughed at, but come on, who sees you when you are drying your hair?</li>
            <li>The Belson is the best soft bonnet I have ever tried!!</li>
            <li>I have to say this is BY FAR the best $52.00 (shipping)</li>
            <li>Best purchase I could have made in a soft bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li>This soft bonnet dryer is great!</li>
            <li>It is compact and I am able to whip it out - much more quicly than the \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; Dryer I own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It drys hair in a timely manner and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>You can also travel with it knowing that you can do your own hair easy as 1 2 3.</li>
            <li>I came across this funky looking bonnet by accident on Amazon and was happy to read many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I love bonnet hair dryers for their convenience.</li>
            <li>The lowest heat setting is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>So I was deployed and needed to take better care of my hair.</li>
            <li>I really love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Gone are the days when I used to put off rollersetting my hair for weeks because I dreaded being STUCK under a dryer for 1 1/2 hour not being able to move.  </li>
            <li>Hats off to you! :-)</li>
            <li>the most uniformly.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>and i love it even more.</li>
            <li>but that is ok with me.</li>
            <li>so I could accomplish more chores while wearing it.  </li>
            <li>to 20 feet would work better for people like myself that have to multitask.  </li>
            <li>With the controls worn around your neck, you have more room to roam.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even practically give most of them away at yard sales</li>
            <li>and I hope to get many years of use out of it.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>maybe I should stock up just in case :).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for more than that...    </li>
            <li>I was nervous before I bought this, I&#x27;d read all the reviews and wasnt quite sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>Love love</li>
            <li>Works just like a head bonnet and fits most heads.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I waited a while and tried the dryer on low and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>One of my better Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>Gold n Hot!!!</li>
            <li>and I was excited to start roller setting my own hair.</li>
            <li>Most importanatly, this dryer is super effective.</li>
            <li>I feel that if I had an extension cord, I could easily walk around my apartment while drying my hair, because the design is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews I was beyond excited to get this product!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer and it dries my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>the WHOLE head gets dry because the hood beautifully covers the full head perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The low setting amazingly got really hot and was perfect for drying my sisterlocks.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very soft, and turned out very nicely.</li>
            <li>I was able to get comfortable and move around when I needed to.</li>
            <li>Also, I received my item sooner then expected, which was great!  </li>
            <li>So overall a great purchase for me, I strongly recommend it !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful that you can just let it hang while accomplishing other tasks.</li>
            <li>also the cap tears easily</li>
            <li>So, buying this product and making the purchase through Amazon was an easy choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very Convenient and perfect for my busy lifestyle.</li>
            <li>It was easy to walk around once I attached an extension cord.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a very good hair dryer and a easy way to dry with rolos.</li>
            <li>so today, instead of working, i washed my hair, put on my dryer, popped in my earphones, clicked on abc.com and watched full episodes of my favorite tv shows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked fine.  </li>
            <li>but it still works fine.</li>
            <li>This dryer was fine for 9 months, but today it began to smoke and now it won&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>It comes in a very compact carrying case which is handy for traveling.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is so comfortable that I can just relax, read, and doze.</li>
            <li>It allows you to be hands free and walk around.  </li>
            <li>Also, The hood is so comfortable and is soooo lightweight.</li>
            <li>From Daizy to Conair, none were comfortable, lightweight or affordable.  </li>
            <li>Also, the sound of the blower upsets my cats</li>
            <li>It comes out of the rollers feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is so lightweight and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It works like detailed.  </li>
            <li>I put some tissue paper in my ears to muffle the sound.</li>
            <li>it does the job of a bonnet dryer but still allows you to move around and feel quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using this Bonnet Hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Wash and sets are great and you can also deep condition</li>
            <li>The results have always been fantastic.</li>
            <li>This dryer dries so fast it is amazing.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good though....</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I had a hooded dryer previously which worked great, but I was stuck sitting at the table for an hour while waiting for trying to figure out the best way to dry my hair with out hurting my neck.  </li>
            <li>last plus, it comes with a very handy case to store both pieces inside -- the electric unit and the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to wear and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>and it is so cheap that I am going to buy 2 more for $12.97 so when this first burns out</li>
            <li>Well, within the first use, I FELL IN LOVE with this product.  </li>
            <li>It looks strange but works great</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I never got as far as drying my hair with this product so cannot tell you how effective it is!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and boy does it get hot!</li>
            <li>If I had known about it my life would have been so much easier in the hair care category. :-)    </li>
            <li>And it leaves my hair nice and soft -</li>
            <li>Overall, it is good and it solved the problem.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer so much</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but it tends to get very hot- even when on the cool setting.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use rollers, but other reviews says it&#x27;s great for that too.  </li>
            <li>but those tend to work better with more traditional bonnet designs.    </li>
            <li>I use mostly on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>Very Hot around the Chin and Neck...</li>
            <li>This one offers an interesting flair that allows you to not be bothered with positioning the motor unit so that it remains cool.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it dries my hair quickly, but one thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the bonnet.</li>
            <li>I saw this dryer and loved the design of it - thinking it would evenly dry my hair.</li>
            <li>but it did exactly as I wanted!</li>
            <li>specially when you touch the hot plastic around  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the soft bonnet dryers, but I figured that I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li>It will be well worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Although Belson and Gold N Hot products aren&#x27;t typically available at your local Wal-Mart and Target,(go figure), they do have an excellent reputation for making quality Black hair care products.           </li>
            <li>For instance, I am typing this review right now with it on.  </li>
            <li>This Bonnet dryer is very soft and lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I did research for a week before deciding to buy this dryer and there is no other dryer out there that can top this one in the convenience category.</li>
            <li>Does this baby get hot super hot.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about this dryer, and the best part is that it&#x27;s SO CHEAP, that if something goes wrong it won&#x27;t hurt my pocket too much to get another one.</li>
            <li>Pure perfection with my dryer!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife who had troubles in getting her hair dry and nice.</li>
            <li>The higher setting is a bit grueling.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even feel too hot on my face which I remember reading as a concern.  </li>
            <li>Its really hot and</li>
            <li>When I first bought it, it had a tendency to overheat and shut off.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I used it several times and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I had the Conair dryer first and returned it.</li>
            <li>absolutely gets the job done!</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Gold N Hot for years</li>
            <li>I bought it from Amazon in 2011 but Gold n Hot will not honor the warranty because it&#x27;s a discontinued item (now I understand why they stopped making it).</li>
            <li>The girl who did my hair had this dryer it looks so funny when i saw it</li>
            <li>Worked however it was extremely hot</li>
            <li>I use at least 2\\&quot; rolers and it fits very nicely.</li>
            <li>and my kids even wanted to try it and were impressed with how fast their long hair was dried.  </li>
            <li>Ok so all my friends laugh at me when they see me in this dryer because I look like a golden astronaut, but I definitely have the last laugh.</li>
            <li>I like the more direct heat of a soft bonnet dryer</li>
            <li>This one here dried my hair the quickest and (most importantly)</li>
            <li>I can dry my hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cord is pretty long and sometimes I attach an extension cord if I need to move around more.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself heats up quickly, is large enough to accommodate a whole head full of 2\\&quot;rollers and is also quite comfortable.  </li>
            <li>On my first use I was able to walk around and iron my clothes for the week, write out bills, &amp; read and by the time I was finished, my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li>After reading all of the positive reviews I kept searching for this dryer until I found it on Ebay.   </li>
            <li>It also dries your hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter if your rollers are very large-The Gold N Hot can accomodate.  </li>
            <li>I finally broke down and went online to find one and am happy with the Belson Gold N HOT.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use the dryer for deep conditioning treatments but I am preety sure it will work for roller settings.</li>
            <li>The air vent on the dryer needs to be able to breathe in order for the dry not to over heat.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hairdryer, because it is so much more convenient to let your rollers dry, while you are surfing the internet or reading a book.</li>
            <li>takes forever to get my hair dry, but it does work, and it is much more affordable than the ones at the salon.</li>
            <li>The high setting is too hot for me, but the low is just fine.  </li>
            <li>It dried my hair super fast and very evenly, much better than the dryers at hair shop that burn my ears without drying my hair.   </li>
            <li>I did switch it between medium and high when it got too hot.</li>
            <li>because yes, the High setting thankfully does get really hot), I purchased an extension cord, and also I was prepared to have my towel around my neck.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, after about 2 hours it cut off (I was using it on high).  </li>
            <li>At first I wanted to return this dryer because after 5 minutes of use on the high setting, the dryer began to smoke and shut off on me.  </li>
            <li>The low is hot hot hot already!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>You have both hands free and don&#x27;t have to fumble around with a regular hairdryer until you get cramps.  </li>
            <li>I am now ready to give it the review it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firs</li>
            <li>Fast Drying -</li>
            <li>Straight from the box</li>
            <li>Light enough to travel with too.  </li>
            <li>I paid 3 times as much for it too.....</li>
            <li>I just would be cautious because you really do get what you paid for and</li>
            <li>Sometimes I put a wet rag on my neck other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>Especially because I was so excited about this product.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving to purchase a PIBBS EZ Dryer and needed something for the time being other than a table top hood dryer.</li>
            <li>I have fine, long hair</li>
            <li>The dryer works fine but expect to need an hour to dry your hair</li>
            <li>I would only suggest the cord be a little longer to move around a little bit, but it is really comfortable to and has 3 heat settings, hot, warm and cool.  </li>
            <li>the next setting below that is the cool air, so</li>
            <li>I also like that it has four different heat settings, including a cool.  </li>
            <li>For the small investment, I was not looking for a salon quality product, just something handy for me to give my hair a break from the wear and tear of the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Never did I imagine that bonnett hair dryers were still in production and could be purchased brand new!  </li>
            <li>but since you don&#x27;t find them very often in the stores I have put off getting a new one for some time.  </li>
            <li>First of all, compared to all the other soft bonnet dryers I&#x27;ve tried (the ones with the elastic band that you tighten around the rollers) this is quite easy to slip on over my rollers (the huge grey ones).</li>
            <li>The back dries twice as quickly as the front.</li>
            <li>it dries my \\&quot;african american\\&quot; hair quickly, thoroughly/evenly and straightens it out like i&#x27;ve had a perm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone....</li>
            <li>The high setting is much to high and will burn out the motor.</li>
            <li>I should not need to use the high setting after all.</li>
            <li>but this one allows me to have a little more freedom.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a giant gold tooth when it inflates, it&#x27;s really quite funny</li>
            <li>Just know, it is awkward and loud and you&#x27;ll want to wear a tank top or a light Tshirt while it&#x27;s blowing because you&#x27;ll get very hot.</li>
            <li>but I stayed under for another 30 minutes, 1 hour total to make sure thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li>I live in the UK and I purchased this product in the Amazon Marketplace.</li>
            <li>Very loud -</li>
            <li>Then I was left with a flat hair bonnet because it had a huge melted hole.</li>
            <li>The soft bonnet melted because of the head that my hair dryer was putting into it!</li>
            <li>I will be the first to buy it, even if they charge double the amount in cost.</li>
            <li>I removed the packaging and tried it out for the first time the same evening.</li>
            <li>It is ionic and my hair comes out soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>More comfortable than any other soft or hard bonnet</li>
            <li>My rollers are large enough that the air stays inside of the bonnet and not in my face.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>This is so much better than sitting under a hard bonnet hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have natural, \\&quot;Black\\&quot; hair and use this dryer to set my twists.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend \\&quot;Belson Gold-N-Hot Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer\\&quot;; as a matter-of-fact, I have.  </li>
            <li>For me, a hooded air dryer was not a consideration; for my number one must was to get a soft bonnet.  </li>
            <li>the natural heat from the sun, plus the dust was doing a number on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Because of the design, I also wouldn&#x27;t really use it if you are just doing deep conditioning treatments.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soft bonnet about 2 months ago.</li>
            <li>I had no issues with smoking or overheating so far.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn the head and actually dries fast.</li>
            <li>I have to get use to the loud motor around my neck.    </li>
            <li>So, I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li>really noisy, second, that it may require some of the conair&#x27;s dryer after the 70 min.</li>
            <li>I am a naturally kinky curly girl with 4C Hair and purchased this dryer so that I can set my twists, braid outs, etc.</li>
            <li>B0012DOK9Q Belson Gold-N-Hot Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer]]</li>
            <li>They are more expensive but worth the cost.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s kind off frustrating.</li>
            <li>This dryer gets so hot that I turned it down to the cool setting to dry my hair</li>
            <li>I can only stand it on low temp, the high temp is way too intense for me.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would like is, if Belson can ever make this exact dryer with a quiet motor (and I hope they do)</li>
            <li>/&gt;2) Product seems to be made a while ago, meaning even if new the product was made back in 2004.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>yes it is hot just like EVERY other dryer.</li>
            <li>It dries my thick coarse hair quickly and there is room for my large rollers.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I leaned over and the air intake/exhaust area got covered for a few seconds and it shut off and took so long to cool enough for me to turn it back on</li>
            <li>(low is really fine and gets hot enough to dry my long hair which is down my mid-back)and</li>
            <li>The most popular brands on the market fail miserably when it comes to caring for and keeping Black hair healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>I also love that it has all settings hot and cold.</li>
            <li>I thought ebay was my only option for replacing an old bonnet hair dryer</li>
            <li>After it played out, I went on ebay and found a vintage Lady Dazey that I later gave to Goodwill after I went natural.  </li>
            <li>I wish someone would make a soft bonnet dryer with this design that actually works.</li>
            <li>It does great with my thick long hair; it dried it no time!</li>
            <li>Since it fits around my head, my entire head was dry rather than just drying the top of  and having to maneuver to get the back of my head dried.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to dry the hair late at night with a semi quiet motor while others are in the house that need a semi quiet atmosphere.   </li>
            <li>If they make this dryer with a quiet motor, Belson will completely outdo themselves because there are dryers out there with quiet motors.  </li>
            <li>It may look silly, and we had our laughs the first time I used the dryer -- but it worked better than other bonnet/hose type dryers.  </li>
            <li>I would never even give my roller sets a chance to dry completely because I just couldn&#x27;t bare to sit under there for an hour.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say that I don&#x27;t have faith in Belson because I have some products from them that have lasted a long time so far.   </li>
            <li>The plastic tends to get hot after a few minutes, so I pull it off my neck .</li>
            <li>it dries my thick hair fairly quickly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use too much heat on my hair so it might be a little damaging.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> it is the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> The price was excellent in comparison.</li>
            <li> The Belson Gold-n-Hot dryer is the best dryer, for the best price.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed that I immediately ordered 3 of them (one for my daughter in college, one for myself and one to give as a gift)because</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful, works well and delivers what it states it will.  </li>
            <li> Amazon offered the best price even with shipping charges added!  </li>
            <li> again, like me, use this perfect \\&quot;feature\\&quot; to your advantage.</li>

            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> So I ordered this dryer-bonnet combo as opposed to buying the two separately to save space and cash... and its turned out to be great!!</li>

            <li> This thing is very good.</li>
            <li> I have the thing on as I&#x27;m typing typing this lol, anyways, truly awesome</li>
            <li> I rollerset weekly so a good bonnet dryer is my best friend.  </li>
            <li> Not a problem because the bonnet expands beautifully to cover all of the rollers.    </li>
            <li> but it works great.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> the price is so great.</li>

            <li> I am glad that I made this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> That Conair dryer is good for conditioning not drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the good thing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good dryer</li>
            <li> Good purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this dryer!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This awesome to use with leave in conditioner,sometimes I use it to dry my hair on the rollers,I get perfect curls every time ! :)</li>
            <li> I own this dryer....</li>
            <li> This dryer is compact and handy for me because I travel alot.</li>
            <li> instead of seeing it as a nuisance, let the hum lull you into a nice nap, or put on earphones and listen to an audio book, music or online tv program.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am totally loving this dryer</li>
            <li> so this came in handy for me when I&#x27;d roll my hair in steam curlers and then use this blower to set my hair.</li>
            <li> Ok, granted you would get laughed at, but come on, who sees you when you are drying your hair?</li>
            <li> The Belson is the best soft bonnet I have ever tried!!</li>
            <li> I have to say this is BY FAR the best $52.00 (shipping)</li>
            <li> Best purchase I could have made in a soft bonnet dryer.  </li>
            <li> This soft bonnet dryer is great!</li>
            <li> It is compact and I am able to whip it out - much more quicly than the \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; Dryer I own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It drys hair in a timely manner and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> You can also travel with it knowing that you can do your own hair easy as 1 2 3.</li>
            <li> I came across this funky looking bonnet by accident on Amazon and was happy to read many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I love bonnet hair dryers for their convenience.</li>
            <li> The lowest heat setting is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> So I was deployed and needed to take better care of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Gone are the days when I used to put off rollersetting my hair for weeks because I dreaded being STUCK under a dryer for 1 1/2 hour not being able to move.  </li>
            <li> Hats off to you! :-)</li>
            <li> the most uniformly.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> and i love it even more.</li>
            <li> but that is ok with me.</li>
            <li> so I could accomplish more chores while wearing it.  </li>
            <li> to 20 feet would work better for people like myself that have to multitask.  </li>
            <li> With the controls worn around your neck, you have more room to roam.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even practically give most of them away at yard sales</li>
            <li> and I hope to get many years of use out of it.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> maybe I should stock up just in case :).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ask for more than that...    </li>
            <li> I was nervous before I bought this, I&#x27;d read all the reviews and wasnt quite sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> Love love</li>
            <li> Works just like a head bonnet and fits most heads.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I waited a while and tried the dryer on low and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> One of my better Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> Gold n Hot!!!</li>
            <li> and I was excited to start roller setting my own hair.</li>
            <li> Most importanatly, this dryer is super effective.</li>
            <li> I feel that if I had an extension cord, I could easily walk around my apartment while drying my hair, because the design is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was beyond excited to get this product!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and it dries my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> the WHOLE head gets dry because the hood beautifully covers the full head perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The low setting amazingly got really hot and was perfect for drying my sisterlocks.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very soft, and turned out very nicely.</li>
            <li> I was able to get comfortable and move around when I needed to.</li>
            <li> Also, I received my item sooner then expected, which was great!  </li>
            <li> So overall a great purchase for me, I strongly recommend it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful that you can just let it hang while accomplishing other tasks.</li>
            <li> also the cap tears easily</li>
            <li> So, buying this product and making the purchase through Amazon was an easy choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very Convenient and perfect for my busy lifestyle.</li>
            <li> It was easy to walk around once I attached an extension cord.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to use</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a very good hair dryer and a easy way to dry with rolos.</li>
            <li> so today, instead of working, i washed my hair, put on my dryer, popped in my earphones, clicked on abc.com and watched full episodes of my favorite tv shows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked fine.  </li>
            <li> but it still works fine.</li>
            <li> This dryer was fine for 9 months, but today it began to smoke and now it won&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very compact carrying case which is handy for traveling.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is so comfortable that I can just relax, read, and doze.</li>
            <li> It allows you to be hands free and walk around.  </li>
            <li> Also, The hood is so comfortable and is soooo lightweight.</li>
            <li> From Daizy to Conair, none were comfortable, lightweight or affordable.  </li>
            <li> Also, the sound of the blower upsets my cats</li>
            <li> It comes out of the rollers feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is so lightweight and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It works like detailed.  </li>
            <li> I put some tissue paper in my ears to muffle the sound.</li>
            <li> it does the job of a bonnet dryer but still allows you to move around and feel quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using this Bonnet Hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Wash and sets are great and you can also deep condition</li>
            <li> The results have always been fantastic.</li>
            <li> This dryer dries so fast it is amazing.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good though....</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I had a hooded dryer previously which worked great, but I was stuck sitting at the table for an hour while waiting for trying to figure out the best way to dry my hair with out hurting my neck.  </li>
            <li> last plus, it comes with a very handy case to store both pieces inside -- the electric unit and the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to wear and it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> and it is so cheap that I am going to buy 2 more for $12.97 so when this first burns out</li>
            <li> Well, within the first use, I FELL IN LOVE with this product.  </li>
            <li> It looks strange but works great</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I never got as far as drying my hair with this product so cannot tell you how effective it is!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and boy does it get hot!</li>
            <li> If I had known about it my life would have been so much easier in the hair care category. :-)    </li>
            <li> And it leaves my hair nice and soft -</li>
            <li> Overall, it is good and it solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer so much</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but it tends to get very hot- even when on the cool setting.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use rollers, but other reviews says it&#x27;s great for that too.  </li>
            <li> but those tend to work better with more traditional bonnet designs.    </li>
            <li> I use mostly on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> Very Hot around the Chin and Neck...</li>
            <li> This one offers an interesting flair that allows you to not be bothered with positioning the motor unit so that it remains cool.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it dries my hair quickly, but one thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the bonnet.</li>
            <li> I saw this dryer and loved the design of it - thinking it would evenly dry my hair.</li>
            <li> but it did exactly as I wanted!</li>
            <li> specially when you touch the hot plastic around  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the soft bonnet dryers, but I figured that I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> It will be well worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Although Belson and Gold N Hot products aren&#x27;t typically available at your local Wal-Mart and Target,(go figure), they do have an excellent reputation for making quality Black hair care products.           </li>
            <li> For instance, I am typing this review right now with it on.  </li>
            <li> This Bonnet dryer is very soft and lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I did research for a week before deciding to buy this dryer and there is no other dryer out there that can top this one in the convenience category.</li>
            <li> Does this baby get hot super hot.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this dryer, and the best part is that it&#x27;s SO CHEAP, that if something goes wrong it won&#x27;t hurt my pocket too much to get another one.</li>
            <li> Pure perfection with my dryer!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who had troubles in getting her hair dry and nice.</li>
            <li> The higher setting is a bit grueling.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even feel too hot on my face which I remember reading as a concern.  </li>
            <li> Its really hot and</li>
            <li> When I first bought it, it had a tendency to overheat and shut off.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I used it several times and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I had the Conair dryer first and returned it.</li>
            <li> absolutely gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Gold N Hot for years</li>
            <li> I bought it from Amazon in 2011 but Gold n Hot will not honor the warranty because it&#x27;s a discontinued item (now I understand why they stopped making it).</li>
            <li> The girl who did my hair had this dryer it looks so funny when i saw it</li>
            <li> Worked however it was extremely hot</li>
            <li> I use at least 2\\&quot; rolers and it fits very nicely.</li>
            <li> and my kids even wanted to try it and were impressed with how fast their long hair was dried.  </li>
            <li> Ok so all my friends laugh at me when they see me in this dryer because I look like a golden astronaut, but I definitely have the last laugh.</li>
            <li> I like the more direct heat of a soft bonnet dryer</li>
            <li> This one here dried my hair the quickest and (most importantly)</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cord is pretty long and sometimes I attach an extension cord if I need to move around more.  </li>
            <li> The dryer itself heats up quickly, is large enough to accommodate a whole head full of 2\\&quot;rollers and is also quite comfortable.  </li>
            <li> On my first use I was able to walk around and iron my clothes for the week, write out bills, &amp; read and by the time I was finished, my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews I kept searching for this dryer until I found it on Ebay.   </li>
            <li> It also dries your hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter if your rollers are very large-The Gold N Hot can accomodate.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and went online to find one and am happy with the Belson Gold N HOT.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use the dryer for deep conditioning treatments but I am preety sure it will work for roller settings.</li>
            <li> The air vent on the dryer needs to be able to breathe in order for the dry not to over heat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer, because it is so much more convenient to let your rollers dry, while you are surfing the internet or reading a book.</li>
            <li> takes forever to get my hair dry, but it does work, and it is much more affordable than the ones at the salon.</li>
            <li> The high setting is too hot for me, but the low is just fine.  </li>
            <li> It dried my hair super fast and very evenly, much better than the dryers at hair shop that burn my ears without drying my hair.   </li>
            <li> I did switch it between medium and high when it got too hot.</li>
            <li> because yes, the High setting thankfully does get really hot), I purchased an extension cord, and also I was prepared to have my towel around my neck.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, after about 2 hours it cut off (I was using it on high).  </li>
            <li> At first I wanted to return this dryer because after 5 minutes of use on the high setting, the dryer began to smoke and shut off on me.  </li>
            <li> The low is hot hot hot already!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> You have both hands free and don&#x27;t have to fumble around with a regular hairdryer until you get cramps.  </li>
            <li> I am now ready to give it the review it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firs</li>
            <li> Fast Drying -</li>
            <li> Straight from the box</li>
            <li> Light enough to travel with too.  </li>
            <li> I paid 3 times as much for it too.....</li>
            <li> I just would be cautious because you really do get what you paid for and</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put a wet rag on my neck other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Especially because I was so excited about this product.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving to purchase a PIBBS EZ Dryer and needed something for the time being other than a table top hood dryer.</li>
            <li> I have fine, long hair</li>
            <li> The dryer works fine but expect to need an hour to dry your hair</li>
            <li> I would only suggest the cord be a little longer to move around a little bit, but it is really comfortable to and has 3 heat settings, hot, warm and cool.  </li>
            <li> the next setting below that is the cool air, so</li>
            <li> I also like that it has four different heat settings, including a cool.  </li>
            <li> For the small investment, I was not looking for a salon quality product, just something handy for me to give my hair a break from the wear and tear of the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Never did I imagine that bonnett hair dryers were still in production and could be purchased brand new!  </li>
            <li> but since you don&#x27;t find them very often in the stores I have put off getting a new one for some time.  </li>
            <li> First of all, compared to all the other soft bonnet dryers I&#x27;ve tried (the ones with the elastic band that you tighten around the rollers) this is quite easy to slip on over my rollers (the huge grey ones).</li>
            <li> The back dries twice as quickly as the front.</li>
            <li> it dries my \\&quot;african american\\&quot; hair quickly, thoroughly/evenly and straightens it out like i&#x27;ve had a perm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone....</li>
            <li> The high setting is much to high and will burn out the motor.</li>
            <li> I should not need to use the high setting after all.</li>
            <li> but this one allows me to have a little more freedom.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a giant gold tooth when it inflates, it&#x27;s really quite funny</li>
            <li> Just know, it is awkward and loud and you&#x27;ll want to wear a tank top or a light Tshirt while it&#x27;s blowing because you&#x27;ll get very hot.</li>
            <li> but I stayed under for another 30 minutes, 1 hour total to make sure thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li> I live in the UK and I purchased this product in the Amazon Marketplace.</li>
            <li> Very loud -</li>
            <li> Then I was left with a flat hair bonnet because it had a huge melted hole.</li>
            <li> The soft bonnet melted because of the head that my hair dryer was putting into it!</li>
            <li> I will be the first to buy it, even if they charge double the amount in cost.</li>
            <li> I removed the packaging and tried it out for the first time the same evening.</li>
            <li> It is ionic and my hair comes out soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> More comfortable than any other soft or hard bonnet</li>
            <li> My rollers are large enough that the air stays inside of the bonnet and not in my face.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> This is so much better than sitting under a hard bonnet hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have natural, \\&quot;Black\\&quot; hair and use this dryer to set my twists.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend \\&quot;Belson Gold-N-Hot Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer\\&quot;; as a matter-of-fact, I have.  </li>
            <li> For me, a hooded air dryer was not a consideration; for my number one must was to get a soft bonnet.  </li>
            <li> the natural heat from the sun, plus the dust was doing a number on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Because of the design, I also wouldn&#x27;t really use it if you are just doing deep conditioning treatments.  </li>
            <li> I bought this soft bonnet about 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> I had no issues with smoking or overheating so far.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn the head and actually dries fast.</li>
            <li> I have to get use to the loud motor around my neck.    </li>
            <li> So, I was quite surprised.</li>
            <li> really noisy, second, that it may require some of the conair&#x27;s dryer after the 70 min.</li>
            <li> I am a naturally kinky curly girl with 4C Hair and purchased this dryer so that I can set my twists, braid outs, etc.</li>
            <li> B0012DOK9Q Belson Gold-N-Hot Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer]]</li>
            <li> They are more expensive but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s kind off frustrating.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets so hot that I turned it down to the cool setting to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I can only stand it on low temp, the high temp is way too intense for me.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would like is, if Belson can ever make this exact dryer with a quiet motor (and I hope they do)</li>
            <li> /&gt;2) Product seems to be made a while ago, meaning even if new the product was made back in 2004.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> yes it is hot just like EVERY other dryer.</li>
            <li> It dries my thick coarse hair quickly and there is room for my large rollers.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I leaned over and the air intake/exhaust area got covered for a few seconds and it shut off and took so long to cool enough for me to turn it back on</li>
            <li> (low is really fine and gets hot enough to dry my long hair which is down my mid-back)and</li>
            <li> The most popular brands on the market fail miserably when it comes to caring for and keeping Black hair healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> I also love that it has all settings hot and cold.</li>
            <li> I thought ebay was my only option for replacing an old bonnet hair dryer</li>
            <li> After it played out, I went on ebay and found a vintage Lady Dazey that I later gave to Goodwill after I went natural.  </li>
            <li> I wish someone would make a soft bonnet dryer with this design that actually works.</li>
            <li> It does great with my thick long hair; it dried it no time!</li>
            <li> Since it fits around my head, my entire head was dry rather than just drying the top of  and having to maneuver to get the back of my head dried.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to dry the hair late at night with a semi quiet motor while others are in the house that need a semi quiet atmosphere.   </li>
            <li> If they make this dryer with a quiet motor, Belson will completely outdo themselves because there are dryers out there with quiet motors.  </li>
            <li> It may look silly, and we had our laughs the first time I used the dryer -- but it worked better than other bonnet/hose type dryers.  </li>
            <li> I would never even give my roller sets a chance to dry completely because I just couldn&#x27;t bare to sit under there for an hour.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that I don&#x27;t have faith in Belson because I have some products from them that have lasted a long time so far.   </li>
            <li> The plastic tends to get hot after a few minutes, so I pull it off my neck .</li>
            <li> it dries my thick hair fairly quickly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use too much heat on my hair so it might be a little damaging.  </li>
            <li> Price - I bought mine for less than $40 brand new at a local store where this one was the last one left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my other soft bonnets I would have to turn the hose to hit all the places.  </li>
            <li> Have tried other soft bonnets and have read all the reviews here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And when I noticed that Belson had a soft bonnet hair dryer, I knew I wanted to add it to my arsenal of other Belson products like their irons.</li>
            <li> , I have a small whole in the cap</li>
            <li> oh yes, this sucker gets hot.  </li>
            <li> and I normally spend 2 - 2 and a half hours under the dryer to get my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Just flat out stopped working!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I have really long hair past my mid back and this never dried my hair completely.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased Belson products with complete satisfaction and will continue to believe in the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> First, we bought couple of conair&#x27;s products, but they were not good enough.</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair and check my e-mail at the same time, try and knock that.</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked was the loud motor.</li>
            <li> I simply taped it up and was good to go, but again, it was annoying.    </li>
            <li> I have to say that this dryer is worth looking dumb while you have it on.      </li>
            <li> As someone stated this item is a little loud since the motor is around you</li>
            <li> It is so much easier than wearing a bonnet or using the hard hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t stop using my blow dryer for those days when I want a really straight look, but this Belson will do the job at least twice a week for me</li>
            <li> All the negative reviews really arent that valid.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had misty off and on whether which will usually leave me with a frizz head and need to redo my hair frequently, but I&#x27;ve been coming and going and only washing my hair when I go to the gym</li>
            <li> I only wish the bonnet was made like a shower cap, closed in to hold heat in  </li>
            <li> My granny got me one from an estate sale that lasted for a really long time.  </li>
            <li> so I realized 2 hours was going to be too long for my liking</li>
            <li> I sat under the dryer for two solid hours and my hair was just as wet as when I rolled it.</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders and thick, so it&#x27;s important that my hair is fully dry when I roller set.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Belson, for making products that make caring for African American hair easier and less stressful.  </li>
            <li> The only issue that I have is that it does run a little hot and I will have to stop because my neck does burn a little, however I should turn it down.  </li>
            <li> I used my standard worldwide adapter that works well for other items that I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> Unlike other dryers, the heat settings feel different.    </li>
            <li> My length is to the point where air dry was no longer an option.  </li>
            <li> I use it for 30 - 45 minutes and if so desired another 15 - 30 minutes to completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I gave up and went to bed and let it dry overnight instead.  </li>
            <li> This dryer has me dry in about 1.5 hours.  </li>
            <li> I roller set my hair and put this dryer on, and my hair was dry in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Hang the comfortable neck strap around you so as not to pull on the plastic of the bonnet, switch unit on to your desired setting hi, low or cold</li>
            <li> I was dry and shiny in under 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The dryer does not have a way to tighten the cap around my head so the air blows into my  eyes, thus making them dry and burning.  </li>
            <li> I needed my hair to dry</li>
            <li> this product would recommend to every single person i know.</li>
            <li> It only took 60 mins for my hair to dry, which is average time in the salon for me.</li>
            <li> the extreme heat.&lt;br /&gt;4) Heat seems to circulate really well, so with less power and heating than hard bonnets it covers the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> I have had two other soft bonnet dryers, as well as two different hard bonnet dryers.  </li>
            <li> Now I can style my hair from any hotel room and actually dry my hair while sitting on the bed watching a movie!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick natural curly unruly hair.</li>
            <li> Dealing with the vendor and getting the product delivered took less time than if I had researched where I could buy it locally and</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have preferred would be a slightly longer cord but for the price i paid I am not complaining.  </li>
            <li> So, after viewing hundreds or blow dryers, and seeing only a few bonnet hair dryers in sad condition, I finally stumbled across a 2nd-hand, Gold N Hot bonnet hair dryer and decided to check out the website.</li>
            <li> which I did not expect that this soft bonnet would give me the results like a hard bonnet.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve just been careful not to let it get covered</li>
            <li> It dried my hair on the low setting in 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have thick african american hair and it is working well for me.</li>
            <li> and it takes less time than my other gold-n- hot hard bonett dryer!</li>
            <li> At least they last several years before they break down.</li>
            <li> And if you do not want to use the heat settings, the cool air setting is also great.it just brings out cold air like a fan.  </li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> SO you cant do any other chores whilst wearing it.</li>
            <li> Then while I&#x27;m under the dryer, I don&#x27;t have to protect my neck from the heat like I used to with other dryers.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is noisy just like EVERY other hair dryer,</li>
            <li> It dryed my roller-set, long length sister locks in less than 45 minutes!</li>
            <li> I am a black female with thick curly resistant hair this dryer lets me do other things while I dry my hair</li>
            <li> I expected it to last for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> I have APL hair, and usually it would take 1.5 hours on average to dry, but with this one I&#x27;ve used to 4-5 times now and in 45-50 mins my hair is dry!</li>
            <li> It tried my hair 5 to 10 minutes less than the one that i use at my salon (and the one I use in my salon leaves my ears, and face all read due to</li>
            <li> I had never thought about a soft bonnet dryer until I finally got soooo tired of trying to stay under the hard ones.</li>
            <li> However, I am sad to announce that my dryer is no longer really working, it&#x27;s been a years now</li>
            <li> I am African-American with coarse thick below shoulder hair.</li>
            <li> I use this hair dryer to travel with and also to lay down in my bed.</li>
            <li> and maybe it would cut  down my drying time.  </li>
            <li> It makes my head feel weighted down and pulls out my rollers when putting it on and off.</li>
            <li> While waiting for the arrival, I armored myself with my little extras based on the other&#x27;s comments.  </li>
            <li> What I have realized over the past few months of experimenting, is that my hair is too long and thick for a traditional rollerset with the cylindrical magnetic rollers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with relaxed armpit length hair.  </li>
            <li> (this type of hair dryer works so well on Black hair).  </li>
            <li> The hood is odd, but gets the job done...</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, texlaxed, afro hair</li>
            <li> I never want to go back to those hard bonnet dryers again!</li>
            <li> I purchase this bonnet a little over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> it was as easy as 1-2-3 to set up, just pull the base piece over the round dryer vent.  </li>
            <li> so my money went down the drain!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that this dryer is LOUD.</li>
            <li> Also, it dries unevenly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> it is SO not as heavy and burdensome as a lot of the reviewers have made it seem.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this dryer on Amazon because it was not available anymore.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair dried in 30 minutes</li>
            <li> It even came with a small black compartment that you can use to pack it away when you want to travel.</li>
            <li> The bad thing is first the noise.</li>
            <li> You do not need a separate blow dryer to use it but be warned, the code is really small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all over the past 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I did use it every two days for the past 9 months, so perhaps I just burned out the motor.</li>
            <li> I am not sure these types of hair dryers are meant to be used so often??</li>
            <li> Obviously this is a (needed) safety measure and it would always (eventually) turn back on, BUT it was still annoying.    </li>
            <li> do you know how LATE i&#x27;d be to everything if i had to waste time sitting underneath a hairdryer!</li>
            <li> I thought it was broken until it cooled down</li>
            <li> The only negative I would say is the element hanging down in front of me is a little annoying, but bearable.  </li>
            <li> And the problem with my hard bonnets is that your bottom rollers don&#x27;t get any heat.  </li>
            <li> You dont have to think twice to buy this one and it is hard to find</li>
            <li> so you have to be sitting in one place until you finish, and that sucks.</li>
            <li> (a string around my neck then is the LEAST of my worries!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair that falls between my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> As usual, Belson didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a little weird to look at</li>
            <li> I was so mad and unable to send it back in 30 days</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair not a good hairdryer for you.</li>
            <li> Product is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> , I have very thick hair .</li>
            <li> The cord is approximately 6 to 7 ft in length.  </li>
            <li> Afraid it did not work for me as I never got past switching it on!</li>
            <li> Yes, very thick hair!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bulky, weird contraption</li>
            <li> Seriously!!!</li>
            <li> And buying products that fail to deliver on their promises is insulting and an outrage, not to mention time consuming and expensive.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate sitting under dryers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Well, now I&#x27;m so thankful I don&#x27;t have to sit under those dreadful things anymore.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I own this dryer....it is the best thing since sliced bread. I agree with another writer that it worked miracles for my hair (African American). However, I am sad to announce that my dryer is no longer really working, it&#x27;s been a years now and I am still searching. I need Belson to put this dryer back in production. Please!! Amazon, is there any way you can contact the manufacturer to request supplies. Trust me this product will sell. Update 5/26/17 Still looking for something simular.</li>
            <li> I love bonnet hair dryers for their convenience. This one offers an interesting flair that allows you to not be bothered with positioning the motor unit so that it remains cool. There is a neck strap if you want a hands-free existence while drying your hair. The lowest heat setting is more than sufficient. The higher setting is a bit grueling. It comes in a very compact carrying case which is handy for traveling. The price was excellent in comparison.</li>
            <li> I have natural, \\&quot;Black\\&quot; hair and use this dryer to set my twists.  It gets the job done, but it tends to get very hot- even when on the cool setting.  I don&#x27;t like to use too much heat on my hair so it might be a little damaging.  Also, it dries unevenly.  The back dries twice as quickly as the front.</li>
            <li> As someone stated this item is a little loud since the motor is around you neck but it works great. It dries my thick coarse hair quickly and there is room for my large rollers.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and it dries my hair very quickly.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to sit still under a traditional dryer!!  I am glad that I made this purchase!! You Go Gold n Hot!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  This is so much better than sitting under a hard bonnet hair dryer.  This dryer allows you to walk around and get things done while you are drying your hair, especially if you plug it into an extension cord.  It also dries your hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I would recommend \\&quot;Belson Gold-N-Hot Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer\\&quot;; as a matter-of-fact, I have.  I have Sisterlocks and like to rod and/or roll them.  My length is to the point where air dry was no longer an option.  For me, a hooded air dryer was not a consideration; for my number one must was to get a soft bonnet.  Secondly, I needed to move about.  This bonnet does just that when plugged into a 6ft. power strip.  Additionally, I like the design and ample size.  The high setting is too hot for me, but the low is just fine.  I use it for 30 - 45 minutes and if so desired another 15 - 30 minutes to completely dry.  I have previously purchased Belson products with complete satisfaction and will continue to believe in the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer and based on the price I didn&#x27;t expect too much. The dryer works fine but expect to need an hour to dry your hair (mine is shoulder length).</li>
            <li> This dryer stopped working the third time I used it. Piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ll stick with hand-held dryers for now on. At least they last several years before they break down.</li>
            <li> The Belson Gold-n-Hot dryer is the best dryer, for the best price. It gets really hot so I had no problem drying my waist length curly hair into a roller set. The bonnet is so comfortable that I can just relax, read, and doze. I did switch it between medium and high when it got too hot. The only bad thing is that this dryer is LOUD. As I was sitting under it I could not hear anything not the TV or anyone talking. Definitely a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> So I was deployed and needed to take better care of my hair. the natural heat from the sun, plus the dust was doing a number on my hair. After using this about 3-4 times it broke! Seriously!!!! I was so mad and unable to send it back in 30 days so my money went down the drain! Don&#x27;t buy it! get a regular hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer! My hair stylist used this on my hair, initially. It dryed my roller-set, long length sister locks in less than 45 minutes! This is unheard of. I was so impressed that I immediately ordered 3 of them (one for my daughter in college, one for myself and one to give as a gift)because the price is so great. This dryer is compact and handy for me because I travel alot. Now I can style my hair from any hotel room and actually dry my hair while sitting on the bed watching a movie! Most importanatly, this dryer is super effective. If you are currently using a hood dryer, its time to toss it.</li>
            <li> I really love this hair dryer.  It is very comfortable to wear and it gets really hot. I can only stand it on low temp, the high temp is way too intense for me. The air vent on the dryer needs to be able to breathe in order for the dry not to over heat. I used it on my daughters hair and she kinda covered the air vent and it stopped working.  I thought it was broken until it cooled down and it started working again. I would recommend this product. I have thick african american hair and it is working well for me.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product. The soft bonnet melted because of the head that my hair dryer was putting into it! Then I was left with a flat hair bonnet because it had a huge melted hole. This happened after maybe the 3rd use. On the other hand, I have really long hair past my mid back and this never dried my hair completely. Total waste of money. Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with the hair dryer.  I like the more direct heat of a soft bonnet dryer but since you don&#x27;t find them very often in the stores I have put off getting a new one for some time.  I finally broke down and went online to find one and am happy with the Belson Gold N HOT.  So far so good. We&#x27;ve had misty off and on whether which will usually leave me with a frizz head and need to redo my hair frequently, but I&#x27;ve been coming and going and only washing my hair when I go to the gym so I guess the Ionic benefits are working.  The only negative I would say is the element hanging down in front of me is a little annoying, but bearable.  The first time I used it I leaned over and the air intake/exhaust area got covered for a few seconds and it shut off and took so long to cool enough for me to turn it back on I gave up and went to bed and let it dry overnight instead.  Since then I&#x27;ve just been careful not to let it get covered and it&#x27;s worked fine.  Doesn&#x27;t even feel too hot on my face which I remember reading as a concern.  I would recommend this dryer to a friend.</li>
            <li> I use this hair dryer to travel with and also to lay down in my bed. I also love that it has all settings hot and cold. also the cap tears easily, I have a small whole in the cap but it still works fine.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I had a hooded dryer previously which worked great, but I was stuck sitting at the table for an hour while waiting for trying to figure out the best way to dry my hair with out hurting my neck.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the soft bonnet dryers, but I figured that I would give this a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Since it fits around my head, my entire head was dry rather than just drying the top of  and having to maneuver to get the back of my head dried.  The only issue that I have is that it does run a little hot and I will have to stop because my neck does burn a little, however I should turn it down.  All in all I think that this is a great product and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I live in the UK and I purchased this product in the Amazon Marketplace. Afraid it did not work for me as I never got past switching it on! It immediately gave out smoke and an acrid burning smell. I used my standard worldwide adapter that works well for other items that I have purchased over the years. Unfortunately I never got as far as drying my hair with this product so cannot tell you how effective it is!</li>
            <li> Oh my Oh my Oh my!!! I have to say this is BY FAR the best $52.00 (shipping) I have EVER spent...and yes...on anything!  Why didn&#x27;t I know about this dryer years ago?  If I had known about it my life would have been so much easier in the hair care category. :-)    While waiting for the arrival, I armored myself with my little extras based on the other&#x27;s comments.  I went to the beauty store and purchased ear protectors (because yes, the High setting thankfully does get really hot), I purchased an extension cord, and also I was prepared to have my towel around my neck.  Well, within the first use, I FELL IN LOVE with this product.  It is a Godsend!  Gone are the days when I used to put off rollersetting my hair for weeks because I dreaded being STUCK under a dryer for 1 1/2 hour not being able to move.  Nightmare.  On my first use I was able to walk around and iron my clothes for the week, write out bills, &amp; read and by the time I was finished, my hair was dry.  Please don&#x27;t listen to the comments about the motor being around your neck.  It is necessary and is needed.  It allows you to be hands free and walk around.  It&#x27;s wonderful that you can just let it hang while accomplishing other tasks. Also, The hood is so comfortable and is soooo lightweight. Another thing... the WHOLE head gets dry because the hood beautifully covers the full head perfectly.  I hope Belson never ever discontinues this product. The only thing I would like is, if Belson can ever make this exact dryer with a quiet motor (and I hope they do) I will be the first to buy it, even if they charge double the amount in cost. It will be well worth it. If they make this dryer with a quiet motor, Belson will completely outdo themselves because there are dryers out there with quiet motors.  They are more expensive but worth the cost. It would be nice to dry the hair late at night with a semi quiet motor while others are in the house that need a semi quiet atmosphere.   I did research for a week before deciding to buy this dryer and there is no other dryer out there that can top this one in the convenience category. Ladies, if you need a hair dryer bonnet, especially for rollersets...this is it. Doesn&#x27;t matter if your rollers are very large-The Gold N Hot can accomodate.  Belson please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product - can&#x27;t find it in stores and it is a MUST HAVE. Also, Blue Bees thank you for carrying this item.  Hats off to you! :-)</li>
            <li> This product is great, arrived just as described by the seller.It even came with a small black compartment that you can use to pack it away when you want to travel.But i must say the heat settings seem to be off.The low heat which i selected , isnt that low.Its really hot and the next setting below that is the cool air, so that&#x27;s kind off frustrating.I ended up using it for about 10 minutes and then switching it off for 5 minutes and use it again for 10 minutes...and reapeat the process, becuase I couldnt bear the heat.Be warned, you will need a towel to wrap around your neck (and something to cover your ears), if you decide to use the heat settings.  I mainly use the dryer for deep conditioning treatments but I am preety sure it will work for roller settings.There is a lot of room in the dryer.And if you do not want to use the heat settings, the cool air setting is also great.it just brings out cold air like a fan.  Other than that.I definitely recommend this dryer.You do not need a separate blow dryer to use it but be warned, the code is really small so you have to be sitting in one place until you finish, and that sucks.SO you cant do any other chores whilst wearing it.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick natural curly unruly hair. I have to wash, roll and sit under dryer. This dryer has me dry in about 1.5 hours.  Yes, very thick hair!  I have been useing it for almost two years and it Rocks! I only wish the bonnet was made like a shower cap, closed in to hold heat in  and maybe it would cut  down my drying time.  Great Product. P.S I am white, it&#x27;s not just for African American hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with relaxed armpit length hair.  I rollerset weekly so a good bonnet dryer is my best friend.  I have to say that this dryer is worth looking dumb while you have it on.      I have had two other soft bonnet dryers, as well as two different hard bonnet dryers.  This one here dried my hair the quickest and (most importantly) the most uniformly.  With my other soft bonnets I would have to turn the hose to hit all the places.  And the problem with my hard bonnets is that your bottom rollers don&#x27;t get any heat.  But with this, it&#x27;s all uniformly done.    I also like that it has four different heat settings, including a cool.  Unlike other dryers, the heat settings feel different.    What I&#x27;d change:    When I first bought it, it had a tendency to overheat and shut off.  Obviously this is a (needed) safety measure and it would always (eventually) turn back on, BUT it was still annoying.    The bonnet itself.  Mine has ripped in several places, within months of purchasing.  I simply taped it up and was good to go, but again, it was annoying.    Because of the design, I also wouldn&#x27;t really use it if you are just doing deep conditioning treatments.  You can do it but those tend to work better with more traditional bonnet designs.    Overall, I love it.  And since they don&#x27;t make them anymore, I&#x27;m scared for the day this breaks... I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
            <li> This Bonnet dryer is very soft and lightweight and easy to use. I use at least 2\\&quot; rolers and it fits very nicely. It has 3 heat settings to choose from and  does a faster job drying on my hair than a regular dryer. And it leaves my hair nice and soft - probably that&#x27;s the ions working.   I purchased this hairdryer, because it is so much more convenient to let your rollers dry, while you are surfing the internet or reading a book. You have both hands free and don&#x27;t have to fumble around with a regular hairdryer until you get cramps.  So overall a great purchase for me, I strongly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I wish they would bring this back.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this dryer, I was desparately trying to find one in a local store, but I couldn&#x27;t find any stores here in Baltimore that carry this dryer anymore, so I was so thankful that Bluebeez still has them. I have to say that over the years I have had to purchase several hair dryers. I had never thought about a soft bonnet dryer until I finally got soooo tired of trying to stay under the hard ones. I would never even give my roller sets a chance to dry completely because I just couldn&#x27;t bare to sit under there for an hour. Well, now I&#x27;m so thankful I don&#x27;t have to sit under those dreadful things anymore. I roller set my hair and put this dryer on, and my hair was dry in about 30 minutes. My hair was very soft, and turned out very nicely. I was able to get comfortable and move around when I needed to. I love this dryer. I just hope it lasts. I never want to go back to those hard bonnet dryers again!</li>
            <li> 2014 update&lt;br /&gt;I had to change from 4 to 5 stars because this product its still working and i love it even more. I want to find another one to keep it in case mine breaks. I have called the company and they dont make it anymore.  I bought this soft bonnet about 2 months ago. I am now ready to give it the review it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firs let me say I have Medium course hair 3 to 6 inches below shoulder. I must user roller set since the hand driers alone do not work for me. I usually last about 70 minutes drying (I go to my Dominican Hair Salon).  Then they have to use the hand dryer for me to straighten my perm.  This works wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Have tried other soft bonnets and have read all the reviews here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) More comfortable than any other soft or hard bonnet I used.&lt;br /&gt;2) NO air goes to my face.  My rollers are large enough that the air stays inside of the bonnet and not in my face.&lt;br /&gt;3) Fast Drying - It tried my hair 5 to 10 minutes less than the one that i use at my salon (and the one I use in my salon leaves my ears, and face all read due to the extreme heat.&lt;br /&gt;4) Heat seems to circulate really well, so with less power and heating than hard bonnets it covers the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;5) Mobile - it allows me to move all around and read and do online banking etc at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;6) Price - I bought mine for less than $40 brand new at a local store where this one was the last one left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Product is very hard to find. It took me a while to find mine.&lt;br /&gt;2) Product seems to be made a while ago, meaning even if new the product was made back in 2004.&lt;br /&gt;3) Very Hot around the Chin and Neck...specially when you touch the hot plastic around  ( I must use a towel.&lt;br /&gt;4) The product should come with a replacement Gold Bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;5) Very loud - but that is ok with me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after spending countless hours on ebay trying to replace a 2nd-hand, bonnet hair dryer from the 70&#x27;s that was on it&#x27;s last leg.  I thought ebay was my only option for replacing an old bonnet hair dryer (this type of hair dryer works so well on Black hair).  So, after viewing hundreds or blow dryers, and seeing only a few bonnet hair dryers in sad condition, I finally stumbled across a 2nd-hand, Gold N Hot bonnet hair dryer and decided to check out the website. Never did I imagine that bonnett hair dryers were still in production and could be purchased brand new!  What a relief!  I purchased the item on a Wednesday afternoon and it arrived at my door in roughtly 24 hours. I removed the packaging and tried it out for the first time the same evening. Simply saying, \\&quot;I love it\\&quot;, fails to convey my sentiments for this item.          Thank you, Belson, for making products that make caring for African American hair easier and less stressful.  The most popular brands on the market fail miserably when it comes to caring for and keeping Black hair healthy and strong. And buying products that fail to deliver on their promises is insulting and an outrage, not to mention time consuming and expensive. Although Belson and Gold N Hot products aren&#x27;t typically available at your local Wal-Mart and Target,(go figure), they do have an excellent reputation for making quality Black hair care products.           So, buying this product and making the purchase through Amazon was an easy choice. The product is wonderful, works well and delivers what it states it will.  Dealing with the vendor and getting the product delivered took less time than if I had researched where I could buy it locally and Amazon offered the best price even with shipping charges added!  As I stated above, the vendor shipped the item the same day I placed the order and it arrived via UPS the next day.  The dryer itself heats up quickly, is large enough to accommodate a whole head full of 2\\&quot;rollers and is also quite comfortable.  The only change I would make, would be to make the electrical cord longer so I could accomplish more chores while wearing it.  The cord is approximately 6 to 7 ft in length.  15  to 20 feet would work better for people like myself that have to multitask.  But then again, I have plenty of reading to catch up on as well. If you&#x27;re at all on the fence about this item, don&#x27;t be if the issue is performance or quality. You won&#x27;t be disapointed in either.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve read the reviews that are before mine, and let me tell you, the things they complain about are the things that i take advantage of with my hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay, so there&#x27;s a noise. what dryer have you EVER sat underneath where there hasn&#x27;t been a noise?! instead of seeing it as a nuisance, let the hum lull you into a nice nap, or put on earphones and listen to an audio book, music or online tv program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the neck string. yeah. that. it is SO not as heavy and burdensome as a lot of the reviewers have made it seem. again, like me, use this perfect \\&quot;feature\\&quot; to your advantage. the portability allows me to put on lotion, get dressed, type, etc.--all while drying my hair! and if i plan on cleaning or cooking with it on, i simply plug it into an extension cord for a longer range and go on about my day! do you know how LATE i&#x27;d be to everything if i had to waste time sitting underneath a hairdryer! (a string around my neck then is the LEAST of my worries!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a writer, i&#x27;m always in front of my computer. so today, instead of working, i washed my hair, put on my dryer, popped in my earphones, clicked on abc.com and watched full episodes of my favorite tv shows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and besides all that, the quality is EXCELLENT! it dries my \\&quot;african american\\&quot; hair quickly, thoroughly/evenly and straightens it out like i&#x27;ve had a perm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the GREATEST hair dryer...EVER!</li>
            <li> It looks strange but works great</li>
            <li> It may look silly, and we had our laughs the first time I used the dryer -- but it worked better than other bonnet/hose type dryers.  With the controls worn around your neck, you have more room to roam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all over the past 30 years.  From Daizy to Conair, none were comfortable, lightweight or affordable.  I couldn&#x27;t even practically give most of them away at yard sales, that&#x27;s how unpopular and clunky they were.  I came across this funky looking bonnet by accident on Amazon and was happy to read many positive reviews.  For the small investment, I was not looking for a salon quality product, just something handy for me to give my hair a break from the wear and tear of the blow dryer.  I am totally loving this dryer now~!!  Straight from the box it was as easy as 1-2-3 to set up, just pull the base piece over the round dryer vent.  Hang the comfortable neck strap around you so as not to pull on the plastic of the bonnet, switch unit on to your desired setting hi, low or cold (low is really fine and gets hot enough to dry my long hair which is down my mid-back)and relax with a book or magazine while this does all the work.  I was dry and shiny in under 10 minutes.  I don&#x27;t use rollers, but other reviews says it&#x27;s great for that too.  There is PLENTY of room under the head piece.  It looks like a giant gold tooth when it inflates, it&#x27;s really quite funny and my kids even wanted to try it and were impressed with how fast their long hair was dried.  I wouldn&#x27;t stop using my blow dryer for those days when I want a really straight look, but this Belson will do the job at least twice a week for me and I hope to get many years of use out of it.  I had no issues with smoking or overheating so far.  Fingers are crossed. One last plus, it comes with a very handy case to store both pieces inside -- the electric unit and the bonnet.  Light enough to travel with too.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The dryer does not have a way to tighten the cap around my head so the air blows into my  eyes, thus making them dry and burning.  Thank goodness it dries my thick hair fairly quickly so I can turn it off.  Also, the sound of the blower upsets my cats and I could not hear the TV.</li>
            <li> I purchase this bonnet a little over a year ago.  It worked wonderfully I used it several times and I love it.  Today it totally died! For the amount of money I paid for it.  I expected it to last for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It&#x27;s easy to use. Very Convenient and perfect for my busy lifestyle. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Ok so all my friends laugh at me when they see me in this dryer because I look like a golden astronaut, but I definitely have the last laugh. First of all, compared to all the other soft bonnet dryers I&#x27;ve tried (the ones with the elastic band that you tighten around the rollers) this is quite easy to slip on over my rollers (the huge grey ones). Then while I&#x27;m under the dryer, I don&#x27;t have to protect my neck from the heat like I used to with other dryers.  I feel that if I had an extension cord, I could easily walk around my apartment while drying my hair, because the design is very comfortable.  I have APL hair, and usually it would take 1.5 hours on average to dry, but with this one I&#x27;ve used to 4-5 times now and in 45-50 mins my hair is dry! It comes out of the rollers feeling silky and smooth.  I have no complaints about this dryer, and the best part is that it&#x27;s SO CHEAP, that if something goes wrong it won&#x27;t hurt my pocket too much to get another one. So far so good though....maybe I should stock up just in case :).</li>
            <li> I am a black female with thick curly resistant hair this dryer lets me do other things while I dry my hair and it takes less time than my other gold-n- hot hard bonett dryer! It is ionic and my hair comes out soft and shiny! You dont have to think twice to buy this one and it is hard to find so get it now!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer!  It is so lightweight and comfortable.  It is so much easier than wearing a bonnet or using the hard hair dryers.  If you want comfort and ease while drying your hair...try this product.</li>
            <li> It works like detailed.  I can&#x27;t ask for more than that...    The hood is odd, but gets the job done...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a very good hair dryer and a easy way to dry with rolos. The problem is that because I bought it to use in Europe I had to buy a converter adapter plug and it keeps stopping every 10 minutes. Nevertheless, I think it&#x27;s a good buy. It doesn&#x27;t burn the head and actually dries fast.</li>
            <li> Greetings,this is a great dryer. I am African-American with coarse thick below shoulder hair. It dried my hair on the low setting in 50 minutes. I use 2 inch rollers in front and even larger rollers in the back. Not a problem because the bonnet expands beautifully to cover all of the rollers.    The only thing I disliked was the loud motor. That is the only reason I did not give it a five star rating. I put some tissue paper in my ears to muffle the sound. I have to get use to the loud motor around my neck.    It was easy to walk around once I attached an extension cord.I had the Conair dryer first and returned it. That Conair dryer is good for conditioning not drying my hair. It did not work at all. The Belson is the best soft bonnet I have ever tried!!</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer. I highly recommend this to anyone.... I can dry my hair quickly and easily. It is compact and I am able to whip it out - much more quicly than the \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; Dryer I own. I paid 3 times as much for it too.....</li>
            <li> I LOVE this dryer! It&#x27;s comfortable and boy does it get hot! absolutely gets the job done! Why didn&#x27;t I discover this years ago?  I would only suggest the cord be a little longer to move around a little bit, but it is really comfortable to and has 3 heat settings, hot, warm and cool.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this dryer on Amazon because it was not available anymore.  I actually found this one through research and persistence.  I found the # for the company that makes this dryer, called, and left a message.  The # was 913-663-4500.  I got a call back after a couple of hours and was advised that they had 2 dryers left and I could purchase them.  It was $21.00 + s/h.  Now that I think about it, I should have bought both of them.  Best purchase I could have made in a soft bonnet dryer.  I have owned about 3 bonnet dryers over the course of 15 years.  My granny got me one from an estate sale that lasted for a really long time.  After it played out, I went on ebay and found a vintage Lady Dazey that I later gave to Goodwill after I went natural.  My Mom held on to one that she had from years ago that I have now.  It&#x27;s also a Lady Dazey but the hose is in the back and the heat doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly.    This bonnet dryer is great!  I know it&#x27;s a little weird to look at but it does the job.  The first time I used it, after about 2 hours it cut off (I was using it on high).  I have read that this is a widespread issue, but I am assuming it is for safety reasons because, oh yes, this sucker gets hot.  I hate sitting under dryers but this one allows me to have a little more freedom.  For instance, I am typing this review right now with it on.  It&#x27;s cord is pretty long and sometimes I attach an extension cord if I need to move around more.  I have long, thick, texlaxed, afro hair so I realized 2 hours was going to be too long for my liking so I packed it away.  Here I am, almost a year later, trying it again.  What I have realized over the past few months of experimenting, is that my hair is too long and thick for a traditional rollerset with the cylindrical magnetic rollers (The biggest ones I have are the 2\\&quot; gray ones).  So I went out and bought the fat navy blue and magenta colored flexirods (the biggest I could find)...Pure perfection with my dryer!  My hair nowdries in a flexirod set in 1 hour on low with this dryer.  If you find this dryer, buy it.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was nervous before I bought this, I&#x27;d read all the reviews and wasnt quite sure what to expect.  This product is great! it does the job of a bonnet dryer but still allows you to move around and feel quite comfortable. All the negative reviews really arent that valid. Yes it is noisy just like EVERY other hair dryer, yes it is hot just like EVERY other dryer. It dried my hair super fast and very evenly, much better than the dryers at hair shop that burn my ears without drying my hair.   The only thing I would have preferred would be a slightly longer cord but for the price i paid I am not complaining.  Love love this product would recommend to every single person i know.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Works just like a head bonnet and fits most heads.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i would recommend with this is to use the low setting. The high setting is much to high and will burn out the motor. The low is hot hot hot already! Great tool to have.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this dryer-bonnet combo as opposed to buying the two separately to save space and cash... and its turned out to be great!! I have the thing on as I&#x27;m typing typing this lol, anyways, truly awesome, thank you thank you thank you!!!</li>
            <li> At first I wanted to return this dryer because after 5 minutes of use on the high setting, the dryer began to smoke and shut off on me.  I waited a while and tried the dryer on low and it worked perfectly.  The low setting amazingly got really hot and was perfect for drying my sisterlocks.  I should not need to use the high setting after all.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was beyond excited to get this product! I have been a fan of Gold N Hot for years and I was excited to start roller setting my own hair. I even ordered rollers and everything else to go along with this order.   I received the Bonnet and I sat under it. After 10 min. my daughter started fussing so I stopped it and thought I would take care of her and come back to it. When I turned it back on it stopped working!! Just flat out stopped working! I tried resetting it. I tried everything. I needed my hair to dry and I was so disappointed. Words can&#x27;t even discribe how I felt. Especially because I was so excited about this product.   I contacted the seller and they refunded me my money. I do not have faith in this product. I won&#x27;t say that I don&#x27;t have faith in Belson because I have some products from them that have lasted a long time so far.   I just would be cautious because you really do get what you paid for and every once in a while I guess you get a lemon!</li>
            <li> This awesome to use with leave in conditioner,sometimes I use it to dry my hair on the rollers,I get perfect curls every time ! :)</li>
            <li> This soft bonnet dryer is great! I&#x27;m saving to purchase a PIBBS EZ Dryer and needed something for the time being other than a table top hood dryer. My hair is past my shoulders and thick, so it&#x27;s important that my hair is fully dry when I roller set. It only took 60 mins for my hair to dry, which is average time in the salon for me. So, I was quite surprised. This product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who had troubles in getting her hair dry and nice. First, we bought couple of conair&#x27;s products, but they were not good enough. This thing is very good. It dryes the hair in just one hour may be 70 minutes. This is the good thing. The bad thing is first the noise. I can&#x27;t withstand it. really noisy, second, that it may require some of the conair&#x27;s dryer after the 70 min. Overall, it is good and it solved the problem.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews I kept searching for this dryer until I found it on Ebay.   I like the fact that it dries my hair quickly, but one thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the bonnet. It makes my head feel weighted down and pulls out my rollers when putting it on and off. However, this is not enought to discourage me from keeping this dryer. I will just have to take extra precautions when applying the bonnet.   I would recommend this to any woman who does not have hours to spend under a hair dryer.  UPDATE** This dryer was fine for 9 months, but today it began to smoke and now it won&#x27;t work at all. Granted, I did use it every two days for the past 9 months, so perhaps I just burned out the motor. I am not sure these types of hair dryers are meant to be used so often??</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair that falls between my shoulder blades. I roller set my hair every week and I normally spend 2 - 2 and a half hours under the dryer to get my hair dry. I saw this dryer and loved the design of it - thinking it would evenly dry my hair. I sat under the dryer for two solid hours and my hair was just as wet as when I rolled it. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product. I bought it from Amazon in 2011 but Gold n Hot will not honor the warranty because it&#x27;s a discontinued item (now I understand why they stopped making it). Don&#x27;t waste your money on this dryer. I wish someone would make a soft bonnet dryer with this design that actually works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer because I wanted something portable. This works wonderful, I have very thick hair . I am African American this works perfect on my hair. The plastic tends to get hot after a few minutes, so I pull it off my neck . Sometimes I put a wet rag on my neck other than that it works great. One of my better Amazon purchases. If you have thin hair not a good hairdryer for you.</li>
            <li> I am a naturally kinky curly girl with 4C Hair and purchased this dryer so that I can set my twists, braid outs, etc. This dryer gets so hot that I turned it down to the cool setting to dry my hair which I did not expect that this soft bonnet would give me the results like a hard bonnet. My hair dried in 30 minutes but I stayed under for another 30 minutes, 1 hour total to make sure thoroughly dry. I love this dryer so much and it is so cheap that I am going to buy 2 more for $12.97 so when this first burns out I have another one. Buy this dryer and you will not be disappointed!![[ASIN:B0012DOK9Q Belson Gold-N-Hot Ionic Soft Bonnet Dryer]]</li>
            <li> The girl who did my hair had this dryer it looks so funny when i saw it but BOY!!! Does this baby get hot super hot. You have limt space get this. I do have to say it took a while for it to get to my house of all the things i have gotting this took the longest. but it&#x27;s a good dryer</li>
            <li> Its a great price and it works well.  So far so good.  I use mostly on the high setting.  Good purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> takes forever to get my hair dry, but it does work, and it is much more affordable than the ones at the salon.</li>
            <li> Worked however it was extremely hot and I felt like my scalp was on fire after using it.</li>
            <li> I am a big Belson product fan. And when I noticed that Belson had a soft bonnet hair dryer, I knew I wanted to add it to my arsenal of other Belson products like their irons. As usual, Belson didn&#x27;t disappoint! Don&#x27;t let the look of it fool you! Its a compact and easy-to-use product that packs a punch!  It does great with my thick long hair; it dried it no time! The only thing I wish was that the cord was a bit longer but its nothing an extension cord can&#x27;t handle.  Also, I received my item sooner then expected, which was great!  I recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> This Bonnet Hair Dryer is a great investment. The price is affordable and the quality is excellent. It drys hair in a timely manner and it is very comfortable. It is also easy to use and I enjoy using this Bonnet Hair dryer. You can also travel with it knowing that you can do your own hair easy as 1 2 3. Wash and sets are great and you can also deep condition your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and it is a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend this product for everyone!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Just know, it is awkward and loud and you&#x27;ll want to wear a tank top or a light Tshirt while it&#x27;s blowing because you&#x27;ll get very hot. I have fine, long hair so this came in handy for me when I&#x27;d roll my hair in steam curlers and then use this blower to set my hair. The results have always been fantastic. It&#x27;s just a bulky, weird contraption but it did exactly as I wanted! 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> Ok, granted you would get laughed at, but come on, who sees you when you are drying your hair? This dryer dries so fast it is amazing. I can dry my hair and check my e-mail at the same time, try and knock that.</li>
