            <li> lasting for about 20mins. It helps relaxing the eyes with eyecream, and smells nice</li>
            <li> I just love it. Relaxing and good fragrance</li>
            <li> These are the unscented variety of these type masks and still have that relaxing warmth. I will not travel without these masks since I discovered them.</li>

            <li> very soothing and healing to the eyes if you didn&#x27;t have enough sleep..  I strongly recommend them.</li>
            <li> good. I use a lot of this product. This one is not my favorite smell but it&#x27;s good as the others</li>
            <li> so good and really relaxing</li>
            <li> I love this when my friend recommended this to me. It helps me to relieve my eyes after working with computers for too long. Also very good for taking a nap!</li>

            <li> Love this! Smells so good and relaxes my eyes. Fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love the eye mask! It helps my eyes to relax and helps me to go to sleep! The smell is also nice! I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love it! It help me sleep well.</li>
            <li> I use it every day now. Both the nap at noon or sleep in the evening. Because of the  warm stem it is  very likely to feel relaxing~</li>
            <li> like the lavender ones that smell awesome better- these had no smell but they are so great to use if your traveling , plane, car, train love them</li>
            <li> Ocassionally, I get dry eyes during the night, so in the morning one or both of my eyes are stinging.  To remedy the sting, I place a warm face towel over my eyes.  The downside to this is the face towel get cold in about 2 minutes.  So instead of 15 minute to remedy the pain, it was taking me 30 minutes.  One day a friend of mine gave me two packet of this eye mask. I was so happy when I discover that this amazing eye mask becomes warm as soon as you take if off the packet and stay warm for about 20 minutes.  No more wet towel over my eyes.  What a great product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell so much! Help me falling sleep, and can be reused as normal mask for one or two time, good choice!</li>
