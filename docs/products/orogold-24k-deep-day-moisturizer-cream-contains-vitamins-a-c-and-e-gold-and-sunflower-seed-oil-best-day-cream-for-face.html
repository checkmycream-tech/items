            <li>Makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturier but its not what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li>My own fault for remembering which to buy.</li>
            <li>Nice a works just as  well.</li>
            <li>: It has a very light smell.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Love how my skin feels</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of oro gold day cream.</li>
            <li>The product does all that it is suppose to do and even more.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and love the way my face feels after.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I know everyone it different, but for me, these are the best creams and peels I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>Orogold, after all, comes from Italy, the land where doctors, once upon a time in the Renaissance, were the original stars!  </li>
            <li>Almost overnight,  my fine lines and wrinkles were improved, and so I had to get more.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft, and is great for using under makeup/foundation.</li>
            <li>They are for fine lines or any problem you have the product will work on the areas you  need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
            <li>It is LIGHT.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy and the best thing is I&#x27;m not allergic to it</li>
            <li>All the products in this line seem to be fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth recommending!</li>
            <li>I use a circular motion and rub it in with clean fingers.</li>
            <li>The Oro Gold Day Moisturizing Creme makes my skin feel great - I live in the desert and need a high quality product.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>I had to use a very good moisturizer for about a week to get the skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>The sales people are very pushy and you wind up with way more than you need.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea is the company I bought these products and they are doing so great selling the products at  affordable prices.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penney of it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and keeps my face feeling smooth and soft all day.  </li>
            <li>I rarely breakout, but if I use a cream that is too dense</li>
            <li>My opinion is it&#x27;s a good product, very overpriced as it is not the same product you sample and whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy it in a store.</li>
            <li>This product is really worth its price.</li>
            <li>I know the original foil packets I got as a sample are much thicker than the product I ordered.</li>
            <li>As an avid outdoorswoman,  in Southern California, I know the importance of proper skin care, beginning with a good strong non-animal-tested moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly be keeping this item in stock!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good moisturizer, see if you can find one for less.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Not to mention &amp;#34;fl oz&amp;#34; is measuring unit by volume that can tell the exact product size but by weight in &amp;#34;oz&amp;#34; cannot tell.</li>
            <li>I like to put on my cheeks/under eyes first, and then my chin, then my forehead.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this in Vegas and have been a fan since.</li>
            <li>I first discovered Oro Gold Moisturizer while in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many positive comments about the effects over the last 8 months of use.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this item, I had high hopes about its \\&quot;worth its weight in gold\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Other than being kind of oily, my skin is pretty normal.</li>
            <li>They gave me a $15 credit to my account for my &amp;#34;troubles&amp;#34;, but what I really want is to return the product completely and get a full refund.  </li>
            <li>First time I bought the jar, the packaging was different and the whole jar was filled and lasted 8 months.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first but after using this with the night cream and peel, I&#x27;m very impressed with how soft and radiant my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>I have found it keeps my skin very healthy and smooth, and I put only a small amount on twice a day - underneath my foundation in the morning, and before going to bed at night.</li>
            <li>they give you a fresh looking  young appearance.</li>
            <li>I WAS MUCH HAPPIER WITH LOREAL REVITALIFT AND THAT LINE OF PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>Really improved my skin moisture and smoothed skin color  </li>
            <li>I just really like the cream</li>
            <li>Not only is it GREAT moisturizer, but it also corrected and made vanish dry, red patches of skin on my face.</li>
            <li>Feeling of young skin too.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and allergies, and haven&#x27;t had any problems using the Oro Gold products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li>BUT, it&#x27;s a complete scam.</li>
            <li>The second time I bought the jar, the product lasted a whole 3 months.</li>
            <li>My 19 year old daughter uses this on the exzema on her arms.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth- been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li>Okay, this is very expensive, and I am cheap.</li>
            <li>: I only have to tap my fingers in here three times to get enough product for my whole face.</li>
            <li>It is the only product we&#x27;ve found so far that works and leaves her skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products in the Oro Gold line, and highly recommend this product as well.  </li>

            <li> A little goes a long way, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products in the Oro Gold line, and highly recommend this product as well.  </li>
            <li> I have used moisturizer that sink into my skin right away making it hard to rub in and making me have to use a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I am giving them two stars because at the very least they were quick with their replies.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was because the new pump feature was broken, but rather it is because the new packaging/pump feature on l y allowed for 1/16th of the amount of lotion compared to what the jar appears to hold if that.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 fl oz cream but came in much smaller than expected of just 1.86 oz.  </li>
            <li> The fact is it came in much smaller than I have expected for a 60ml / 2 fl oz.</li>
            <li> after applying the product to the face it has this greasy feel that never absorbs or dry leaving a shiny and greasy look.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat oily skin and this product makes the skin so dry that it started to itch.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WAY OVERPRICED AND DOES NOT LIVE UP TO</li>
            <li> the product is average - equal to a drug store brand but five times the price.</li>
            <li> Even prescription skin creams couldn&#x27;t erase these dry patches on my face but after one week of using my Oro Gold Moisturizer, VOILA!</li>
            <li> The redness and dry areas were GONE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like regular lotion, it&#x27;ll keep your skin a little softer but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Im 60 yrs old and trust me this cream is a must have at least once in your lifetime...</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY on a face cream that has no actual results on your face.</li>
            <li> so I wrapped it up and gave it to my mother a few weeks later.  </li>
            <li> Not really seeing the results I thought I would be getting by this time</li>
            <li> lots of other moisturizers around for far less money.&lt;br /&gt;sales is as you&#x27;d expect: shady and uninformed:</li>
            <li> Not happyits dry, not creamy like my previous jar.</li>
            <li> Gave their other products a try too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of facial cream that ranged from high end to store brand and have to say that this facial cream is by far the worst I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It made my face break out and is not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> No, will not cure acne rosacea on the hands (as this is facial complaint)</li>
            <li> It cost less on Amazon, they overcharged in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> It has little gold flecks so it even sparkles when you put it on</li>
            <li> JUST A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I emailed them back with my receipt from my Amazon Order and they then concurred that they had indeed sent me the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to tighten, but my skin does feel tighter.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample in Las Vegas this past spring and could not wait to buy it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worst than cheap off brand.</li>

            <li> great product .. great service</li>
            <li> Not happyits dry, not creamy like my previous jar. Will not order again</li>
            <li> As an avid outdoorswoman,  in Southern California, I know the importance of proper skin care, beginning with a good strong non-animal-tested moisturizer.  Orogold, after all, comes from Italy, the land where doctors, once upon a time in the Renaissance, were the original stars!  Just as doctors from Italy were summoned worldwide to combat the bubonic plague in the 1400&#x27;s, this cream combats skin problems associated with wear and tear.  I have found it keeps my skin very healthy and smooth, and I put only a small amount on twice a day - underneath my foundation in the morning, and before going to bed at night. Even opening the package is like opening a present - the box is lined with satin, and comes with documentation that it does, indeed, contain 24 K gold from Italy.  Orogold is an excellent way to treat one&#x27;s face and neck!</li>
            <li> I tried diferent products and so expensive. These products melt in your face. they give you a fresh looking  young appearance.They are for fine lines or any problem you have the product will work on the areas you  need. Dead Sea is the company I bought these products and they are doing so great selling the products at  affordable prices. That is loving their customers! I got my products the very next two days.   Keep the affordable prices we kept buying it!    Thank you</li>
            <li> I WAS MUCH HAPPIER WITH LOREAL REVITALIFT AND THAT LINE OF PRODUCTS. THIS PRODUCT IS WAY OVERPRICED AND DOES NOT LIVE UP TO IT&#x27;S HYPE.</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item, I had high hopes about its \\&quot;worth its weight in gold\\&quot;.  And it was!  Not only is it GREAT moisturizer, but it also corrected and made vanish dry, red patches of skin on my face. Miraculous to say the least!  Even prescription skin creams couldn&#x27;t erase these dry patches on my face but after one week of using my Oro Gold Moisturizer, VOILA! The redness and dry areas were GONE! I will certainly be keeping this item in stock!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 fl oz cream but came in much smaller than expected of just 1.86 oz.  Not to mention &amp;#34;fl oz&amp;#34; is measuring unit by volume that can tell the exact product size but by weight in &amp;#34;oz&amp;#34; cannot tell. Wrong number 2 vs 1.86 and wrong measuring unit fl oz vs oz.  The fact is it came in much smaller than I have expected for a 60ml / 2 fl oz.</li>
            <li> This cream is not greasy and is great for under makeup. ...and I love the smell of oro gold day cream.</li>
            <li> the product is average - equal to a drug store brand but five times the price. I attempted to return it and was told that returns only accepted if product was unopened. Does that make sense?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light cream, I use it instead of a primer in the morning, makes the make up glide on my face! I like the amount of moisture that it have withought making skin heavy!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the product at the store/kiosk at the mall after the manipulative and aggressive sale tactics of the store associate.  I&#x27;ve used a variety of facial cream that ranged from high end to store brand and have to say that this facial cream is by far the worst I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s worst than cheap off brand. store product.  It made my face break out and is not worth the price.  after applying the product to the face it has this greasy feel that never absorbs or dry leaving a shiny and greasy look.  THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY on a face cream that has no actual results on your face.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products in the Oro Gold line, and highly recommend this product as well.  The daytime creamy moisturizer applies easily and has a great texture.  Pleasant thickness and not scented.  Great for everyone!</li>
            <li> I received my product on time.  The product does all that it is suppose to do and even more. If you are looking for a product that will but mositure back into your face this is the product. This product is worth every penney of it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and love the way my face feels after.  A little goes a long way, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> What a awesome moisturizer cream.  Really improved my skin moisture and smoothed skin color  Feeling of young skin too.  Im 60 yrs old and trust me this cream is a must have at least once in your lifetime...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year.  It goes on smoothly and keeps my face feeling smooth and soft all day.  My face looks younger than my age, which what woman wouldn&#x27;t like that!</li>
            <li> Ordered Oro Gold 24K Deep Day Moisturizer for my Mother&#x27;s Bday.  When I received the box it looked correct so I wrapped it up and gave it to my mother a few weeks later.  When she opened it and looked inside the box, it was the wrong product.  They sent Oro Gold Oil Controlled Moisturizer.  I emailed the company immediately and although I did receive a prompt response, they informed me that I had indeed ordered the Oil Controlled Moisturizer.  I emailed them back with my receipt from my Amazon Order and they then concurred that they had indeed sent me the wrong product.  Unfortunately, the product I ordered was Out of Stock.  So I&#x27;m left with a $131 product I don&#x27;t want.  They gave me a $15 credit to my account for my &amp;#34;troubles&amp;#34;, but what I really want is to return the product completely and get a full refund.  I am giving them two stars because at the very least they were quick with their replies.  Unfortunately, the wrong product and no refund really sucks.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth every penny.  I have sensitive skin and allergies, and haven&#x27;t had any problems using the Oro Gold products.  I also use the collegen renewal cream.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice day moisturizer. I&#x27;m in my early 30s and I have normal/dry skin. I rarely breakout, but if I use a cream that is too dense then I will. This cream has been very good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT: It has a very light smell. It is not overpowering. It smells a bit flowerly mixed with baby powder. Not too noticeable as the day wears on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEEL: This is the best part about the lotion. It comes in a round container and it is very silky. I have used moisturizer that sink into my skin right away making it hard to rub in and making me have to use a lot of product. That&#x27;s not the case with this moisturizer. It is LIGHT. Makes my skin feel so soft, and is great for using under makeup/foundation. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks and my skin, even around my eye, feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION: I only have to tap my fingers in here three times to get enough product for my whole face. I like to put on my cheeks/under eyes first, and then my chin, then my forehead. I use a circular motion and rub it in with clean fingers. There is not sunscreen in it, so you won&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;white face&amp;#34; flash back if you also use it with a foundation that has no sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m a huge fan. It&#x27;s expensive, but I like that I&#x27;m not having to use a ton of product to get it on my face. It makes my skin very smooth and even. Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to tighten, but my skin does feel tighter. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  It isn&#x27;t too heavy and the best thing is I&#x27;m not allergic to it</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful BUT, it&#x27;s a complete scam. First time I bought the jar, the packaging was different and the whole jar was filled and lasted 8 months. The second time I bought the jar, the product lasted a whole 3 months. I thought it was because the new pump feature was broken, but rather it is because the new packaging/pump feature on l y allowed for 1/16th of the amount of lotion compared to what the jar appears to hold if that. I wrote to customer service about it and never heard back. I&#x27;ll try to call to complain next.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest face cream ever for 40-50&#x27;s !! Didn&#x27;t have to deal with pushy salespeople. LOVED ordering this way.</li>
            <li> Okay, this is very expensive, and I am cheap. So the 5 stars is solely based on the effectiveness of this product. I love this! It is the best moisturizer that I have ever used. It has little gold flecks so it even sparkles when you put it on (it&#x27;s not visible like glitter, just a shimmer). I did not buy this at a store/kiosk, so I don&#x27;t have any insight into the sales process. I just really like the cream, I think you will too.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth- been using it for a few years now.You should try it too!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s a treat for your face. I use it daily! I first discovered this in Vegas and have been a fan since.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  Tried a sample in Las Vegas this past spring and could not wait to buy it.  Bought and will buy more!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturier but its not what I thought I was getting. I had bought Oro Gold while I was on vacation, but it was different from this. My own fault for remembering which to buy. I will try again because I loved the one I bought on vacation. It cost less on Amazon, they overcharged in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> My 19 year old daughter uses this on the exzema on her arms.  It is the only product we&#x27;ve found so far that works and leaves her skin feeling soft.  It does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> The Oro Gold Day Moisturizing Creme makes my skin feel great - I live in the desert and need a high quality product. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Good item, I will try it again</li>
            <li> I tried this cream in a mall from a kiosk, and it was just in a sample.  I almost threw it away, and then one day  decided to use it.  I have never been so impressed with the quality and what it did for my skin.  Almost overnight,  my fine lines and wrinkles were improved, and so I had to get more.  It was so expensive in the mall, but when I found  it on Amazon, I bought it, and will continue to use it.  All the products in this line seem to be fabulous. I know everyone it different, but for me, these are the best creams and peels I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product. Makes my skin feel amazing. It&#x27;s as if my face has gone back 7 years.</li>
            <li> I first discovered Oro Gold Moisturizer while in Las Vegas.  I love it!  It&#x27;s like silk on my skin, it smells wonderful and I love the results.  I will not be going back to my former face creams.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. Leaves your skin so soft and smooth. I only use about 25% of my liquid foundation as I used too.</li>
            <li> Overpriced..Underquality. All hype and packaging. Nice a works just as  well.Gave their other products a try too. Underimpressed.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have found.</li>
            <li> although a little expensive it leaves my skin feeling great....will definately buy again....great service and kept informed at all times</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin extremely dry. I have somewhat oily skin and this product makes the skin so dry that it started to itch. I had to use a very good moisturizer for about a week to get the skin back to normal. It&#x27;s possible that it works for some skin types but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Other than being kind of oily, my skin is pretty normal. It was a waste of money because it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be conned. Look up Orogold complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the deep peeling cream. All I have to say is it&#x27;s nothing special. JUST A WASTE OF MONEY. I have no idea where these 5 star comments are coming from. It&#x27;s like regular lotion, it&#x27;ll keep your skin a little softer but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I know the original foil packets I got as a sample are much thicker than the product I ordered. Just happened to find a packet to compare it with. My opinion is it&#x27;s a good product, very overpriced as it is not the same product you sample and whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy it in a store. The sales people are very pushy and you wind up with way more than you need. If you are looking for a good moisturizer, see if you can find one for less. I will not go without it in the morning or at night.......Bottom line, I use it and like it!</li>
            <li> overpriced, way over value, marketed to the credulous. lots of other moisturizers around for far less money.&lt;br /&gt;sales is as you&#x27;d expect: shady and uninformed: No, will not cure acne rosacea on the hands (as this is facial complaint)</li>
            <li> Not really seeing the results I thought I would be getting by this time and this product is very expensive.  Not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is really worth its price. I was a bit skeptical at first but after using this with the night cream and peel, I&#x27;m very impressed with how soft and radiant my skin feels and looks. I&#x27;ve received many positive comments about the effects over the last 8 months of use. Definitely worth recommending!</li>
