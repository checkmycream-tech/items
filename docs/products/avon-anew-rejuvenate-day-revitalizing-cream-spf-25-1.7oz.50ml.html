            <li>Nice non oily finish for combination skin types.  </li>
            <li>After applying the day cream, my foundation and powder glide on so nicely.  </li>
            <li>you are better off ordering from an Avon representative</li>
            <li>I love this day cream as it makes a difference with the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>The best endorsement I can give is that my mom is constantly complimented on her skin and youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>And at such a great price!</li>
            <li>Have used anew products for 30 years...absolutely love this cream</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t care.  :-)</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most creams on the market today but not Avon.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and i recommend it</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to wear Avon products.</li>
            <li>I really love this cream.</li>
            <li>great product.i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft now and I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Bummed it is no longer available through AVON, but I&#x27;m so glad I could find it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old and this cream seems to do great for me.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and seems to be moisturizing well.</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong fragrance either, which I like.</li>
            <li>It feels so light when you put it on your face.</li>
            <li>and my skin is loving this even more than the Clean and Clear!</li>
            <li>may be too young (almost mid-twenties) to use this, but as a moisturizer with 25 SPF, it&#x27;s the best thing I can do to have healthy skin for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin, with SPF and feels great all day long, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The texture of cream is great, not oily nor very dry.</li>
            <li>Kind of shiny at first but dries in to Matte finish.not very hydrating</li>
            <li>Love the cream, not so much the fragrance.</li>
            <li>but if you only want a little moisture and good dub protection this is great.</li>
            <li>Very light and soft!</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>I think its worth the money.</li>
            <li>Having mature skin, need something that has a bit more of softening agents.  </li>
            <li>I love Avon products and especially Anew products.</li>
            <li>I wear this product daily and love it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>It feels great on my face, and is much cheaper then the moisturizers I have bought in the past</li>
            <li>I waited until I was done using my Clean and Clear Morning Glow moisturizer (Which I was almost out of) before using this.</li>
            <li>And I use the Simple Skin Care cleanser to clean with first, then the toner, then this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a bargain for what you&#x27;d pay on avon&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great lotion, it seriously feels like your putting silk on your skin!</li>
            <li>Most people assume that she is 15 to 20 years younger than her actual age.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and silky too</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I stopped when I ran out 2 years ago because I had twins and was very busy.  </li>
            <li>Other creams do not measure up and now that I&#x27;m sleeping in back using my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It sucks it right up and feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>my skin is soft and has fewer lines and wrinkles or at least they are not as prominent</li>
            <li>It helps to keep my face looking young, and has a sunscreen which you need to wear each day, even in the winter.</li>
            <li>It is thick but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and seems to absorb in very quickly.</li>

            <li> It was old and outdated that it smelled old and the color was beige..</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and clear...not crazy about the smell</li>

            <li> In other words, it has something in it that appears to adjust to the condition of your skin at the time you use it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I started noticing slight diffeerence in my skin already.</li>
            <li> Thought I was going to have a terrible sunburn on my face a couple of weekends ago from being outside most of the time.</li>
            <li> Does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not to heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I often get compliments on my skin; and I could see the difference after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> Not sure how you get it half price</li>
            <li> It is much less expensive than the Olay Regenerist and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the science or chemistry behind this cream.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to see this product be discontinued by Avon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it made me break out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so bad either.</li>
            <li> It was so nasty and irritating that I eventually just threw it away.  </li>
            <li> I hated how my skin looked with foundatain on.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product!  Bummed it is no longer available through AVON, but I&#x27;m so glad I could find it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and seems to be moisturizing well.</li>
            <li> Nice cream.  The sunblock stings my eyes though.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this moisturizer. It is thick but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and seems to absorb in very quickly. I have a feeling the jar will last me two months or longer, as I need to use very little to moisture my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Avon anew for almost 20 years.  I wish they didn&#x27;t discontinue the perfecting lotion, but this is just as good.</li>
            <li> I only used this product for 3 wks and so far I love it.  I started noticing slight diffeerence in my skin already. I think its worth the money.</li>
            <li> This was a re-order and have used it for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Good,, everything was perfect!!</li>
            <li> In just a week I could tell a difference. It makes my skin very soft and silky too</li>
            <li> - I have been using this cream for over 15 years and it has kept my skin looking marvrlous</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream daily for 6 months now and I can finally see the bottom of the jar. I have never routinely used a face cream, but I am over 65 now and also using a CPAP mask at night. I felt like my skin was getting dryer, so I decided  to try this. It feels so light when you put it on your face. Not greasy at all. It does not have a strong fragrance either, which I like. Some fragrances give me a migraine. I just put it on once a day after my morning shower. I like that is has sunscreen already in it, so it is protecting my skin as well as nourishing it.  My skin is very soft now and I am happy with this product. In fact, I stopped using my under eye cream and use this for that purpose too. I use this on my face, but I should probably start using it on my neck too.</li>
            <li> Great price..great product !</li>
            <li> I have allergies and this cream doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  It is much less expensive than the Olay Regenerist and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. This is the ONLY day cream I have found that does not irritate. Does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the science or chemistry behind this cream. What I do know us that when my skin is irritated and dry (from sun or wind, etc.) it soothes and softens it. When my skin feels good, this cream is not overly greasy. In other words, it has something in it that appears to adjust to the condition of your skin at the time you use it. I am in my 50&#x27;s and this is a good quality under makeup cream you can use any morning.</li>
            <li> It was old and outdated that it smelled old and the color was beige..you are better off ordering from an Avon representative</li>
            <li> Cream is good and it seems to be working on me. The texture of cream is great, not oily nor very dry. SPF is an added advantage.</li>
            <li> This cream smells like summer at the beach.  Nice non oily finish for combination skin types.  I like it .</li>
            <li> A person never knows whether or not a product is working until you use an over-the-counter product and revert back to Avon - that&#x27;s when you can see the difference! I love this day cream as it makes a difference with the skin on my face. The SPF 25 is good too! Thought I was going to have a terrible sunburn on my face a couple of weekends ago from being outside most of the time. As it turned out I remembered that Anew has SPF 25 and never did get a hint of burn on my face.</li>
            <li> great product.i highly recommend. nothing i have tried works as well. my skin is soft and has fewer lines and wrinkles or at least they are not as prominent</li>
            <li> Still like it, recommend to others.  G L. Bullock</li>
            <li> Use this product along with gel cleanser, still waiting to see if there are any visible results.  If consumers are expecting an immediate difference, then this product may not be ideal.  Having mature skin, need something that has a bit more of softening agents.  However, in all fairness to the product, I have only being using it for about two weeks.  I would recommend the product for those that are in the 40 to 50 age group.</li>
            <li> Awesome delivery process received it quickly and no issues. This stuff works great at minimizing pores. Love this cream!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have oily skin but it&#x27;s not to heavy. I use it as a night and day cream.  It does leave my skin feeling revitalized they way it claims! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Avon Anew Rejuvenate Day Cream is the best!!  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and my skin can&#x27;t get enough of it.  It sucks it right up and feels soft and smooth.  Before I began using Avon Anew Day Cream I hated how my skin looked with foundatain on.  After applying the day cream, my foundation and powder glide on so nicely.  Give this a try!!</li>
            <li> Kind of shiny at first but dries in to Matte finish.not very hydrating but if you only want a little moisture and good dub protection this is great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this moisturizer for my Mother. She has used Avon&#x27;s Anew products for several years and swears by them. The best endorsement I can give is that my mom is constantly complimented on her skin and youthful appearance. Most people assume that she is 15 to 20 years younger than her actual age. (No, she has not had surgery) She combines this product with the nightly use of Cocoa butter and the results are flawless.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love Avon products and especially Anew products.I&#x27;m 61 years old and this cream seems to do great for me. And at such a great price!</li>
            <li> I received this as a bridal shower gift from the games we played (Go figure on how I scored this item). I waited until I was done using my Clean and Clear Morning Glow moisturizer (Which I was almost out of) before using this. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and my skin is loving this even more than the Clean and Clear! And I use the Simple Skin Care cleanser to clean with first, then the toner, then this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be too young (almost mid-twenties) to use this, but as a moisturizer with 25 SPF, it&#x27;s the best thing I can do to have healthy skin for a very long time. Going to order more when I run out!! :D</li>
            <li> did nothing. i switched back to ole henriksen products</li>
            <li> Have used anew products for 30 years...absolutely love this cream</li>
            <li> Very good I use it all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used avon anew rejuvenate for over a decade.  I stopped when I ran out 2 years ago because I had twins and was very busy.  Other creams do not measure up and now that I&#x27;m sleeping in back using my favorite moisturizer. Fast shipping and a bargain for what you&#x27;d pay on avon&#x27;s site. Not sure how you get it half price but i don&#x27;t care.  :-)</li>
            <li> I always use Avon products.  I am allergic to most creams on the market today but not Avon.  It is a great product and I have been buying it for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and clear...not crazy about the smell but it&#x27;s not so bad either. Great product, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to see this product be discontinued by Avon. It always leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Put it this way, I&#x27;m 38 &amp; people mistake me for being in my mid 20&#x27;s. Been using this for 3 years.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this product and i recommend it</li>
            <li> I wear this product daily and love it.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and has a SPF to it so I don&#x27;t have to worry about sun screen on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used Avon Anew products for over 15 years. I often get compliments on my skin; and I could see the difference after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lotion, it seriously feels like your putting silk on your skin! Very light and soft!</li>
            <li> After using this product for 4 weeks, I do not notice that it has helped my skin at all. This is odd as I have used other Anew products and they worked very well. The one thing I found unbearable about Avon Anew Rejuvinate was the smell. It was so nasty and irritating that I eventually just threw it away.  I couldn&#x27;t stand smelling it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I love it.  It helps to keep my face looking young, and has a sunscreen which you need to wear each day, even in the winter.</li>
            <li> Love the cream, not so much the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  Actually what I wanted!!! A++++</li>
            <li> I have always loved Anew, and this product is not the exception! Perfect for dry skin, with SPF and feels great all day long, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and consitancy. Unfortunately it made me break out. I used to be able to wear Avon products.</li>
            <li> I always buy this product. Its awesome</li>
            <li> Made skin look radiant</li>
            <li> I have been with Anew since day one..  And yes I have fallen for the others but I always come back to this. The best thing is that it works and doesn&#x27;t cost a freaking fortune...  This seller was great  got here quickly!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream. It feels great on my face, and is much cheaper then the moisturizers I have bought in the past</li>
