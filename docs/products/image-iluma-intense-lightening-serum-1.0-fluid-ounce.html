            <li> Previously I&#x27;ve used 4 bottles of image lightening serum--and also recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are already lighter!,,</li>
            <li> It does NOTHING in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It came promptly and it was less expensive than the local salon.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money :(</li>

            <li> Very soothing for sensitive or irritated skin. I would recommend for anyone with redness issues.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Have sensitive skin and this gives me no problems. Use every day and night. Can really tell difference.</li>
            <li> smells so good! arrived great</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results with using this product since I purchased it and I use it daily night &amp; day.</li>
            <li> This product did wonders for my face</li>
            <li> I love the Image Iluma intense lightening  serum. I have used it for the last 6 months. I had really dry skin and since using it, it has made my skin soft and  very mositurized. I also have very dark circles and since using the serum I have noticed that my dark circles have become much lighter. I have been very pleased  with this product, however progress doesn&#x27;t happen overnight  be patient  and you will see results!</li>
            <li> Previously I&#x27;ve used 4 bottles of image lightening serum--and also recommended it to others. But this new and ruined serum has an unbearable  turpentine-like odour!  Somebody in this skin care company should know that fragrance can cause irritation and therefore is NOT recommended for most skincare products and then to add something so strong and awful! Really what were they thinking! And I ordered two bottles..would really like my money back.</li>
            <li> Lightens skin discolorations!  Love the Image products.</li>
            <li> I have rosecea. This product soothes the inflammation and eliminates breakouts.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the right serum. The color is way different and doesn&#x27;t smell like what it should.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to judge it&#x27;s lightening, however I love the liquid base it comes in. Most skin lighteners are drying and stink of alcohol. Not this one. Pleasant smell and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, but from my esthetician. HOWEVER, as long as this is the same product and not a fake, I highly recommend it to anyone with scarring. One thing I keep seeing though is people saying, &amp;#34;I used this for several weeks and saw no results...&amp;#34; Let me just say, they&#x27;re right. It does NOTHING in a few weeks. With that said though, it does wonderfully if given  a chance to work over the required amount of time.... 3 months. Give this product 3 months (I use mine twice a day) and see results. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I don&#x27;t know of a single person who has been let down when they used their whole bottle religiously.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really made a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Have tried this for weeks, no results at all. Waste of time and money :(</li>
            <li> smell very strong . like chemical ...</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. It came promptly and it was less expensive than the local salon.  My dark spots are already lighter!,,</li>
