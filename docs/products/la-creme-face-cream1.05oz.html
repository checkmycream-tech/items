    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best face cream I ever used</li>
            <li>which I am very impressed by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I give this product a 4 star review, rather than a 3-star, because the cream smells great!</li>
            <li>The directions say to use once or twice a day for best results.</li>
            <li>I got ripped off but good!  </li>
            <li>One of them is &amp;#34;snail secretion filtrate&amp;#34; - this can&#x27;t be good!  </li>
            <li>Trickery - if they have a good product they would not need to resort to this!</li>
            <li>The creme feels very good on my skin, is a great moisturizer and smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>service was great but haven&#x27;t seen any change yet.</li>
            <li>This face cream is great.</li>

            <li>and my face feels wonderful and smooth.  </li>

            <li>or I would not be able to post my review</li>
            <li>love this cream was so glade</li>
            <li>but I think it is working, need more time</li>
            <li>and I love these products.</li>
            <li>It also contains vitamins that help promote healthy skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be looking into this a bit more to hopefully find the truth about this product</li>
            <li>This cream is ok.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>14 day free trial, my eye!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>(Good thing I like it so much!)  </li>
            <li>It has a very, nice light fragrance that I enjoy very much as I put it on my face.</li>
            <li>If you read the fine print, it does say that most people will see improvement after using the product 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>Beware, the reviews are true!</li>
            <li>The first thing I do when I get any kind of cream is to smell it.  </li>
            <li>I like how creamy and easy it is to smooth all over my face.</li>
            <li>Works great in conjunction with Bella creme facial cream.</li>
            <li>The cream also goes on smooth and doesn’t leave any visible signs of its application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great skin cream for reducing wrinkles and making you look younger.</li>
            <li>It looks, smells and feels like cheap, pore-clogging gunk.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the FREE 14 day trial from LA CREME &amp; BELLA LABS,  to find out it was a scam.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I get this product for my wife, and this is free after a promotional code.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I ordered the free trial, and received it while I was in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>The box that the cream comes in says to pay special attention to the eye area and the forehead when applying this cream.  </li>
            <li>cream makes my skin feel very hydrated which I love.</li>
            <li>Good product when used with bellalabs facial cream.</li>
            <li>Company does not provide full refund if dissatisfied with product during 14 day period.</li>
            <li>You can feel it start to work quickly.  </li>
            <li>I used this crème for the first time Saturday, it made my face feel soft and moisturized, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered, I got a call from them within 20 minutes saying that if I had any questions or concerns not to hesitate to call!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use up my supply, and if I am still so happy with it, will order from Amazon at about half the price!  </li>
            <li>The new formula uses peptides to help reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic as a facial moisturizer, but as for the fine wrinkles under my eyes, no difference.</li>
            <li>This cream is also very gentle to my skin and has not caused any irritation or breakouts.</li>
            <li>They are interested in tricking you so they can &amp;#34;legally&amp;#34; charge your credit card $83 on the 15th day from the date of your order.</li>
            <li>If I did want to order this product again, it would definitely be through Amazon, they have a much better deal and you&#x27;re not locked in to every 30 days.</li>
            <li>As for the snail secretions... I was grossed out at first but decided to look into it.</li>
            <li>you had it and will be getting more in the future</li>
            <li>Be aware there is an auto shipment on this product.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>sure enough, I&#x27;ve been billed $87.63 three times.  </li>
            <li>a nice day - and be careful out there!</li>
            <li>My face is super soft as well.</li>
            <li>Will definitely read fine print from now on.  </li>
            <li>very rosey</li>
            <li>I also ordered the FREE $4.95 shipping cost only LA CREME &amp; BELLA LABS, to find out it was a SCAM.</li>
            <li>I really like this La Creme face cream.</li>
            <li>, it was very watery and one could tell it was an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The representative put me on hold for a while to try to make me think he was looking for an available supervisor, but came back on the line only to tell me that no one was available.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t, and it really helps my lines.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>love it but for the price not much product to use</li>
            <li>It absorbs into skin well, leaving it very moisturized and non greasy.</li>
            <li>A very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>It contains ingredients that will help your skin looks younger and smooth face,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
            <li>That said, it was hot by now, and I can&#x27;t use ANYTHING on my skin in sweaty weather (normally use Olay Regenerist), or I break out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried at least 10 other products with no results, but this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see that is was any better than any other cream.  </li>
            <li>14 day trial is beyond me, then they charge you $87+ 14 DAYS FROM THE DAY YOU PURCHASE IT, and refuse to give you a refund, though after A VERY STRESSFUL AMOUNT OF  ARGUMENT argument finally refunded the full amount.</li>
            <li>To apply just wash face , pat dry, and smooth on cream.</li>
            <li>The product itself is high quality and works as advertised, I would not have a problem recommending this to anyone.</li>
            <li>My goal is to get rid of those tiny little lines on the top of my cheek when I smile.  </li>
            <li>This is a good example of what a scam looks and feels like if you have never experienced one.</li>
            <li>, well Citi sided with La Creme due to the fine print and bs that is included in the terms, do not buy this stuff thinking you will have recourse if you don&#x27;t like it..</li>
            <li>I applied the cream to my entire right side of my face and went to bed.</li>
            <li>Day one: I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My full upper eyelid now shows, and I have just a small bit left in the crease on my right eye, and a bit more on my left.  </li>
            <li>and I would be contacting them again to get a complete refund!  </li>
            <li>The cream is so smooth that if you&#x27;re not careful you may get too much and waste it.  </li>
            <li>the my mother, the face cream does prevent fine lines and wrinkles over a period of a few days.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised after using this cream.</li>
            <li>As with BellaLabs the ingredients are completely unimpressive.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it has helped.</li>
            <li>would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I read that It has natural acidic and elastin properties.</li>
            <li>This was a complete scam.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a month so far</li>
            <li>Skin is soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>La Creme offers nourishment and moisturizer to your face and this is an anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61, and have very droopy upper eyelids</li>
            <li>It is very light, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was back in junior high school dealing with this person.</li>
            <li>It rubs in and dries very fast which I like because I am usually in a time crunch when I am trying to get ready to go somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well mixed with bella labs facial creme</li>
            <li>Even if the product were terrific (which it most certainly is not), the deceptive tactics of hiding a dense and complicated &amp;#34;Terms and Conditions&amp;#34; contract which you unwittingly agree to (when you think you are simply trying out a new product for the cost of shipping) should scream loud and clear that these people are not interested in satisfied repeat customers.</li>
            <li>He would be able to &amp;#34;split the difference&amp;#34; with me and issue a refund for 40 some odd dollars (approximately half of the charge).  </li>
            <li>When you apply this cream on your face, at first it feels a little thick, but afterwards your skin starts to soak it in and it leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use La Creme with Bella Labs lotion and my skin is soft looks much younger than my 63 years.</li>
            <li>So far I have not seen any results, but have only been using this cream for a week now.  </li>
            <li>Beware Invoice from LaCreme Facial Cream does not show complete charges.</li>
            <li>It shipped in a fast an timely manner ( i got it before the expected delivery date) and</li>
            <li>then La Crème bills the full amount as you are past the 14 day trial.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> very rosey</li>
            <li> I also ordered the FREE $4.95 shipping cost only LA CREME &amp; BELLA LABS, to find out it was a SCAM.</li>
            <li> I really like this La Creme face cream.</li>
            <li> , it was very watery and one could tell it was an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The representative put me on hold for a while to try to make me think he was looking for an available supervisor, but came back on the line only to tell me that no one was available.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t, and it really helps my lines.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> love it but for the price not much product to use</li>
            <li> It absorbs into skin well, leaving it very moisturized and non greasy.</li>
            <li> A very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> It contains ingredients that will help your skin looks younger and smooth face,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
            <li> That said, it was hot by now, and I can&#x27;t use ANYTHING on my skin in sweaty weather (normally use Olay Regenerist), or I break out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried at least 10 other products with no results, but this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that is was any better than any other cream.  </li>
            <li> 14 day trial is beyond me, then they charge you $87+ 14 DAYS FROM THE DAY YOU PURCHASE IT, and refuse to give you a refund, though after A VERY STRESSFUL AMOUNT OF  ARGUMENT argument finally refunded the full amount.</li>
            <li> To apply just wash face , pat dry, and smooth on cream.</li>
            <li> The product itself is high quality and works as advertised, I would not have a problem recommending this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My goal is to get rid of those tiny little lines on the top of my cheek when I smile.  </li>
            <li> This is a good example of what a scam looks and feels like if you have never experienced one.</li>
            <li> , well Citi sided with La Creme due to the fine print and bs that is included in the terms, do not buy this stuff thinking you will have recourse if you don&#x27;t like it..</li>
            <li> I applied the cream to my entire right side of my face and went to bed.</li>
            <li> Day one: I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My full upper eyelid now shows, and I have just a small bit left in the crease on my right eye, and a bit more on my left.  </li>
            <li> and I would be contacting them again to get a complete refund!  </li>
            <li> The cream is so smooth that if you&#x27;re not careful you may get too much and waste it.  </li>
            <li> the my mother, the face cream does prevent fine lines and wrinkles over a period of a few days.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised after using this cream.</li>
            <li> As with BellaLabs the ingredients are completely unimpressive.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it has helped.</li>
            <li> would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I read that It has natural acidic and elastin properties.</li>
            <li> This was a complete scam.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month so far</li>
            <li> Skin is soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> La Creme offers nourishment and moisturizer to your face and this is an anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61, and have very droopy upper eyelids</li>
            <li> It is very light, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was back in junior high school dealing with this person.</li>
            <li> It rubs in and dries very fast which I like because I am usually in a time crunch when I am trying to get ready to go somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works really well mixed with bella labs facial creme</li>
            <li> Even if the product were terrific (which it most certainly is not), the deceptive tactics of hiding a dense and complicated &amp;#34;Terms and Conditions&amp;#34; contract which you unwittingly agree to (when you think you are simply trying out a new product for the cost of shipping) should scream loud and clear that these people are not interested in satisfied repeat customers.</li>
            <li> He would be able to &amp;#34;split the difference&amp;#34; with me and issue a refund for 40 some odd dollars (approximately half of the charge).  </li>
            <li> When you apply this cream on your face, at first it feels a little thick, but afterwards your skin starts to soak it in and it leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I use La Creme with Bella Labs lotion and my skin is soft looks much younger than my 63 years.</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any results, but have only been using this cream for a week now.  </li>
            <li> Beware Invoice from LaCreme Facial Cream does not show complete charges.</li>
            <li> It shipped in a fast an timely manner ( i got it before the expected delivery date) and</li>
            <li> then La Crème bills the full amount as you are past the 14 day trial.</li>
            <li> Same results, same chemical reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I waited too long to return this</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is supposed to be watery but was very liquidly and every time I open jar spills over.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used long enough to see difference</li>
            <li> So just take a little with your finger and then rub it softly onto your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Spend your hard earned money on a high SPF lotion like Aveeno.</li>
            <li> and you are still dry after you apply it.</li>
            <li> It will also hide some larger wrinkles, although they will take a few days of daily application of the face cream.</li>
            <li> so I only tried it on a small patch on my cheek when I had the next day off.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> When you open it up, just put a little on your hand.  </li>
            <li> One container will probably last me at least a month using it only once a day.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days and tried it again on only a cheek.</li>
            <li> and there is absolutely NO CHANGE</li>
            <li> Other reviews on Amazon do not focus on the product, rather they focus on the company making the product.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is all fragrance and don&#x27;t believe that you need one with the other, they are both garbage</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see difference with other products that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Greasy and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely zero results and after the 14 day trial period I was automatically billed almost $90 for another bottle of the useless product.  </li>
            <li> The cream was watered down.  </li>
            <li> My lines are less noticeable, dark spots are disappearing</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> Less than 30 day use.</li>
            <li> but I do feel like they are less noticeable</li>
            <li> I happened to notice on the brochure that if you do not cancel within 9 days and return the bottle they will charge your card $87.63.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is not good, do not fall in for $4.95 shipping cost only deal.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream , so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (I can see them, as they hang down over my eyelashes!).  </li>
            <li> I have used to for a few days and my skin does feel softer.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy oily product and it did nothing for my skin</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Again wasted my money will not order this again.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry not for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this cream after I had already ordered the product because of all of the negative reviews, so I was ready to return it as soon as I received it.</li>
            <li> I usually  have bad luck with skin care products but this works out very well.</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware - Caused Breakouts and NOT Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Claims to reduce wrinkles when used with Bellalabs Facial Cream are false!</li>
            <li> I am a bit torn regarding this review since I&#x27;ve read a few reviews stating that some of the ingredients in the cream are not good for you</li>
            <li> Definitely not great and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Both La Creme and BellaLabs products are made with a long list of questionable chemical ingredients (no fewer than 6 forms of parabens in the BellaLabs product) and the fragrance is so overpowering I was forced to wash the stuff off almost immediately.</li>
            <li> and I called and complained about the product on 4/30</li>
            <li> The customer representatives are rude and belligerent.</li>
            <li> I would offer a negative star if that was an option.  </li>
            <li> least if you buy it on Amazon - you won&#x27;t get caught up in their subscription gimmick --</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit thick.  </li>
            <li> but if it doesn&#x27;t work does not good.</li>
            <li> I had my daughter take a mug shot of me before use, which I looked at today, and I can hardly believe the difference!  </li>
            <li> cream doesn&#x27;t leave behind any sticky or greasy residue that I have noticed.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with product.</li>
            <li> La Crème is an expensive scam.  </li>
            <li> They do not stand behind their product because it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately after using this product for about a week,I see no difference in the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry, and no monthly fees.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this crap.</li>
            <li> La Creme&#x27;s customer service is atrocious and they treat their clients with contempt!</li>
            <li> but for the cost the consistency is terrible.</li>
            <li> Product is loaded with parabens which are terrible for you.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best face cream I ever used</li>
            <li> service was great but haven&#x27;t seen any change yet.</li>
            <li> Works great in conjunction with Bella creme facial cream.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised after using this cream. I have tried so many and have seen nothing. This product really is amazing. After one week I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> has perfume to it I personally don&#x27;t like perfume in skin care proucts</li>
            <li> I have been using this, along with Bella Labs Cream and see a noticeable difference in 2 weeks.  My lines are less noticeable, dark spots are disappearing and my face feels wonderful and smooth.  I have been having problems with my skin tone and this has evened it out.  I have tried at least 10 other products with no results, but this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Saw no changes what so ever</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product. As with BellaLabs the ingredients are completely unimpressive. I can&#x27;t express it enough...don&#x27;t do it!! Spend your hard earned money on a high SPF lotion like Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I use La Creme with Bella Labs lotion and my skin is soft looks much younger than my 63 years.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it has helped.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with product. Greasy and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Less than 30 day use.</li>
            <li> Day one: I have very sensitive skin so I only tried it on a small patch on my cheek when I had the next day off. Woke up the next morning with a red spot but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Day two: I applied the cream to my entire right side of my face and went to bed. Next morning.... very rosey red.&lt;br /&gt; I tried this with the recommended BellaLabs Facial Cream and without it. Each time I got the same reaction.&lt;br /&gt; I waited a few days and tried it again on only a cheek. Same results, same chemical reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I waited too long to return this so I don&#x27;t know if the return policy is a good one or not.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for this honest and unbiased review. I got this for my mother and she thoroughly enjoys it. The packaging was good with the item being encased in cardboard with La Creme branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According the my mother, the face cream does prevent fine lines and wrinkles over a period of a few days. It will also hide some larger wrinkles, although they will take a few days of daily application of the face cream. The cream also goes on smooth and doesn’t leave any visible signs of its application. It also does not cause any burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great skin cream for reducing wrinkles and making you look younger. Other reviews on Amazon do not focus on the product, rather they focus on the company making the product. The product itself is high quality and works as advertised, I would not have a problem recommending this to anyone.</li>
            <li> been using since Jan, 3 months, can&#x27;t say I see any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Works really well mixed with bella labs facial creme</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any results, but have only been using this cream for a week now.  I do like the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift...love it!  It makes my skin feel very soft and it applies perfectly!  It smells wonderful, very citrusy.</li>
            <li> La Crème is an expensive scam.  save your money!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks and there is absolutely NO CHANGE&lt;br /&gt;  IN MY SKIN OR COMPLEXION!  DO NOT BE DECEIVED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  jane</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see that is was any better than any other cream.  I thought it was a bit thick.  And I didn&#x27;t see the results like it said would happen.  It was a lot of money for nothing.  I&#x27;ll go back to my Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> Received this item.  Not sure if it is supposed to be watery but was very liquidly and every time I open jar spills over.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used long enough to see difference but for the cost the consistency is terrible.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY OR ITS TWIN SISTER, BELLALABS. They operate a shameful and manipulative &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; scam.  Even if the product were terrific (which it most certainly is not), the deceptive tactics of hiding a dense and complicated &amp;#34;Terms and Conditions&amp;#34; contract which you unwittingly agree to (when you think you are simply trying out a new product for the cost of shipping) should scream loud and clear that these people are not interested in satisfied repeat customers. They are interested in tricking you so they can &amp;#34;legally&amp;#34; charge your credit card $83 on the 15th day from the date of your order. Both La Creme and BellaLabs products are made with a long list of questionable chemical ingredients (no fewer than 6 forms of parabens in the BellaLabs product) and the fragrance is so overpowering I was forced to wash the stuff off almost immediately. It looks, smells and feels like cheap, pore-clogging gunk. Cancel your credit card if you made the mistake of giving it to these lawerly shysters. Zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the FREE $4.95 shipping cost only LA CREME &amp; BELLA LABS, to find out it was a SCAM. The cream smells wonderful and is smooth but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in getting rid of the wrinkles. Received the order on 321/15. I happened to notice on the brochure that if you do not cancel within 9 days and return the bottle they will charge your card $87.63.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is not good, do not fall in for $4.95 shipping cost only deal. Now I have to ship it from Hawaii and will cost lot more than $4.95. What Scam!</li>
            <li> I also ordered the FREE 14 day trial from LA CREME &amp; BELLA LABS,  to find out it was a scam.  The cream smells wonderful and is smooth but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in getting rid of the wrinkles. I also ordered from Bella Labs as suggested you use both cremes together.  I received the order on 6/12/14 and called today to cancel today, and they have charged my credit card $87.63 plus the 4.99 shipping.  I guess I didn&#x27;t read closely enough, but the 14 day trial starts the day you order, not when you receive it, so in actuality you&#x27;re not getting 14 days to try it out especially if it takes a while to get to you.  Wish I had checked out some of these reviews before ordering, &amp;#34;burn me once shame on you, burn me twice shame on me&amp;#34;.  Will definitely read fine print from now on.  DON&amp;#34;T order from this company. CSR was like a robot &amp;#34;sorry ma&#x27;am  that is the policy.  Buyer beware.  If I did want to order this product again, it would definitely be through Amazon, they have a much better deal and you&#x27;re not locked in to every 30 days.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:ec1eb3aa8d842f5815e9e27942f757bb]] I really like this La Creme face cream. It has a very, nice light fragrance that I enjoy very much as I put it on my face. I like how creamy and easy it is to smooth all over my face. It rubs in and dries very fast which I like because I am usually in a time crunch when I am trying to get ready to go somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream makes my skin feel very hydrated which I love. My complexion seems smoother and more even toned. My wrinkles haven&#x27;t suddenly vanished but I do feel like they are less noticeable which I am very impressed by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream doesn&#x27;t leave behind any sticky or greasy residue that I have noticed. This cream is also very gentle to my skin and has not caused any irritation or breakouts. I am looking forward to seeing continued results because I have added this product into my daily beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> You are warned: Case #751536254501 from Citi for my 14 day trial purchase, I called La Creme and they did take me off the auto renew but would not refund my charge, my trial was to expire 5/5/15 and I called and complained about the product on 4/30, it was very watery and one could tell it was an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer support told me that it is not runny and I am mistaken, bottom line, I filed report with my credit card company and they took the charge off until the dispute was settled, well Citi sided with La Creme due to the fine print and bs that is included in the terms, do not buy this stuff thinking you will have recourse if you don&#x27;t like it..</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware - Caused Breakouts and NOT Satisfied. Beware Invoice from LaCreme Facial Cream does not show complete charges.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month, and I haven&#x27;t seen any change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;This company is running a scam.  They do not stand behind their product because it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL!  They bill your credit card and when you call they refuse to issue a refund despite the problems/false advertising associated with their product.  I would not relent and continuously asked for a supervisor.  The representative put me on hold for a while to try to make me think he was looking for an available supervisor, but came back on the line only to tell me that no one was available.  However, he said he some &amp;#34;good news&amp;#34;.  He would be able to &amp;#34;split the difference&amp;#34; with me and issue a refund for 40 some odd dollars (approximately half of the charge).  I told him to do that, but that I was not finished with this problem and I would be contacting them again to get a complete refund!  Ridiculous!  Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after using this product for about a week,I see no difference in the appearance of my face. Works fantastic as a facial moisturizer, but as for the fine wrinkles under my eyes, no difference. I give this product a 4 star review, rather than a 3-star, because the cream smells great! I will update this review if I notice a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!  Its a scam!!!</li>
            <li> I like this face cream. It is very refreshing, easy to apply. The face cream makes the face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviews.  I got ripped off but good!  Did anyone notice the ingredients?  One of them is &amp;#34;snail secretion filtrate&amp;#34; - this can&#x27;t be good!  It also says it was made in Vietnam.  My husband went to Vietnam.  It appears they are still trying to &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; the Americans. Cancel your card, that way they can&#x27;t get any more from you than they already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice day - and be careful out there! (I didn&#x27;t want to put even one star on it!)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this cream after I had already ordered the product because of all of the negative reviews, so I was ready to return it as soon as I received it. I ended up giving it a shot anyway. I&#x27;m now on my second night of using it and I have already noticed a difference. My goal is to get rid of those tiny little lines on the top of my cheek when I smile.  So far I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference. As for the snail secretions... I was grossed out at first but decided to look into it. I read that It has natural acidic and elastin properties. My face is super soft as well. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in my skin.  The creme feels very good on my skin, is a great moisturizer and smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Am using in combinations with LaBella product. I am 73 and have definitely seeing an improvement in skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it. La Creme Skin Care has Bella Labs call and tell you that you need both products to use in tandem. (2nd product never received) The second product is not received before the 14 day trial then La Crème bills the full amount as you are past the 14 day trial. Offered to send the unopened product back they refuse.  BBB has numerous complaints and continue to refer to the contract!  Do not try the 14 day trial. Trickery - if they have a good product they would not need to resort to this!</li>
            <li> I have to give this A star or I would not be able to post my review, This product does not even deserve a star.  Do not purchase this crap. It is all fragrance and don&#x27;t believe that you need one with the other, they are both garbage and you are still dry after you apply it. Go for Cetaphil it&#x27;s cheaper and safer for your skin and it has skin type products that you can choose for your skin type and the facial cremes come with an SPF &amp; hyaluronic acid, a water retention ingredient for your  cells. You won&#x27;t be sorry, and no monthly fees. Oh, and you can find it at CVS, Walgreens, Walmart</li>
            <li> Claims to reduce wrinkles when used with Bellalabs Facial Cream are false!</li>
            <li> Love this, I have used all of the expensive products. This isn&#x27;t, and it really helps my lines.</li>
            <li> This is a good example of what a scam looks and feels like if you have never experienced one. They promise you a 14 day trial, the wording leading you to believe you have 14 days to try the product, but what they do is begin the 14 day trial the day you purchase the product so how they can call it 14 day trial is beyond me, then they charge you $87+ 14 DAYS FROM THE DAY YOU PURCHASE IT, and refuse to give you a refund, though after A VERY STRESSFUL AMOUNT OF  ARGUMENT argument finally refunded the full amount. The customer representatives are rude and belligerent. I felt like I was back in junior high school dealing with this person. What a hassle. Product is loaded with parabens which are terrible for you.</li>
            <li> I would offer a negative star if that was an option.  This was a complete scam.  Absolutely zero results and after the 14 day trial period I was automatically billed almost $90 for another bottle of the useless product.  Haha. Nice business model.</li>
            <li> love this cream was so glade you had it and will be getting more in the future</li>
            <li> aMY WIFE LOVES IT. SHE LIKES THE WAY THAT IT REMOVES HER WRINKLES.</li>
            <li> Well it is been only month but I think it is working, need more time</li>
            <li> This is a scam, regardless of how it works. Beware, the reviews are true!</li>
            <li> love it but for the price not much product to use</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and have very dry skin. I have been using this for a month so far and I love these products. Skin is soft and not greasy. Works well with putting on my makeup. I usually  have bad luck with skin care products but this works out very well. I would recommend this .</li>
            <li> This face cream is great. I recently recived this face cream by La Crème. It shipped in a fast an timely manner ( i got it before the expected delivery date) and it was well packaged. It comes in a nice 1.05 oz glass jar. It is a thick cream , so a little goes a long way. The directions say to use once or twice a day for best results. To apply just wash face , pat dry, and smooth on cream. This face cream has a wonderful light refreshing scent. It absorbs into skin well, leaving it very moisturized and non greasy. It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated. It is good for all skin types. The new formula uses peptides to help reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It also contains vitamins that help promote healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recived this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This is a nice anti-wrinkle face cream for me. It is very light, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily, and a little goes a long way. One container will probably last me at least a month using it only once a day. I also liked that on the bottom of the package printed is the the manufacturing date and expiration date. I have used to for a few days and my skin does feel softer. If you read the fine print, it does say that most people will see improvement after using the product 2-3 months. I will update my post after using this for 2.5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for an honest review of this product.</li>
            <li> Good formula and ingredients.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> Not all they said it would be</li>
            <li> I am a bit torn regarding this review since I&#x27;ve read a few reviews stating that some of the ingredients in the cream are not good for you but I have to say that my skin is firmer, younger looking and my tone has improved. A very noticeable difference. I will be looking into this a bit more to hopefully find the truth about this product but I cannot deny the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this. It&#x27;s all a scam.</li>
            <li> Can you give 0 stars?  This is a heavy oily product and it did nothing for my skin&lt;br /&gt;At least if you buy it on Amazon - you won&#x27;t get caught up in their subscription gimmick -- DO NOT SUBSCRIBE BEFORE YOU TRY THE PRODUCT.  La Creme&#x27;s customer service is atrocious and they treat their clients with contempt!</li>
            <li> Good product when used with bellalabs facial cream.</li>
            <li> This cream is ok.  Definitely not great and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> product arrive on time. However does not work like seen on TV....nice but if it doesn&#x27;t work does not good. I wasted my money. Oh on the commercial it states works with in a day or week. I have been using it for 3 weeks no change at all. I purchased a oil of Olay brown spot removal it worked in one week. Again wasted my money will not order this again.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry not for me.</li>
            <li> Be aware there is an auto shipment on this product.</li>
            <li> Caused an allergic skin reaction. Company does not provide full refund if dissatisfied with product during 14 day period.</li>
            <li> I couldnt tell a difference, yet. It was only a month supply.</li>
            <li> The first thing I do when I get any kind of cream is to smell it.  This anti-wrinkle cream smells so good.  When you open it up, just put a little on your hand.  The cream is so smooth that if you&#x27;re not careful you may get too much and waste it.  So just take a little with your finger and then rub it softly onto your face and neck.  And it&#x27;s always a good idea to put any creams or moisturizers on in an upward motion, going against gravity.  The box that the cream comes in says to pay special attention to the eye area and the forehead when applying this cream.  That makes sense because that&#x27;s where wrinkles show, around your eyes from smiling and squinting and also on your forehead from stress, etc.  When you apply this cream on your face, at first it feels a little thick, but afterwards your skin starts to soak it in and it leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth.  You can feel it start to work quickly.  It feels like your skin plumps up some.  It has vitamin E in it which is really good for healing and softening and vitamin B which is another great ingredient and it has peptides in it which help reduce lines and wrinkles.  I use this twice a day, morning and night, after washing and drying my face.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The cream was watered down.  It was runny. I will never buy it again</li>
            <li> I get this product for my wife, and this is free after a promotional code.&lt;br /&gt;This La Creme offers nourishment and moisturizer to your face and this is an anti-wrinkle cream. It contains ingredients that will help your skin looks younger and smooth face,</li>
            <li> I used this crème for the first time Saturday, it made my face feel soft and moisturized, I really liked it. thank you</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold up to what you claimed it would.  I saw no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. It really works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much improvement so I won&#x27;t be ordering anymore.</li>
            <li> 14 day free trial, my eye! Total scam!!! They send you a 30 day supply and want you PAY 89. EACH for La Creme and Bellalabs if you cancel and want to keep the bottles. Otherwise, you have to send the bottles back at your expense!</li>
            <li> Did not see any difference in skin tightening or tone after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I ordered the free trial, and received it while I was in the U.S.  I went home to Mexico, started using it, and broke out, so I stopped.  That said, it was hot by now, and I can&#x27;t use ANYTHING on my skin in sweaty weather (normally use Olay Regenerist), or I break out.  So, now that it&#x27;s cooling off, I&#x27;ve been using it again for about a month.  Well.  I&#x27;m 61, and have very droopy upper eyelids (I can see them, as they hang down over my eyelashes!).  I was even getting up the courage to go to a plastic surgeon to have the extra skin removed.  Not anymore!  My full upper eyelid now shows, and I have just a small bit left in the crease on my right eye, and a bit more on my left.  Amazing.  I had my daughter take a mug shot of me before use, which I looked at today, and I can hardly believe the difference!  And no break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the ordering, I did not cancel, because I forgot about it after I got home.  My daughter said I had received another one, and I said yeah, yeah, and didn&#x27;t check on it.  Then she said I got another one, so I checked, and sure enough, I&#x27;ve been billed $87.63 three times.  (Good thing I like it so much!)  So I emailed to cancel.  No problem there.  When I first ordered, I got a call from them within 20 minutes saying that if I had any questions or concerns not to hesitate to call!  That&#x27;s a first for me, and I was very impressed by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use up my supply, and if I am still so happy with it, will order from Amazon at about half the price!  I&#x27;ll keep you posted!</li>
            <li> They say combine it with Bella product but I don&#x27;t see difference with other products that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> it feels really good, I will keep you posted after I have used it a month and let you know about the results</li>
