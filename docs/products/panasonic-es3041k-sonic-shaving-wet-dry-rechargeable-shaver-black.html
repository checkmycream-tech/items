            <li>It shave great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say,</li>
            <li>and I get a great shave in about 2 minutes...</li>
            <li>All in all a great shaver at a great price.ther machine or a mug and brush.</li>
            <li>All in all a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li>That razor worked great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how happy I am with the purchase and performance.</li>
            <li>was remarkable.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>This razor was surprising since it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I noticed it in a department store and bought it for $19 to use as a travel shaver since it was fairly compact and had a travel case.</li>
            <li>And all was good, the guys with the gashes on their faces minded their business, and the guys with the stubly irratated skin minded theirs.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic WES9941P fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver hoping for a good alternative to the razor but it did not perform as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT SHAVE - VERY EASY TO CLEAN - ONE</li>
            <li>But shaving once a week is still way better than every day!</li>
            <li>When you factor in the price, it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>handy while traveling.    </li>
            <li>Nicely designed.</li>
            <li>I liked that shaver</li>
            <li>I bought Braun ($139 ) &amp; Pansonic Deluxe Sonic ($98) thru the years</li>
            <li>He was, as he put it, spectacularly unimpressed.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really surprisingly  waterproof and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because it is a good quality shaver, gives a close shave, and I can get 6 or more shaves before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li>I now use it more than a blade razor because it is so handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sixth, for a really great shave, use it with a hot lather machine or a mug and brush.</li>
            <li>But still better than a razor you can&#x27;t cut yourself and no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Why pay much more when this does the job?</li>
            <li>I have used the Panasonic shaver with the nanotech blades for more than a year and have never nicked my skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely an amazing deal in light of what the shavers cost at retail outlets.  </li>
            <li>(I like the Panasonic better.)</li>
            <li>The difference in the shavers is the lesser priced one has a foil head, which works best for me.</li>
            <li>Like I said before this is an excellent simple shaver.  </li>
            <li>IT REPLACES ONE THAT COST MORE THAN TWICE</li>
            <li>Clearly I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>This $25.00 Panasonic works even better.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times he went over the skin, he could still feel stubble, and he ended up with his skin irritated from his efforts.</li>
            <li>REALLY FAST!!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this original model(4 shavers)for about 25 years and have always liked it.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice shave, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is its price as it is extremely delicate (the screen had holes in it within a month of receiving it) and has to be charged fairly often; also, it performs best as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li>I recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a good close shave with a no nonsense device that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>like the charger as it is too easy to knock the shaver off of it.</li>
            <li>To clean the shaver, just squirt liquid soap on top and turn it on.</li>
            <li>To clean the shaver, just squirt liquid soap on top and turn it on.</li>
            <li>and I just had to put in my 2 cents, since I disagree with him so strongly.  </li>
            <li>It never fails to give a quick, clean shave and at a remarkable price.</li>
            <li>It works just fine if you shave every day.  </li>
            <li>This is the very first \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaver I&#x27;ve used and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>cover charge and men&#x27;s faces everywhere could be as smooth as the day they were born.</li>
            <li>Some men need to stray from the beaten path and are lured into cheap fixes prommissing to save money or time from the all mighty mach3.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things.</li>
            <li>It comes into the shower and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>My beard is relatively light</li>
            <li>This razor is a variation of the Smooth Operator which had the song by Sade in the ad.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to be writing a good review for a $25.00 razor.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is a very nice electric for an incredibly low price.</li>
            <li>This one excels in every way--fast, smooth, clean, comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning up the unit with a drop of liquid soap adds to the clever convenience of this handy shaver.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it never got better.  </li>
            <li>I originally paid 35 dollars for it.  </li>
            <li>This razor was originally called Sonic Shaving One (one head).</li>
            <li>Works great dry or in the shower with gel.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to discover it gave me a better shave than the shaver which I had purchased for more than five times the price.</li>
            <li>A piece of cake to clean.</li>
            <li>It gives me an very close shave and is most comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>and I find that the Braun even with their clean &amp; renew kit was a joke</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use, produces quick close shaves, and the battery keeps its charge all week.  </li>
            <li>I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver.</li>
            <li>FULL BATTERY CHARGE PROVIDES 2 WEEKS OF SHAVING -  BARGAIN PRICE</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s true, even with a Fusion.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the money.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely right, and the shave is surprisingly smooth.</li>
            <li>I never leave reviews but this time I just had to say how much I LOVE my new razor!</li>
            <li>For me this razor has been excellent, I have light facial hair and it has done a tremendous job in shaving, the battery charge lasts several weeks and cleaning the razor was a breeze under running hot water.  </li>
            <li>The cheap, lightweight plastic construction should have been my first clue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to electric shavers but pleased with this gadget.</li>
            <li>I also like the long hair trimmer better than the more costly model.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s even better than my old Panasonic!</li>
            <li>Gives a great shave with little irritation.  </li>
            <li>so your skin can \\&quot;adapt\\&quot; to it (whatever that means - probably more accurate to say that your shaving technique will adapt to it since I don&#x27;t think my skin actually went through any sort of transformation!).  </li>
            <li>It has worked exactly as promised; it is a true wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>I got this shaver because in the early 90&#x27;s I owned a tiny Panasonic travel shaver that worked great.  </li>
            <li>Shaves fast and clean.</li>
            <li>My face is VERY sensitive, in fact I&#x27;ve worn a beard for 10+ years because my face chaps so easily.</li>
            <li>, effecitve, close shave, very reasonable cost, BUT</li>
            <li>The blade and foil give nowhere near as fine a cut as the ES762 did.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that this shaver performs better than the older models of this type of Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wondered if this newer model would equal the service and satisfaction I received with the older one.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, i had to wait forever to get this shipped.</li>
            <li>This is my teens first shaver</li>
            <li>I wore out the first one.</li>
            <li>I bought the first model of this type of Panasonic shaver 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>It looked just like the first Panasonic one head Wet/Dry shaver I had purchased except that it is sleeker.</li>
            <li>And I was glad to find that it gives the exact same shave as the first Panasonic model I purchased.</li>
            <li>This one has no expensive frills and I don&#x27;t miss them at all.</li>
            <li>This is the first wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Paying more doesn&#x27;t necessarily get you more\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the nicest electric shavers that I&#x27;ve owned and the first wet-type shaver.</li>
            <li>FIRST LASTED ABOUT 7 YRS.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is rechargeable and can go at least three days  with out recharging ( great for traveling )</li>
            <li>So my most recent purchase enabled me to have one at each place.  </li>
            <li>[Hey, my first Amazon review!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver a some weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>However, if you go two days without shaving, you may need to blade shave first.</li>
            <li>I was initially hesitant to try the \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; shaver but the reviews were all positive and I&#x27;m glad I took the plunge.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get (just wash the thing under tap water).</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a wet &amp; dry type shaver, and I gotta tell ya, I LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li>Razor works great either as a dry razor or wet.</li>
            <li>If you have a tough beard you may not be happy with this product.</li>
            <li>it doesnt get whole sections, and i end up looking like a moth-eaten dog.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tear up my skin as much as the rotary shavers (e.g., Norelco)</li>
            <li>and I really like the fact that it has been designed for portability.  </li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t know, but it managed it.</li>
            <li>I would give it a five star rating except that it can nick the skin of my neck if I apply too much pressure when trying to shave too fast.</li>
            <li>But as much practice as I have had with this type of Panasonic shaver, that will not be a problem.    </li>
            <li>I will write a review for that one too after I very reluctantly try that one.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The combination of blades works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much I looked for another Panasonic but found none.  </li>
            <li>They really meant that this unit is washable.</li>
            <li>I have no issues with the shaver and it is very well built.</li>
            <li>AS MUCH.</li>
            <li>Its cheap enough that I will buy another one rather than replace the screen.</li>
            <li>Hmm, I wonder if he really tried this shaver.</li>
            <li>The blade and guard fit numerous Panasonic one head shavers.</li>
            <li>Man kind no longer had to endure daily mutilation or fire engine red stuble ridden skin.</li>
            <li>yes it is expensive as all good things are, but my face is as smooth as as a baby&#x27;s butt dipped in oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit is a bit noisy and takes a little longer to complete a shave than my prior electric shavers, but I&#x27;m very pleased over the results of a perfectly smooth shave with no skin</li>
            <li>This is a good razor for the money and will last for years if my experience with my other Panasonics is any guide.</li>
            <li>One blade (the only way to go), good power/torque, very sharp.</li>
            <li>Gives a respectable dry shave, no irritation on my sensitive skin, and cleans up by operating it under running water.</li>
            <li>This is far better than shaving with a dry electric.</li>
            <li>At first glance, he thought he wasn&#x27;t going to like it, but he charged it up and tried it and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is as good as more expensive shavers and will last three to four years on the battery installed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the only electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned that does a good job on my neck, you partially raise the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; unit and let it first cut the neck beard while the standard cutter follows and trims the rest.</li>
            <li>They cost almost as much as the new razor, so it&#x27;s easier just to get another shaver from Amazon.</li>
            <li>this, probably the older version,</li>
            <li>I purchased this model as a replacement for an older (comparable) model.    </li>
            <li>I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space.</li>
            <li>Does the job, isn&#x27;t flashy, and works great.  </li>
            <li>(I am careful to fully discharge before recharging), the shave is close and comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t mind the shower environment</li>
            <li>Second, I&#x27;ve tried the Panasonic two head wet/ dry shaver, and I think this one shaves better.</li>
            <li>My only issue is the charger has no cord and plugs right into the wall</li>
            <li>With this model, you simply hold the head at right angles and shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a new blade and foil but it feels like it is just pulling my hair out.</li>
            <li>I use it then buy a new one when the battery wears out.</li>
            <li>I can no longer plug it in to the light fixture in the bathroom and can&#x27;t plug it in under a cabinet due to the shaver having to be directly connected to the charger in order to charge.</li>
            <li>After using it for several months I decided to go back to the model similar to the one I have been using for many years.  </li>
            <li>But the charge lasts 5-10 days and it is a small design flaw that many others would consider a plus as there is no charger on the counter.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Panasonic wet/dry shaver probably 5 or 6 years ago; not the same model as this but the precursor to it.  </li>
            <li>My old Panasonic may have needed new blades or foil but the shave</li>
            <li>Works great for cleaning up those few die hard hairs on my balding pate where I can&#x27;t see - no buzz</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not interchangeable is the clear plastic snap on piece that protects the guard.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had a model that is nearly identical to this</li>
            <li>I just got it and have used it twice so far, both times in the shower.  </li>
            <li>will I stray to far from my savior the mach3</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t just mean the top pops off to rinse it under the sink (which it does), or that you can shave in the shower (which you can).</li>
            <li>I have stored many other shavers wet and have never had this happen.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a wet/ dry shaver.</li>
            <li>In my experience, no electric will do on my neck and poorly on the sideburns area and this one is no exception, but on the chin, lips, etc it is great, so I use a conventional razor there and the Panasonic on the rest.  </li>
            <li>True it was put back in the medicine cabinet wet with the plastic protective cover in place, but I believe still it should not show signs of rust.</li>
            <li>It does not nick the skin in any way such as the much older model could.</li>
            <li>Too bad it isn&#x27;t available any more.</li>
            <li>Men everywhere routinly came to work with huge chunk of their faces missing from the totally counter ergonomic razors.</li>
            <li>It is also showing signs of rust that are very apparent on the side burn blade.</li>
            <li>This was my first wet shaver tryout and it became a nightmare!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just a travel shaver; you can make it your one and only shaver if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver for $67.47.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth, I used to still blade shave my neck, but the instructions say to pop the trimmer half way up, and hold the razor trimmer first to shave the neck.</li>
            <li>More vibration of the blades then anything else, especially the side burner piece than actual direct linkage which makes this unit perform poorly.</li>
            <li>It reaches areas of curved recess on my face like no other shaver ( the crease between my chin and lower lip and my upper lip and my nose).  </li>
            <li>It replaces my old Braun single head linear.</li>
            <li>My previous one was a Braun (I prefer the single head shavers) normal dry shaver, and if I wanted a really close shave</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A GREAT SHAVE FOR THE $$$$$!!!!....</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son for Christmas based on the wonderful reviews.   </li>
            <li> very* happy</li>
            <li> This is an excellent choice for travel or home.  </li>
            <li> Very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD VALUE.</li>
            <li> Incredible price for what it does.</li>
            <li> Loves everything about it, including the great shave he gets with it.</li>
            <li> And it still gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> Great proudct @</li>
            <li> great price.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a great value here.</li>
            <li> I still use my blade but this is great for travel, quickie shaves, office etc.</li>
            <li> It shave great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say,</li>
            <li> and I get a great shave in about 2 minutes...</li>
            <li> All in all a great shaver at a great price.ther machine or a mug and brush.</li>
            <li> All in all a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> That razor worked great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how happy I am with the purchase and performance.</li>
            <li> was remarkable.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> This razor was surprising since it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I noticed it in a department store and bought it for $19 to use as a travel shaver since it was fairly compact and had a travel case.</li>
            <li> And all was good, the guys with the gashes on their faces minded their business, and the guys with the stubly irratated skin minded theirs.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic WES9941P fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver hoping for a good alternative to the razor but it did not perform as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SHAVE - VERY EASY TO CLEAN - ONE</li>
            <li> But shaving once a week is still way better than every day!</li>
            <li> When you factor in the price, it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> handy while traveling.    </li>
            <li> Nicely designed.</li>
            <li> I liked that shaver</li>
            <li> I bought Braun ($139 ) &amp; Pansonic Deluxe Sonic ($98) thru the years</li>
            <li> He was, as he put it, spectacularly unimpressed.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really surprisingly  waterproof and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because it is a good quality shaver, gives a close shave, and I can get 6 or more shaves before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I now use it more than a blade razor because it is so handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sixth, for a really great shave, use it with a hot lather machine or a mug and brush.</li>
            <li> But still better than a razor you can&#x27;t cut yourself and no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Why pay much more when this does the job?</li>
            <li> I have used the Panasonic shaver with the nanotech blades for more than a year and have never nicked my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely an amazing deal in light of what the shavers cost at retail outlets.  </li>
            <li> (I like the Panasonic better.)</li>
            <li> The difference in the shavers is the lesser priced one has a foil head, which works best for me.</li>
            <li> Like I said before this is an excellent simple shaver.  </li>
            <li> IT REPLACES ONE THAT COST MORE THAN TWICE</li>
            <li> Clearly I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> This $25.00 Panasonic works even better.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times he went over the skin, he could still feel stubble, and he ended up with his skin irritated from his efforts.</li>
            <li> REALLY FAST!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this original model(4 shavers)for about 25 years and have always liked it.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice shave, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is its price as it is extremely delicate (the screen had holes in it within a month of receiving it) and has to be charged fairly often; also, it performs best as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a good close shave with a no nonsense device that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> like the charger as it is too easy to knock the shaver off of it.</li>
            <li> To clean the shaver, just squirt liquid soap on top and turn it on.</li>
            <li> To clean the shaver, just squirt liquid soap on top and turn it on.</li>
            <li> and I just had to put in my 2 cents, since I disagree with him so strongly.  </li>
            <li> It never fails to give a quick, clean shave and at a remarkable price.</li>
            <li> It works just fine if you shave every day.  </li>
            <li> This is the very first \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaver I&#x27;ve used and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> cover charge and men&#x27;s faces everywhere could be as smooth as the day they were born.</li>
            <li> Some men need to stray from the beaten path and are lured into cheap fixes prommissing to save money or time from the all mighty mach3.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things.</li>
            <li> It comes into the shower and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My beard is relatively light</li>
            <li> This razor is a variation of the Smooth Operator which had the song by Sade in the ad.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to be writing a good review for a $25.00 razor.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is a very nice electric for an incredibly low price.</li>
            <li> This one excels in every way--fast, smooth, clean, comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning up the unit with a drop of liquid soap adds to the clever convenience of this handy shaver.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it never got better.  </li>
            <li> I originally paid 35 dollars for it.  </li>
            <li> This razor was originally called Sonic Shaving One (one head).</li>
            <li> Works great dry or in the shower with gel.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover it gave me a better shave than the shaver which I had purchased for more than five times the price.</li>
            <li> A piece of cake to clean.</li>
            <li> It gives me an very close shave and is most comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> and I find that the Braun even with their clean &amp; renew kit was a joke</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use, produces quick close shaves, and the battery keeps its charge all week.  </li>
            <li> I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> FULL BATTERY CHARGE PROVIDES 2 WEEKS OF SHAVING -  BARGAIN PRICE</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s true, even with a Fusion.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the money.</li>
            <li> The price is definitely right, and the shave is surprisingly smooth.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but this time I just had to say how much I LOVE my new razor!</li>
            <li> For me this razor has been excellent, I have light facial hair and it has done a tremendous job in shaving, the battery charge lasts several weeks and cleaning the razor was a breeze under running hot water.  </li>
            <li> The cheap, lightweight plastic construction should have been my first clue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to electric shavers but pleased with this gadget.</li>
            <li> I also like the long hair trimmer better than the more costly model.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even better than my old Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave with little irritation.  </li>
            <li> so your skin can \\&quot;adapt\\&quot; to it (whatever that means - probably more accurate to say that your shaving technique will adapt to it since I don&#x27;t think my skin actually went through any sort of transformation!).  </li>
            <li> It has worked exactly as promised; it is a true wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> I got this shaver because in the early 90&#x27;s I owned a tiny Panasonic travel shaver that worked great.  </li>
            <li> Shaves fast and clean.</li>
            <li> My face is VERY sensitive, in fact I&#x27;ve worn a beard for 10+ years because my face chaps so easily.</li>
            <li> , effecitve, close shave, very reasonable cost, BUT</li>
            <li> The blade and foil give nowhere near as fine a cut as the ES762 did.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that this shaver performs better than the older models of this type of Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wondered if this newer model would equal the service and satisfaction I received with the older one.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, i had to wait forever to get this shipped.</li>
            <li> This is my teens first shaver</li>
            <li> I wore out the first one.</li>
            <li> I bought the first model of this type of Panasonic shaver 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> It looked just like the first Panasonic one head Wet/Dry shaver I had purchased except that it is sleeker.</li>
            <li> And I was glad to find that it gives the exact same shave as the first Panasonic model I purchased.</li>
            <li> This one has no expensive frills and I don&#x27;t miss them at all.</li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Paying more doesn&#x27;t necessarily get you more\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest electric shavers that I&#x27;ve owned and the first wet-type shaver.</li>
            <li> FIRST LASTED ABOUT 7 YRS.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is rechargeable and can go at least three days  with out recharging ( great for traveling )</li>
            <li> So my most recent purchase enabled me to have one at each place.  </li>
            <li> [Hey, my first Amazon review!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver a some weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> However, if you go two days without shaving, you may need to blade shave first.</li>
            <li> I was initially hesitant to try the \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; shaver but the reviews were all positive and I&#x27;m glad I took the plunge.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get (just wash the thing under tap water).</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a wet &amp; dry type shaver, and I gotta tell ya, I LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li> Razor works great either as a dry razor or wet.</li>
            <li> If you have a tough beard you may not be happy with this product.</li>
            <li> it doesnt get whole sections, and i end up looking like a moth-eaten dog.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tear up my skin as much as the rotary shavers (e.g., Norelco)</li>
            <li> and I really like the fact that it has been designed for portability.  </li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t know, but it managed it.</li>
            <li> I would give it a five star rating except that it can nick the skin of my neck if I apply too much pressure when trying to shave too fast.</li>
            <li> But as much practice as I have had with this type of Panasonic shaver, that will not be a problem.    </li>
            <li> I will write a review for that one too after I very reluctantly try that one.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> The combination of blades works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so much I looked for another Panasonic but found none.  </li>
            <li> They really meant that this unit is washable.</li>
            <li> I have no issues with the shaver and it is very well built.</li>
            <li> AS MUCH.</li>
            <li> Its cheap enough that I will buy another one rather than replace the screen.</li>
            <li> Hmm, I wonder if he really tried this shaver.</li>
            <li> The blade and guard fit numerous Panasonic one head shavers.</li>
            <li> Man kind no longer had to endure daily mutilation or fire engine red stuble ridden skin.</li>
            <li> yes it is expensive as all good things are, but my face is as smooth as as a baby&#x27;s butt dipped in oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is a bit noisy and takes a little longer to complete a shave than my prior electric shavers, but I&#x27;m very pleased over the results of a perfectly smooth shave with no skin</li>
            <li> This is a good razor for the money and will last for years if my experience with my other Panasonics is any guide.</li>
            <li> One blade (the only way to go), good power/torque, very sharp.</li>
            <li> Gives a respectable dry shave, no irritation on my sensitive skin, and cleans up by operating it under running water.</li>
            <li> This is far better than shaving with a dry electric.</li>
            <li> At first glance, he thought he wasn&#x27;t going to like it, but he charged it up and tried it and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is as good as more expensive shavers and will last three to four years on the battery installed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the only electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned that does a good job on my neck, you partially raise the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; unit and let it first cut the neck beard while the standard cutter follows and trims the rest.</li>
            <li> They cost almost as much as the new razor, so it&#x27;s easier just to get another shaver from Amazon.</li>
            <li> this, probably the older version,</li>
            <li> I purchased this model as a replacement for an older (comparable) model.    </li>
            <li> I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space.</li>
            <li> Does the job, isn&#x27;t flashy, and works great.  </li>
            <li> (I am careful to fully discharge before recharging), the shave is close and comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t mind the shower environment</li>
            <li> Second, I&#x27;ve tried the Panasonic two head wet/ dry shaver, and I think this one shaves better.</li>
            <li> My only issue is the charger has no cord and plugs right into the wall</li>
            <li> With this model, you simply hold the head at right angles and shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a new blade and foil but it feels like it is just pulling my hair out.</li>
            <li> I use it then buy a new one when the battery wears out.</li>
            <li> I can no longer plug it in to the light fixture in the bathroom and can&#x27;t plug it in under a cabinet due to the shaver having to be directly connected to the charger in order to charge.</li>
            <li> After using it for several months I decided to go back to the model similar to the one I have been using for many years.  </li>
            <li> But the charge lasts 5-10 days and it is a small design flaw that many others would consider a plus as there is no charger on the counter.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Panasonic wet/dry shaver probably 5 or 6 years ago; not the same model as this but the precursor to it.  </li>
            <li> My old Panasonic may have needed new blades or foil but the shave</li>
            <li> Works great for cleaning up those few die hard hairs on my balding pate where I can&#x27;t see - no buzz</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not interchangeable is the clear plastic snap on piece that protects the guard.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had a model that is nearly identical to this</li>
            <li> I just got it and have used it twice so far, both times in the shower.  </li>
            <li> will I stray to far from my savior the mach3</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t just mean the top pops off to rinse it under the sink (which it does), or that you can shave in the shower (which you can).</li>
            <li> I have stored many other shavers wet and have never had this happen.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s a wet/ dry shaver.</li>
            <li> In my experience, no electric will do on my neck and poorly on the sideburns area and this one is no exception, but on the chin, lips, etc it is great, so I use a conventional razor there and the Panasonic on the rest.  </li>
            <li> True it was put back in the medicine cabinet wet with the plastic protective cover in place, but I believe still it should not show signs of rust.</li>
            <li> It does not nick the skin in any way such as the much older model could.</li>
            <li> Too bad it isn&#x27;t available any more.</li>
            <li> Men everywhere routinly came to work with huge chunk of their faces missing from the totally counter ergonomic razors.</li>
            <li> It is also showing signs of rust that are very apparent on the side burn blade.</li>
            <li> This was my first wet shaver tryout and it became a nightmare!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just a travel shaver; you can make it your one and only shaver if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver for $67.47.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, I used to still blade shave my neck, but the instructions say to pop the trimmer half way up, and hold the razor trimmer first to shave the neck.</li>
            <li> More vibration of the blades then anything else, especially the side burner piece than actual direct linkage which makes this unit perform poorly.</li>
            <li> It reaches areas of curved recess on my face like no other shaver ( the crease between my chin and lower lip and my upper lip and my nose).  </li>
            <li> It replaces my old Braun single head linear.</li>
            <li> My previous one was a Braun (I prefer the single head shavers) normal dry shaver, and if I wanted a really close shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get both heads on the double model in the right position.</li>
            <li> My old Remington was due for a replacement anyway, and I stumbled on the Panasonic I ultimately purchased.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when buying this shaver, mainly because it was inexpensive and cordless.</li>
            <li> After using this shaver for several weeks, I simply cannot see how this shaver could hurt my face in any manner as long as it is used correctly.</li>
            <li> I have changed the foil a few times over the past year on the assumption that it may be dull, but no matter what, it takes several passes to cut through a day old beard, and even then leaves several stray hairs that cannot be cut no matter how many passes or from which angle or direction you make the pass.  </li>
            <li> Waited too long to send it back</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, Panasonic says it takes a few weeks to get used to a new razor.</li>
            <li> He tried to use more pressure, but only succeeded in cutting his skin, not the hair.  </li>
            <li> The ablility to use it as a wet or dry is a major asset.  </li>
            <li> It has a faint buzz you can hear over the normal hum when it&#x27;s actually cutting off hairs, so I can tell when I&#x27;m shaved clean just by the sound of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect it to perform nearly as well as the everyday shaver I used.</li>
            <li> The original Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair!</li>
            <li> I also tried it on my dry leg with no effect.  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t get a smooth shave, and how in the world it cuts my skin without cutting the hair above it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this is a Wet/Dry shaver, I use it dry, without any shaving cream or preshave lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry, sometimes after over two days of beard growth.</li>
            <li> Whether I shave dry, with shaving cream or shaving gel, I get a close shave with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a single head design which is why I like it.</li>
            <li> The batteries supply over two weeks of shaves on a single charge.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for 6 years and have not replaced a single component.  </li>
            <li> I have had more expensive panasonic shavers for years and this one works just as well if not better.  </li>
            <li> I then ordered the Panasonic ES3041K Sonic Shaving Wet Dry Rechargeable Shaver for $24.99.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find replacement batteries for my old ES762s, and if that fails I&#x27;m going look for something in the high quality range, based on other reviews and recommendations from friends.</li>

            <li> when it finally arrived, i was not very satisfied.</li>
            <li> He used the Panasonic for a couple of weeks, then went back to the blade and was shocked at how effortlessly smooth his face was.</li>
            <li> I had a shaver much like this one a few years ago that lasted a least 8 years before the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about him ruining it by getting it wet.   </li>
            <li> I found that when I used it as a wet shaver, it gave me a shave that was as close if not closer than a razor shave.</li>
            <li> This razor trims very closely without irritating my skin at all.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had four Panasonic razors and I prefer them to any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Take it from me my brothers as a man who has walked on the other side do not buy this razor</li>
            <li> and I hope it&#x27;s not more of the same.  </li>
            <li> It was not worth the money I spent and wished I had never bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors in the past and could never get a close enough shave that was even \\&quot;acceptable\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It means you can lather up with Foamy or other shave cream and shave as with a blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fifth, as someone noted in a review, you&#x27;re supposed to replace the blade every year and the guard every two years (or the other way around).</li>
            <li> I previously had a $180.00 razor from another brand that I pruchased on a recommendation as every other razor I tried burned my skin.</li>
            <li> Eventually, the battery went down and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, so I replaced it with this Panasonic ES3041K model about 1 year ago.  </li>
            <li> the extra friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But washing with a little soap and water just before using this shaver, I get a beard that&#x27;s soften up a little by the washing, and then this shaver glides over the soapy lather like silk!!  </li>
            <li> Sharper than my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned Norelcos for over a decade.</li>
            <li> It is recharagable, lasts seven days on a charge, and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands.</li>
            <li> I bought the previous model of this razor about 5 years ago while on a business trip.  </li>
            <li> The ES364 is a slightly upscale version of it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cordless shaver, not necessarily to completely replace a razor, but to use at times when a blade razor was not handy to use (in the office, etc.)</li>
            <li> The charger is a little block, no wires.</li>
            <li> Charger is compact and takes little space.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had a model that is nearly identical to this this, probably the older version, but, i&#x27;d just like to say it&#x27;s lasted me 6 years.  It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge like it used to but I never expected it to last this long.  It works just fine if you shave every day.  But if you let it grow for a few days shaving is a real pain.  But still better than a razor you can&#x27;t cut yourself and no razor burn.  I&#x27;ll probably buy this one soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 30+ years, and bought this one to replace my worn-out Norelco triple rotary type device.  From day one, this shaver didn&#x27;t do the job.  The instructions say to give it a few weeks so your skin can \\&quot;adapt\\&quot; to it (whatever that means - probably more accurate to say that your shaving technique will adapt to it since I don&#x27;t think my skin actually went through any sort of transformation!).  Unfortunately, it never got better.  I have changed the foil a few times over the past year on the assumption that it may be dull, but no matter what, it takes several passes to cut through a day old beard, and even then leaves several stray hairs that cannot be cut no matter how many passes or from which angle or direction you make the pass.  To get these stray hairs, I usually end up doing a \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; with a disposible razor blade, which sort of defeats the purpose of owning the electric device.</li>
            <li> Twenty +/- years ago I bought a Panasonic wet/dry shaver and used it until the battery died and the screen and cutter failed. I loved it. People keep telling me that the price of these razors has gone up and that they are no longer affordable. I finally decided to take a look for myself on Amazon and bought the ES3041K. The price hadn&#x27;t gone up and it&#x27;s even better than my old Panasonic! IMO, use it for a month and you&#x27;ll never go back. And I can stop buying razor blades at 14 bucks a pop.</li>
            <li> Firstly, i had to wait forever to get this shipped. when it finally arrived, i was not very satisfied. been using it for about 2 weeks now, but i think im gonna stop. it doesnt get whole sections, and i end up looking like a moth-eaten dog. i dont know why.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model as a replacement for an older (comparable) model.    This unit, although it works, and is a newer model however it does not work as well. More vibration of the blades then anything else, especially the side burner piece than actual direct linkage which makes this unit perform poorly. It is also showing signs of rust that are very apparent on the side burn blade. I had never had any shave blade rust on me, not even the disposable type. True it was put back in the medicine cabinet wet with the plastic protective cover in place, but I believe still it should not show signs of rust. I have stored many other shavers wet and have never had this happen. The charger: small box like piece that must be attached to the unit and then plugged in. NO CORD.  I can no longer plug it in to the light fixture in the bathroom and can&#x27;t plug it in under a cabinet due to the shaver having to be directly connected to the charger in order to charge. No corded charging base is the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had four Panasonic razors and I prefer them to any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.  This is a good razor for the money and will last for years if my experience with my other Panasonics is any guide.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He used it with lather on his face, and it did not remove the hair.  He tried to use more pressure, but only succeeded in cutting his skin, not the hair.  I also tried it on my dry leg with no effect.  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like the compact no-cord design of the charger. The price is definitely right, and the shave is surprisingly smooth. Works great dry or in the shower with gel.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver.  When you factor in the price, it is amazing.  I just got it and have used it twice so far, both times in the shower.  It has worked exactly as promised; it is a true wet/dry shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t tear up my skin as much as the rotary shavers (e.g., Norelco) and I really like the fact that it has been designed for portability.  It&#x27;s not just a travel shaver; you can make it your one and only shaver if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver, has had it for years.  Keeps coming back to buy another one.  Loves everything about it, including the great shave he gets with it.</li>
            <li> This is my third or fourth Panasonic wet/dry. I shave everyday. This razor was surprising since it was so inexpensive. My old Panasonic may have needed new blades or foil but the shave I got with this razor was remarkable. Bought a Braun once (still use it as a travel shaver but doesn&#x27;t stand up to the shave with the panasonic). Had it for a week or two and still haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it.</li>
            <li> What can I say that will make you trust this shaver? I have been using this original model(4 shavers)for about 25 years and have always liked it. It&#x27;s not the fancy model or have a lot of extra features, but it gets the job done to my satisfaction. I still remember way back when, when my barber refused to believe I had shaved that day with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Razor works great either as a dry razor or wet. Everything I wanted at an excellent price. Why pay much more when this does the job?</li>
            <li> This is my teens first shaver and it&#x27;s perfect.  It came with a charger that stays plugged into the outlet and holds the shaver while not in use.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose well.  Since it&#x27;s wet/dry and my son is only 13, it&#x27;s perfect for him and I don&#x27;t have to worry about him ruining it by getting it wet.   It also comes with a carrying bag which comes in handy while traveling.    Good product.</li>
            <li> well, i&#x27;ve used it three or four times.  then i bought a different razor. couldn&#x27;t get a smooth shave, and how in the world it cuts my skin without cutting the hair above it i really don&#x27;t know, but it managed it.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a single head design which is why I like it. It reaches areas of curved recess on my face like no other shaver ( the crease between my chin and lower lip and my upper lip and my nose).  This is the second shaver of this design I have owned. I wore out the first one. Am tempted to order another one in case this is ever discontinued.</li>
            <li> I bought the first model of this type of Panasonic shaver 15 years ago. I noticed it in a department store and bought it for $19 to use as a travel shaver since it was fairly compact and had a travel case. I did not expect it to perform nearly as well as the everyday shaver I used. I was surprised to discover it gave me a better shave than the shaver which I had purchased for more than five times the price. I eventually tossed the more expensive shaver and began using the inexpensive Panasonic one head Wet/Dry shaver every day. I found that when I used it as a wet shaver, it gave me a shave that was as close if not closer than a razor shave. After using it for 12 to 13 years, it finally gave out on me and would no longer charge.  I could not find a similar model at that time and bought a Panasonic with the nanotech blades instead. But the Panasonic with the nanotech blades does not shave my neck as well as the Panasonic one head Wet/Dry shaver did. When I recently noticed this one on the Panasonic website, I bought it immediately. It looked just like the first Panasonic one head Wet/Dry shaver I had purchased except that it is sleeker. And I was glad to find that it gives the exact same shave as the first Panasonic model I purchased. I would give it a five star rating except that it can nick the skin of my neck if I apply too much pressure when trying to shave too fast. I have used the Panasonic shaver with the nanotech blades for more than a year and have never nicked my skin. But as much practice as I have had with this type of Panasonic shaver, that will not be a problem.    Update: I was surprised to find that this shaver performs better than the older models of this type of Panasonic shaver. It does not nick the skin in any way such as the much older model could. And I am still amazed to find any bad reviews of this product. A few said it hurt their face. Do they realize they do not and should not apply pressure to get this shaver to do its job? After using this shaver for several weeks, I simply cannot see how this shaver could hurt my face in any manner as long as it is used correctly. And it still gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement when my Panasonic ES762s stopped charging. That was a big mistake because this shaver is on the low end of the quality/comfort scale and is not a replacement for the ES762s. My mistake for thinking it could be. It actually hurts to shave with it. The cheap, lightweight plastic construction should have been my first clue. The blade and foil give nowhere near as fine a cut as the ES762 did. I&#x27;ve tried a new blade and foil but it feels like it is just pulling my hair out. If you have a tough beard you may not be happy with this product. I&#x27;m trying to find replacement batteries for my old ES762s, and if that fails I&#x27;m going look for something in the high quality range, based on other reviews and recommendations from friends.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this one. My son used it a few times and no matter what he tried it just doesn&#x27;t work well. Waited too long to send it back so we got stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Great proudct @ great price. My second one.    Sharper than my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a quick shave. I use it at work in the evening if I have a client engagement/dinner. I would not recommend it for regular morning use.</li>
            <li> Nicely designed., effecitve, close shave, very reasonable cost, BUT..could they tell you simply how to turn it ON? Embarassed to admit, took me almost 15 minutes to figure out the ON/OFF feature.</li>
            <li> In the begining there was the disposable bic razor. Men everywhere routinly came to work with huge chunk of their faces missing from the totally counter ergonomic razors. Then they invented the electric razor and men came to work with their faces intact but skin as red and irratated as satans&#x27; eyes after a all nighter of smoking pot, and as stubly as your grandma&#x27;s legs. And all was good, the guys with the gashes on their faces minded their business, and the guys with the stubly irratated skin minded theirs. &lt;br /&gt;And then there was the mach 3 by Gillette. Man kind no longer had to endure daily mutilation or fire engine red stuble ridden skin. All it took was a $2.50 a week cover charge and men&#x27;s faces everywhere could be as smooth as the day they were born. All their prayers were answered.&lt;br /&gt;But alas some men are never happy with perfection. Some men need to stray from the beaten path and are lured into cheap fixes prommissing to save money or time from the all mighty mach3. Some men are tricked into buying horrible inneffecctive electric razors from heathen snake oil salesmen. And was one of those men oh yes I was one. I paid 50 plus dollars to look like a total moron at work with my blotchy irritated stubly face for the three weeks the instuctions implored me to wait while my &amp;quot;skin adjusted&amp;quot; to being painfully, and badly shaved. &lt;BR&gt;   &lt;BR&gt;But I have repented I have been born again never again will I stray to far from my savior the mach3 yes it is expensive as all good things are, but my face is as smooth as as a baby&#x27;s butt dipped in oil. Take it from me my brothers as a man who has walked on the other side do not buy this razor your face will look like hellfire.</li>
            <li> I have had more expensive panasonic shavers for years and this one works just as well if not better.  Definitely an amazing deal in light of what the shavers cost at retail outlets.  This one has no expensive frills and I don&#x27;t miss them at all.</li>
            <li> Comes with a pouch. The charger is a little block, no wires. The socket has to support the weight of the charger and shaver. Makes you think it&#x27;s a travel shaver. It doesn&#x27;t shave that close, no pull up and cut technology here. Not bad for the money.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver because in the early 90&#x27;s I owned a tiny Panasonic travel shaver that worked great.  This was my first wet shaver tryout and it became a nightmare!  I used it with shaving foam and had to go over and over my neck until I had a raw mess like hamburger meat! I waited to try it again because it says to stick with it so your beard/skin get used to it-BAD IDEA! I actually took pictures of my wrecked neck and sent to Panasonic and asked for the dual foil they sent the 4025 and I hope it&#x27;s not more of the same.  I will write a review for that one too after I very reluctantly try that one.</li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve used and I really like it.  A piece of cake to clean.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shaver; using shaving cream gives the best of both worlds, a close blade shave with the convenience of an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned that does a good job on my neck, you partially raise the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; unit and let it first cut the neck beard while the standard cutter follows and trims the rest. The combination of blades works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is a bit noisy and takes a little longer to complete a shave than my prior electric shavers, but I&#x27;m very pleased over the results of a perfectly smooth shave with no skin burn or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning up the unit with a drop of liquid soap adds to the clever convenience of this handy shaver. I was initially hesitant to try the \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; shaver but the reviews were all positive and I&#x27;m glad I took the plunge. I recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a good close shave with a no nonsense device that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> I have THREE Braun electric shavers but all were OVER $100.00!! I purchased the [[ASIN:B00006WNQ9 Panasonic ES3041K Sonic Shaving Wet Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Black]] for WET use in the shower.  This razor is excellent and for the price GET ONE!! IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Gives a great shave with little irritation.  Charger is compact and takes little space.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lightweight simple wet/dry shaving device that had inexpensive replacement foil and blade assemblies. The Panasonic WES9941P fit perfectly. Gives a nice shave, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean. It replaces my old Braun single head linear. (I like the Panasonic better.) The batteries supply over two weeks of shaves on a single charge. Give it a few weeks of shaves to break in to cut real close.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is its price as it is extremely delicate (the screen had holes in it within a month of receiving it) and has to be charged fairly often; also, it performs best as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver hoping for a good alternative to the razor but it did not perform as I wanted. It takes several passess to get the hair and then sometimes leaves patches behind.  It was not worth the money I spent and wished I had never bought it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver for $67.47. After using it for several months I decided to go back to the model similar to the one I have been using for many years.  I then ordered the Panasonic ES3041K Sonic Shaving Wet Dry Rechargeable Shaver for $24.99.  Actually, I purchases two of them to have one for back-up.  Lesson learned: \\&quot;Paying more doesn&#x27;t necessarily get you more\\&quot;.  I get the best shave with model ES3041K.  It gives me an very close shave and is most comfortable to use.  I also like the long hair trimmer better than the more costly model.  The difference in the shavers is the lesser priced one has a foil head, which works best for me.</li>
            <li> I had a shaver much like this one a few years ago that lasted a least 8 years before the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I liked that shaver so much I looked for another Panasonic but found none.  I had a Remington and it didn&#x27;t last long.  I searched for a Panasonic again and found this one. Like I said before this is an excellent simple shaver.  Does the job, isn&#x27;t flashy, and works great.  I won&#x27;t buy anything but Panasonic from now on.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest electric shavers that I&#x27;ve owned and the first wet-type shaver. I have previously owned Norelcos for over a decade. The original Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair! It is painful! I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars. Bad idea - you don&#x27;t always get what you pay for! I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver. I took my chance on this one, based solely on the reviews here. This is the very first \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaver I&#x27;ve used and absolutely love it. It gives a close enough shave but not too close. You can use it with whatever shaving cream you use.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note that the Panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type (not gel), Barbasol like stuff with this shaver. It also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get (just wash the thing under tap water). They really meant that this unit is washable. It is recharagable, lasts seven days on a charge, and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands. The build quality is excellent. The charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space. You cannot go wrong with this. Amazon has a great value here. Sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For me this razor has been excellent, I have light facial hair and it has done a tremendous job in shaving, the battery charge lasts several weeks and cleaning the razor was a breeze under running hot water.  Amazon also gave me the best price.</li>
            <li> I use a blade and shaving cream, for decades. I tried electrics years ago but was not impressed with the shave or the ease of maintenance. I bought this razor for a hospital stay and I am impressed. Does just like advertised. Gives a respectable dry shave, no irritation on my sensitive skin, and cleans up by operating it under running water. I still use my blade but this is great for travel, quickie shaves, office etc. Incredible price for what it does.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic prior to this that lasted 5 years until the batteries died. I took a chance on this as is it inexpensive. It shave great and I just use soap with it instead of shaving creme. It comes into the shower and is easy to clean. I have no issues with the shaver and it is very well built. My only issue is the charger has no cord and plugs right into the wall and I do not have a lot of room above my plug. But the charge lasts 5-10 days and it is a small design flaw that many others would consider a plus as there is no charger on the counter. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver, for the money, you can&#x27;t beat it anywhere.  No complaints what so ever. Definitely recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to electric shavers but pleased with this gadget. It&#x27;s really surprisingly  waterproof and easy to maintain. I still have to learn how to keep skin taut to avoid scrapes. Seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my husband for Father&#x27;s day at his request.  At first glance, he thought he wasn&#x27;t going to like it, but he charged it up and tried it and was pleasantly surprised.  Very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought Braun ($139 ) &amp; Pansonic Deluxe Sonic ($98) thru the years and I find that the Braun even with their clean &amp; renew kit was a joke, I had to buy replacements tops or blades 3 times a year, for the cost of 3 of Es3041. I find that Es3041k out shaves them all.  The best part is the price that Amazon sells it for is cheaper than buying the replacements foil &amp; blade.  I&#x27;m ordering 2 today, I use them about 6-8 months at a time &amp; toss them.  I find that if you use Lectric Pre Shave you get a cleaner shave and use witch hazel after.   I been using this type model for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY 2ND ONE.  FIRST LASTED ABOUT 7 YRS.  VERY GOOD VALUE.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, yet it does what it is supposed to do.  I use it as a touch-up to a razor blade in the shower.  Gets all the corners without abrasion.</li>
            <li> I have used the ES3041K shaver for 2 years. Having a rather tough beard  the Pansonic is the only electric shaver I have found to work for me.  The ablility to use it as a wet or dry is a major asset.  I like the fact that it is rechargeable and can go at least three days  with out recharging ( great for traveling ) If you have not much success with electric shavers in the past, Give the ES3041K a try. Beware, not many stores stock this shaver ( at least not in Minnesota) and you may have to order online.</li>
            <li> I bought the previous model of this razor about 5 years ago while on a business trip.  The airline had &#x27;misplaced&#x27; my luggage and I needed another razor.  My old Remington was due for a replacement anyway, and I stumbled on the Panasonic I ultimately purchased.  That model lasted me for over 4 years, with only 1 blade/foil replacement during that time.  Eventually, the battery went down and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, so I replaced it with this Panasonic ES3041K model about 1 year ago.  Honestly, I wondered if this newer model would equal the service and satisfaction I received with the older one.  I&#x27;m happy to say, it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is a Wet/Dry shaver, I use it dry, without any shaving cream or preshave lotion.  My beard is relatively light and I get a great shave in about 2 minutes...with no burn or redness.  For the money, I don&#x27;t think this unit can be beat!  Heck, my father-in-law (a blade man for 65 yrs) is now asking me about getting one of these for him!</li>
            <li> A GREAT SHAVE FOR THE $$$$$!!!!....IT REPLACES ONE THAT COST MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH. AND IT TOOK RECORD TIME TO GET TO ME....REALLY FAST!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for 6 years and have not replaced a single component.  I originally paid 35 dollars for it.  Too bad it isn&#x27;t available any more.</li>
            <li> Had one for the last 2 years until I tore the screen. This is the best shaver I have ever used. Shaves fast and clean.Its cheap enough that I will buy another one rather than replace the screen. &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the charger as it is too easy to knock the shaver off of it.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Panasonic wet/dry shaver probably 5 or 6 years ago; not the same model as this but the precursor to it.  I had to replace the foil once and the cutters once after about 3 yrs.  When the battery finally went, I replaced with this model.  Since we spend a lot of time at our condo and since my memory ain&#x27;t what it used to be, I would leave there or leave at home and not have when/where I wanted it.  So my most recent purchase enabled me to have one at each place.  Clearly I am pleased with it.  The battery seems to last forever (I am careful to fully discharge before recharging), the shave is close and comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t mind the shower environment a bit - mine is used in the shower and stays in the shower except for charging.  In my experience, no electric will do on my neck and poorly on the sideburns area and this one is no exception, but on the chin, lips, etc it is great, so I use a conventional razor there and the Panasonic on the rest.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son for Christmas based on the wonderful reviews.   He used it for a couple of weeks and tried to adjust to it.   But, he looked like he got in a fight with a lawnmower and lost.   It just butchered his face and he finally just tossed it in the trash and went back to disposables.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This shaver is as good as more expensive shavers and will last three to four years on the battery installed.  I use it then buy a new one when the battery wears out. For the price you cant beat it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when buying this shaver, mainly because it was inexpensive and cordless. I wanted a cordless shaver, not necessarily to completely replace a razor, but to use at times when a blade razor was not handy to use (in the office, etc.) But because it was a reliable brand like Panasonic, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did because it is a good quality shaver, gives a close shave, and I can get 6 or more shaves before it needs to be recharged. I now use it more than a blade razor because it is so handy.</li>
            <li> I bought the ES3041 several weeks ago. It follows several models of Braun and before that Remington electric shavers.This one excels in every way--fast, smooth, clean, comfortable. I use it dry, sometimes after over two days of beard growth. It never fails to give a quick, clean shave and at a remarkable price. Hats off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun&#x27;s, Norelco&#x27;s and Remmington&#x27;s. This Panasonic is a very nice electric for an incredibly low price. One blade (the only way to go), good power/torque, very sharp. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but this time I just had to say how much I LOVE my new razor! My face is VERY sensitive, in fact I&#x27;ve worn a beard for 10+ years because my face chaps so easily. I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors in the past and could never get a close enough shave that was even \\&quot;acceptable\\&quot;. This razor trims very closely without irritating my skin at all. That being said, if I skip a couple days shaving I have to use a regular blade razor to get the hair short enough to start using it again. But shaving once a week is still way better than every day!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SHAVE - VERY EASY TO CLEAN - ONE FULL BATTERY CHARGE PROVIDES 2 WEEKS OF SHAVING -  BARGAIN PRICE</li>
            <li> [Hey, my first Amazon review!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver a some weeks ago.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a wet &amp; dry type shaver, and I gotta tell ya, I LOVE it!!  My previous one was a Braun (I prefer the single head shavers) normal dry shaver, and if I wanted a really close shave it left my skin a little sore from the extra friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But washing with a little soap and water just before using this shaver, I get a beard that&#x27;s soften up a little by the washing, and then this shaver glides over the soapy lather like silk!!  My shave is close every time, and my face is *very* happy I found this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bonus for me.  It has a faint buzz you can hear over the normal hum when it&#x27;s actually cutting off hairs, so I can tell when I&#x27;m shaved clean just by the sound of the shaver.  Works great for cleaning up those few die hard hairs on my balding pate where I can&#x27;t see - no buzz &#x3D; no stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just came back to buy another one of these (to leave in my travel kit - I keep it fully equipped so I can just grab it and go).  And I read the review again from the mach 3 guy and I just had to put in my 2 cents, since I disagree with him so strongly.  FWIW, I notice that he doesn&#x27;t mention this shaver explictly, just touts the mach 3.  Hmm, I wonder if he really tried this shaver.</li>
            <li> I shave with the Panasonic ES3041K every day. I&#x27;m sold on it. Here&#x27;s why. First, it&#x27;s a wet/ dry shaver. That doesn&#x27;t just mean the top pops off to rinse it under the sink (which it does), or that you can shave in the shower (which you can). It means you can lather up with Foamy or other shave cream and shave as with a blade. This is far better than shaving with a dry electric. Second, I&#x27;ve tried the Panasonic two head wet/ dry shaver, and I think this one shaves better. Why? It&#x27;s hard to get both heads on the double model in the right position. With this model, you simply hold the head at right angles and shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, Panasonic says it takes a few weeks to get used to a new razor. I think that&#x27;s true, even with a Fusion. This razor was originally called Sonic Shaving One (one head). There were also Sonic Shaving Two and Three models. This razor is a variation of the Smooth Operator which had the song by Sade in the ad. The ES364 is a slightly upscale version of it. This one gives about seven shaves on a charge and comes with a charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, I used to still blade shave my neck, but the instructions say to pop the trimmer half way up, and hold the razor trimmer first to shave the neck. This works well. Pop the trimmer all the way up to shave sideburns and mustache. However, if you go two days without shaving, you may need to blade shave first. This Panasonic is a daily driver; I still blade shave with a Fusion or Mach 3 on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, as someone noted in a review, you&#x27;re supposed to replace the blade every year and the guard every two years (or the other way around). They cost almost as much as the new razor, so it&#x27;s easier just to get another shaver from Amazon. The blade and guard fit numerous Panasonic one head shavers. What&#x27;s not interchangeable is the clear plastic snap on piece that protects the guard. My suggestion is throw it in your shaving kit while shaving so you don&#x27;t lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixth, for a really great shave, use it with a hot lather machine or a mug and brush. Panasonic doesn&#x27;t recommend gel because it&#x27;s too thick. I used Brut shave foam but it didn&#x27;t glide as well as Foamy. To clean the shaver, just squirt liquid soap on top and turn it on. It lathers up and cleans itself. All in all a great shaver at a great price.ther machine or a mug and brush. Panasonic doesn&#x27;t recommend gel because it&#x27;s too thick.

            <li> I am surprised to be writing a good review for a $25.00 razor. I previously had a $180.00 razor from another brand that I pruchased on a recommendation as every other razor I tried burned my skin. That razor worked great. This $25.00 Panasonic works even better. Whether I shave dry, with shaving cream or shaving gel, I get a close shave with no razor burn. I can&#x27;t believe how happy I am with the purchase and performance.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace another brand.  This is an excellent choice for travel or home.  It is comfortable to use, produces quick close shaves, and the battery keeps its charge all week.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, who had been using a disposable blade shaver since his Norelco died. He was, as he put it, spectacularly unimpressed. No matter how many times he went over the skin, he could still feel stubble, and he ended up with his skin irritated from his efforts. He used the Panasonic for a couple of weeks, then went back to the blade and was shocked at how effortlessly smooth his face was. Not recommended.</li>
