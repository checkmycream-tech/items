            <li>This is perfect as a refresher.</li>
            <li>It works great for me!</li>

            <li>This product is great in a pinch to make your hair look great when you don&#x27;t have time for washing and setting it.</li>
            <li>It has been effective beyond my greatest expectations.</li>
            <li>This is great to use in between washings.  </li>
            <li>I work out every morning and this is great when you are in a hurry and do not have time to watch your hair.  </li>
            <li>They even make one that has keratin, so it&#x27;s good for your hair while it helps de-grease it.</li>
            <li>I have found the Stilla works better for me and smells great</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>My daughter shared a bottle of this product with me, and I was looking for a bottle of my own ever since.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time on how nice my hair smells.</li>
            <li>It also thickens my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bargain &amp; is kind to your hair.</li>
            <li>but again, I love the product</li>
            <li>and I normally love John Frieda products.  </li>
            <li>Then I found I was able to order it on amazon.com..</li>
            <li>Most products just don&#x27;t deliver the results I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>A dry shampoo is perfect if I didn&#x27;t get a chance to wash my hair before work or after a lunch time</li>
            <li>Perfect for the day after shampooing and blow drying to refresh it and let you wear your hair down again rather than having to throw it into a bun or ponytail.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for a quick Hair refresher..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and makes my hair feel cleaner without added weight or stickiness.</li>
            <li>I can now go 2 days between washings &amp; still feel &amp; look like I have clean hair.  </li>
            <li>Having fine, long hair, I have tried many, many products to give me the body and fullness I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product for those of us with fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair fresh and full between shampoos..</li>
            <li>Really upset John Frieda decided to discontinue this!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different dry shampoos of differing price points and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I often worried if people could smell it in my hair, and if they could, what was the point in having my hair look fresh if it didn&#x27;t smell fresh?</li>
            <li>There are other with good review&#x27;s that I have tried ,but don&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to strong smells, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stand the smell though!</li>
            <li>I first read about this product in the Oprah magazine a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li>However, you should know that there are probably more powerful dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>, it is a very fresh &amp; light dry shampoo</li>
            <li>On the other hand, nice for a bag, for travel.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way this dry shampoo works.</li>
            <li>more like hairspray than dry shampoo</li>
            <li>I have tried many dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another product that I think may be better than the John Frieda is the Ojon Dry Cleanser</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair and it was very forceful.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>Spray at the hair roots, gently rub into the scalp with your finger tips.  </li>
            <li>It really does the trick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very chemical smelling.</li>
            <li>really greasy hair should be cautious.</li>
            <li>Bought it at Ulta (very inexpensive) and found it to be very effective in fluffy my thinning hair and &amp;#34;buying&amp;#34; me an extra day before needing to wash it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and was excited to see a dry shampoo that promised some extra volume.  </li>
            <li>But you can only use this product on the second day, If your hair is too greasy it wont do much, but better than nothing.</li>
            <li>like the size of this canister, but you can get a better smelling product for a lot less from Suave.</li>
            <li>I find this leaves less visible residue and has a better smell.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the results on my thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li>MY only complain is that it comes in a small size, I would like a large size of something this good.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also such a strong perfume smell that I can barely stand it!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for all hair types.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to add to your collection of products.</li>
            <li>So maybe not the safest to use but light enough for limp fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is my new remedy, and I continue to keep plenty on hand.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure that you shake it well before spraying, and push down the nozzle far enough, otherwise you won&#x27;t get any powder out.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need the extra volume and enjoy strong and artificial perfume smells, you will likely enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of dry shampoos, and they all seem to be pretty much the same product, with the exception of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>really like this dry shampoo because it leaves my hair looking</li>
            <li>Its  make your hair less greasy and fresh your hair.</li>
            <li>but this one is such a fine powder that after you brush it out, it simply feels like you just washed and dried your hair.</li>
            <li>I think this is a really decent dry shampoo</li>
            <li>and it makes my thin brittle hair look way better.  </li>
            <li>This dry volume spray really works for my mixed grey hair!</li>
            <li>This is not too much of a problem for me since I have blondish-brown hair, but if you have dark hair, it could be a big problem.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine, thin hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the only dry hair shampoo which I can use without taking time to get white powder out,  I try and keep it in stock.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t overly oily, so I occasionally get away with using this as a dry shampoo for the second day after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and each time, I end up using another dry shampoo to acheive the desired result.  </li>
            <li> Also, I feel like this one deposits a much thicker layer of powder into my hair, making it hard to blend into my brunette</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little over beauty product adds, they promise much, but deliver little.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dry shampoo, bought it used it and using it since it came out.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for those days when you don&#x27;t feel like shampooing and adds tons of volume.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair or use any chemical processing.  </li>
            <li> B000XXX24A Ojon Rub-Out Dry Cleanser 4.5 oz]].  </li>
            <li> Other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have contained clay and caused a gunky buildup on my scalp</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be naturally oily and I am way past my teens!  </li>
            <li> For dark hair, I would recommend Bumble and Bumble Hair Powder, which comes in a variety of colors[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I spray it at my hairline, down my part, and then lift the crown of my hair and spray underneath.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thin hair</li>
            <li> I sprayed it with people over and they complained about the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Plus, my husband complained about the smell from this one.  </li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that the manufacturer has decided to discontinue it from their Volume line :</li>
            <li> &quot; the smell is not too offensive, and it is not too expensive.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE the way this dry shampoo works. It&#x27;s light and makes my hair feel cleaner without added weight or stickiness. However, I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product provides any extra volume as the name suggests. The smell is also such a strong perfume smell that I can barely stand it! I sprayed it with people over and they complained about the smell as well. If you don&#x27;t need the extra volume and enjoy strong and artificial perfume smells, you will likely enjoy this product. If you are sensitive to strong smells, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that the manufacturer has decided to discontinue it from their Volume line :-(.....but again, I love the product, it is a very fresh &amp; light dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and was excited to see a dry shampoo that promised some extra volume.  I have used this several times and each time, I end up using another dry shampoo to acheive the desired result.  Plus, my husband complained about the smell from this one.  I have found the Stilla works better for me and smells great but it is not an aerosol (which I like).  I would not buy this again and I normally love John Frieda products.  This one just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for a quick Hair refresher..Couldn&#x27;t find it anyplace--Then I found I was able to order it on amazon.com..It arrives promptly and I love it!  Carole McNujlty</li>
            <li> Really upset John Frieda decided to discontinue this!! It is a wonderful product for those of us with fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Really like this dry shampoo. Found out it was discontinued and found it on amazon. May have have been discontinued because of ingredients, I think contains butane?  So maybe not the safest to use but light enough for limp fine hair.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and works like a charm! Keeps hair fresh and full between shampoos..highly recommend this product for all hair types.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry hair shampoo which I can use without taking time to get white powder out,  I try and keep it in stock.  There are other with good review&#x27;s that I have tried ,but don&#x27;t do it for me.  MY only complain is that it comes in a small size, I would like a large size of something this good.  On the other hand, nice for a bag, for travel.</li>
            <li> Having fine, long hair, I have tried many, many products to give me the body and fullness I&#x27;m looking for.  Most products just don&#x27;t deliver the results I&#x27;m looking for.  My daughter shared a bottle of this product with me, and I was looking for a bottle of my own ever since.  Glad I found it on Amazon at a good price.  This is my new remedy, and I continue to keep plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> I think this is a really decent dry shampoo and I liked the results on my thick, straight hair. I really can&#x27;t stand the smell though! I don&#x27;t think any fragrance is added to it, it just smells so gross. I often worried if people could smell it in my hair, and if they could, what was the point in having my hair look fresh if it didn&#x27;t smell fresh? I finished the can and haven&#x27;t purchased again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different dry shampoos of differing price points and this is by far the best. I actually found it at Big Lots and for $2.00, I figured I would try it out. I absolutely love it. I would pay the $10+ dollars it costs on here for it (but will probably just go back to Big Lots and stock up!). Other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have contained clay and caused a gunky buildup on my scalp but this one is such a fine powder that after you brush it out, it simply feels like you just washed and dried your hair. I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, I think it just smells like a scented hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions I believe say to just spray and work it into your roots a bit and you&#x27;re ready to go. I would not recommend that. You have to make sure that you shake it well before spraying, and push down the nozzle far enough, otherwise you won&#x27;t get any powder out. It should be white when it comes out. Then you just let it sit for a minute or two to absorb the oil and brush it out. If you don&#x27;t brush it, it will stay white on your hair. I spray it at my hairline, down my part, and then lift the crown of my hair and spray underneath. Perfect for the day after shampooing and blow drying to refresh it and let you wear your hair down again rather than having to throw it into a bun or ponytail. It also is great if you are styling your hair after washing and want tons of volume. I highly recommend it to add to your collection of products.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair like it has some dust on it, but it does what it says</li>
            <li> I first read about this product in the Oprah magazine a couple of years ago.  Bought it at Ulta (very inexpensive) and found it to be very effective in fluffy my thinning hair and &amp;#34;buying&amp;#34; me an extra day before needing to wash it.  They no longer sell it but, no problem, I just order 3-4 at a time from Amazon.  Spray at the hair roots, gently rub into the scalp with your finger tips.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for well over a year and bring it with me whenever I can. My hair isn&#x27;t overly oily, so I occasionally get away with using this as a dry shampoo for the second day after shampooing. However, you should know that there are probably more powerful dry shampoos out there. This is perfect as a refresher. I&#x27;ll use it after work before I am going out to dinner or drinks, or if I&#x27;m out and about for an extended period and need a pick me up! I get compliments all the time on how nice my hair smells.</li>
            <li> I have been using this and it makes my thin brittle hair look way better.  Thought it has been discontinued</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dry shampoo, bought it used it and using it since it came out.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for those days when you don&#x27;t feel like shampooing and adds tons of volume.</li>
            <li> This product is great in a pinch to make your hair look great when you don&#x27;t have time for washing and setting it. It really does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of dry shampoos, and they all seem to be pretty much the same product, with the exception of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda&#x27;s smells a lot like paint. It&#x27;s very chemical smelling. Also, I feel like this one deposits a much thicker layer of powder into my hair, making it hard to blend into my brunette hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the size of this canister, but you can get a better smelling product for a lot less from Suave. They even make one that has keratin, so it&#x27;s good for your hair while it helps de-grease it.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair and it was very forceful.</li>
            <li> more like hairspray than dry shampoo</li>
            <li> The product does what it said. Its  make your hair less greasy and fresh your hair. But you can only use this product on the second day, If your hair is too greasy it wont do much, but better than nothing. People w/ really greasy hair should be cautious.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin hair.  I have never found a product that actually increases the thickness and body for my hair.  It has been effective beyond my greatest expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have very long, thin hair and it seems that as soon as I wash it, the next day it needs washing again.  I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair or use any chemical processing.  My hair seems to be naturally oily and I am way past my teens!  This is great to use in between washings.  I can now go 2 days between washings &amp; still feel &amp; look like I have clean hair.  It also thickens my hair nicely.  I recommend this to everyone to try.  It&#x27;s a bargain &amp; is kind to your hair.</li>
            <li> No volume increase here. I&#x27;m a little over beauty product adds, they promise much, but deliver little.</li>
            <li> I work out every morning and this is great when you are in a hurry and do not have time to watch your hair.  Spray and style your hair.  It works great for me!</li>
            <li> This dry volume spray really works for my mixed grey hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried many dry shampoos.  I have thin-ish hair that can look greasy after a day without washing.  A dry shampoo is perfect if I didn&#x27;t get a chance to wash my hair before work or after a lunch time workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this dry shampoo because it leaves my hair looking \\&quot;matte,\\&quot; the smell is not too offensive, and it is not too expensive.  One \\&quot;con\\&quot; is that it can leave whiteish powder residue that needs to be shaken out.  This is not too much of a problem for me since I have blondish-brown hair, but if you have dark hair, it could be a big problem.  For dark hair, I would recommend Bumble and Bumble Hair Powder, which comes in a variety of colors[[ASIN:B0012X3W9K Bumble and Bumble Brown Hair Powder Spray 1 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another product that I think may be better than the John Frieda is the Ojon Dry Cleanser [[ASIN:B000XXX24A Ojon Rub-Out Dry Cleanser 4.5 oz]].  I find this leaves less visible residue and has a better smell.  However, this is more expensive.</li>
