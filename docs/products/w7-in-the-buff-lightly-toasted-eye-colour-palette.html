            <li>so I thought this wasn&#x27;t going to be great quality</li>
            <li>and I really love these eyeshadow palettes!!</li>
            <li>I have brown skin and the colors set very nicely.</li>
            <li>The pigments are amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Good seller.</li>
            <li>The matte are just as good too.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t quite as pigmented,  but that was solved with some good primer.</li>
            <li>: really good</li>
            <li>I loved the colors</li>
            <li>so that was a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>cheap and goes on perfectly.</li>
            <li>, I thought how could it be any good.</li>
            <li>Probably wont be using the brush that came with, but its good to have.</li>
            <li>These shadows go on nicely with great coverage.</li>
            <li>I loved the eyeshadows inside.</li>
            <li>so glad I bought them, and they came sooner than they say which I was even more happy about!</li>
            <li>Super pigmented, the colors are beautiful, and oh I just loveee it!!</li>
            <li>These are very nice with cute packaging and good color payoff.  </li>
            <li>Pretty colors, came in good condition, the cheapest and best palette out of all the w7&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>lol :-)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure its great.</li>
            <li>With 12 beautiful eye shadows , some mat shades, some are shimmery and the metallic colors are easy to apply too.</li>
            <li>But on their own they are pigmented, easy to blend, beautiful eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this palette!</li>
            <li>If you apply with a brush, make sure to tap off the excess!</li>
            <li>Love the W7 brand!</li>
            <li>and they love it!</li>
            <li>I love this palatte!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love this palette!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>SO wort the $9.00 :) MUST BUY!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>Love it. !</li>
            <li>Love the colors!</li>
            <li>I love this palette!</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and are nice and smooth going on.</li>
            <li>is amazing as well</li>
            <li>Amazing dupe</li>
            <li>This product is economic and best quality.</li>
            <li>The case is tin, as pictured, kind of flexible, can&#x27;t imagine it would be too durable.</li>
            <li>I now own 2 W7 palettes.</li>
            <li>This knockoff is just like the real thing, (my best friend has it, and this is a fraction of the price)</li>
            <li>If I spend money that much on something it needs to be PERFECT!</li>
            <li>However for traveling purposes I would have liked a darker brown shade.</li>
            <li>Even the brush is nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t happen to own that one</li>
            <li>but these are a good value for the money :)</li>
            <li>The shadows are appropriately pigmented and some of them are GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>There is a really nice selection.</li>
            <li>Love love love this palette!!</li>
            <li>Received my item quickly and it&#x27;s beautiful, haven&#x27;t had a test to try it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not professional or anything, so they work great for me :D</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, looks nice and came very fast.</li>
            <li>I love love these colors!</li>
            <li>I love the colors , it came nicely packaged</li>
            <li>Cheap and good quality eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Just as beautiful as the first one.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>Apply very evenly, very easy to blend and fade, and have a beautiful shimmer to them.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation isn&#x27;t as good as UD&#x27;s but for the price, this palette is worth the buy!</li>
            <li>, i got this pallete because they said its a good naked dupe, which its okay, but i wouldnt compare the two, the shadows are of good pigment, i just wish the inside had a good mirror, also packaging is amazing, and the brush is okay</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and blend beautifully.</li>
            <li>Other wise I couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
            <li>Otherwise quick shipping and good product.</li>
            <li>The dark colors have a good pigment, and do a great smokey eye!</li>
            <li>Most of the colours have nice pigmentation and blend easily.  </li>
            <li>Safely packaged and undamaged.</li>
            <li>These colors are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments since wearing them.</li>
            <li>I also like that I&#x27;m able to wear it with any outfit.</li>
            <li>All in all, I love this, and would buy 10 more.</li>
            <li>Love these palettes I wear them all the time</li>
            <li>Love the colors and ease of application.  </li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>Buzzfeed did an article on best dupes for the Naked palettes</li>
            <li>I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>I would rather have more matte shades and most of them are shimmery.</li>
            <li>But because I already have so many palettes, I never ordered this, or the in the buff palette.</li>
            <li>If you do, I would advise paying more for better quality.</li>
            <li>The lighter shadows and matte shadows aren&#x27;t pigmented - at all, but the darker ones seem quite lovely pigmented, like most palettes.</li>
            <li>not terrible shadows.</li>
            <li>hope maybe you have a better experience with them.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>The color is great and they are very blendable.</li>
            <li>This is the best Naked Dupe out there!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, the colors are so creamy and pigmented for the price.</li>
            <li>Great colors, I&#x27;ve only tried four of them, but loved the ones I tried.</li>
            <li>Its more powdery then buttery, like drug store eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The light colors have glitter, and give a nice shimmery eye for night time..</li>
            <li>: I love the colors, the price, and the application.</li>
            <li>and I will by more for my clients.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Stunning shadows.</li>
            <li>Save your money for something better.</li>
            <li>Perfect substitute for the Naked Palette!!</li>
            <li>shimmery most of the time.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, but most of the shadows are shimmery.</li>
            <li>The colors are richer and more pigmented.</li>
            <li>Most of the shades have some sparkle, so it is not something that I would personally wear to work, but it&#x27;s great for going me out!</li>
            <li>Love this pallet gas shipment</li>
            <li>The seller needs to package the items better to avoid this.</li>
            <li>This naked palette has very beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>Love the brush and color selection.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Very nice product thanks</li>
            <li>I own this as well as the original</li>
            <li>pretty good shadows</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as pigmented, but it&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good dupe for UD.</li>
            <li>It has good pigmentation, not as good as my Naked 3 palette but still good, but I will always make sure to use a primer first.</li>
            <li>Cheap, no pigments, comes off easily!</li>
            <li>Love the colors, easily blendable.</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice, low-cost palette that I was happy to add to my collection</li>
            <li>Still good colors, and if you like shimmer, then you&#x27;ll probably really like, or even love this palette.</li>
            <li>i love the quality of this make up, and enjoy that it stays on longer than most eye shadows.</li>
            <li>This product is great and a nice alternative to Urban Decay!</li>
            <li>The w7 palette has all the same colors and look very good.</li>
            <li>Very nice, and extreme pigmentation, They are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Fantastic item for sure.</li>
            <li>The other side, however is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This one is better than the original</li>
            <li>It compares nicely to the Naked palette, color wise.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sized palette with accurate colors pictured and a good overall value.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine since I place it in a drawer.</li>
            <li>so I was super stoked to be able to test it.</li>
            <li>The pigment is great and some colors only have a little shimmer for a great matte look!</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice bit it doesnt pigment very well.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great dupe of the naked palettes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that the colors are so close to the Naked 1 palette.</li>
            <li>No shedding, and is an overall great brush.</li>
            <li>The price is so cheap</li>
            <li>Being of light drown skin</li>
            <li>but this is honestly worth it :)</li>
            <li>I have this one as well as the Naked 3 dupe (In the Nudes) and they are both great.</li>
            <li>Great dupe for the Naked palette!!!</li>
            <li>Great dupe for Urban Decay Nude Pallette.</li>
            <li>They did a great job honestly, the Naked pallete is waaaaaaay to much</li>
            <li>The dark shades are brilliantly pigmented and easy to layer and blend.</li>
            <li>Great dupe of the Naked original palette.</li>
            <li>It is as good as my stila palette, sephora collection palette, and any other shadows that I own.</li>
            <li>brush wasn&#x27;t very useful, but I have my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came super early and in perfect condition love it, price makes it such a deal too .</li>
            <li>I must have received a special palette or the makeup snobs don&#x27;t want you to know how great this product actually is.</li>
            <li>The colors have incredible pigment and are an incredible bargain, compared to the Naked Palette, and there&#x27;s hardly any fallout.</li>
            <li>Luckily mine was perfectly fine, but I think that was just luck.</li>
            <li>and at first I wasn&#x27;t too sure.</li>
            <li>i grab for this pallete, but its not my favorite but gets job done, and ships fast!</li>
            <li>The color stays pretty true most of the day, even better if I use a primer first.</li>
            <li>Was very excited to find that the colors are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is quite a good dupe of the naked 1!!</li>
            <li>One thing that kind of sucked though is the cover for mine came off after a couple uses and couldn&#x27;t be fixed so it just kinda sits on there now.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s virtually no fallout (even in the glitter shades with a full day of wear.)</li>
            <li>I had heard only good things about this palette and they were all true.</li>
            <li>great product, came earlier than the expected delivery, perfect packaging-- overall</li>
            <li>This is a perfect dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked palettes!</li>
            <li>recommend it to anyone who needs a nice cheap pallet such a deal!</li>
            <li>This palette arrived quickly &amp; undamaged.</li>
            <li>Super pigmented make up,</li>
            <li>I totally recommend it for people that do not want to spend a lot of money on a Naked palette, this is the best replica.</li>
            <li>Love the colors definitely will buy more</li>
            <li>This is the PERFECT dupe for the Naked palette by Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>so I was already super stoked.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful, and I definitely reccomend if you can&#x27;t afford or just don&#x27;t want to spend the money on naked.</li>
            <li>Love this came early and is so smooth on application</li>
            <li>Soooo happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very crucial to use a eye shadow primer on order to get as much pigmentation out as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with  the quality &amp; price of this palette.</li>
            <li>but I can say that the shadows are all very pretty.</li>
            <li>The shadows are very buttery, which makes them super easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Came in earlier than expected which was awesome because I originally ordered it for graduation.</li>
            <li>this is my new all-time favorite thing.</li>
            <li>In swatch comparisons, only one or two colors weren&#x27;t exact matches, but they&#x27;re all gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The pigment isn&#x27;t quite as strong, but it layers very well</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I wanted with this product!</li>
            <li>I am not mad that I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I love the case, it reminds me of and old dime store paint box!</li>
            <li>Second palate and I am&lt;br /&gt;Still in love!</li>
            <li>Excellent dupe for the Urban Decay Naked palette and shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>and they actually look better without the primer!</li>
            <li>This is a very good dupe for the Urban Decay Naked palette.</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow is very powdery and not at all smooth or buttery.  </li>
            <li>The colors go on smooth and they blend really well.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought it would be for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I prefer using my own personal brushes with this palette.</li>
            <li>but that is honestly the only con.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own the latter because of the cost, so I got this one (and two others).  </li>
            <li>I own all three of the naked palettes, and I still go for this one every time.</li>
            <li>Does not clump (leave lines on my eyelids) after a days&#x27; worth of wear.</li>
            <li>I am doing my own wedding day makeup and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>nice pallet but not enough color.</li>
            <li>I only liked three or four shades in here.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>All in all, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Good color payoff and endless look options.</li>
            <li>The colors are rich and are very blendable.</li>
            <li>But to be honest it has 2 amazing neutral matte brown shades that not all palettes have, which is MUCH more important for me, as I can mix it with a little bit of the black shade for a night time look!</li>
            <li>I needed to spend 35$ to get free shipping and only had 25$ worth of product in my basket, and it was either 8$ for shipping or buy something for 10$, the choice was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant but the formula is smooth and stays pretty well with eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>This is a great dupe for the Naked palette from Urban Decay for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth even the small price as there are drugstore palettes and sales on high-end palettes that will give you more shades and better quality.</li>
            <li>so it goes through the colors very fast.</li>
            <li>But I really loved it just as much as I loved the other brands such as smash box or naked or two faced.</li>
            <li>Eye shadows are pretty pigmented.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors as pictured.  </li>
            <li>I love the different shades - have a variety for each day of the week.</li>
            <li>looks exactly like pictured will be ordering from this company again</li>
            <li>The colors are shimmery and not so pigmented but are pretty</li>
            <li>My package arrived to me 12 days earlier then predicted. :)</li>
            <li>It looks exactly alike</li>
            <li>It is exactly what they say it is.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more w7 products.</li>
            <li>The colors are also resilient and last for more than 8 hours.</li>
            <li>There is some fallout, which is pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t my favorite, I ended up using my naked brush.</li>
            <li>I first discovered W7 cosmetic products while watching Lisa Eldridge, a prolific makeup artist based in the UK, on Youtube.</li>
            <li>I am not in love with the fact that there are only 2 matte shades, however that is a personal preference, and I own so many other palettes that have matte shades, that I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>Little bit light at application, but works much better with damp brush.</li>
            <li>I like natural colors , but I am excited to try out the smokey pallets as well.</li>
            <li>I ordered all the W7 eyeshadow palettes and altogether cost less than 1 UD Naked palette and the quality is just as good!</li>
            <li>I bought it &amp; it came a month earlier than the expected date which is great.</li>
            <li>Te palette came completely intact and looks so clean.</li>
            <li>It is by far my #1 go to palette right now!</li>
            <li>The black shade and the lightest shade take a few passes to build coverage but the others are excellent, especially if you scratch the top layer</li>
            <li>This palette came with a dual ended brush - one side a sponge tip and another brush that is almost an exact dupe of the Real Techniques Retailer Brush from the Core Collection Set.</li>
            <li>It offers vibrant colors, and a smooth application.</li>
            <li>This pallet comes in a metal tin case that is easy to open &amp; close.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I expected and more.</li>
            <li>This brand is my favorite eye shadow pallet they come quickly have cutesy names on the back and last for ever</li>
            <li>The only downfall is its huge.</li>
            <li>it gives off a jasmine like scent as well, which is a huge bonus over the Naked Basics palette, which has an ammonia like smell to it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and last all day.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette</li>
            <li>The consistency is also off, but not as much as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>But now hat I have lightly toasted I 100% plan on ordering in the buff next!</li>
            <li>I bought this eye shadow , but did not expect too much.</li>
            <li>Some colors are more pigmented than others, but that was expected.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Great palette, very comparable to the way more expensive naked palettes by urdan decay</li>
            <li>There are only two brown tones that are matte and a lighter peachy/taupe color that is lightly shimmered.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four star because they are really powdery and have some fallout also some of the lighter colors you have to pack on a lot to receive a shade color..  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>kind of like what you would get from a wet and wild shadow.</li>
            <li>The lighter colors need a little extra layers and more blending to show the actual color, but the dark colors are really good :).</li>
            <li>My sister has the Original Naked palette and side by side with the W7</li>
            <li>other than that, i love the colors but the way it came ruined it all</li>
            <li>For the price, it was actually better than I expected!  </li>
            <li>They are a cheaper alternative and dupe to the original Naked palette.</li>
            <li>They do seem to be highly pigmented and very blendable.</li>
            <li>The sponge in no other words sucked, it snapped right off, and I hadn&#x27;t even used it yet.</li>
            <li>I love the glittery black shade.</li>
            <li>In the photo they looked more matte, I was expecting less glitter on it.</li>
            <li>I understand that these are more affordable dupes for the Urban Decay Naked Palette.</li>
            <li>only thing is i wish it had more matte shade, there are only 2 matte shades the rest of shimmer/glitter.</li>
            <li>I use this palette everyday for a nice natural look</li>
            <li>This is an exact dupe for the Urban Decay original Naked palette.</li>
            <li>I just wish the pigmentation was a little more prevelant.</li>
            <li>and I honestly am going to have a hard time</li>
            <li>the texture is a bit different but it is toattaly worth it comparing the prices.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent UD Naked dupe..</li>
            <li>And the pigmentation is crazy good!</li>
            <li>Naked 1 is highly pigmented buttery eyeshadows that go on really well but for close to $60!</li>
            <li>Definitely a new staple for me, I wear it literally every day now.</li>
            <li>but they are all buttery soft and vibrant on my arm</li>
            <li>I am in love with W7, I have all of the palettes minus In the Buff, that is next on my list!</li>
            <li>The product is exactly like the Naked 1.</li>
            <li>That being said the shadows are not the exact same color, quality, and packaging.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>While searching for some new, affordable eye shadow pallet&#x27;s, I came across W7 and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is amazing, very minimal fall out and not chalky like other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li>what I expected and so far it seems to stay pretty well!</li>
            <li>If you do not have sensitive skin, I recommend this to save bucks.</li>
            <li>The shape, the softness, they&#x27;re nearly unidentical.</li>
            <li>I would not use them on my professional clients however.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the In The Buff: natural nudes pallet .</li>
            <li>Cheap price but not a cheap product.</li>
            <li>but it really surprised me.</li>
            <li>and I was in complete awe.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the pigmentation of all of the eye shadows.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft , its a little stiff but its still good</li>
            <li>However, unlike Urban Decay&#x27;s usual fine ingredients this particular product broke me up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy the w7&#x27;s dupe of the first naked palette.</li>
            <li>Colors are exactly like &#x27;Naked&#x27; Urban Decay Brand.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this palette because of the low price</li>
            <li>At first the texture is dry and a little chalky, but I found after scratching the surface of the pans a little the colors go on much smoother and more opaque (especially the &#x27;sin&#x27; like color).</li>
            <li>Loved the naked palette but its just too expensive for me.</li>
            <li>but I was completely wrong the quality is amazing</li>
            <li>Back into the box of play makeup I made for my 9 year old niece.....</li>
            <li>his this is just as good, if not better than the urban decay palettes (although I do not own any naked palettes, I have tried them on myself and others.)</li>
            <li>I am shocked at how amazing this product is!</li>
            <li>W7&#x27;s eyeshadows have a  similar colors with good pigment, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>I was a little spectacle at first because of the price and it being low</li>
            <li>It would have easily been broken.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this eye pallet, especially if you have purchased or want to purchase the nudes pallet from the other companies, and they cost 57.00$.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>However, it is really powdery and some colors have little pigmentation.</li>

            <li> so I haven&#x27;t asked lol</li>
            <li> so I thought this wasn&#x27;t going to be great quality</li>
            <li> and I really love these eyeshadow palettes!!</li>
            <li> I have brown skin and the colors set very nicely.</li>
            <li> The pigments are amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Good seller.</li>
            <li> The matte are just as good too.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t quite as pigmented,  but that was solved with some good primer.</li>
            <li> : really good</li>
            <li> I loved the colors</li>
            <li> so that was a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> cheap and goes on perfectly.</li>
            <li> , I thought how could it be any good.</li>
            <li> Probably wont be using the brush that came with, but its good to have.</li>
            <li> These shadows go on nicely with great coverage.</li>
            <li> I loved the eyeshadows inside.</li>
            <li> so glad I bought them, and they came sooner than they say which I was even more happy about!</li>
            <li> Super pigmented, the colors are beautiful, and oh I just loveee it!!</li>
            <li> These are very nice with cute packaging and good color payoff.  </li>
            <li> Pretty colors, came in good condition, the cheapest and best palette out of all the w7&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> lol :-)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure its great.</li>
            <li> With 12 beautiful eye shadows , some mat shades, some are shimmery and the metallic colors are easy to apply too.</li>
            <li> But on their own they are pigmented, easy to blend, beautiful eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette!</li>
            <li> If you apply with a brush, make sure to tap off the excess!</li>
            <li> Love the W7 brand!</li>
            <li> and they love it!</li>
            <li> I love this palatte!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love this palette!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> SO wort the $9.00 :) MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Love it. !</li>
            <li> Love the colors!</li>
            <li> I love this palette!</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and are nice and smooth going on.</li>
            <li> is amazing as well</li>
            <li> Amazing dupe</li>
            <li> This product is economic and best quality.</li>
            <li> The case is tin, as pictured, kind of flexible, can&#x27;t imagine it would be too durable.</li>
            <li> I now own 2 W7 palettes.</li>
            <li> This knockoff is just like the real thing, (my best friend has it, and this is a fraction of the price)</li>
            <li> If I spend money that much on something it needs to be PERFECT!</li>
            <li> However for traveling purposes I would have liked a darker brown shade.</li>
            <li> Even the brush is nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t happen to own that one</li>
            <li> but these are a good value for the money :)</li>
            <li> The shadows are appropriately pigmented and some of them are GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li> There is a really nice selection.</li>
            <li> Love love love this palette!!</li>
            <li> Received my item quickly and it&#x27;s beautiful, haven&#x27;t had a test to try it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not professional or anything, so they work great for me :D</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, looks nice and came very fast.</li>
            <li> I love love these colors!</li>
            <li> I love the colors , it came nicely packaged</li>
            <li> Cheap and good quality eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Just as beautiful as the first one.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Apply very evenly, very easy to blend and fade, and have a beautiful shimmer to them.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation isn&#x27;t as good as UD&#x27;s but for the price, this palette is worth the buy!</li>
            <li> , i got this pallete because they said its a good naked dupe, which its okay, but i wouldnt compare the two, the shadows are of good pigment, i just wish the inside had a good mirror, also packaging is amazing, and the brush is okay</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and blend beautifully.</li>
            <li> Other wise I couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
            <li> Otherwise quick shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> The dark colors have a good pigment, and do a great smokey eye!</li>
            <li> Most of the colours have nice pigmentation and blend easily.  </li>
            <li> Safely packaged and undamaged.</li>
            <li> These colors are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments since wearing them.</li>
            <li> I also like that I&#x27;m able to wear it with any outfit.</li>
            <li> All in all, I love this, and would buy 10 more.</li>
            <li> Love these palettes I wear them all the time</li>
            <li> Love the colors and ease of application.  </li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> Buzzfeed did an article on best dupes for the Naked palettes</li>
            <li> I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> I would rather have more matte shades and most of them are shimmery.</li>
            <li> But because I already have so many palettes, I never ordered this, or the in the buff palette.</li>
            <li> If you do, I would advise paying more for better quality.</li>
            <li> The lighter shadows and matte shadows aren&#x27;t pigmented - at all, but the darker ones seem quite lovely pigmented, like most palettes.</li>
            <li> not terrible shadows.</li>
            <li> hope maybe you have a better experience with them.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> The color is great and they are very blendable.</li>
            <li> This is the best Naked Dupe out there!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, the colors are so creamy and pigmented for the price.</li>
            <li> Great colors, I&#x27;ve only tried four of them, but loved the ones I tried.</li>
            <li> Its more powdery then buttery, like drug store eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The light colors have glitter, and give a nice shimmery eye for night time..</li>
            <li> : I love the colors, the price, and the application.</li>
            <li> and I will by more for my clients.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Stunning shadows.</li>
            <li> Save your money for something better.</li>
            <li> Perfect substitute for the Naked Palette!!</li>
            <li> shimmery most of the time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but most of the shadows are shimmery.</li>
            <li> The colors are richer and more pigmented.</li>
            <li> Most of the shades have some sparkle, so it is not something that I would personally wear to work, but it&#x27;s great for going me out!</li>
            <li> Love this pallet gas shipment</li>
            <li> The seller needs to package the items better to avoid this.</li>
            <li> This naked palette has very beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> Love the brush and color selection.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Very nice product thanks</li>
            <li> I own this as well as the original</li>
            <li> pretty good shadows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as pigmented, but it&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good dupe for UD.</li>
            <li> It has good pigmentation, not as good as my Naked 3 palette but still good, but I will always make sure to use a primer first.</li>
            <li> Cheap, no pigments, comes off easily!</li>
            <li> Love the colors, easily blendable.</li>
            <li> Overall, a nice, low-cost palette that I was happy to add to my collection</li>
            <li> Still good colors, and if you like shimmer, then you&#x27;ll probably really like, or even love this palette.</li>
            <li> i love the quality of this make up, and enjoy that it stays on longer than most eye shadows.</li>
            <li> This product is great and a nice alternative to Urban Decay!</li>
            <li> The w7 palette has all the same colors and look very good.</li>
            <li> Very nice, and extreme pigmentation, They are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item for sure.</li>
            <li> The other side, however is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This one is better than the original</li>
            <li> It compares nicely to the Naked palette, color wise.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sized palette with accurate colors pictured and a good overall value.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine since I place it in a drawer.</li>
            <li> so I was super stoked to be able to test it.</li>
            <li> The pigment is great and some colors only have a little shimmer for a great matte look!</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice bit it doesnt pigment very well.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great dupe of the naked palettes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that the colors are so close to the Naked 1 palette.</li>
            <li> No shedding, and is an overall great brush.</li>
            <li> The price is so cheap</li>
            <li> Being of light drown skin</li>
            <li> but this is honestly worth it :)</li>
            <li> I have this one as well as the Naked 3 dupe (In the Nudes) and they are both great.</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the Naked palette!!!</li>
            <li> Great dupe for Urban Decay Nude Pallette.</li>
            <li> They did a great job honestly, the Naked pallete is waaaaaaay to much</li>
            <li> The dark shades are brilliantly pigmented and easy to layer and blend.</li>
            <li> Great dupe of the Naked original palette.</li>
            <li> It is as good as my stila palette, sephora collection palette, and any other shadows that I own.</li>
            <li> brush wasn&#x27;t very useful, but I have my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came super early and in perfect condition love it, price makes it such a deal too .</li>
            <li> I must have received a special palette or the makeup snobs don&#x27;t want you to know how great this product actually is.</li>
            <li> The colors have incredible pigment and are an incredible bargain, compared to the Naked Palette, and there&#x27;s hardly any fallout.</li>
            <li> Luckily mine was perfectly fine, but I think that was just luck.</li>
            <li> and at first I wasn&#x27;t too sure.</li>
            <li> i grab for this pallete, but its not my favorite but gets job done, and ships fast!</li>
            <li> The color stays pretty true most of the day, even better if I use a primer first.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to find that the colors are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is quite a good dupe of the naked 1!!</li>
            <li> One thing that kind of sucked though is the cover for mine came off after a couple uses and couldn&#x27;t be fixed so it just kinda sits on there now.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s virtually no fallout (even in the glitter shades with a full day of wear.)</li>
            <li> I had heard only good things about this palette and they were all true.</li>
            <li> great product, came earlier than the expected delivery, perfect packaging-- overall</li>
            <li> This is a perfect dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked palettes!</li>
            <li> recommend it to anyone who needs a nice cheap pallet such a deal!</li>
            <li> This palette arrived quickly &amp; undamaged.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented make up,</li>
            <li> I totally recommend it for people that do not want to spend a lot of money on a Naked palette, this is the best replica.</li>
            <li> Love the colors definitely will buy more</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT dupe for the Naked palette by Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> so I was already super stoked.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, and I definitely reccomend if you can&#x27;t afford or just don&#x27;t want to spend the money on naked.</li>
            <li> Love this came early and is so smooth on application</li>
            <li> Soooo happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very crucial to use a eye shadow primer on order to get as much pigmentation out as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with  the quality &amp; price of this palette.</li>
            <li> but I can say that the shadows are all very pretty.</li>
            <li> The shadows are very buttery, which makes them super easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Came in earlier than expected which was awesome because I originally ordered it for graduation.</li>
            <li> this is my new all-time favorite thing.</li>
            <li> In swatch comparisons, only one or two colors weren&#x27;t exact matches, but they&#x27;re all gorgeous.</li>
            <li> The pigment isn&#x27;t quite as strong, but it layers very well</li>
            <li> and I got exactly what I wanted with this product!</li>
            <li> I am not mad that I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I love the case, it reminds me of and old dime store paint box!</li>
            <li> Second palate and I am&lt;br /&gt;Still in love!</li>
            <li> Excellent dupe for the Urban Decay Naked palette and shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li> and they actually look better without the primer!</li>
            <li> This is a very good dupe for the Urban Decay Naked palette.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is very powdery and not at all smooth or buttery.  </li>
            <li> The colors go on smooth and they blend really well.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would be for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I prefer using my own personal brushes with this palette.</li>
            <li> but that is honestly the only con.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own the latter because of the cost, so I got this one (and two others).  </li>
            <li> I own all three of the naked palettes, and I still go for this one every time.</li>
            <li> Does not clump (leave lines on my eyelids) after a days&#x27; worth of wear.</li>
            <li> I am doing my own wedding day makeup and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> nice pallet but not enough color.</li>
            <li> I only liked three or four shades in here.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> All in all, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good color payoff and endless look options.</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and are very blendable.</li>
            <li> But to be honest it has 2 amazing neutral matte brown shades that not all palettes have, which is MUCH more important for me, as I can mix it with a little bit of the black shade for a night time look!</li>
            <li> I needed to spend 35$ to get free shipping and only had 25$ worth of product in my basket, and it was either 8$ for shipping or buy something for 10$, the choice was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant but the formula is smooth and stays pretty well with eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> This is a great dupe for the Naked palette from Urban Decay for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was worth even the small price as there are drugstore palettes and sales on high-end palettes that will give you more shades and better quality.</li>
            <li> so it goes through the colors very fast.</li>
            <li> But I really loved it just as much as I loved the other brands such as smash box or naked or two faced.</li>
            <li> Eye shadows are pretty pigmented.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors as pictured.  </li>
            <li> I love the different shades - have a variety for each day of the week.</li>
            <li> looks exactly like pictured will be ordering from this company again</li>
            <li> The colors are shimmery and not so pigmented but are pretty</li>
            <li> My package arrived to me 12 days earlier then predicted. :)</li>
            <li> It looks exactly alike</li>
            <li> It is exactly what they say it is.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more w7 products.</li>
            <li> The colors are also resilient and last for more than 8 hours.</li>
            <li> There is some fallout, which is pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t my favorite, I ended up using my naked brush.</li>
            <li> I first discovered W7 cosmetic products while watching Lisa Eldridge, a prolific makeup artist based in the UK, on Youtube.</li>
            <li> I am not in love with the fact that there are only 2 matte shades, however that is a personal preference, and I own so many other palettes that have matte shades, that I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> Little bit light at application, but works much better with damp brush.</li>
            <li> I like natural colors , but I am excited to try out the smokey pallets as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered all the W7 eyeshadow palettes and altogether cost less than 1 UD Naked palette and the quality is just as good!</li>
            <li> I bought it &amp; it came a month earlier than the expected date which is great.</li>
            <li> Te palette came completely intact and looks so clean.</li>
            <li> It is by far my #1 go to palette right now!</li>
            <li> The black shade and the lightest shade take a few passes to build coverage but the others are excellent, especially if you scratch the top layer</li>
            <li> This palette came with a dual ended brush - one side a sponge tip and another brush that is almost an exact dupe of the Real Techniques Retailer Brush from the Core Collection Set.</li>
            <li> It offers vibrant colors, and a smooth application.</li>
            <li> This pallet comes in a metal tin case that is easy to open &amp; close.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected and more.</li>
            <li> This brand is my favorite eye shadow pallet they come quickly have cutesy names on the back and last for ever</li>
            <li> The only downfall is its huge.</li>
            <li> it gives off a jasmine like scent as well, which is a huge bonus over the Naked Basics palette, which has an ammonia like smell to it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly and last all day.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette</li>
            <li> The consistency is also off, but not as much as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> But now hat I have lightly toasted I 100% plan on ordering in the buff next!</li>
            <li> I bought this eye shadow , but did not expect too much.</li>
            <li> Some colors are more pigmented than others, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great palette, very comparable to the way more expensive naked palettes by urdan decay</li>
            <li> There are only two brown tones that are matte and a lighter peachy/taupe color that is lightly shimmered.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star because they are really powdery and have some fallout also some of the lighter colors you have to pack on a lot to receive a shade color..  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> kind of like what you would get from a wet and wild shadow.</li>
            <li> The lighter colors need a little extra layers and more blending to show the actual color, but the dark colors are really good :).</li>
            <li> My sister has the Original Naked palette and side by side with the W7</li>
            <li> other than that, i love the colors but the way it came ruined it all</li>
            <li> For the price, it was actually better than I expected!  </li>
            <li> They are a cheaper alternative and dupe to the original Naked palette.</li>
            <li> They do seem to be highly pigmented and very blendable.</li>
            <li> The sponge in no other words sucked, it snapped right off, and I hadn&#x27;t even used it yet.</li>
            <li> I love the glittery black shade.</li>
            <li> In the photo they looked more matte, I was expecting less glitter on it.</li>
            <li> I understand that these are more affordable dupes for the Urban Decay Naked Palette.</li>
            <li> only thing is i wish it had more matte shade, there are only 2 matte shades the rest of shimmer/glitter.</li>
            <li> I use this palette everyday for a nice natural look</li>
            <li> This is an exact dupe for the Urban Decay original Naked palette.</li>
            <li> I just wish the pigmentation was a little more prevelant.</li>
            <li> and I honestly am going to have a hard time</li>
            <li> the texture is a bit different but it is toattaly worth it comparing the prices.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent UD Naked dupe..</li>
            <li> And the pigmentation is crazy good!</li>
            <li> Naked 1 is highly pigmented buttery eyeshadows that go on really well but for close to $60!</li>
            <li> Definitely a new staple for me, I wear it literally every day now.</li>
            <li> but they are all buttery soft and vibrant on my arm</li>
            <li> I am in love with W7, I have all of the palettes minus In the Buff, that is next on my list!</li>
            <li> The product is exactly like the Naked 1.</li>
            <li> That being said the shadows are not the exact same color, quality, and packaging.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> While searching for some new, affordable eye shadow pallet&#x27;s, I came across W7 and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is amazing, very minimal fall out and not chalky like other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> what I expected and so far it seems to stay pretty well!</li>
            <li> If you do not have sensitive skin, I recommend this to save bucks.</li>
            <li> The shape, the softness, they&#x27;re nearly unidentical.</li>
            <li> I would not use them on my professional clients however.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the In The Buff: natural nudes pallet .</li>
            <li> Cheap price but not a cheap product.</li>
            <li> but it really surprised me.</li>
            <li> and I was in complete awe.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the pigmentation of all of the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft , its a little stiff but its still good</li>
            <li> However, unlike Urban Decay&#x27;s usual fine ingredients this particular product broke me up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy the w7&#x27;s dupe of the first naked palette.</li>
            <li> Colors are exactly like &#x27;Naked&#x27; Urban Decay Brand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this palette because of the low price</li>
            <li> At first the texture is dry and a little chalky, but I found after scratching the surface of the pans a little the colors go on much smoother and more opaque (especially the &#x27;sin&#x27; like color).</li>
            <li> Loved the naked palette but its just too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> but I was completely wrong the quality is amazing</li>
            <li> Back into the box of play makeup I made for my 9 year old niece.....</li>
            <li> his this is just as good, if not better than the urban decay palettes (although I do not own any naked palettes, I have tried them on myself and others.)</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how amazing this product is!</li>
            <li> W7&#x27;s eyeshadows have a  similar colors with good pigment, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I was a little spectacle at first because of the price and it being low</li>
            <li> It would have easily been broken.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this eye pallet, especially if you have purchased or want to purchase the nudes pallet from the other companies, and they cost 57.00$.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> However, it is really powdery and some colors have little pigmentation.</li>
            <li> They are not particularly pigmented and seem to fluff of the skin very easily even with all the preparations of eye shadow base, powder etc.......they just seem cheap.</li>
            <li> Not EXACTLY the naked 2 palette, but for a few bucks, it comes pretty close.</li>
            <li> One of the eyeshadows was damaged but very minor which is expected because of how far it has to travel.</li>
            <li> They dont last that long.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long on the eye either.</li>
            <li> not very pigmented without a base but very nice colors.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a palette of neutral/smokey colors which I could use for both everyday makeup and more dramatic looks</li>
            <li> I even had to wet some of the colors to get some on the brush because they were sooo powdery and didn&#x27;t have enough pigment.</li>
            <li> Came well before expected delivery date which was supposed to be mid</li>
            <li> This product came way earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I expected the palette to be smaller in size.</li>
            <li> It could take that long if your on the west coast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wayyyyy less than Urban Decay and for the same quality.</li>
            <li> The only other con was my cover broke after two weeks</li>
            <li> Very long wear.</li>
            <li> the colors create an amazing nude or dramatic look, but I do use other brushes than what this product came with because it is small and only has few bristles.</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is pretty poor.</li>
            <li> Pic 3 is when wet &amp; pic 4 is dry.</li>
            <li> but I had to stop wearing it due to minor breakouts.</li>
            <li> The last five colors of the palette look a little bit darker than expected although I did not try it yet.</li>
            <li> Palette is a little bigger than I expected as well</li>
            <li> Arrived well before expected.</li>
            <li> The packaging doesn&#x27;t snap closed</li>
            <li> Goes on your eyelid as expected from the color.</li>
            <li> Just received today Aug 13, expected Aug 31</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper Naked like pallette, and this is dead on.</li>
            <li> Delivered a month before the expected delivery date</li>
            <li> However, they are not very pigmented</li>
            <li> It comes with a brush, that has hairs on one end, and a sponge applicator on the other end.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ll start off by saying this is a solid dupe for the infamous Naked palettes by Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> , i just use my other brushes with it.</li>
            <li> Came faster than expected as well!</li>
            <li> Will be ordering other product from this company</li>
            <li> and it leaked into the other colors</li>
            <li> It arrived approximately in a week - I live in Canada, if that makes any difference.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars but the shipping took a little longer than expected.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it arrived in a mailing envelope with no sort of protection.</li>
            <li> the black was ALL over the others.</li>
            <li> It came in 11 days or less that.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t care any less about that.</li>
            <li> Considering the fact that this cost less than 10 bucks</li>
            <li> But the black was all cracked</li>
            <li> lasted all day without smudges which is what normally happens with less expensive makeup that I have purchased product</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s basically a mess.</li>
            <li> The shadows are a little powdery, not as silky as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I was a little scared to order this as it was not what I am used to purchasing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fallout is little to non existent depending on how you apply</li>
            <li> My order arrived earlier than I was expecting and none of my shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> came with two colors missing and</li>
            <li> I was not impressed and as I said, they are not for the professional.</li>
            <li> It also creases after wearing for a few hours, even when I use primer.</li>
            <li> Very little to no fall out.</li>
            <li> I can look past that</li>
            <li> Packaging is a bit bulky for a small purse but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with is useless, since it is too small and not dense enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen previous reviews about it arriving broken, so I was nervous about that.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be my go-to palette, but it&#x27;s hard to work with.</li>
            <li> The little brush it comes with is not great just fyi.</li>
            <li> IMO any sponge applicator sucks.</li>
            <li> know which one I mean.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, 2 broken eye shadows and broken tin lid.</li>
            <li> Nothing broken or damaged.</li>
            <li> but I want to keep it secret just for me</li>
            <li> And you cannot beat the price so seriously just buy it!</li>
            <li> + on the expensive name brands.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the colors would not be pigmented, but</li>
            <li> horrible!</li>

            <li> This brand is my favorite eye shadow pallet they come quickly have cutesy names on the back and last for ever I work 12 hour work days and my eyeshadow is always on point</li>
            <li> I like this makeup palette a lot..it arrived faster than I thought. Safely packaged and undamaged. Eye shadows are pretty pigmented. I did some swatches as you can see in one of the pictures. I will be ordering again. Thank you</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good seller. This product is economic and best quality.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked palettes! My sister has the Original Naked palette and side by side with the W7 In the Buff palette they have seemingly identical shades. I ordered this as a palette of neutral/smokey colors which I could use for both everyday makeup and more dramatic looks and I got exactly what I wanted with this product! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves the Naked palettes but doesn&#x27;t have the budget to spend loads of cash on an eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> These colors are fabulous! I have gotten so many compliments since wearing them. They go on smoothly and last all day. I also like that I&#x27;m able to wear it with any outfit. No matter what, it always looks great!</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would be for such a cheap price. The case is tin, as pictured, kind of flexible, can&#x27;t imagine it would be too durable. But....the quality of the eyeshadow is out of this world for the price. Very nice, and extreme pigmentation, They are gorgeous. Apply very evenly, very easy to blend and fade, and have a beautiful shimmer to them. The matte are just as good too. It comes with a brush, that has hairs on one end, and a sponge applicator on the other end. IMO any sponge applicator sucks. The brush isn&#x27;t that great either, but does what it needs to, I guess. I prefer using my own personal brushes with this palette. All in all, I love this, and would buy 10 more. I will be investing in all the palettes!</li>
            <li> Came super early and in perfect condition love it, price makes it such a deal too . recommend it to anyone who needs a nice cheap pallet such a deal!</li>
            <li> Lots of options in color. The only downfall is its huge. It&#x27;s the size of a wallet.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, came in good condition, the cheapest and best palette out of all the w7&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Not EXACTLY the naked 2 palette, but for a few bucks, it comes pretty close. I have olive skin, and I&#x27;m struggling to find a look that i like a lot with this palette for my tone. I think the naked 2 colors just aren&#x27;t my thing. I&#x27;ll definitely buy the w7&#x27;s dupe of the first naked palette.</li>
            <li> deffinitely a great pallete and the brush it comes with is amazing as well, theres not one shade in here that is the same and I honestly am going to have a hard time&lt;br /&gt;picking a color every time i use it!</li>
            <li> Love these palettes I wear them all the time</li>
            <li> This is an exact dupe for the Urban Decay original Naked palette. I absolutely love this palette! It is by far my #1 go to palette right now! The pigmentation isn&#x27;t as good as UD&#x27;s but for the price, this palette is worth the buy! W7 also makes dupes of the Naked 2 and Naked 3 but I have yet to try those. Those are my next buys. You honestly cannot beat the price for how great this palette is! The names of the shadows are on the back of the palette including the ingredients. My order arrived earlier than I was expecting and none of my shadows were broken. The only downside to this palette is that is does not come w/ a mirror. I can look past that but that is honestly the only con.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors as pictured.  The shadows are a little powdery, not as silky as I would like.  The color stays pretty true most of the day, even better if I use a primer first.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette it&#x27;s definitely a Urban Decay alternative for way cheaper. Good color payoff and endless look options. My only complaint is that it arrived in a mailing envelope with no sort of protection. No bubble wrap or anything. I&#x27;d seen previous reviews about it arriving broken, so I was nervous about that. Luckily mine was perfectly fine, but I think that was just luck. It would have easily been broken. Otherwise quick shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> Versatile compact for practical eyeshadow usage. Great packaging.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing a couple of YouTube videos comparing them to the Urban Decay Naked palettes.  I don&#x27;t own the latter because of the cost, so I got this one (and two others).  These are very nice with cute packaging and good color payoff.  Also, the shipping on these was super-fast (about 1 week) considering they were coming from overseas.  I am not mad that I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I now own 2 W7 palettes. This palette arrived quickly &amp; undamaged. This is a very good dupe for the Urban Decay Naked palette. It has good pigmentation, not as good as my Naked 3 palette but still good, but I will always make sure to use a primer first. Overall, I am very pleased with  the quality &amp; price of this palette.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. This knockoff is just like the real thing, (my best friend has it, and this is a fraction of the price)</li>
            <li> Bought this when my naked 1 palette ran out instead of spending another $50 on some eye shadow. Loved the naked palette but its just too expensive for me. The w7 palette has all the same colors and look very good. They aren&#x27;t quite as pigmented,  but that was solved with some good primer. The consistency is also off, but not as much as I was expecting. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Naked Palette 2 and suddenly everyone was telling me that this was the dupe for it ! I bought it &amp; it came a month earlier than the expected date which is great. I compared it to my Naked Palette 2 and they&#x27;re all the same ! Pigmentation is great, no creasing, and you save lots of money !</li>
            <li> I love the colors , it came nicely packaged</li>
            <li> The colors are nice bit it doesnt pigment very well.They dont last that long.</li>
            <li> horrible! came with two colors missing and the black was ALL over the others. other than that, i love the colors but the way it came ruined it all</li>
            <li> For the price, it was actually better than I expected!  I love the case, it reminds me of and old dime store paint box!</li>
            <li> Definitely a great dupe of the naked palettes. I own all three of the naked palettes, and I still go for this one every time. If I could change one thing, it would be the casing that the shadows are in, but for the price, I feel like I should not complain. Fantastic item for sure.</li>
            <li> Color selection just ok!&lt;br /&gt;Price was great.</li>
            <li> Cheap, no pigments, comes off easily!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and ease of application.  Does not clump (leave lines on my eyelids) after a days&#x27; worth of wear.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I am doing my own wedding day makeup and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on Urban Decay. Buzzfeed did an article on best dupes for the Naked palettes and I decided to give this one a try. I am in love with it. Plus with the colors being the same I just use Naked tutorials on different combos. Cheap and good quality eye shadow.</li>
            <li> great product, came earlier than the expected delivery, perfect packaging-- overall: really good</li>
            <li> not very pigmented without a base but very nice colors. I would rather have more matte shades and most of them are shimmery.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how amazing this product is! I needed to spend 35$ to get free shipping and only had 25$ worth of product in my basket, and it was either 8$ for shipping or buy something for 10$, the choice was pretty easy. I had been eying this palette for a while as I refuse to pay 55$ for the naked palettes, especially since I keep hearing such mixed reviews. If I spend money that much on something it needs to be PERFECT! But because I already have so many palettes, I never ordered this, or the in the buff palette. But now hat I have lightly toasted I 100% plan on ordering in the buff next! It is as good as my stila palette, sephora collection palette, and any other shadows that I own. I will say when tapping my brush in the shadow there is a bit of extra powder, however I brush off any excess powder off the brush and have no problem with fall out when applying on my eyes. So the shadow being powdery is not an issue at all. The shadows are very buttery, which makes them super easy to blend. I am not in love with the fact that there are only 2 matte shades, however that is a personal preference, and I own so many other palettes that have matte shades, that I don&#x27;t need it. However for traveling purposes I would have liked a darker brown shade. But to be honest it has 2 amazing neutral matte brown shades that not all palettes have, which is MUCH more important for me, as I can mix it with a little bit of the black shade for a night time look! I his this is just as good, if not better than the urban decay palettes (although I do not own any naked palettes, I have tried them on myself and others.)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, 2 broken eye shadows and broken tin lid.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Was very excited to find that the colors are exactly what I was looking for. Even the brush is nice. Packaging is a bit bulky for a small purse but not a deal breaker. Haven&#x27;t used it yet so I will update on staying power but they are all buttery soft and vibrant on my arm lol :-) I bought this pallette bc I am not one to spend  $50+ on the expensive name brands. Pic 3 is when wet &amp; pic 4 is dry.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ll start off by saying this is a solid dupe for the infamous Naked palettes by Urban Decay. However, unlike Urban Decay&#x27;s usual fine ingredients this particular product broke me up and at first I wasn&#x27;t too sure. I loved the colors but I had to stop wearing it due to minor breakouts. If you do not have sensitive skin, I recommend this to save bucks. If you do, I would advise paying more for better quality. The only other con was my cover broke after two weeks so it didn&#x27;t hold up. It did come in order though so that was a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good product. Colors are very similar to the UD Naked eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that the colors are so close to the Naked 1 palette. However, it is really powdery and some colors have little pigmentation. I even had to wet some of the colors to get some on the brush because they were sooo powdery and didn&#x27;t have enough pigment. The brush it comes with is useless, since it is too small and not dense enough. I was hoping this would be my go-to palette, but it&#x27;s hard to work with. They don&#x27;t last very long on the eye either.</li>
            <li> Totally met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Palette arrived in pristine condition. Not even a speck out of place. There are only two matte shades in the palette. The rest are either shimmer or glitter. I love the glittery black shade. I understand that these are more affordable dupes for the Urban Decay Naked Palette. I don&#x27;t happen to own that one so I can&#x27;t speak to that but I can say that the shadows are all very pretty. They do seem to be highly pigmented and very blendable. I&#x27;m looking forward to creating a lot of eye looks with this palette.</li>
            <li> This palette came with a dual ended brush - one side a sponge tip and another brush that is almost an exact dupe of the Real Techniques Retailer Brush from the Core Collection Set. The shape, the softness, they&#x27;re nearly unidentical. The sponge in no other words sucked, it snapped right off, and I hadn&#x27;t even used it yet. The other side, however is wonderful. No shedding, and is an overall great brush. Onto the eyeshadows, they were incredibly powdery. If you apply with a brush, make sure to tap off the excess! Because there will be a lot of excess shadow to be tapped off. The lighter shadows and matte shadows aren&#x27;t pigmented - at all, but the darker ones seem quite lovely pigmented, like most palettes. I don&#x27;t find they blend incredibly well together, but these are wonderful colours. They are a cheaper alternative and dupe to the original Naked palette. It arrived approximately in a week - I live in Canada, if that makes any difference. I ordered from Online Beauty. The palette arrived unscathed and unbroken. The beginning three pictures are without flash, and the last three are with.</li>
            <li> Great color palette. Lasts all day or longer.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Came in earlier than expected which was awesome because I originally ordered it for graduation. Anyways. It is beautiful. I just wish the pigmentation was a little more prevelant.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented make up,</li>
            <li> Little bit light at application, but works much better with damp brush.</li>
            <li> Love love love it! The colors are awesome! Very long wear. An the price only $7 well you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> not terrible shadows. I would not use them on my professional clients however. These work for a day to day look on myself. They are not particularly pigmented and seem to fluff of the skin very easily even with all the preparations of eye shadow base, powder etc.......they just seem cheap. kind of like what you would get from a wet and wild shadow. I was not impressed and as I said, they are not for the professional. Back into the box of play makeup I made for my 9 year old niece.....she gets all the rejects I try and test online but realize I can&#x27;t use them for work. well, the kid is happy! LOL.....hope maybe you have a better experience with them.</li>
            <li> Love the W7 brand! cheap and goes on perfectly. And the pigmentation is crazy good!</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I totally recommend it for people that do not want to spend a lot of money on a Naked palette, this is the best replica. The last five colors of the palette look a little bit darker than expected although I did not try it yet. In the photo they looked more matte, I was expecting less glitter on it. The pigments are amazing! Congrats!</li>
            <li> pretty good shadows, i got this pallete because they said its a good naked dupe, which its okay, but i wouldnt compare the two, the shadows are of good pigment, i just wish the inside had a good mirror, also packaging is amazing, and the brush is okay, i just use my other brushes with it. i grab for this pallete, but its not my favorite but gets job done, and ships fast!</li>
            <li> Arrived well before expected. Nothing broken or damaged. I haven&#x27;t used the urban decay pallette so I can&#x27;t compare them but these are a good value for the money :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had the UD Naked palette, but this palette makes me feel like 1,000,000 bucks! The color is great and they are very blendable. This is the best Naked Dupe out there!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, the colors are so creamy and pigmented for the price. Amazing dupe</li>
            <li> I love the different shades - have a variety for each day of the week.</li>
            <li> While searching for some new, affordable eye shadow pallet&#x27;s, I came across W7 and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product. It offers vibrant colors, and a smooth application. The shadow stayed in place for a good 12 hours, and living in south FL that&#x27;s saying ALOT! I would recommend this pallet to anyone who is looking for a nice palette for a great value!</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to order this as it was not what I am used to purchasing. But I really loved it just as much as I loved the other brands such as smash box or naked or two faced. I am so going to continue to order these products.</li>
            <li> Came well before expected delivery date which was supposed to be mid to end of September I got mine two days ago tested it out and very happy with the product lasted all day without smudges which is what normally happens with less expensive makeup that I have purchased product looks exactly like pictured will be ordering from this company again</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 -one for each of my sisters- and they love it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice sized palette with accurate colors pictured and a good overall value. I would recommend this product and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great colors, I&#x27;ve only tried four of them, but loved the ones I tried. I&#x27;m not professional or anything, so they work great for me :D</li>
            <li> Lasts well all day with a primer.  I have&#x27;t tried it without primer though.  Most of the colours have nice pigmentation and blend easily.  Overall, a nice, low-cost palette that I was happy to add to my collection</li>
            <li> This is totally a dupe for Naked. And you cannot beat the price so seriously just buy it!</li>
            <li> I bought this eye shadow , but did not expect too much. The price is so cheap, I thought how could it be any good.This pallet comes in a metal tin case that is easy to open &amp; close. With 12 beautiful eye shadows , some mat shades, some are shimmery and the metallic colors are easy to apply too. I want to order the rest of the collection. I have purchased the In The Buff: natural nudes pallet . I like natural colors , but I am excited to try out the smokey pallets as well. I would highly recommend this eye pallet, especially if you have purchased or want to purchase the nudes pallet from the other companies, and they cost 57.00$.&lt;br /&gt;You know which one I mean. Girls do yourself a favor ; purchase the Buff eye palett , it&#x27;s got some beautiful looks waiting to be created.</li>
            <li> The colors are shimmery and not so pigmented but are pretty I must say</li>
            <li> This is quite a good dupe of the naked 1!! Naked 1 is highly pigmented buttery eyeshadows that go on really well but for close to $60! W7&#x27;s eyeshadows have a  similar colors with good pigment, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong! The lighter colors need a little extra layers and more blending to show the actual color, but the dark colors are really good :). Its more powdery then buttery, like drug store eyeshadow. The dark colors have a good pigment, and do a great smokey eye! The light colors have glitter, and give a nice shimmery eye for night time.. OVERALL: I love the colors, the price, and the application. My package arrived to me 12 days earlier then predicted. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is i wish it had more matte shade, there are only 2 matte shades the rest of shimmer/glitter.</li>
            <li> Love love love this palette!! I use this palette everyday for a nice natural look and it&#x27;s perfect! Came faster than expected as well!</li>
            <li> I just got my product in the mail today and I have to say that I couldn&#x27;t be any happier! The pigment is great and some colors only have a little shimmer for a great matte look! Te palette came completely intact and looks so clean. Being of light drown skin the colors create an amazing nude or dramatic look, but I do use other brushes than what this product came with because it is small and only has few bristles. Other wise I couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
            <li> I love love these colors! so glad I bought them, and they came sooner than they say which I was even more happy about!</li>
            <li> Love the colors definitely will buy more</li>
            <li> I love this palatte! The colors are beautiful and are nice and smooth going on.</li>
            <li> This is an AWSOME. This product is exactly what I expected and more. Beautiful. Great pigment and I will by more for my clients.</li>
            <li> Came two weeks earlier than estimated arrival date! Everything was intact. Some colors are more pigmented than others, but that was expected. Great dupe of the Naked original palette. Probably wont be using the brush that came with, but its good to have. Just wish there was a mirror.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent UD Naked dupe.. but some of the colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as the appear. But, a primer definitely helped with color and longevity. For this price, it&#x27;s a great dupe and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition. Love it. Very little to no fall out.</li>
            <li> They did a great job honestly, the Naked pallete is waaaaaaay to much but this is honestly worth it :)</li>
            <li> It compares nicely to the Naked palette, color wise. It&#x27;s not nearly as pigmented, but it&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> This product came way earlier than I expected. It came in 11 days or less that. 11 days is just when I checked my mail. The product is exactly like the Naked 1. It looks exactly alike the texture is a bit different but it is toattaly worth it comparing the prices. Ordered it a second time for a friend. Just as beautiful as the first one.</li>
            <li> W 7 palettes are wonderful they come from the UK and are sold by a company name Bislinks. The palettes is great price this one came in where you can buy all three together. And what a great price.</li>
            <li> nice pallet but not enough color.</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT dupe for the Naked palette by Urban Decay. The colors are rich and are very blendable. It lasts for hours on my lids without creasing. I applied it on today around 5pm and it&#x27;s currently almost 1am and it looks like I just put it on still. Cheap price but not a cheap product. If you are considering buying this... DO IT! It&#x27;s wayyyyy less than Urban Decay and for the same quality.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what they say it is.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this palette because of the low price but it really surprised me. The colors are very pigmented and blend beautifully. The packaging doesn&#x27;t snap closed but it&#x27;s fine since I place it in a drawer. For the $10 price tag, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This is now my second w7 palette and I really love these eyeshadow palettes!! The colors are great, as is the pigment. Goes on your eyelid as expected from the color. These shades are great for smoky looks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Stunning shadows. I will definitely be ordering more w7 products.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, easily blendable. Good quality!!!</li>
            <li> Just received today Aug 13, expected Aug 31 so I was already super stoked. I opened it up and I was in complete awe. Oh my! I&#x27;d reccomend this to everyone but I want to keep it secret just for me lol. I was looking for a cheaper Naked like pallette, and this is dead on. Super pigmented, the colors are beautiful, and oh I just loveee it!! The brush is soft , its a little stiff but its still good and I couldn&#x27;t care any less about that. This is wonderful, and I definitely reccomend if you can&#x27;t afford or just don&#x27;t want to spend the money on naked. Basically the same!!</li>
            <li> Awesome pigmentation and great delivery time!</li>
            <li> Love this palette! The colors have incredible pigment and are an incredible bargain, compared to the Naked Palette, and there&#x27;s hardly any fallout. The colors are also resilient and last for more than 8 hours. Amazing price for an incredible product!</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good dupe for UD. The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant but the formula is smooth and stays pretty well with eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is very powdery and not at all smooth or buttery.  I did not like it and just threw it away.  Save your money for something better.</li>
            <li> This is just as I was hoping! The eyeshadows are great. This is a great dupe for the Naked palette from Urban Decay for a fraction of the price. That being said the shadows are not the exact same color, quality, and packaging. But on their own they are pigmented, easy to blend, beautiful eyeshadows. The little brush it comes with is not great just fyi. And the tin is a bit bulky so I just depotted the pans and threw them in a z palette.</li>
            <li> LOVE! The color is darker then what I expected and so far it seems to stay pretty well! It was to arrive in about a month from purchase date but it ended up showing up within 2 weeks! SO wort the $9.00 :) MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> Perfect substitute for the Naked Palette!!</li>
            <li> I only have the UD basics and smoked palette, so I can&#x27;t confirm personally that this is a Naked dupe. That being said, I bought this after through research into Naked &#x27;dupes&#x27; and this one seemed like the closet match as well as the cheapest. I have this one as well as the Naked 3 dupe (In the Nudes) and they are both great. At first the texture is dry and a little chalky, but I found after scratching the surface of the pans a little the colors go on much smoother and more opaque (especially the &#x27;sin&#x27; like color). The black shade and the lightest shade take a few passes to build coverage but the others are excellent, especially if you scratch the top layer a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it gives off a jasmine like scent as well, which is a huge bonus over the Naked Basics palette, which has an ammonia like smell to it.</li>
            <li> Great palette, very comparable to the way more expensive naked palettes by urdan decay</li>
            <li> Amazing! Second palate and I am&lt;br /&gt;Still in love! I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I only liked three or four shades in here. This palette doesn&#x27;t have great color payoff and the shades just look sheer and shimmery most of the time. I don&#x27;t think it was worth even the small price as there are drugstore palettes and sales on high-end palettes that will give you more shades and better quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect color palette</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this for the price. Colors are exactly like &#x27;Naked&#x27; Urban Decay Brand.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but most of the shadows are shimmery. Still good colors, and if you like shimmer, then you&#x27;ll probably really like, or even love this palette. There are only two brown tones that are matte and a lighter peachy/taupe color that is lightly shimmered.</li>
            <li> very beautiful colors !!! Great for blending</li>
            <li> Excellent dupe for the Urban Decay Naked palette and shipping was extremely fast! Delivered a month before the expected delivery date so it was a pleasant surprise! One thing that kind of sucked though is the cover for mine came off after a couple uses and couldn&#x27;t be fixed so it just kinda sits on there now. The pigmentation is amazing, very minimal fall out and not chalky like other reviewers have stated. I must have received a special palette or the makeup snobs don&#x27;t want you to know how great this product actually is. I ordered all the W7 eyeshadow palettes and altogether cost less than 1 UD Naked palette and the quality is just as good!</li>
            <li> I own this as well as the original In The Buff, the In The Nude palette, and the In The Night palette by W7. This one is better than the original In The Buff, in my opinion. The colors are richer and more pigmented. The biggest issue I&#x27;ve had with these W7 palettes is that the lighter colors tend to not be as pigmented and be a bit on the chalky side, especially when compared to the darker shades. The dark shades are brilliantly pigmented and easy to layer and blend. They last well throughout the day, too. They&#x27;re definitely worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> i love the quality of this make up, and enjoy that it stays on longer than most eye shadows. Most of the shades have some sparkle, so it is not something that I would personally wear to work, but it&#x27;s great for going me out!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. I expected the palette to be smaller in size. The selection is perfect. Its almost twice the size of my hand. Shipped fast. Not 5 stars cause I haven&#x27;t worn it but I&#x27;m sure its great.</li>
            <li> Love this came early and is so smooth on application</li>
            <li> Love this pallet gas shipment</li>
            <li> The shadows are appropriately pigmented and some of them are GORGEOUS. There is a really nice selection. There is some fallout, which is pretty noticeable. It also creases after wearing for a few hours, even when I use primer. All in all, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 w7 eyeshadows. One of the eyeshadows was damaged but very minor which is expected because of how far it has to travel.</li>
            <li> These shadows go on nicely with great coverage.</li>
            <li> Love it. ! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, looks nice and came very fast. The only issue is it uses a lot of shadow so it goes through the colors very fast. But for the price I will definitely keep buying</li>
            <li> I order this palette a week ago, and just got it today in the mail. Came 3 weeks earlier so I was super stoked to be able to test it. I loved the eyeshadows inside. Not as pigmented as I would like them too be, but layering, and added a bit of water helped alot. The brush that comes with it isn&#x27;t my favorite, I ended up using my naked brush. Considering the fact that this cost less than 10 bucks I&#x27;m extremely happy. Will be ordering other product from this company</li>
            <li> Love the colors! Applies beautifully! Could not be happier that I didn&#x27;t have to break the bank for the urban decay palettes.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! Very happy.</li>
            <li> Just got it today! I will be back to write a review!</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the Naked palette!!!</li>
            <li> I first discovered W7 cosmetic products while watching Lisa Eldridge, a prolific makeup artist based in the UK, on Youtube. She often uses W7 products  in her videos.  The product arrived within 7 days after I placed my order. I was pleasantly surprised by the pigmentation of all of the eye shadows. In addition, I got compliments on the various looks I created with these eye shadows. I will order again. Cheers!</li>
            <li> The colors in this pallet are beautiful. I gave it a four star because they are really powdery and have some fallout also some of the lighter colors you have to pack on a lot to receive a shade color..  Fast shipping.  This ships from the UK and I got it in a week and a day.  When my arrival time said 3-4 weeks. It could take that long if your on the west coast.  Anyways. Pick this up!!</li>
            <li> Received my item quickly and it&#x27;s beautiful, haven&#x27;t had a test to try it out. But the black was all cracked and it leaked into the other colors so it&#x27;s basically a mess. The seller needs to package the items better to avoid this. Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Very nice product thanks</li>
            <li> Great dupe for Urban Decay Nude Pallette.</li>
            <li> This naked palette has very beautiful colors. I have brown skin and the colors set very nicely. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I was afraid that the colors would not be pigmented, but wow! These colors are so pigmented! I tried them with and without primer and they actually look better without the primer! I am in love with W7, I have all of the palettes minus In the Buff, that is next on my list!</li>
            <li> I had heard only good things about this palette and they were all true. In swatch comparisons, only one or two colors weren&#x27;t exact matches, but they&#x27;re all gorgeous. The pigment isn&#x27;t quite as strong, but it layers very well and there&#x27;s virtually no fallout (even in the glitter shades with a full day of wear.) I&#x27;m literally recommending this palette to everyone I know. And you just can&#x27;t beat the price!! Definitely a new staple for me, I wear it literally every day now.</li>
            <li> Love the brush and color selection. Pigmentation is pretty poor. I would reccomend the coastal scents revealed palate and the l&#x27;oreal nudes palate over this one.</li>
            <li> Soooo happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very crucial to use a eye shadow primer on order to get as much pigmentation out as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Fallout is little to non existent depending on how you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;The brush wasn&#x27;t very useful, but I have my own.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Will order again when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in great shape for my fianc√©! I think she likes it, but I am a guy so I haven&#x27;t asked lol</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but complements on my makeup with this . So I give it 5 stars, and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> This product is great and a nice alternative to Urban Decay!</li>
            <li> This palette is awesome! The colors are practically identical to those in the naked palette by urban decay and for only a fraction of the price. The colors go on smooth and they blend really well. However, they are not very pigmented so I recommend using an eyelid primer with it.</li>
            <li> this is my new all-time favorite thing. I was a little spectacle at first because of the price and it being low so I thought this wasn&#x27;t going to be great quality but I was completely wrong the quality is amazing and I&#x27;m very happy I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars but the shipping took a little longer than expected. The product itself is wonderful. Palette is a little bigger than I expected as well but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
