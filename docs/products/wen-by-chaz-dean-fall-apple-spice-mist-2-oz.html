    <ol>
            <li>smells great.</li>
            <li>I like using it to freshen up my hair; works great when leaving a smoky establishment.</li>
            <li>It may be a great product...</li>
            <li>Great for the holidays.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve found this to be a great cover-up if you have smoke or food odors in your hair.</li>
            <li>Works great and smells good too.</li>
            <li>good offer</li>
            <li>This product is good to use after shower to help with frizzes.</li>
            <li>It smells like carmel apple, but NOT in a good way.</li>
            <li>I think this will make a good replacement for my curl enhancer that freshened up my hair between &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The Fall Apple Spice Mis smells so good.  </li>
            <li>It smells so  wonderfully good, and I get so many compliments when I wear it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love Wen products!</li>
            <li>I have used Wen shampoo (termed &amp;#34;conditioning cleanser&amp;#34;) for a couple of years and for me it&#x27;s the best though overpriced.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about how good my hair smells when I use it.  </li>
            <li>The smell can be a bit overwhelming, but over all a good product.</li>
            <li>My daughter has taken to using it also, to the point I had to order her a bottle of her own (and the cleanser too).</li>
            <li>This was a great addition to the apple spice cleansing conditioner, as it solidified that great harvest scent, and made my hair hair touchable soft.</li>
            <li>I have a large cabinet full of hair conditioning, protecting, and bodifying products, and the best of them are eh...</li>
            <li>Smells more like you&#x27;ve been baking pumpkin all day, doesn&#x27;t smell anything like apples.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite of all the Wen replenishing mists and also the conditioning cleansers.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell.</li>
            <li>, the scent was so overwhelming</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of the seasonals.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on my pillowcase at night too :)</li>
            <li>My favorite scent is the six thirteen</li>
            <li>This scent is ok.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t get as close to my hair as I do.  </li>
            <li>However, I do love WEN products.  </li>
            <li>I love the size of the product.  </li>
            <li>Great for ponytails and straight styles.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells more like maple syrup than it does apples.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just be looking for a scent that is more my taste.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and smell on my hair.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>smells good  and good value as it is overpriced on a regular purchase.</li>
            <li>It is very sweet with overtones of brown sugar and cinnamon - a hint of apple.  </li>
            <li>This replenishing mist leaves my hair soft, smooth, and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>Scent to strong and fakr smelling, does nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like overly sweet maple syrup w/o any apple at all.  </li>
            <li>Wen hair mists are an amazing product adding so much softness to my hair.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not one I would welcome a second time, but the price held my attention.</li>
            <li>The only reason I purchased it was because of the great price.  </li>
            <li>Unless you want to smell light a holiday candle.</li>
            <li>It smells great and gives my hair that extra lift when ever i use it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect light and breezy.</li>
            <li>only looks good if it appears shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>And if you are going natural it&#x27;s great for keeping your curls feeling soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the WEN products but not so much the scent of this one.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a spice scent, I don&#x27;t really smell any apple.</li>
            <li>This is NOT my favorite scent, can&#x27;t really put my finger on what bothers me about it, but the product itself performs well.  </li>
            <li>I love this new seasonal scent.</li>
            <li>Worth giving it a try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars because not only do I love the smell..</li>
            <li>Just got this and tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what good this product does.  </li>
            <li>Stunk to high heaven!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very apple-y, more of a spicy baked scent.</li>
            <li>Yeah, I wanted to really like this product</li>
            <li>very festive...</li>
            <li>The smell is actually reminiscent of a cheap scented candle.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it coats the hair a bit, but doesn&#x27;t really add needed moisture.  </li>
            <li>I agree with most of the other comments, this smells like a candle.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly,the shampoo in this scent gives me better results than any of the other Wen shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I thought I might be able to use it to keep my roots less greasy between washes, but it does not help.</li>
            <li>Will not purchase this particular item again.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, did not really like the smell, does work good, but would rather buy other fragrance</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like cinnamon french toast, and helps me keep my hair looking fresh between wash-days.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t know because the first and only time I tried it</li>
            <li>glad this was a small sample bottle</li>
            <li>My hair was getting kind of big and frizzy and a few sprays calmed it right down.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any use for it so far.  </li>
            <li>Also, the smell wasn&#x27;t very appley but smelled strange almost like rotten apple</li>
            <li>Was I ever surprised to see an actual difference.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this really works</li>
            <li> The scent truly smells like autumn and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t expect much in the way of results, I bought this mist because I use other Wen products and I needed a small 2 oz container for air travel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to Wen but have been a no poo girl for quite awhile and am slowly trying to eliminate the sulfates from all my hair care products.  </li>
            <li> This did not seem to be the same as one I had previously (thought it had a bit more oil content), so I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t like the performance of Fall Apple Spice as well as some of the other Wen Replenishing Mists.  </li>
            <li> I recommend trying some other other Wen mists before buying Fall Apple Spice.</li>
            <li> My hair is down</li>
            <li> Between haircuts, my ends get dry and split from heat styling and that problem seems to be a hard one to tackle.</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> The knock-off products however leave my hair a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> This dried out my hair</li>
            <li> Smelled like a candle that I have burned in the past.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the smell</li>
            <li> and he got annoyed with me because he didn&#x27;t like the smell -- ooops -- not a good way to start the day!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s weird, I know.  </li>
            <li> The smell is awful!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells more like you&#x27;ve been baking pumpkin all day, doesn&#x27;t smell anything like apples. My husband didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> arrived promptly. smells great. good offer</li>
            <li> I like the Wen Mists, but I definately do not like the scent of this one.  I gave it away.</li>
            <li> This replenishing mist leaves my hair soft, smooth, and smelling great.  It is my favorite of all the Wen replenishing mists and also the conditioning cleansers.</li>
            <li> I did not  care for the aroma of this product however the product does work well in hair but just dont like smell</li>
            <li> Stunk to high heaven!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites in the Wen line. Worth giving it a try</li>
            <li> Wen hair mists are an amazing product adding so much softness to my hair. I love this new seasonal scent. It&#x27;s not very apple-y, more of a spicy baked scent. If you don&#x27;t like spice this wont be for you but if you like spicy scents you should give this one a go!</li>
            <li> This was a great addition to the apple spice cleansing conditioner, as it solidified that great harvest scent, and made my hair hair touchable soft. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I wanted to really like this product but it turned out to be the product that made me want to try a different product line after being faithful to CD products for 6 years. Imagine that</li>
            <li> use in my yoga class.  smells good  and good value as it is overpriced on a regular purchase. will buy again for that price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this really works but I love the smell. I like using it to freshen up my hair; works great when leaving a smoky establishment.</li>
            <li> It may be a great product...I just don&#x27;t know because the first and only time I tried it, the scent was so overwhelming I couldn&#x27;t stand it..will probably just throw it out.</li>
            <li> This did not seem to be the same as one I had previously (thought it had a bit more oil content), so I was a bit disappointed. The fragrance is not one I would welcome a second time, but the price held my attention.</li>
            <li> I love the WEN products but not so much the scent of this one.  Smelled like a candle that I have burned in the past.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the seasonals.  I get so many compliments about how good my hair smells when I use it.  I spray it on my pillowcase at night too :)</li>
            <li> I love Wen products! My favorite scent is the six thirteen but it is not an every day cleanser. This scent is ok. It is more of a spice scent, I don&#x27;t really smell any apple. I will probably go back to the Ginger Pumpkin fall scent or the Fig.</li>
            <li> This product is good to use after shower to help with frizzes. The smell can be a bit overwhelming, but over all a good product.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.  Most people don&#x27;t get as close to my hair as I do.  My hair is down and I can smell it.  Was expecting either spice smelling or fruity.  Got neither</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the other comments, this smells like a candle.  It is not offensive - just smells like a candle.  The only reason I purchased it was because of the great price.  Will not purchase this particular item again.  However, I do love WEN products.  have tons of others that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like cinnamon french toast, and helps me keep my hair looking fresh between wash-days. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I didn&#x27;t like this smell.  I didn&#x27;t like it so I tried it on him and he got annoyed with me because he didn&#x27;t like the smell -- ooops -- not a good way to start the day!!</li>
            <li> I love the size of the product.  Too much of it isn&#x27;t necessary.  The smell is amazing.  Great for the holidays.  I use this mist to keep my hair in place.  Great for ponytails and straight styles.  And if you are going natural it&#x27;s great for keeping your curls feeling soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> It smells like carmel apple, but NOT in a good way. Almost embarrassed to give it away - she may just throw it out,</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey for what you get. Also, the smell wasn&#x27;t very appley but smelled strange almost like rotten apple</li>
            <li> The smell is awful!! Unless you want to smell light a holiday candle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars because not only do I love the smell..very festive...but also because softens my hair and moisturizes it .</li>
            <li> this is one of the yummiest scents from WEN yet. even the shampoo&#x27;s scent lasts longer than the others. i&#x27;ve found this to be a great cover-up if you have smoke or food odors in your hair.</li>
            <li> The scent smells more like maple syrup than it does apples.  The smell is actually reminiscent of a cheap scented candle.  Also, I don&#x27;t like the performance of Fall Apple Spice as well as some of the other Wen Replenishing Mists.  It feels like it coats the hair a bit, but doesn&#x27;t really add needed moisture.  I recommend trying some other other Wen mists before buying Fall Apple Spice.</li>
            <li> I do not like the apple spice scent.  So I haven&#x27;t used this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what good this product does.  I haven&#x27;t seen any use for it so far.  I thought I might be able to use it to keep my roots less greasy between washes, but it does not help.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s name.  Wen has totally changed my hair and this fall scent is no exception.  It smells great and gives my hair that extra lift when ever i use it.</li>
            <li> This dried out my hair</li>
            <li> Just got this and tried it for the first time.  I&#x27;m fairly new to Wen but have been a no poo girl for quite awhile and am slowly trying to eliminate the sulfates from all my hair care products.  My hair was getting kind of big and frizzy and a few sprays calmed it right down.  I think this will make a good replacement for my curl enhancer that freshened up my hair between &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34;.  This is NOT my favorite scent, can&#x27;t really put my finger on what bothers me about it, but the product itself performs well.  I&#x27;ll just be looking for a scent that is more my taste.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a large cabinet full of hair conditioning, protecting, and bodifying products, and the best of them are eh... ok.  My hair is processed and to me processed hair only looks good if it appears shiny and healthy.  Between haircuts, my ends get dry and split from heat styling and that problem seems to be a hard one to tackle. Although I didn&#x27;t expect much in the way of results, I bought this mist because I use other Wen products and I needed a small 2 oz container for air travel.  Was I ever surprised to see an actual difference.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  I happen to like the scent, but it is not for everyone. It is very sweet with overtones of brown sugar and cinnamon - a hint of apple.  Don&#x27;t expect light and breezy. I have used Wen shampoo (termed &amp;#34;conditioning cleanser&amp;#34;) for a couple of years and for me it&#x27;s the best though overpriced.  The knock-off products however leave my hair a little heavy.  Interestingly,the shampoo in this scent gives me better results than any of the other Wen shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  That&#x27;s weird, I know.  So I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m not going to look for this mist in a different scent for now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It smells so  wonderfully good, and I get so many compliments when I wear it!  My daughter has taken to using it also, to the point I had to order her a bottle of her own (and the cleanser too).</li>
            <li> The Fall Apple Spice Mis smells so good.  The scent truly smells like autumn and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> glad this was a small sample bottle, did not really like the smell, does work good, but would rather buy other fragrance</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the smell</li>
            <li> Scent to strong and fakr smelling, does nothing for my hair. Returned it.</li>
            <li> this makes my hair sticky and smelly.  It&#x27;s more like overly sweet maple syrup w/o any apple at all.  I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
