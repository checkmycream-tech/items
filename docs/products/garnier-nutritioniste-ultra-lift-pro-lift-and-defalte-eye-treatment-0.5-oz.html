            <li>As for my under-eyes, the suffered greatly as the cream stung as soon as I would layer it on, and after a few days my skin just started peeling off.  </li>

            <li>Very gentle and no fragrance which is another plus...</li>
            <li>and I can see positive changes around my eyes.</li>

            <li>The results, however, were less than satisfying and downright</li>

            <li>I have had no trouble with the cream or the gel.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it a 5 is the gel section was only half full</li>
            <li>Apparently, the cream and the gel formulas also somehow mixed together either during transit or before being shipped.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Delivery was quick.  However, this product appeared to have been used.  3/4 of the cream was missing, which upset me quite a bit.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> As I get into my forties, my eye area is one that has started showing the proverbial signs of the \\&quot;passing of time\\&quot;.  Although I have paid meticulous attention to my eyes ever since I was a teenager, small crow&#x27;s feet just underneath my lachrymals and the prosaic under-eye circles I have sported even as a child are becoming more obvious.  I have also noticed that I am losing some elasticity on my eyelids, so when I saw an eye cream to treat the whole eye area with two different products in one same container, I jumped at the idea and wanted to try it right away - plus, if it worked, the price could not be beaten.  The results, however, were less than satisfying and downright dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier Nutritioniste Ultra-Lift Pro Dual Eye Cream consists of a white cream for the under-eye area and a salmon-coloured gel for the lids.  For me, it worked a lot better on the lids area, although results were not particularly significant.  As for my under-eyes, the suffered greatly as the cream stung as soon as I would layer it on, and after a few days my skin just started peeling off.  I have never had results like these from a cosmetic product and I do not have sensitive skin.  So I would suggest trying it via a sample or on a counter at the pharmacy (is sold at drugstores) before subjecting such a delicate area of your face to such battering.</li>
            <li> This product was hard to find in the stores and much more expensive.  Very happy with this find and will be doing business with them again.</li>
            <li> works well if you follow the directions for a couple of months you&#x27;ll see a lift on your upper eye lid and toned less puffy  under eye.</li>
            <li> After 1 month of use I haven&#x60;t note any change, my dark circles remain the same I even increase the quantity of water I consume and dark circles and wrinkles...still there.</li>
            <li> It works ok. The gel side was not as full as the other side.Dont know why. Will not order this again.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve never used this product before and it takes awhile to have any effect, I do not know yet whether it&#x27;s something I would recommend or not.</li>
            <li> Will explain why? Mine is in a green jar with white cover... Cannot find it in stores I shop in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondering if they just changed container? Would appreciate knowing this.. So here goes with the one I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive eyes.. Find the Garnier ultra lift anti wrinkling does not irritate me.. Very gentle and no fragrance which is another plus...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am very anxious to know the question I addressed.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid forties and have sagging eyelids and crepe skin on my lids. I have been using this product for 2 days and can see results already. I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be very careful with products. I have had no trouble with the cream or the gel. Both absorb quickly into my skin. My eyes look bigger and brighter and the eyelids are visibly firmer. I can&#x27;t wait to see how good I look in a month for my high school reunion!</li>
            <li> This container arrived 1/2 empty on each side. Apparently, the cream and the gel formulas also somehow mixed together either during transit or before being shipped. The open container smells like rotten fish, the product is unbearable to put on because of the smell, and it was so disappointing. I had been looking forward to buying and using this cream for months.&lt;br /&gt;Now I feel sorry that I bought this and will not be buying another Garnier eye / gel product from Amazon (just to be on the safe side). This ended up being a waste of money!!  :(</li>
            <li> was so upset when I couldn&#x27;t find in store when I ran out.  Took a chance and looked to see if out on Amazon and was thrilled to find!  This is the only item I have found that reduces the puffiness on my upper lids!!.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after using Avon&#x27;s because it was cheaper....No difference at all even after using for 2 months.  I went back to using the Avon Pro Dual Eye System which I saw results the first week.</li>
            <li> The only product that I have found and I&#x27;ve tried plenty that reduces the wrinkles and puffiness under my eyes...love it...due to heredity I assume I&#x27;ll be using this product for as long as I care what they look like...lol</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly. I have been using for 4 days now and I can see positive changes around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this eye moisturizer.  It did seem to help lift and deflate. The cream for upper lid is separated from the undereye gel and it feels very good.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 is the gel section was only half full so I felt I did not get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Once you open the product there is no way to keep the gel separated from the cream. It must always sit in an upright position and be opened very carefully. Even then I don&#x27;t think that the product would stay separated. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and after trying many very expensive skin treatment products, I am finding Garnier products do as good a job as the really pricey ones.</li>
            <li> The cream side was about 1/3 full, the gel almost empty, enough for a few applications only, so I don&#x27;t know if the product is effective over time or not! Wrote the seller, they said all in stock were the same, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did an &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34; search and found &amp;#34;Amazing Stuff Here&amp;#34;(&amp;#34;Yalmeh&amp;#34;) and have had much success with them and their  products ever since!</li>
            <li> UNDER EYE TREATMENT COULDNT SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE RESONABLY PRICED.UNDER EYE CIRLCES DIDNT WORK FOR ME TRIED ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO NO AVAIL.THANKS</li>
            <li> How you are supposed to apply one type of cream above the eye and a different cream below the eye, is beyond me. Does not moisturize as well as other eye creams I have used.</li>
