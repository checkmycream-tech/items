            <li>Worked perfectly with my Clarisonic and the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and they fit perfectly on my Mia 2.</li>
            <li>These brushes fit perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia 2, and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these compatible ones from the $25 ones.</li>
            <li>and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a really good value.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfectly into my Clarisonic Mia 1</li>
            <li>Fit great on my Mia.</li>
            <li>They work wonderfully and are such a great value.  </li>
            <li>Purchased these and they seem every bit as good as originals at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>They arrived as promised and look and feel as good as the Clarisonic original brush heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moreover, I was pleased to find that the I have for my sensitive/acne prone skin with Roscea were unwarranted.  </li>
            <li>Love the price, would by again</li>
            <li>Thank you  : )</li>
            <li>Irritation and stinging greeted me when using with my Clarisonic (with the appropriate technique I will add).</li>
            <li>It fits on my mia2 just fine.</li>
            <li>Very cost effective when compared to brand brushes.  </li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price</li>
            <li>- Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>the brush that it came with originally.</li>
            <li>I will spend the money to get the original refills.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These leave my face feeling clean and refreshed without my face feeling like I just scraped sand paper over it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, they fit the brush handle and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>My face feels super clean.</li>
            <li>The sweet price is an added treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>Quick</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes are a wonderful alternative to the more expensive Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I received these brush heads last week and I am in love with them!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sit as nicely as the actual clarisonic brush does</li>
            <li>Only used it a few times, but compared to the original replacement heads at $25.00 each, I will SURE purchase again!!  : )  </li>
            <li>The brush heads fit my clarisonic mia 2 perfectly and works as stated, but the bristles are definitely not meant for a delicate skin.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t have them quite snapped in correctly and thought they were a bust.  </li>
            <li>First time needing to replace heads on my Mia2.</li>
            <li>When I first used motor would stop.</li>
            <li>but it fits and does the job just as well at a much cheaper price!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, I think it is as soft as the original brush, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Softer that original Clarisonic brushes, which my very sensitive skin really appreciated.</li>
            <li>Unlike the normal brush heads where I would just rinse them off and give them a good wash once a week, these get moldy and if you don&#x27;t wash them everyday.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them if you need replacements for your sonic device!</li>
            <li>Much softer then</li>
            <li>Otherwise,  I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase and was touched when I received the company&#x27;s informative humble email a few days ago.</li>
            <li>One side note is that I had been using a mild retinol twice a week, however, after noticing some inflammation pairing the two treatments, I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m going to avoid using my Mia on the same days.</li>
            <li>better than the regular brush heads and will definitely save me and my mom some money!</li>
            <li>Even though the OEM brusheads are considerably more expensive, I will be purchasing those as they work better for my skin.</li>
            <li>I guess the bristles are just too cheap to be soft enough.  </li>
            <li>If it works great if not it wasnt too expensive of a loss.</li>
            <li>When I first bought these, I bought them knowing I wasn&#x27;t buying actual clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>I had pretty middle of the road expectations for this to work.</li>
            <li>These work the exact same way as the ones that came with the product.</li>
            <li>and I got the sensitive ones.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your cash unless you are in the market for some light torture.</li>
            <li>Well I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>are my only issues:They are a bit more stiff than the actual brush heads</li>
            <li>I purchased the &amp;#34;Delicate&amp;#34; brush heads because I have sensitive cheeks that tend to get very red and</li>
            <li>These compatible replacement brush heads for delicate skin just do not measure up to the original Clairisonic brushes.</li>
            <li>When I first used it several of the black bristles came out.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Even the clarisonic normal brush heads are softer than these and the bristles feel harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered Procizion generic delicate brush head instead of the sensitive Clarisonic one and the generic</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> only other con to buying these that I have is you have to wash them after every use and let them air dry OUT of the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using  Procizon&#x27;s sensitive skin brush head for the past week and my skin is displaying the &amp;#34;typical signs&amp;#34; of appearing brighter and smoother after using the brush.</li>
            <li> The product came as expected and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that the delicate brush head is the one to use if you have sensitive skin and rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with it locking, spinning, or vibrating unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Well a few things...</li>
            <li> After 3 times I figured I just wasted money I could have put towards a new Clarisonic brush head :(</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get this out of the way: these are not appropriate for use on the delicate skin of your face.</li>
            <li> I got the delicate skin 2 pack</li>
            <li> Feel they work just as well as my Clarisonic delicate brush heads.</li>
            <li> Just like the clarisonic brush but less expensive.</li>
            <li> I mean those suckers are $25 a piece!</li>
            <li> I saw a little shower mildew once my brush head started to go bad and</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t feel too guilty about absent mindedly leaving it the shower one day.</li>
            <li> would I buy the expensive Clarisonic refills for $25+</li>

            <li> I got the delicate skin 2 pack and they fit perfectly on my Mia 2. My face feels super clean. I use the Mia with these replacement brushes and then I apply rosehip oil on my face. Don&#x27;t overpay for the clsrosonic brushes because these are perfect. And yes everything oscillates the same!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work on my Clarisonic Mia2. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Daughter Loves Brush Heads! - Very Smooth Transaction! - Excellent Seller! - Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t have them quite snapped in correctly and thought they were a bust.  User error.  Feel they work just as well as my Clarisonic delicate brush heads.</li>
            <li> These brushes are working like the brand, the only difference is the price. That&#x27;s what I like! Great Job.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly with my Clarisonic and the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> These brushes fit perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia 2, and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these compatible ones from the $25 ones. This brush leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh, I feel like I just came out of a spa! I&#x27;ve had no problems with it locking, spinning, or vibrating unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Quick</li>
            <li> Softer that original Clarisonic brushes, which my very sensitive skin really appreciated. Arrived a little earlier than expected, which is always really appreciated.  I will definitely order again.  Very cost effective when compared to brand brushes.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Yay! All the reviews are correct. These replacement brushes are a wonderful alternative to the more expensive Clarisonic brush heads. I&#x27;ve been using  Procizon&#x27;s sensitive skin brush head for the past week and my skin is displaying the &amp;#34;typical signs&amp;#34; of appearing brighter and smoother after using the brush. The sweet price is an added treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I was pleased to find that the I have for my sensitive/acne prone skin with Roscea were unwarranted.  The brush head&#x27;s bristles are softer than the Clarisonic brand and I found that it made my transition to using the product again easier. The bristles also appear to be made out of the same antimicrobial material so I didn&#x27;t feel too guilty about absent mindedly leaving it the shower one day. One side note is that I had been using a mild retinol twice a week, however, after noticing some inflammation pairing the two treatments, I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m going to avoid using my Mia on the same days. Otherwise,  I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase and was touched when I received the company&#x27;s informative humble email a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Fit great on my Mia. Much softer then the brush that it came with originally. Love the price, would by again</li>
            <li> These are great! I got the Delicate version, and it&#x27;s nice and soft and non irritating but still cleansing. I read some reviews about the inner circle brush not oscillating, but I did not experience this. It fits on my mia2 just fine. I&#x27;ll be buying these instead of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; ones from now one.</li>
            <li> First time needing to replace heads on my Mia2. Purchased these and they seem every bit as good as originals at a much better price.  Arrived quickly.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, I think it is as soft as the original brush, in my opinion. I have no problem to replace it to my Mia 2.</li>
            <li> better than the regular brush heads and will definitely save me and my mom some money!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Bristles are not so &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> They arrived as promised and look and feel as good as the Clarisonic original brush heads. I will be using them in the next month or so when my skin gets a bit drier with the onset of fall &amp; winter weather. Will up ate my review again then (which is why this is 4 stars and not five because I have not used them yet).</li>
            <li> Great! Worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Mia2 and they fit perfectly. This is a really good value.  When I first used it several of the black bristles came out.  But none have come out since.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Fits Mia II</li>
            <li> I use these for my clarisonic brush.  Definitely a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> These compatible replacement brush heads for delicate skin just do not measure up to the original Clairisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> Just like the clarisonic brush but less expensive.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit my clarisonic mia 2 perfectly and works as stated, but the bristles are definitely not meant for a delicate skin. Even the clarisonic normal brush heads are softer than these and the bristles feel harsh on the skin. Even though the OEM brusheads are considerably more expensive, I will be purchasing those as they work better for my skin.</li>
            <li> Well a few things... When I first bought these, I bought them knowing I wasn&#x27;t buying actual clarisonic brush heads. I mean those suckers are $25 a piece! Who wouldn&#x27;t look else where. The the price and now knowing what I know now; would I buy them again? ABSOLUTELY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my only issues:They are a bit more stiff than the actual brush heads and I got the sensitive ones. They feel like the regular brush head so if your skin is sensitive, like mine, you will just have to be careful of the pressure you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other con to buying these that I have is you have to wash them after every use and let them air dry OUT of the shower. Unlike the normal brush heads where I would just rinse them off and give them a good wash once a week, these get moldy and if you don&#x27;t wash them everyday. I saw a little shower mildew once my brush head started to go bad and that&#x27;s when I decided to toss it.</li>
            <li> I think they are great!!!  Only used it a few times, but compared to the original replacement heads at $25.00 each, I will SURE purchase again!!  : )  Thank you  : )</li>
            <li> I received these brush heads last week and I am in love with them!  They fit perfectly into my Clarisonic Mia 1 and I&#x27;m having no issues whatsoever! I purchased the &amp;#34;Delicate&amp;#34; brush heads because I have sensitive cheeks that tend to get very red and the brush that came with my Clarisonic was often too abrasive.  These leave my face feeling clean and refreshed without my face feeling like I just scraped sand paper over it!&lt;br /&gt;Why would I buy the expensive Clarisonic refills for $25+ when I will just continue to buy these! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I ordered Procizion generic delicate brush head instead of the sensitive Clarisonic one and the generic felt like it scratched as it cleaned.  My face was red and irritated after each use.  I guess the bristles are just too cheap to be soft enough.  After 3 times I figured I just wasted money I could have put towards a new Clarisonic brush head :(</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly on my Mia2 and work great!</li>
            <li> The order was placed on 1/29 and received on 1/30!! The replacement brush head fits in my Plus and Quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Brushes work as well as the brand name product</li>
            <li> wonderful, no problem with seller</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. When I first used motor would stop. This happened several times and I decided to return them. Since then the heads seem to be working correctly. It&#x27;s possible I didn&#x27;t have them seated properly. I have decided to use them for awhile longer.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get this out of the way: these are not appropriate for use on the delicate skin of your face. Irritation and stinging greeted me when using with my Clarisonic (with the appropriate technique I will add). Don&#x27;t waste your cash unless you are in the market for some light torture. Returned- I will spend the money to get the original refills.&lt;br /&gt;However, they fit the brush handle and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I had pretty middle of the road expectations for this to work. If it works great if not it wasnt too expensive of a loss. Well I was pleasantly surprised. These work the exact same way as the ones that came with the product. I will definitely repurchase and have already recommended these to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I like the softness of these brushes. Doesn&#x27;t sit as nicely as the actual clarisonic brush does but it fits and does the job just as well at a much cheaper price!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that the delicate brush head is the one to use if you have sensitive skin and rosacea.  A washcloth is rougher than this brush head. The product came as expected and worked as expected.</li>
