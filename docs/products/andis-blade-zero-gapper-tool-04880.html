            <li>Great easy to use product.</li>
            <li>Nice and crispy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product for zero gapping Andis liners.</li>
            <li>It did come with its own instructions</li>
            <li>has there own video so that should help.</li>
            <li>Good concept easy to use .</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved it,it came quick and</li>
            <li>My andis outliner is now sharper and works better.</li>
            <li>If you buy this make sure you visit Andis&#x27; youtube page.</li>
            <li>and he used it on all his clippers,now there sharper and better</li>
            <li>,we love it</li>
            <li>If there was levels of blade setting for this tool, it would have been better.</li>
            <li>is 1000% better.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I just wish I had more blades to adjust.</li>
            <li>Better than, &amp;#34;on the money&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And in my opinion better than the anivo models</li>
            <li>but this works better and quicker by removing the guess work out of it and from what I understand they work on promate blades as well,</li>
            <li>Andis if you&#x27;re listening - you should create an adjustment on the blade stop that allows users to dial-in the gap to a variable amount, that simple adjust would make this product excellent.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a better look in your cuts, then I will tell you to invest into this masterpiece.</li>
            <li>After using it I wouldn&#x27;t sell it for more then 10 bucks if it didn&#x27;t cost me 30</li>
            <li>Great razor,,ive been in the barber industry for 15yrs and for the price and quality,i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But with the normal andis  trimmer blades it does GREAT.</li>
            <li>Pretty good tool to zero out your blade.</li>
            <li>It aligns your clippers to zero for a very clean and precise cut.</li>
            <li>Easy instructions.</li>
            <li>The blade gapper was easy to use and adjusted blade to cut just as close as a razor.</li>
            <li>Easy to use if u just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>With that said the metal piece is strong and this tool works like a charm, I had been doing it manually</li>
            <li>Zero Gapper worked fine.</li>
            <li>it was fine</li>
            <li>I have to say this zero gapper is accurate every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Use it when you need to so your cuts can be precise.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product that every barber should have.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy video tutorials.</li>
            <li>And, viola it zero gaps the blade precise and with precision accuracy.</li>
            <li>They adjust the blades quicky and precisely.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use</li>
            <li>After receiving several replacement Andis blades that were clearly out of alignment, I thought this product would be great for getting the blades nicely aligned.</li>
            <li>for me attending barber school it made my lines more crisp and clean when done correctly</li>
            <li>This was not all that good, I only fit some of my Andis clippers, and it did not zero them out like I was expecting....</li>
            <li>(Thanks China, always love your guys quality,prideful craftmanship,LOL)</li>
            <li>glad I bought these as I really wanted to get my line ups closer</li>
            <li>Takes a few attempts to get it perfect without any overlap, but it definitely gets the blade closer and more precise than the anivo blade setter....</li>
            <li>Sets blade perfectly super close cuts without biting..</li>
            <li>I go threw alot of blades, I&#x27;ve used the anivo blade setter and its alright, but wished their was a better quality setter, in comes the Andis Zero gapper, while the concept is nice, there is a slight learning curve (directions included just suck)</li>
            <li>However if you are the type who likes those super close lines then this thing is right up your alley.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product works fine but who actually needs a $26 tool to zero gap your blades.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>while using this is well worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li>Andis should stick to their \\&quot;American Made\\&quot; mantra on this one, maybe woulda held up better,luckily the part that broke wasn&#x27;t vital component to use the gapper, quite honestly works better when you don&#x27;t lock blade in,</li>
            <li>They are worth the money.</li>
            <li>They tell you exactly how to use this.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I ordered it to do.</li>
            <li>Very well worth the wait</li>
            <li>I did not use this correctly the first time</li>
            <li>I used it the first time about 6 months ago</li>
            <li>Zero Gapper does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I used too much force the first time.</li>
            <li>The gapper word great I did get it within the time stated maybe a little earlier.  </li>
            <li>OUT THE BOX READY TO USE.  </li>
            <li>This product really zero&#x27;s out the blade</li>
            <li>Where has this been my whole life.</li>
            <li>The material that it is made from really allows you to do what you want and it stays clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t get any easier.  </li>
            <li>and it really does zero out your blade.</li>
            <li>Not sellers fault the makers of this could not have used their own product it leaves the blade uneven ,will tear your face up .you will want a refund if you purchase</li>
            <li>So with that all said, it&#x27;s a handy tool for us barbers, only major major flaw is its cheaply made first time I used it a piece of the black plastic you lock blade in with broke off</li>
            <li>I will start by saying that I have read some of the other reveiws concerning this product and about how the plastic pieces seem as if they may break, it&#x27;s good information, as if you do not watch the tutorial this could occur due to not knowing how much pressure to apply to get your blades in as I did (or did not).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Clippers like new again</li>
            <li>I used these blades on my son&#x27;s trimmers and proceeded to give him an extremely sharp and clean line (no nicks and scratches).&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few important tips Ive</li>
            <li>Simple to use and keeps blades straight when aligning.</li>
            <li>Gives you very crisp and sharp edge ups..</li>
            <li>A life saver for the person who can&#x27;t zero gap the old fashion way....</li>
            <li>I received the Gapper and immediately set to aligning all of my old blades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a must buy for any professional or bathroom barber...</li>
            <li>After years of using the mirror or flat surface method of setting my edgers (with a mixed rate of success) this is by far and away the easiest was to zero gap my edgers.  </li>
            <li>cannot use for new gtx trimmers deep tooth blade.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical.</li>
            <li>and it works for all the major trimmer blades opposed to buying multiple anivo models.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Definitely a must buy for any professional or bathroom barber...</li>
            <li> After years of using the mirror or flat surface method of setting my edgers (with a mixed rate of success) this is by far and away the easiest was to zero gap my edgers.  </li>
            <li> cannot use for new gtx trimmers deep tooth blade.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical.</li>
            <li> and it works for all the major trimmer blades opposed to buying multiple anivo models.</li>
            <li> Ps when you push up to gap it dont push it hard so the blades dont end up lopsided and are straight</li>
            <li> Lines the blade as far as it can go, just be VERY CAREFUL as it will be quite sharp.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have ( not a major one ) is that the button on the left side came off but with a little glue</li>
            <li> Next, push the slider up a little more until the cutting blade sits on an angle, cupped inside the slider.</li>
            <li> While it does get the blades sharp, I&#x27;ve not been able to stop them from causing irritation or cutting users.  </li>
            <li> but once you figure out how to load and the proper amount of pressure you should use when pushing the blade to gap(FYI barely push it because if u push it hard blade will overgap and be wayyy to sharp and cut people).</li>
            <li> I expected this device to enable the blade to give a sharper shave but it did improve the performance of my clippers.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone that is curious about purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The Zero Gapper performed exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I admit I had to watch the instruction video on the Andis YouTube channel a few times to finally get the hang of using the device, but once I got it, I got it.  </li>
            <li> If you like razor sharp hair line you need this product.</li>
            <li> My clippers are sharp as ever now.</li>
            <li> Blade may cut too close so be very careful if using trimmers for shaving.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful not to cut your client; and don&#x27;t even try to use the zero gapped blade on kids.</li>
            <li> Limited to a few blades</li>
            <li> Did not work to late to send back</li>
            <li> A little too sharp.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to press hard just slide the cutting blade into position lightly to firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This worked and now with same old blades cutting</li>
            <li> It takes slightly loosening your blades and inching the gapper into the correct postition.</li>

            <li> My andis outliner is now sharper and works better. Assembly with just the booklet instructions was terrible, you have to watch the Youtube installation online video to fully understand using the 0Gapper.</li>
            <li> There is a trick to setting the t-outliners and outliner II&#x27;s blades. Once you insert the blades inside the setter, push the sliding mechanism up to align the blades. Next, push the slider up a little more until the cutting blade sits on an angle, cupped inside the slider. Push the lock to the left until it clicks and voila! Tighten your blade screws and put them back on the trimmer. Nice and crispy. This move will not work on the styliner II blades. Good luck with those.</li>
            <li> Works great.Clippers like new again</li>
            <li> cannot use for new gtx trimmers deep tooth blade. Wasted my money</li>
            <li> Great razor,,ive been in the barber industry for 15yrs and for the price and quality,i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you buy this make sure you visit Andis&#x27; youtube page. They tell you exactly how to use this. One of the best purchases you can make if you own Andis trimmers. They really do get the blades perfectly aligned but again, look at the guide on youtube to help you perfect it.</li>
            <li> If you like razor sharp hair line you need this product. It aligns your clippers to zero for a very clean and precise cut.</li>
            <li> **** I&#x27;ve been using this blade setter for awhile now and. A few important tips Ive learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when sliding the the cutting blade into position DO NOT APPLY TOO MUCH PRESSURE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to press hard just slide the cutting blade into position lightly to firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;ve started sliding the blade into position with my two thumbs and holding it into position with one while tightening tension screws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I noticed that the blade would sometimes come out uneven or unparallel if I slid it into position with the bracket and locked it in. I use neither now and get a perfect blade every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works very well once you set a few blades and get the hang of it. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> you want to zero gap correctly? Buy this tool then.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I ordered it to do. Easy instructions. My clippers are sharp as ever now. Thank You</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved it,it came quick and all good and he used it on all his clippers,now there sharper and better,we love it</li>
            <li> Zero Gapper worked fine. Had to adjust a couple times from the biting though. Recommend for all barbers for using edjers.....</li>
            <li> Pretty good tool to zero out your blade. If there was levels of blade setting for this tool, it would have been better.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and keeps blades straight when aligning. After reading some other reviews I was not sure about this product but I found out that it was user error.</li>
            <li> OUT THE BOX READY TO USE.  INSTALLED BLADES, LOCKED IN ADJUSTMENT, AND TIGHTENED ADJUSTMENT SCREWS.  PRODUCT IS A AS ADVERTISED WILL ORDER AGAIN IF NECESSARY.</li>
            <li> Sets blade perfectly super close cuts without biting.. Gives you very crisp and sharp edge ups.. Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I expected this device to enable the blade to give a sharper shave but it did improve the performance of my clippers.</li>
            <li> Did not work to late to send back</li>
            <li> I have been looking to make my Andis T-outliner blades sharper for years.  I have sent them to my barbers etc.  This worked and now with same old blades cutting is 1000% better.  Thank you.  It feels good to take this issue off of my list after some any years.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. A great tool to have. Use it when you need to so your cuts can be precise. 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> This product really zero&#x27;s out the blade so you can get the closet shave or line-up as possible. I think Andis out did themselves when they made this product.</li>
            <li> The blade gapper was easy to use and adjusted blade to cut just as close as a razor. Blade may cut too close so be very careful if using trimmers for shaving.</li>
            <li> Where has this been my whole life. I love it I just wish I had more blades to adjust. I think I might just go around to barbershops and adjust their blades for them lol. If you don&#x27;t have it GET IT!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Aligns blades perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Once set blades won&#x27;t require realignment for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Takes a tiny bit of effort to get blades in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manually setting the gap is inaccurate while using this is well worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li> Great product, I was adjusting blades manually this product is easy to use and saved me a great amount of time!</li>
            <li> This was not all that good, I only fit some of my Andis clippers, and it did not zero them out like I was expecting....</li>
            <li> Limited to a few blades</li>
            <li> Useless, I do a better setting using my regular sight.</li>
            <li> While it does get the blades sharp, I&#x27;ve not been able to stop them from causing irritation or cutting users.  A little too sharp.     Edit:  10.7.14.  I no longer use the product at all.  I&#x27;ve gone back to setting blades manually..</li>
            <li> Good concept easy to use . Not sellers fault the makers of this could not have used their own product it leaves the blade uneven ,will tear your face up .you will want a refund if you purchase</li>
            <li> Received item as described without any issue.</li>
            <li> I am a barber who has been cutting hair for almost 6 years. I have to say this zero gapper is accurate every time I use it. My line ups come out sharper!</li>
            <li> Better than, &amp;#34;on the money&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use the andis GTX, blades and it tends to over set them. I have to go behind the device and back them off a bit. But with the normal andis  trimmer blades it does GREAT.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that every barber should have. Very well worth the wait</li>
            <li> Now that is a cool tool!!!</li>
            <li> I did not use this correctly the first time but once I did the blade was on point. Great buy just try not to hulk it as I did.  I used too much force the first time.</li>
            <li> I go threw alot of blades, I&#x27;ve used the anivo blade setter and its alright, but wished their was a better quality setter, in comes the Andis Zero gapper, while the concept is nice, there is a slight learning curve (directions included just suck) but once you figure out how to load and the proper amount of pressure you should use when pushing the blade to gap(FYI barely push it because if u push it hard blade will overgap and be wayyy to sharp and cut people). So with that all said, it&#x27;s a handy tool for us barbers, only major major flaw is its cheaply made first time I used it a piece of the black plastic you lock blade in with broke off and I wasn&#x27;t pressing hard or abusing product, just popped off at my touch (Thanks China, always love your guys quality,prideful craftmanship,LOL) Andis should stick to their \\&quot;American Made\\&quot; mantra on this one, maybe woulda held up better,luckily the part that broke wasn&#x27;t vital component to use the gapper, quite honestly works better when you don&#x27;t lock blade in, kinda pointless cuz blade is in there good no need to \\&quot;lock it in\\&quot;. But bottom line it does what it&#x27;s supposed to And in my opinion better than the anivo models and it works for all the major trimmer blades opposed to buying multiple anivo models. So if you adjust your blades on your trimmer or you have used the anivo setter, def don&#x27;t hestitate to try this one out, I wouldn&#x27;t adjust a blade without it just makes everything easier!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product for zero gapping Andis liners. A life saver for the person who can&#x27;t zero gap the old fashion way....</li>
            <li> Easy to use if u just follow the instructions. Cuts great now. No issues at all, a day level is perfect and does not irritate.</li>
            <li> Takes a few attempts to get it perfect without any overlap, but it definitely gets the blade closer and more precise than the anivo blade setter.... Easier to manage as well and you dont have to apply pressure at all.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I have read some of the other reveiws concerning this product and about how the plastic pieces seem as if they may break, it&#x27;s good information, as if you do not watch the tutorial this could occur due to not knowing how much pressure to apply to get your blades in as I did (or did not). With that said the metal piece is strong and this tool works like a charm, I had been doing it manually but this works better and quicker by removing the guess work out of it and from what I understand they work on promate blades as well, glad I bought these as I really wanted to get my line ups closer</li>
            <li> I use an Andis GTX trimmer as a beard trimmer, so this review only applies to that application. After receiving several replacement Andis blades that were clearly out of alignment, I thought this product would be great for getting the blades nicely aligned. The problem though is that a &amp;#34;Zero Gap&amp;#34; blade will cut you or cause irritation if used as a beard trimmer. Andis if you&#x27;re listening - you should create an adjustment on the blade stop that allows users to dial-in the gap to a variable amount, that simple adjust would make this product excellent. In the meantime, back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does what its says. The product speaks for itself. Great job by Andis. This product makes barbers life and lining the blad a lot easier without having to worry if you are going to nick the client or even cause skin irritation.</li>
            <li> When I got the zero gapper I was kind of skeptical. As soon as I got it, I was no longer skeptical. I adjusted my blades and they worked perfectly. The closeness of the shave and the hair lines were shaper.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone that is curious about purchasing it. There were no doubts after I used it. The material that it is made from really allows you to do what you want and it stays clean.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a better look in your cuts, then I will tell you to invest into this masterpiece.</li>
            <li> The Zero Gapper performed exactly as expected. I used it the first time about 6 months ago and I used instructions I found off of YouTube. It did come with its own instructions but I enjoy video tutorials.</li>
            <li> This really does get those trimmers zero gapped and cutting sharp! Very pleased customer</li>
            <li> I received the Gapper and immediately set to aligning all of my old blades.  I aligned a set of Outliner blades I had for over 3 years and that I previously considered to be dull.  I used these blades on my son&#x27;s trimmers and proceeded to give him an extremely sharp and clean line (no nicks and scratches).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must buy for any professional or bathroom barber...LOL</li>
            <li> The gapper word great I did get it within the time stated maybe a little earlier.  The only problem I have ( not a major one ) is that the button on the left side came off but with a little glue it was fine</li>
            <li> Good looks lol i cant say good things about this gapper it works with all andis trimmers/ shape up machines as people call it who dont barber and for me attending barber school it made my lines more crisp and clean when done correctly im never cut hair and watching vids on how to use it helps andis has there own video so that should help. Ps when you push up to gap it dont push it hard so the blades dont end up lopsided and are straight</li>
            <li> Zero Gapper does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to.  Lines the blade as far as it can go, just be VERY CAREFUL as it will be quite sharp.</li>
            <li> After years of using the mirror or flat surface method of setting my edgers (with a mixed rate of success) this is by far and away the easiest was to zero gap my edgers.  I admit I had to watch the instruction video on the Andis YouTube channel a few times to finally get the hang of using the device, but once I got it, I got it.  It really doesn&#x27;t get any easier.  Do yourself a favor and spend the money to get the tool to have your edgers set on point and not have the edgers biting your customers face and neck.</li>
            <li> Great easy to use product.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks if you have no idea of what your trying to achieve with your blades. It looks heavy duty but once you get the feel of it it&#x27;s flimsy. I managed to learn how to work it but I don&#x27;t recommend you get this. And I think Andis was wrong on the pricing of this item. After using it I wouldn&#x27;t sell it for more then 10 bucks if it didn&#x27;t cost me 30</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works fine but who actually needs a $26 tool to zero gap your blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased the andis blade zero gapper after wasting money in anivo brand setters. It takes slightly loosening your blades and inching the gapper into the correct postition. And, viola it zero gaps the blade precise and with precision accuracy.</li>
            <li> tooooooo close. but it did its job if your trying to cut a person</li>
            <li> Blades set perfect every time !!!!! I&#x27;ve set all my liners super crispy lines !!!!!! Great tool for beginners like me .</li>
            <li> I bought this gapper at a hair show. Not from Amazon so my review does not reflect the seller in any way. This thing works like charm. Super easy to use and it really does zero out your blade. The only problem is the blade is a bit to close. You have to be very careful not to cut your client; and don&#x27;t even try to use the zero gapped blade on kids. However if you are the type who likes those super close lines then this thing is right up your alley.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for.  They adjust the blades quicky and precisely.  They are worth the money.</li>
