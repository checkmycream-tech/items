            <li>The quality is very good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The build on these clippers is incredible.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>and they are designed great.</li>
            <li>Everything is great except for the fact the jaws are way too close together</li>
            <li>I also purchased the toenail clippers too and am just as happy with those.</li>
            <li>These nail Clippers are great for men.  </li>
            <li>They have great weight</li>
            <li>Also they work great.  </li>
            <li>This product works great for both fingernails and toenails.</li>
            <li>Great, arrived in time and works as described.</li>
            <li>Great quality and holds your clippings until you are done.</li>
            <li>great pair of finger nail clippers for ladies...</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>cut&#x27;s great and size fits my hand good.  </li>
            <li>Manliest way to clip your nails, i find i&#x27;m doing it more often too, helps not having to ask the chicks to borrow theirs :D</li>
            <li>It is even better than the Ace toenail clipper; a very pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>and they are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>My husband has always been looking for good clippers.  </li>
            <li>this is a good one ,taking it with me every where</li>
            <li>These are good clippers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a good looking pair of clippers, one reason i bought them, but bummed they can&#x27;t stay up to the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clippers are a good, well made, fingernail</li>
            <li>Great quality, I don&#x27;t think I will have to buy another pair for many years.</li>
            <li>These are the best clippers I have ever owned and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I love these nail clippers!  </li>
            <li>I dont understand why so many review it as a good product.</li>
            <li>For toenails are suitable</li>
            <li>The lack of a good nail file is a drawback; after the clipping the nails need some filing to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>A excellent purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the cheapo ones that you get for Xmas in a grooming set,  look like trash.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp and really easy to use, leaving a clean and precise cut.</li>
            <li>These are great, they cut at the right distance.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is huge!</li>
            <li>Love em.</li>
            <li>I would say if you&#x27;re thinking about these as a gift, make sure the man is a Tim \\&quot;The</li>
            <li>For that latter, perhaps something from Revlon would be best.</li>
            <li>I have to say they were the most versatile item I owned for those 10 weeks.</li>
            <li>not so therefore I think to buy one more for toenails, too from this series.</li>
            <li>Rugged - The most noticeable thing about these clippers in how rugged they feel.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d feel confident throwing them off a tall building (</li>
            <li>Design and appearance should be altered drastically to make it more appealing to consumer.</li>
            <li>, got to say I love the nail paring catcher.</li>
            <li>Works much better as a line cutter than a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>The red piece is a &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; which does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li>Otherwise i recommend Klhip, love &#x27;em</li>
            <li>As manly as finger nail clippers can be anyway:)</li>
            <li>then I think the target audience should be somewhere else ... :)</li>
            <li>I think that these are more suited for toenails rather than fingernails.</li>
            <li>I play guitar and these are great for trimming my nails so I can shred my axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but honestly they aren&#x27;t super functional.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff, these things are sharp, have a textured lever and are pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>They fell great in your hand and look great, but a standard $.99 drug store set is much easier to use.</li>
            <li>The ACE cuts my fingernails flawlessly and without sharp edges.</li>
            <li>They are easy to hold onto though.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip.</li>
            <li>They cut my stubborn nails easily.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it is well designed.</li>
            <li>Yes, they cut and leave a strong edge.</li>
            <li>Strong - this thing is STRONG.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems like a huge design flaw.</li>
            <li>The results were perfect, after a few minutes of tinkering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IF they hold up for more than 2 years, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re worth the price (at the time of this review they cost 3.50 + 5 shipping).</li>
            <li>Mighty manscaping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this about 6 months ago after my cheap nail clipper broke and, being the research and review monger that I am</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d return it, but the shipping would cost more than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It works well and is precise.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with them, very sturdy and have a solid feel.</li>
            <li>flat one is great too.</li>
            <li>Super sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was excited to use the clippers.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased for my desk a work</li>
            <li>Wonderfully  built very strong design should last a very long time.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t cut cleanly at all.  </li>
            <li>You know the way the trimmed metal comes off clean?  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how clean your nail trimmings will come off as well.  </li>
            <li>have a wide, scored handle for good gripping and a clippings catcher</li>
            <li>They are heavy-duty, and easy to use if you hold them right.</li>
            <li>This fingernail clipper is just the right stuff!  </li>
            <li>works great, not much else i can say about it</li>
            <li>The clipping collector actually works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses them and we all love it.  </li>
            <li>Sweet and manly finger nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Built strong, good leverage, but rough cuts.  </li>
            <li>This thing really is sharp - it cuts great, nice and solid, and is easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes this results in accidental removal of nail below the quick</li>
            <li>No more dainty silver for me!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Very sharp, great leverage, ergonomic.</li>
            <li>It fell apart the first night my husband tried to use it!  </li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t quite as easy to use as slightly more traditional designs.</li>
            <li>Good hefty clipper that does not slip in your hard like most out</li>
            <li>, they fit the hand comfortably and they chop away those mighty male timbers (</li>
            <li>these clippers 5 out of 5 stars for doing exactly what they said they would and for looking cool - black/red.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $10.</li>
            <li>jagged(TMI: Wiping hasn&#x27;t been fun).  </li>
            <li>These clippers are much better quality and do an excellent job of cutting your finger and toenails.  </li>
            <li>Overall nice clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this clipper many times and it has worked well so far.  </li>
            <li>Too big to effectively trim or cut your fingernails with.</li>
            <li>all right, I&#x27;ll stop now, hehe)</li>
            <li>If you are looking forward to cut your fingernails and toenails for a reasonable price, you arrived at the right product!</li>
            <li>It got to me in a very reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Other reviews have explained how good this item is so I won&#x27;t go into too much detail.  </li>
            <li>Evidently his search is over as he has not looked anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these are great clippers that I think are going to last a long time.</li>
            <li>So, thanks Ace!  </li>
            <li>Does a nice job of grabbing that flying fingernail &amp; holding it until you purposely empty it.</li>
            <li>This makes for nice cuts with minimal need for buffing.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $ absolutely.</li>
            <li>These clippers work well and they are a nice alternative to the normal standard clipprers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, the space between the blades is wider than most and these provide a solid crisp cut</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been needing.</li>
            <li>I use them insufficiently long, cut nails well and very precisely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if most men (positive reviewers) aren&#x27;t picky about their nails having a flat end?</li>
            <li>so these work far better than the old Revlon cheapies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I doubt that though, so the positive reviews are a mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are also very strong, heavy, and stout seeing as they are 402 STAINLESS STEEL!!</li>
            <li>- When I first received these clippers, I promptly opened the package and went to use the clippers; except to have the whole thing fall apart in my lap.</li>
            <li>But,the point at the back of these clippers is still held together, and the firmness of that point has kept the clippers from becoming too flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are nice for me and sharp no problem clipping my nail&#x27;s much better than normal clippers for big hands</li>
            <li>so good for small toes.&lt;br /&gt;note.</li>
            <li>Very strong and sharp nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Putting it back together is easy, but still annoying.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>They do not cut cleanly, I can not clip any nail and not have major filing to do after.</li>
            <li>Also, many of the people with these problems have limited flexibility.</li>
            <li>And certainly doesn&#x27;t look girly either.</li>
            <li>The front is so large it hurts when I use them.</li>
            <li>would not recommend these item for men with large hands...</li>
            <li>(5/26/2013) - More than a year later, I still haven&#x27;t had to buy a new pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Absolutely cut through the toughest nails like butter.</li>
            <li>It makes cleaning the clippers very easy.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The ribbed, textured feature of these clippers make it much easier to manipulate.  </li>
            <li>It cut my feet&#x27;s nails very well &amp; it does not hurt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Never before have I used clippers which really &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; me.  </li>
            <li>They grip very well</li>
            <li>in no time at all as they feel very strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it does cut very well.  </li>
            <li>I really did.  </li>
            <li>Last night I needed to clip my nails and did not have my clipper on me, so I used my girlfriend&#x27;s cheap mini clipper.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are sturdy and clip very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clipper blades are not curved that much.  </li>
            <li>They are almost straight across.  </li>
            <li>They are very robust and well made</li>
            <li>I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>so they are perfect for cutting my cat&#x27;s claws.&lt;br /&gt;no joke.</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say I have very sturdy fingernails often when I&#x27;m trimming,</li>
            <li>design is very manly as well.  </li>
            <li>I thought they broke, but as it turns out, the clippers actually consist of 4 simple pieces that slide together very easily.</li>
            <li>I lost my other ace one, and was able to find this.</li>
            <li>The Ace nail clipper, on the other hand, has been the strongest, most durable clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it effectively catches nails a little more than half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Requires to much pressure to apply, which makes it harder to achieve precise results (and my husband is not the one who cares much how his nails look like..).</li>
            <li>The clippers cut fine for me and fit well in my hands; compared to the silver ones that are hard to grip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those that complain about not being able to reach around the side of their nails perhaps have odd fingernails?</li>
            <li>I bought these looking for something a little more robust than the ones you pick up at the corner drugstore.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a purchase that is worth recommending to others.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something a little more substantial than the cheap clippers I&#x27;ve used for years, but this was just a little too much.</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re sharp and have that all important 30 degree</li>
            <li>When in use though, they produce a very rough cut which forces you to use another pair of clippers to smooth out the nail.</li>
            <li>Not only are they comfortable to use but the type of metal that is used seems to me that it will last forever.</li>
            <li>So many of the cheaper clippers left a rough or ragged edge.</li>
            <li>I first got a set of these fingernail clippers in the mail while in Army Basic Training.</li>
            <li>It is made in China but only marketed by ACE as an American product as familiar as the ACE comb.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I was looking for, a clipper with sharp and properly aligned blades that will cut nails cleanly.</li>
            <li>i was excited (well, as excited as one can be about a nail clipper) for these since i found the industrial design appealing.&lt;br /&gt;however, using them is not so easy for me, a bit painful at time.</li>
            <li>This is not because I want a proper manicure but more along the lines of I don&#x27;t like my left hand to have long nails</li>
            <li>have thick, and strong nails that aren&#x27;t very brittle and nail clippers</li>
            <li>These are way too big even for a large mans fingers.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with them is I wish they opened up a little more</li>
            <li>This clipper is very well built and has a solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These really are the only ones I shall be using from now on.</li>
            <li>It takes some extra care to not clip off too much nail.</li>
            <li>These are by far the nicest finger nail clippers I have ever had.</li>
            <li>the near lack of a curve on the blades presents a problem for me...</li>
            <li>But so far, they seem sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if your nail is back a bit on your finger or toe, this is a little tougher to get all the way underneath for a good cut, or at the corners where the nail might turn down a bit sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very sturdy tool and cuts through my tough nails easily.</li>
            <li>The mouth/cutter part was so narrow, one might be able to fit an infants thin nail between the blades.  </li>
            <li>My nails are very strong, normal clipper is useless after I use it for 4-5 times.</li>
            <li>They do feel weird at first as the blades are kind of big, but once you get used to them, you&#x27;ll never go back to another clipper.</li>
            <li>Two years later I&#x27;m planning on purchasing a second set as I get ready to deploy to Afghanistan.</li>
            <li>Im really tired of all the other cheap clippers that cant cut clean or cut through the nail at all(I</li>
            <li>These are going strong with about weekly use for the past 12 months!months!</li>
            <li>I hope they will serve long, won&#x27;t break and won&#x27;t become blunted, the price quite high.</li>
            <li>The others feel cheap and you have to press hard as you can to cut the nail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend these clippers to anyone, male or female.</li>
            <li>Took them generally because of design and because of that that they man&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I figured out how to use them properly, I must say wow.  </li>
            <li>The red section is a soft poly material and works well in holding the clippings.</li>
            <li>They provide a straight cut which seems to be a bit rough, requires follow up.</li>
            <li>they are so sharp and get the job done fast.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re only missing some kind of small nail file.</li>
            <li>the clip does not open far enough to clip any nails.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try, it is worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li>This clipper is deceptively smaller than I thought it would be thanks impart to both the picture and other reviews.</li>
            <li>When I first saw it, I thought that here is a heavy duty clipper I needed.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite feature as I don&#x27;t have to worry about rogue nails flying across the room to be found later or injuring a third party unnecessarily.</li>
            <li>opening a little to small, but works ok</li>
            <li>These clippers are really sturdy and very very sharp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had my clippers for a little over 2 months, so I can&#x27;t really comment on long-term-durability.  </li>

            <li> Manliest way to clip your nails, i find i&#x27;m doing it more often too, helps not having to ask the chicks to borrow theirs :D</li>
            <li> It is even better than the Ace toenail clipper; a very pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> and they are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> My husband has always been looking for good clippers.  </li>
            <li> this is a good one ,taking it with me every where</li>
            <li> These are good clippers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a good looking pair of clippers, one reason i bought them, but bummed they can&#x27;t stay up to the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These clippers are a good, well made, fingernail</li>
            <li> Great quality, I don&#x27;t think I will have to buy another pair for many years.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I have ever owned and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers!  </li>
            <li> I dont understand why so many review it as a good product.</li>
            <li> For toenails are suitable</li>
            <li> The lack of a good nail file is a drawback; after the clipping the nails need some filing to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> A excellent purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the cheapo ones that you get for Xmas in a grooming set,  look like trash.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp and really easy to use, leaving a clean and precise cut.</li>
            <li> These are great, they cut at the right distance.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is huge!</li>
            <li> Love em.</li>
            <li> I would say if you&#x27;re thinking about these as a gift, make sure the man is a Tim \\&quot;The</li>
            <li> For that latter, perhaps something from Revlon would be best.</li>
            <li> I have to say they were the most versatile item I owned for those 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> not so therefore I think to buy one more for toenails, too from this series.</li>
            <li> Rugged - The most noticeable thing about these clippers in how rugged they feel.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d feel confident throwing them off a tall building (</li>
            <li> Design and appearance should be altered drastically to make it more appealing to consumer.</li>
            <li> , got to say I love the nail paring catcher.</li>
            <li> Works much better as a line cutter than a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> The red piece is a &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; which does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Otherwise i recommend Klhip, love &#x27;em</li>
            <li> As manly as finger nail clippers can be anyway:)</li>
            <li> then I think the target audience should be somewhere else ... :)</li>
            <li> I think that these are more suited for toenails rather than fingernails.</li>
            <li> I play guitar and these are great for trimming my nails so I can shred my axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but honestly they aren&#x27;t super functional.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff, these things are sharp, have a textured lever and are pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> They fell great in your hand and look great, but a standard $.99 drug store set is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> The ACE cuts my fingernails flawlessly and without sharp edges.</li>
            <li> They are easy to hold onto though.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip.</li>
            <li> They cut my stubborn nails easily.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and it is well designed.</li>
            <li> Yes, they cut and leave a strong edge.</li>
            <li> Strong - this thing is STRONG.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems like a huge design flaw.</li>
            <li> The results were perfect, after a few minutes of tinkering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IF they hold up for more than 2 years, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re worth the price (at the time of this review they cost 3.50 + 5 shipping).</li>
            <li> Mighty manscaping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this about 6 months ago after my cheap nail clipper broke and, being the research and review monger that I am</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d return it, but the shipping would cost more than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It works well and is precise.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with them, very sturdy and have a solid feel.</li>
            <li> flat one is great too.</li>
            <li> Super sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was excited to use the clippers.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased for my desk a work</li>
            <li> Wonderfully  built very strong design should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t cut cleanly at all.  </li>
            <li> You know the way the trimmed metal comes off clean?  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how clean your nail trimmings will come off as well.  </li>
            <li> have a wide, scored handle for good gripping and a clippings catcher</li>
            <li> They are heavy-duty, and easy to use if you hold them right.</li>
            <li> This fingernail clipper is just the right stuff!  </li>
            <li> works great, not much else i can say about it</li>
            <li> The clipping collector actually works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses them and we all love it.  </li>
            <li> Sweet and manly finger nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Built strong, good leverage, but rough cuts.  </li>
            <li> This thing really is sharp - it cuts great, nice and solid, and is easy to grip.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes this results in accidental removal of nail below the quick</li>
            <li> No more dainty silver for me!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Very sharp, great leverage, ergonomic.</li>
            <li> It fell apart the first night my husband tried to use it!  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t quite as easy to use as slightly more traditional designs.</li>
            <li> Good hefty clipper that does not slip in your hard like most out</li>
            <li> , they fit the hand comfortably and they chop away those mighty male timbers (</li>
            <li> these clippers 5 out of 5 stars for doing exactly what they said they would and for looking cool - black/red.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $10.</li>
            <li> jagged(TMI: Wiping hasn&#x27;t been fun).  </li>
            <li> These clippers are much better quality and do an excellent job of cutting your finger and toenails.  </li>
            <li> Overall nice clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this clipper many times and it has worked well so far.  </li>
            <li> Too big to effectively trim or cut your fingernails with.</li>
            <li> all right, I&#x27;ll stop now, hehe)</li>
            <li> If you are looking forward to cut your fingernails and toenails for a reasonable price, you arrived at the right product!</li>
            <li> It got to me in a very reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have explained how good this item is so I won&#x27;t go into too much detail.  </li>
            <li> Evidently his search is over as he has not looked anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these are great clippers that I think are going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> So, thanks Ace!  </li>
            <li> Does a nice job of grabbing that flying fingernail &amp; holding it until you purposely empty it.</li>
            <li> This makes for nice cuts with minimal need for buffing.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $ absolutely.</li>
            <li> These clippers work well and they are a nice alternative to the normal standard clipprers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, the space between the blades is wider than most and these provide a solid crisp cut</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been needing.</li>
            <li> I use them insufficiently long, cut nails well and very precisely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if most men (positive reviewers) aren&#x27;t picky about their nails having a flat end?</li>
            <li> so these work far better than the old Revlon cheapies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I doubt that though, so the positive reviews are a mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are also very strong, heavy, and stout seeing as they are 402 STAINLESS STEEL!!</li>
            <li> - When I first received these clippers, I promptly opened the package and went to use the clippers; except to have the whole thing fall apart in my lap.</li>
            <li> But,the point at the back of these clippers is still held together, and the firmness of that point has kept the clippers from becoming too flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are nice for me and sharp no problem clipping my nail&#x27;s much better than normal clippers for big hands</li>
            <li> so good for small toes.&lt;br /&gt;note.</li>
            <li> Very strong and sharp nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Putting it back together is easy, but still annoying.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> They do not cut cleanly, I can not clip any nail and not have major filing to do after.</li>
            <li> Also, many of the people with these problems have limited flexibility.</li>
            <li> And certainly doesn&#x27;t look girly either.</li>
            <li> The front is so large it hurts when I use them.</li>
            <li> would not recommend these item for men with large hands...</li>
            <li> (5/26/2013) - More than a year later, I still haven&#x27;t had to buy a new pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely cut through the toughest nails like butter.</li>
            <li> It makes cleaning the clippers very easy.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The ribbed, textured feature of these clippers make it much easier to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> It cut my feet&#x27;s nails very well &amp; it does not hurt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never before have I used clippers which really &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; me.  </li>
            <li> They grip very well</li>
            <li> in no time at all as they feel very strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, it does cut very well.  </li>
            <li> I really did.  </li>
            <li> Last night I needed to clip my nails and did not have my clipper on me, so I used my girlfriend&#x27;s cheap mini clipper.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are sturdy and clip very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clipper blades are not curved that much.  </li>
            <li> They are almost straight across.  </li>
            <li> They are very robust and well made</li>
            <li> I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> so they are perfect for cutting my cat&#x27;s claws.&lt;br /&gt;no joke.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say I have very sturdy fingernails often when I&#x27;m trimming,</li>
            <li> design is very manly as well.  </li>
            <li> I thought they broke, but as it turns out, the clippers actually consist of 4 simple pieces that slide together very easily.</li>
            <li> I lost my other ace one, and was able to find this.</li>
            <li> The Ace nail clipper, on the other hand, has been the strongest, most durable clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it effectively catches nails a little more than half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Requires to much pressure to apply, which makes it harder to achieve precise results (and my husband is not the one who cares much how his nails look like..).</li>
            <li> The clippers cut fine for me and fit well in my hands; compared to the silver ones that are hard to grip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those that complain about not being able to reach around the side of their nails perhaps have odd fingernails?</li>
            <li> I bought these looking for something a little more robust than the ones you pick up at the corner drugstore.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a purchase that is worth recommending to others.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little more substantial than the cheap clippers I&#x27;ve used for years, but this was just a little too much.</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re sharp and have that all important 30 degree</li>
            <li> When in use though, they produce a very rough cut which forces you to use another pair of clippers to smooth out the nail.</li>
            <li> Not only are they comfortable to use but the type of metal that is used seems to me that it will last forever.</li>
            <li> So many of the cheaper clippers left a rough or ragged edge.</li>
            <li> I first got a set of these fingernail clippers in the mail while in Army Basic Training.</li>
            <li> It is made in China but only marketed by ACE as an American product as familiar as the ACE comb.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I was looking for, a clipper with sharp and properly aligned blades that will cut nails cleanly.</li>
            <li> i was excited (well, as excited as one can be about a nail clipper) for these since i found the industrial design appealing.&lt;br /&gt;however, using them is not so easy for me, a bit painful at time.</li>
            <li> This is not because I want a proper manicure but more along the lines of I don&#x27;t like my left hand to have long nails</li>
            <li> have thick, and strong nails that aren&#x27;t very brittle and nail clippers</li>
            <li> These are way too big even for a large mans fingers.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with them is I wish they opened up a little more</li>
            <li> This clipper is very well built and has a solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These really are the only ones I shall be using from now on.</li>
            <li> It takes some extra care to not clip off too much nail.</li>
            <li> These are by far the nicest finger nail clippers I have ever had.</li>
            <li> the near lack of a curve on the blades presents a problem for me...</li>
            <li> But so far, they seem sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if your nail is back a bit on your finger or toe, this is a little tougher to get all the way underneath for a good cut, or at the corners where the nail might turn down a bit sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very sturdy tool and cuts through my tough nails easily.</li>
            <li> The mouth/cutter part was so narrow, one might be able to fit an infants thin nail between the blades.  </li>
            <li> My nails are very strong, normal clipper is useless after I use it for 4-5 times.</li>
            <li> They do feel weird at first as the blades are kind of big, but once you get used to them, you&#x27;ll never go back to another clipper.</li>
            <li> Two years later I&#x27;m planning on purchasing a second set as I get ready to deploy to Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> Im really tired of all the other cheap clippers that cant cut clean or cut through the nail at all(I</li>
            <li> These are going strong with about weekly use for the past 12 months!months!</li>
            <li> I hope they will serve long, won&#x27;t break and won&#x27;t become blunted, the price quite high.</li>
            <li> The others feel cheap and you have to press hard as you can to cut the nail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend these clippers to anyone, male or female.</li>
            <li> Took them generally because of design and because of that that they man&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I figured out how to use them properly, I must say wow.  </li>
            <li> The red section is a soft poly material and works well in holding the clippings.</li>
            <li> They provide a straight cut which seems to be a bit rough, requires follow up.</li>
            <li> they are so sharp and get the job done fast.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re only missing some kind of small nail file.</li>
            <li> the clip does not open far enough to clip any nails.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, it is worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li> This clipper is deceptively smaller than I thought it would be thanks impart to both the picture and other reviews.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it, I thought that here is a heavy duty clipper I needed.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite feature as I don&#x27;t have to worry about rogue nails flying across the room to be found later or injuring a third party unnecessarily.</li>
            <li> opening a little to small, but works ok</li>
            <li> These clippers are really sturdy and very very sharp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had my clippers for a little over 2 months, so I can&#x27;t really comment on long-term-durability.  </li>
            <li> yea, they&#x27;re powerful, and most of what other reviews noted, but still with a choppy, scary, mechanism so to speak.</li>
            <li> Ultra heavy duty / high quality manufacturing.</li>
            <li> They are Heavy Duty and have a masculine look to them as well!!</li>
            <li> It took a bit to get used to these, but they are solidly built and will last a long long time</li>
            <li> Finally, a nail clipper that&#x27;s sturdy and performs beautifully (I only use it on my hands, the dreaded toe nail fungus causes my to revert to a small pair of wire cutters ((dykes for you old timers)) for the feet)</li>
            <li> Ace clippers are tough, sharp, comfortable.</li>
            <li> so for someone with large hands they are hard to handle...</li>
            <li> Really hard to fit your nail in between the blades because the opening is so small, and it&#x27;s not like i have the nails of an ogre.  </li>
            <li> I am partial to the Revlon but tried these out, they are definitely sturdy.</li>
            <li> after 4 years of use, the blades have very little wear on them and still cut as though they are brand new.</li>
            <li> I mean am I really writing a review for finger nail clippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The red rubber that&#x27;s inserted behind the blades helps greatly in minimizing flying nails, but can sometimes be a little difficult in cleaning out.</li>
            <li> Black color is just paint - even after only 3 uses, the black paint near the \\&quot;hinge\\&quot; of the clipper appears to be chipping away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other (currently sold out)</li>
            <li> These clippers take a little getting used too and the technique I&#x27;ve learned is to do the opposite of traditional nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> They look cool, which is the wrong reason to buy something, but they do not work.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and now being sent back to China for recycling so some other \\&quot;American Company\\&quot; can have something else made out of it.</li>
            <li> The distance between the two blades in larger than my previous clippers, and the result is a stronger clip of nails.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Technically these do the job, but they typically leave the nails rough at the edges after use, and there is no file to help alleviate that.  </li>
            <li> Probably double the size of the little ones my wife has.  </li>
            <li> All of my male co-workers were intrigued and a little jealous.</li>
            <li> Looks very manly - I mean, check out the picture!</li>
            <li> Just a little harder to tell if your going to cut your nail to short</li>
            <li> They are heavy duty so every clip will cut a nail instead of trying several times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it after wash my hands and no slips even with wet hands.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would pay that much for a set of nail clippers, but I was tired of corner drugstore nail clippers that tore and chewed my nails off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to file the rough edges after I use this device.</li>
            <li> i used to HAVE to clip my fingernails right out of a hot shower because they are so thick and hard, and even then normal clippers would just \\&quot;chew\\&quot; at my nail leaving a jagged bad looking edge.</li>
            <li> Not sure they provide better cutting or accuracy.  </li>
            <li> Looking at the other reviews I did not know what to expect with this product.  </li>
            <li> Small female it is not conveniently to work.</li>
            <li> the fleshy underside of my nail gets nipped often, a problem i&#x27;ve never had with other</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful with them</li>
            <li> It is not at all a comfortable device for cutting your nails&lt;br /&gt;You will trouble to place it and cut your nails :</li>
            <li> Replace those 99 cent clippers with this and expect them to last at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well until the base of it completely came apart.</li>
            <li> The lever provides quite a bit of resistance to being pushed down and, you know, clipping your finger or toe nails.  </li>
            <li> The corners of the nail clippers have had the black paint worn out, but 98% of it is still intact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a sharp set of nail clippers, with enough leverage to trim my tough nails.  </li>
            <li> The blades themselves are quite wide but the gap between them is very narrow.  </li>
            <li> Either they were too weak to cut through my nail, leaving them jagged, the  blades would somehow develop a notch in them, resulting in an incomplete clip so I would have to reclip the nail, or they would simply rust or fall apart.</li>
            <li> , I find it a little tricky to get some of my finger and toe nails between the clippers.</li>
            <li> gap between the blades is very small making it pretty difficultly to get nails in between.</li>
            <li> stupidity in these ratings by requiring a certain number of words.)</li>
            <li> Very aggressive cutting angle</li>
            <li> I do like how heavy they are and the non-slip grips.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money . . .</li>
            <li> Its a failed design, the whole design is too thick and really not easy to use it.</li>
            <li> Minority of people with disfigured toenails find that conventional clippers and other instruments promoted for use are simply not correctly sized, or way overpriced and halfway useless because of incorrect jaw size or dull, unsharpened cutters.</li>
            <li> I have thick nails that other drug store clippers just wimp out.  </li>
            <li> These are a bit stiff and take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp, but they are hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Total failure if there is minus star ill give it -5</li>
            <li> Pretty much useless on my fingernails, and it&#x27;s difficult to use on my toenails.</li>
            <li> Not sure, as I have no problem using these to cut my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I usually use dollar-store finger nail clippers, but after breaking three consecutive pair, I decided it was time to give a \\&quot;man&#x27;s clipper\\&quot; a try.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t fiddly, slippery or too small.  </li>
            <li> This clipper needs some space directly under were it is cutting.</li>
            <li> I have owned in the past</li>
            <li> they are small...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say why, but I just didn&#x27;t like these.</li>
            <li> Hard to work.</li>
            <li> But the depth of the front face makes it a bit hard to get under the nails fully sometimes.  </li>
            <li> They cut time and time again without getting dull.</li>
            <li> Taken I don&#x27;t have big fingers, I&#x27;m having a hard time cutting my finger nails because this clipper is so bulky.</li>
            <li> have thick nails)</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m buying them as gifts for fathers day and all those other difficult to shop for gift giving holidays.</li>
            <li> I mean if an clipper can be intimidating this is the one.</li>
            <li> It a design failure why should the face an inch width, i cannot even slot in my nails inside or see where to cut.</li>
            <li> This was yet another true and boring story.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible to actually get your finger nail in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Ace was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Too big, bulky and expensive to allow for precision cutting.  </li>
            <li> I was reading the review and was not sure, but it is not that expensive, so decided to buy it for my husband and see if he likes it.</li>
            <li> IF you have thick toe nail then give these babies a shot!</li>
            <li> This is too big for cutting my nails, so I put it in my tackle box for cutting fishing line.</li>
            <li> The gap is too narrow for cutting nails.  </li>
            <li> Being recently disabled, cutting my fingernails has been difficult.  </li>
            <li> Hard to see what you are cutting.</li>
            <li> They are so thick that you have to tilt them a bit and that keeps them from cutting nails that may become ingrown.  </li>
            <li> Expensive clipper but difficult to find stronger one.</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m doing something wrong, and I don&#x27;t think I am (they&#x27;re nail-clippers)</li>
            <li> I like the look and feel of the clipper in my hand, but I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of cutting my nails with it.  </li>
            <li> (well the packaging seems to go on &amp; on about it) for cutting force.</li>
            <li> No curve in the blade along the horizontal makes it difficult to cut finger nails with flattening the nail and being painful.</li>
            <li> Now it no longer creates the leverage required for cutting a nail.</li>
            <li> just flex and end up tearing my nails instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> Too bad even toe doctor instruments are inadequately made nowadays.</li>
            <li> Hate this thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to chalk it up too, but these things are seriously annoying.</li>
            <li> They just have a terrible design.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but this is a horrible nail clipper.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very aggressive cutting angle and they are designed great. Absolutely cut through the toughest nails like butter. Made for a mans hands too. Love em.</li>
            <li> best made nail clipper i have ever had</li>
            <li> Everything is great except for the fact the jaws are way too close together and it&#x27;s almost impossible to actually get your finger nail in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a huge design flaw.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little more substantial than the cheap clippers I&#x27;ve used for years, but this was just a little too much. Pretty much useless on my fingernails, and it&#x27;s difficult to use on my toenails. Could just be me, but I was dissapointed. They are easy to hold onto though.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Looking at the other reviews I did not know what to expect with this product.  When it arrived I was excited to use the clippers.  After some trial and error I figured out how to use them properly, I must say wow.  These are great, they cut at the right distance.  They are so thick that you have to tilt them a bit and that keeps them from cutting nails that may become ingrown.  I will buy them again, and again.</li>
            <li> I have these clippers and use them all the time.  These are big!  Probably double the size of the little ones my wife has.  They do feel weird at first as the blades are kind of big, but once you get used to them, you&#x27;ll never go back to another clipper.</li>
            <li> What can I say? These are hefty clippers. Those that complain about not being able to reach around the side of their nails perhaps have odd fingernails? Not sure, as I have no problem using these to cut my fingernails. They are heavy-duty, and easy to use if you hold them right. I would say if you&#x27;re thinking about these as a gift, make sure the man is a Tim \\&quot;The Toolman\\&quot; Taylor type and not a Ron \\&quot;Sweatin&#x27; to the Oldies\\&quot; Type. For that latter, perhaps something from Revlon would be best. These are tools. For a man that likes tools. Yes, they cut and leave a strong edge. That&#x27;s taken care of by a nail file, which is why they make them as well. The nail file by Ace is your friend:  [[ASIN:B0013FNB7K Ace Nail File Pick 1 ea]]</li>
            <li> These clippers are really sturdy and very very sharp.  I originally purchased for my desk a work and they are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> My husband has always been looking for good clippers.  Evidently his search is over as he has not looked anymore.</li>
            <li> Purchased these clippers after seeing a review on uncrate.com. I am very happy with them, very sturdy and have a solid feel. The clipping collector actually works surprisingly well. I also purchased the toenail clippers too and am just as happy with those.</li>
            <li> Industrial clipper for all the men in my lives</li>
            <li> Ace clippers are tough, sharp, comfortable. What else could you need when it comes to a pair of clippers. Im really tired of all the other cheap clippers that cant cut clean or cut through the nail at all(I have thick nails) GOOD PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The gap is too narrow for cutting nails.  Its a failed design, the whole design is too thick and really not easy to use it. It a design failure why should the face an inch width, i cannot even slot in my nails inside or see where to cut. Total failure if there is minus star ill give it -5 star. I dont understand why so many review it as a good product.</li>
            <li> These nail Clippers are great for men.  They are Heavy Duty and have a masculine look to them as well!!</li>
            <li> Taken I don&#x27;t have big fingers, I&#x27;m having a hard time cutting my finger nails because this clipper is so bulky.</li>
            <li> I first got a set of these fingernail clippers in the mail while in Army Basic Training. I have to say they were the most versatile item I owned for those 10 weeks. Rugged and frankly the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Two years later I&#x27;m planning on purchasing a second set as I get ready to deploy to Afghanistan. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought these at local store for $1.75.  cut&#x27;s great and size fits my hand good.  would buy another pair even for $9.</li>
            <li> I use them insufficiently long, cut nails well and very precisely. After them it is not necessary to file nails. Took them generally because of design and because of that that they man&#x27;s. Small female it is not conveniently to work. For toenails are suitable not so therefore I think to buy one more for toenails, too from this series. I hope they will serve long, won&#x27;t break and won&#x27;t become blunted, the price quite high.</li>
            <li> this is a good one ,taking it with me every where</li>
            <li> The ACE for Men Fingernail Clipper is  an excellent product for men and it has become a reliable tool that I use often.</li>
            <li> I like the look and feel of the clipper in my hand, but I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of cutting my nails with it.  The lack of a good nail file is a drawback; after the clipping the nails need some filing to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> I usually use dollar-store finger nail clippers, but after breaking three consecutive pair, I decided it was time to give a \\&quot;man&#x27;s clipper\\&quot; a try. The results were perfect, after a few minutes of tinkering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Comes apart - When I first received these clippers, I promptly opened the package and went to use the clippers; except to have the whole thing fall apart in my lap. I thought they broke, but as it turns out, the clippers actually consist of 4 simple pieces that slide together very easily. It makes cleaning the clippers very easy.&lt;br /&gt;2) Strong - this thing is STRONG. The distance between the two blades in larger than my previous clippers, and the result is a stronger clip of nails.&lt;br /&gt;3) Looks very manly - I mean, check out the picture! No more dainty silver for me!&lt;br /&gt;4) Rugged - The most noticeable thing about these clippers in how rugged they feel. They have great weight and I&#x27;d feel confident throwing them off a tall building (if I ever needed to?).&lt;br /&gt;5) Catches nails (sometimes) - The red plastic seen in the image is actually a nail catcher. I&#x27;d say it effectively catches nails a little more than half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Comes apart - I listed this as a pro above, but in some cases it can be a con. Until you get used to the fact that these come apart, you will undoubtedly accidentally pull it apart on occasion. Putting it back together is easy, but still annoying.&lt;br /&gt;2) Black color is just paint - even after only 3 uses, the black paint near the \\&quot;hinge\\&quot; of the clipper appears to be chipping away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are great clippers that I think are going to last a long time. IF they hold up for more than 2 years, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re worth the price (at the time of this review they cost 3.50 + 5 shipping). I suppose time will tell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE (5/26/2013) - More than a year later, I still haven&#x27;t had to buy a new pair of nail clippers. These are going strong with about weekly use for the past 12 months!months!</li>
            <li> These fingernail clippers are the aston martin of fingernail clippers. they are so sharp and get the job done fast. i used to HAVE to clip my fingernails right out of a hot shower because they are so thick and hard, and even then normal clippers would just \\&quot;chew\\&quot; at my nail leaving a jagged bad looking edge. With Ace fingernail (and toenail) clippers, I can clip my nails whenever I need to - and I can&#x27;t imagine nails that these wouldn&#x27;t cut. I had a revelation when I opened them up and started clipping!! They are also very strong, heavy, and stout seeing as they are 402 STAINLESS STEEL!! I wouldn&#x27;t change one thing about them.  .... Buy them. Thank me later.</li>
            <li> Too bulky. Hard to see what you are cutting. The red plastic insert if coming out of mine only after two uses. I do like how heavy they are and the non-slip grips.</li>
            <li> I bought these looking for something a little more robust than the ones you pick up at the corner drugstore. These don&#x27;t cut cleanly at all.  Might as well chew off your fingernails and use a nail file.</li>
            <li> I was tired of cheap clippers that I kept buying at the grocery store. They would bend or turn to rust within a month, so I decided to try these out. I bought the fingernail clippers and the toenail clippers and had them delivered to my office. All of my male co-workers were intrigued and a little jealous. One of them told me to buy him a pair and he would \\&quot;pay me back.\\&quot; So now I&#x27;m buying them as gifts for fathers day and all those other difficult to shop for gift giving holidays. So, thanks Ace!  Also they work great.  This was yet another true and boring story.</li>
            <li> Very strong and sharp nail clipper. I lost my other ace one, and was able to find this. The other (currently sold out) flat one is great too.</li>
            <li> Too big, bulky and expensive to allow for precision cutting.  Design and appearance should be altered drastically to make it more appealing to consumer.</li>
            <li> This product works great for both fingernails and toenails. If you are looking forward to cut your fingernails and toenails for a reasonable price, you arrived at the right product!</li>
            <li> very sturdy tool and cuts through my tough nails easily. works great, not much else i can say about it</li>
            <li> I bought these to put into my gig bag for my guitar so that when I&#x27;m out playing somewhere I have a proper pair of nail clippers. This is not because I want a proper manicure but more along the lines of I don&#x27;t like my left hand to have long nails and I&#x27;ve been out &amp; about with my guitar without clippers once too often. These will satisfy nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, got to say I love the nail paring catcher. Does a nice job of grabbing that flying fingernail &amp; holding it until you purposely empty it. Plus they&#x27;re sharp and have that all important 30 degree (well the packaging seems to go on &amp; on about it) for cutting force. Having big hands I tend to have thicker nails so these work far better than the old Revlon cheapies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave these clippers 5 out of 5 stars for doing exactly what they said they would and for looking cool - black/red.</li>
            <li> This is a man&#x27;s nail clipper! Try this and you&#x27;ll never use those cheapo silver things again. Very sharp, great leverage, ergonomic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say why, but I just didn&#x27;t like these. They weren&#x27;t quite as easy to use as slightly more traditional designs.</li>
            <li> The number of nail clippers I had to purchase before I got the Ace was ridiculous. Either they were too weak to cut through my nail, leaving them jagged, the  blades would somehow develop a notch in them, resulting in an incomplete clip so I would have to reclip the nail, or they would simply rust or fall apart. The Ace nail clipper, on the other hand, has been the strongest, most durable clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after 4 years of use, the blades have very little wear on them and still cut as though they are brand new. The red rubber that&#x27;s inserted behind the blades helps greatly in minimizing flying nails, but can sometimes be a little difficult in cleaning out. The corners of the nail clippers have had the black paint worn out, but 98% of it is still intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build on these clippers is incredible. After a while, the strength of any clippers would deteriorate. But,the point at the back of these clippers is still held together, and the firmness of that point has kept the clippers from becoming too flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend these clippers to anyone, male or female. Replace those 99 cent clippers with this and expect them to last at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp, but they are hard to use.  No curve in the blade along the horizontal makes it difficult to cut finger nails with flattening the nail and being painful.</li>
            <li> Being recently disabled, cutting my fingernails has been difficult.  The ribbed, textured feature of these clippers make it much easier to manipulate.  A blessing.</li>
            <li> These clippers look and feel substantial, something a man can appreciate. When in use though, they produce a very rough cut which forces you to use another pair of clippers to smooth out the nail.</li>
            <li> the clip does not open far enough to clip any nails.  i feel like i was tricked buying this item.</li>
            <li> Great, arrived in time and works as described.</li>
            <li> I opened the box and was amazed how this thing is made. Ultra heavy duty / high quality manufacturing. I mean if an clipper can be intimidating this is the one. My nails are very strong, normal clipper is useless after I use it for 4-5 times. With this you can cut an electrical wire without worrying about damaging it, of course that is not the purpose of this thing. Expensive clipper but difficult to find stronger one.</li>
            <li> A excellent purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Makes the cheapo ones that you get for Xmas in a grooming set,  look like trash.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp and really easy to use, leaving a clean and precise cut.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these!</li>
            <li> This is too big for cutting my nails, so I put it in my tackle box for cutting fishing line. Works much better as a line cutter than a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Really hard to fit your nail in between the blades because the opening is so small, and it&#x27;s not like i have the nails of an ogre.  Also not curved enough, so it takes a lot of clips to get around one nail.  Hate this thing.</li>
            <li> This clipper is very well built and has a solid feel to it.  I like the ease in which you operate it without your fingers sliding off the handle.</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m doing something wrong, and I don&#x27;t think I am (they&#x27;re nail-clippers), you simply cannot cut your nails with these. They look cool, which is the wrong reason to buy something, but they do not work.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! Super sturdy and easy to use. And certainly doesn&#x27;t look girly either. I would say I&#x27;d buy it again, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll break anytime soon!</li>
            <li> This fingernail clipper is just the right stuff!  It is even better than the Ace toenail clipper; a very pleasant surprise.  Well worth the $10.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it, I thought that here is a heavy duty clipper I needed. But, the opening was too close for some of my nails.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully  built very strong design should last a very long time. Just a little harder to tell if your going to cut your nail to short</li>
            <li> They just have a terrible design.</li>
            <li> It cut my feet&#x27;s nails very well &amp; it does not hurt. a bit</li>
            <li> This clipper is deceptively smaller than I thought it would be thanks impart to both the picture and other reviews. I have what one person has described as meat cleaver hands and I&#x27;ve just finished using these clippers to clip some overgrown nails, some nails I&#x27;ve chewed, and some nails that I just had to take a steak knife too which left them unkempt and jagged(TMI: Wiping hasn&#x27;t been fun).  These clippers take a little getting used too and the technique I&#x27;ve learned is to do the opposite of traditional nail clippers.  With traditional nail clippers you maneuver the clipper around each nail.  With this tool you maneuver each nail into the tool.  This makes for nice cuts with minimal need for buffing.  The red piece is a &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; which does its job perfectly. Its made of some type of silicone or rubber and holds on to each clipped nail. I recommend tapping the clipper over the garbage bin after each nail so you don&#x27;t defeat the purpose of the nail catcher.  This is probably my favorite feature as I don&#x27;t have to worry about rogue nails flying across the room to be found later or injuring a third party unnecessarily.</li>
            <li> Descent, if you have bear paws for hands.  Otherwise i recommend Klhip, love &#x27;em</li>
            <li> Good stuff, these things are sharp, have a textured lever and are pretty awesome.  There isn&#x27;t any &amp;#34;hesitation&amp;#34; getting through a nail.</li>
            <li> My dad bought a pair a couple years ago which I have been using. Now that I moved out I had to get a pair for myself! They are heavy duty so every clip will cut a nail instead of trying several times. Great quality, I don&#x27;t think I will have to buy another pair for many years.</li>
            <li> Mighty manscaping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before have I used clippers which really &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; me.  They aren&#x27;t fiddly, slippery or too small.  They grip very well, they fit the hand comfortably and they chop away those mighty male timbers (all right, I&#x27;ll stop now, hehe) in no time at all as they feel very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really are the only ones I shall be using from now on.</li>
            <li> They are nice for me and sharp no problem clipping my nail&#x27;s much better than normal clippers for big hands</li>
            <li> Hard to work. The front is so large it hurts when I use them.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful with them</li>
            <li> These are a bit stiff and take some getting used to. It takes some extra care to not clip off too much nail.</li>
            <li> Great quality and holds your clippings until you are done. The red section is a soft poly material and works well in holding the clippings. I&#x27;ve used it after wash my hands and no slips even with wet hands.</li>
            <li> I mean am I really writing a review for finger nail clippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... well the answer is yes. Oddly enough once I got them I felt that I had to do it. These are by far the nicest finger nail clippers I have ever had. Not only are they comfortable to use but the type of metal that is used seems to me that it will last forever. If you are in the market for finger nail clippers... look no further!</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well until the base of it completely came apart. Now it no longer creates the leverage required for cutting a nail.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would pay that much for a set of nail clippers, but I was tired of corner drugstore nail clippers that tore and chewed my nails off.  These clippers are much better quality and do an excellent job of cutting your finger and toenails.  The whole family uses them and we all love it.  Give it a try, it is worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li> This thing really is sharp - it cuts great, nice and solid, and is easy to grip.  But the depth of the front face makes it a bit hard to get under the nails fully sometimes.  I like my nails cut close, so if your nail is back a bit on your finger or toe, this is a little tougher to get all the way underneath for a good cut, or at the corners where the nail might turn down a bit sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it does cut very well.  Just wish it was a bit \\&quot;shorter\\&quot; at the front for easier maneuvering.</li>
            <li> I really did.  I bought this about 6 months ago after my cheap nail clipper broke and, being the research and review monger that I am, I ended up with this masculine-looking pair of nail clippers.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but this is a horrible nail clipper.  The lever provides quite a bit of resistance to being pushed down and, you know, clipping your finger or toe nails.  Also, just getting a finger or toe nail between the blades is a challenge.  The blades themselves are quite wide but the gap between them is very narrow.  This means you end up rubbing your nails against the end of the blade while trying in vain to find the gap.  Last night I needed to clip my nails and did not have my clipper on me, so I used my girlfriend&#x27;s cheap mini clipper.  It was the biggest relief.</li>
            <li> The product was much smaller than the ad led me to believe.  It fell apart the first night my husband tried to use it!  The mouth/cutter part was so narrow, one might be able to fit an infants thin nail between the blades.  I&#x27;d return it, but the shipping would cost more than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The clippers cut fine for me and fit well in my hands; compared to the silver ones that are hard to grip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complain I would have is a rubber insert by the hinge the helps push the clippers back up.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber insert prevents cut nails from sliding out and they often get stuck.</li>
            <li> works well for my thumbs and big toe nails(hard to find ones that do that).  I have XL hands.&lt;br /&gt;not so good for small toes.&lt;br /&gt;note. This clipper needs some space directly under were it is cutting.</li>
            <li> The clippers were just as promised. Easy to grip. Very sturdy. Would recommend. Would buy again. Worth the $ absolutely.</li>
            <li> I wanted something different so my wife would quit taking my clippers.  These worked.  They stand out as MINE, NO TOUCH.&lt;br /&gt;They are sturdy and clip very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The clipper blades are not curved that much.  They are almost straight across.  Nails are not shaped that way.&lt;br /&gt;That red piece is rubber and serves no purpose.  The nail clippings get caught in there and stuck to the rubber and sometimes between the rubber and the metal.  I ended up ripping that rubber out of there.</li>
            <li> Sweet and manly finger nail clippers. As manly as finger nail clippers can be anyway:)</li>
            <li> Technically these do the job, but they typically leave the nails rough at the edges after use, and there is no file to help alleviate that.  Get something else, these suck.</li>
            <li> I am partial to the Revlon but tried these out, they are definitely sturdy. Not sure they provide better cutting or accuracy.  They provide a straight cut which seems to be a bit rough, requires follow up.</li>
            <li> Spend money once and get these. Heavy duty. They just work.</li>
            <li> These clippers work well and they are a nice alternative to the normal standard clipprers.  They are very robust and well made</li>
            <li> I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Best clippers ever!  It took a bit to get used to these, but they are solidly built and will last a long long time</li>
            <li> It is not at all a comfortable device for cutting your nails&lt;br /&gt;You will trouble to place it and cut your nails :(&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s how it is designed then I think the target audience should be somewhere else ... :)</li>
            <li> Catalog this under T.M.I.:&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, and strong nails that aren&#x27;t very brittle and nail clippers I have owned in the past just flex and end up tearing my nails instead of cutting them. I&#x27;ve needed these for years.</li>
            <li> i was excited (well, as excited as one can be about a nail clipper) for these since i found the industrial design appealing.&lt;br /&gt;however, using them is not so easy for me, a bit painful at time. the near lack of a curve on the blades presents a problem for me...the fleshy underside of my nail gets nipped often, a problem i&#x27;ve never had with other clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the space between the blades is wider than most and these provide a solid crisp cut so they are perfect for cutting my cat&#x27;s claws.&lt;br /&gt;no joke.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I was looking for, a clipper with sharp and properly aligned blades that will cut nails cleanly. So many of the cheaper clippers left a rough or ragged edge. I don&#x27;t have to file the rough edges after I use this device.</li>
            <li> Built strong, good leverage, but rough cuts.  Overall nice clippers.</li>
            <li> These are good clippers.  They cut my stubborn nails easily.  The only issue I have with them is I wish they opened up a little more, I find it a little tricky to get some of my finger and toe nails between the clippers.</li>
            <li> great pair of finger nail clippers for ladies...they are small...so for someone with large hands they are hard to handle...would not recommend these item for men with large hands...</li>
            <li> Finally, a nail clipper that&#x27;s sturdy and performs beautifully (I only use it on my hands, the dreaded toe nail fungus causes my to revert to a small pair of wire cutters ((dykes for you old timers)) for the feet)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to chalk it up too, but these things are seriously annoying. They do not cut cleanly, I can not clip any nail and not have major filing to do after. I&#x27;ve stopped using them. I don&#x27;t know if most men (positive reviewers) aren&#x27;t picky about their nails having a flat end? I doubt that though, so the positive reviews are a mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a good looking pair of clippers, one reason i bought them, but bummed they can&#x27;t stay up to the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yea, they&#x27;re powerful, and most of what other reviews noted, but still with a choppy, scary, mechanism so to speak.</li>
            <li> This clipper is huge! I am 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; and 200lbs, and it is too big to use, even for my big toe. Wasted my money . . .</li>
            <li> Lol. I was reading the review and was not sure, but it is not that expensive, so decided to buy it for my husband and see if he likes it. He threw it to the trash. Said very not comfortable to use. Requires to much pressure to apply, which makes it harder to achieve precise results (and my husband is not the one who cares much how his nails look like..).</li>
            <li> Excellent clipper.  I would recommend.  It works well and is precise.  Even women can use it.</li>
            <li> These are way too big even for a large mans fingers. It is made in China but only marketed by ACE as an American product as familiar as the ACE comb. It was a waste of money and now being sent back to China for recycling so some other \\&quot;American Company\\&quot; can have something else made out of it.</li>
            <li> No file, clunky and big curved cutter. Save your money and buy a Revlon clipper at any drugstore or Amazon.</li>
            <li> Manliest way to clip your nails, i find i&#x27;m doing it more often too, helps not having to ask the chicks to borrow theirs :D</li>
            <li> Minority of people with disfigured toenails find that conventional clippers and other instruments promoted for use are simply not correctly sized, or way overpriced and halfway useless because of incorrect jaw size or dull, unsharpened cutters. Also, many of the people with these problems have limited flexibility. Too bad even toe doctor instruments are inadequately made nowadays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this clipper many times and it has worked well so far.  It is easy to use and it is well designed. It got to me in a very reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I have ever owned and worth the money.  Give them a try.  You will like them.</li>
            <li> The ACE cuts my fingernails flawlessly and without sharp edges. This is definitely a purchase that is worth recommending to others.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have explained how good this item is so I won&#x27;t go into too much detail.  Suffice it to say I have very sturdy fingernails often when I&#x27;m trimming, run-of-the-mill clippers will make the nail split and sort of taper off so that the clipping is not an even thickness.  Sometimes this results in accidental removal of nail below the quick (ouch!).  With the ACE clippers I don&#x27;t have that problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had my clippers for a little over 2 months, so I can&#x27;t really comment on long-term-durability.  But so far, they seem sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is very manly as well.  Have you ever used pneumatic metal shear in a shop?  You know the way the trimmed metal comes off clean?  That&#x27;s how clean your nail trimmings will come off as well.  I play guitar and these are great for trimming my nails so I can shred my axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers get the job done!  I have thick nails that other drug store clippers just wimp out.  I love these nail clippers!  They&#x27;re only missing some kind of small nail file.</li>
            <li> I needed a sharp set of nail clippers, with enough leverage to trim my tough nails.  These work great!  The quality is very good.</li>
            <li> I wanted to splurge on a buy it for life set of clippers which lead me to these but honestly they aren&#x27;t super functional.&lt;br /&gt;The gap between the blades is very small making it pretty difficultly to get nails in between. The brushed texture on the blades them selves also feel like nails on chalk boards when you don&#x27;t get it aligned. They fell great in your hand and look great, but a standard $.99 drug store set is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been needing. The others feel cheap and you have to press hard as you can to cut the nail. NOT WITH THESE.. They cut time and time again without getting dull. IF you have thick toe nail then give these babies a shot!</li>
            <li> Good hefty clipper that does not slip in your hard like most out there.&lt;br /&gt;(more stupidity in these ratings by requiring a certain number of words.)</li>
            <li> opening a little to small, but works ok</li>
            <li> These clippers are a good, well made, fingernail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;They have a wide, scored handle for good gripping and a clippings catcher&lt;br /&gt;in the front.</li>
            <li> I think that these are more suited for toenails rather than fingernails.Too big to effectively trim or cut your fingernails with.</li>
