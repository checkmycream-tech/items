            <li>The aides loved bathing and lotioning my husband because I would not allow the hospital \\&quot;generic\\&quot; wash on my husband&#x27;s body.  </li>
            <li>The defective pump by itself would be tolerable, as Amazon has good customer service and will replace a defective item.</li>
            <li>Very glad we are able to use.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend !&lt;</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I reached a point where I just stopped using any kind of body washes while showering.</li>
            <li>I liked the thicker, milker,</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing body wash, good size and great value for the money.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moist and has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love both the bar soap and the body wash Canus has created and have been using both for years.</li>
            <li>She loves it &amp; has asked me to order more of this for her friends.</li>
            <li>I love the body wash and foaming milk bath.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for better pricing.  </li>
            <li>it is lovely.</li>
            <li>It not only smelled wonderful, but it kept his skin moist and tender to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I find it equally enjoyable for myself, and I give it also to my sister on her birthday.  </li>
            <li>more viscous and more moisturizing product I used before.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love it.  </li>
            <li>We like the Orchid Oil better.</li>
            <li>The consistency is good as well, lathers pretty well too.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a very good smell on my skin and makes it softer, contrary to regular soaps that make my skin dryer.</li>
            <li>it was not unusual for a nurse to inquire what \\&quot;that wonderful</li>
            <li>This is basically a very mild and gentle cleanser with a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you have &amp;#34;alligator&amp;#34; skin like I do, this will help smooth your skin and feels fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I tried a different product or they significantly changed the formula (although I am happy to know they are not using parabens).</li>
            <li>Rinses clean.</li>
            <li>After all of the positive reviews, I thought I would love the smell, but I think it smells like a nursing home.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and was happy with it, but they must have changed the formula because it looks and smells more like a household cleaning product now.</li>
            <li>I remembered having gotten this years ago and loved it, so I decided to buy the big container to keep my skin moist during the winter.</li>
            <li>This product has allowed me to take a full shower, cleaning my legs, feet, etc.  </li>
            <li>My skin has a more normal texture and my psoriasis lesions are receding.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable foam amount, smells clean, leaves you feeling clean without overly drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>I liked the big bottle</li>
            <li>We used this for many month; however, it is becoming harder to find or is increasing in cost so were are looking for alternatives that work as well.  </li>
            <li>Keeps our skin clean and feels very stimulating after each shower.</li>
            <li>The color is yellow and it has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>But I must admin that I&#x27;d rather have no smell or a very mild natural smell (like lemon, tea tree, etc) vs. a chemical perfume addition.  </li>
            <li>I found better pricing at drugstore.com, although it is smaller bottles.  </li>
            <li>I love the matching products, such as soaps and skin creams.</li>
            <li>and my kids enjoy using it to keep their skin soft</li>
            <li>After several weeks things are so much better.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re debating this purchase, I recommend going to a store to smell it first if you can.</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely amazing, i have very sensitive skin and this soap has never made me break out, it actually has cleared up my skin which no acne medicine has ever achieved.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and does not have an oily residue feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Biggest problem is the smell, is it very hospital.  </li>
            <li>Seems to help keep our skin much clearer.</li>
            <li>My skin is more normal, not mummy-style dry.  </li>
            <li>Some may find the perfume pleasant, I certainly didn&#x27;t find it unpleasant, just way too strong.  </li>
            <li>While it is true that it does not foam as much as regular body wash, I have been using a mesh body sponge, which helps make it foam.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brand of body wash.  </li>
            <li>I will say, to their credit, that it seems to do very well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Whenever he was confined to the hospital (and that was VERY frequently in his 18 years of illness)</li>
            <li>The body wash works very well, and left my skin very soft, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>Should be marketed to provenly clear up acne.</li>
            <li>I wish I could buy direct, but I couldn&#x27;t find an online ordering system for them.  </li>
            <li>if you like the smell of an old folks home, then this is for you.</li>
            <li>I have used Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk natural fragrance body lotion for many, many years and used it daily on my husband who was very ill.  </li>
            <li>All the products are long lasting and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft and doesnt contain harsh chemicals which helps alot.</li>
            <li>Winter is here and this maybe your best choice for that dried out, painful skin.</li>

            <li> This bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin that usually itches after using regular shower gels.</li>
            <li> The body wash keeps my skin from getting dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect to replace the need for a moisturizer if you&#x27;re using it in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom, who has extremely dry skin due to medications</li>
            <li> Really not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> I was getting 2 33.6 oz bottles for less than the price of this one.  </li>
            <li> but there is very few other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I could use very little soap; no soap on my arms, truck or legs.  </li>
            <li> I am ready to order again, and I am shocked at the prices.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the smell I can&#x27;t get past.</li>
            <li> I would hate to give this up, especially with winter coming.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible psoriasis including a scalp that is completely covered with it.  </li>
            <li> Really, really bad.</li>
            <li> I had purchased it with  the lotion, but the scent was just awful.</li>

            <li> I love both the bar soap and the body wash Canus has created and have been using both for years. It keeps my skin soft and moist and has a wonderful fragrance. I purchase the small soap size for washing my face, the large bars for bathing and the body wash for showering. All the products are long lasting and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom, who has extremely dry skin due to medications she&#x27;s taking. She loves it &amp; has asked me to order more of this for her friends. Great to give as gifts for people with sensitve skin too! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Canus for several years now.  I love the body wash and foaming milk bath.  I also bought the shampoo/wash for babies.  I am ready to order again, and I am shocked at the prices.  I was getting 2 33.6 oz bottles for less than the price of this one.  I found better pricing at drugstore.com, although it is smaller bottles.  I wish I could buy direct, but I couldn&#x27;t find an online ordering system for them.  They refer you to distributors.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for better pricing.  I would hate to give this up, especially with winter coming.  The body wash keeps my skin from getting dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years. it is lovely. I love the matching products, such as soaps and skin creams.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and was happy with it, but they must have changed the formula because it looks and smells more like a household cleaning product now. The color is yellow and it has a very strong odor. Wish they hadn&#x27;t messed with the formula</li>
            <li> I have used Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk natural fragrance body lotion for many, many years and used it daily on my husband who was very ill.  Whenever he was confined to the hospital (and that was VERY frequently in his 18 years of illness) it was not unusual for a nurse to inquire what \\&quot;that wonderful aroma\\&quot; was that was coming from my husband&#x27;s room. The aides loved bathing and lotioning my husband because I would not allow the hospital \\&quot;generic\\&quot; wash on my husband&#x27;s body.  It not only smelled wonderful, but it kept his skin moist and tender to the touch.  I find it equally enjoyable for myself, and I give it also to my sister on her birthday.  I take it along with me whenever I am away from home - I just don&#x27;t want to get along without Canus Goat&#x27;s milk lotion or body wash.</li>
            <li> Ordered this after extensive research about the brand and its products. An effort well rewarded! I have a sensitive skin that usually itches after using regular shower gels. I reached a point where I just stopped using any kind of body washes while showering. This will not only not irritate your skin but it will also leave you with homey/vintag-y smell that is in no way overpowering.</li>
            <li> I remembered having gotten this years ago and loved it, so I decided to buy the big container to keep my skin moist during the winter. Maybe I tried a different product or they significantly changed the formula (although I am happy to know they are not using parabens). It&#x27;s alright stuff, but nothing to write home about. I liked the thicker, milker, more viscous and more moisturizing product I used before. This is basically a very mild and gentle cleanser with a nice fragrance. But don&#x27;t expect to replace the need for a moisturizer if you&#x27;re using it in a very dry climate. I will say, to their credit, that it seems to do very well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for the money. I refill my travel size with out a problem and I don&#x27;t always need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love it.  Very creamy and does not have an oily residue feeling on your skin.  I would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I love it! When I run out I will definitly order another one.  It makes my skin super soft and doesnt contain harsh chemicals which helps alot.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It leaves a very good smell on my skin and makes it softer, contrary to regular soaps that make my skin dryer. While it is true that it does not foam as much as regular body wash, I have been using a mesh body sponge, which helps make it foam.</li>
            <li> This is great lotion...not greasy and LOVE the scent!!  This bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely amazing, i have very sensitive skin and this soap has never made me break out, it actually has cleared up my skin which no acne medicine has ever achieved. Should be marketed to provenly clear up acne. Hint Hint</li>
            <li> Buy this every year for my kids Christmas.  I liked the big bottle and my kids enjoy using it to keep their skin soft</li>
            <li> I have terrible psoriasis including a scalp that is completely covered with it.  I had tried numerous shampoos to no avail.  Even specialized shampoos made my scalp burn from the drying process associated cleaning.  I could use very little soap; no soap on my arms, truck or legs.  This product has allowed me to take a full shower, cleaning my legs, feet, etc.  I also use it to shampoo my hair.  After several weeks things are so much better.  My skin is more normal, not mummy-style dry.  I also use the Canus goat&#x27;s milk lotion.  My skin has a more normal texture and my psoriasis lesions are receding.  I believe this product may benefit others with severe skin problems.  Not only do you have the soothing goat&#x27;s milk but there is very few other ingredients.  I compared the ingredient list on Canus&#x27; soap to an organic liquid soap.  No contest!  The list of things in the organic specialty shampoo went on and on and on.  My final  decision:  Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk body wash is soothing, protective, and uncomplicated.  Winter is here and this maybe your best choice for that dried out, painful skin.</li>
            <li> Reasonable foam amount, smells clean, leaves you feeling clean without overly drying out your skin. Rinses clean. Also, between this and the unscented lotion, my eczema is tamed.</li>
            <li> The pump on the bottle I got was defective and cracked when it arrived at the house. After all of the positive reviews, I thought I would love the smell, but I think it smells like a nursing home. Really not my cup of tea. If you&#x27;re debating this purchase, I recommend going to a store to smell it first if you can. The defective pump by itself would be tolerable, as Amazon has good customer service and will replace a defective item. It&#x27;s the smell I can&#x27;t get past.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brand of body wash.  If you have &amp;#34;alligator&amp;#34; skin like I do, this will help smooth your skin and feels fabulous.  I give this a 10 thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing body wash, good size and great value for the money.  The consistency is good as well, lathers pretty well too.  Biggest problem is the smell, is it very hospital.  if you like the smell of an old folks home, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> We used this for many month; however, it is becoming harder to find or is increasing in cost so were are looking for alternatives that work as well.  We like the Orchid Oil better.</li>
            <li> Some may find the perfume pleasant, I certainly didn&#x27;t find it unpleasant, just way too strong.  But I must admin that I&#x27;d rather have no smell or a very mild natural smell (like lemon, tea tree, etc) vs. a chemical perfume addition.  The body wash works very well, and left my skin very soft, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this. I had purchased it with  the lotion, but the scent was just awful. Really, really bad. It permeated my skin, so even when I washed it off, the scent still lingered.</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I use this body wash Twice daily, morning &amp; evening. It is wonderful. Keeps our skin clean and feels very stimulating after each shower. It is the best body wash we have ever used !! Seems to help keep our skin much clearer.Very glad we are able to use.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
