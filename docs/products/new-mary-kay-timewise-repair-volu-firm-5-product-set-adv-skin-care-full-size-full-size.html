            <li> I like the whole line of Timewise repair volu-firm.  I can see the difference in the way my skin looks and feels.  Most of my dark spots have gone away.  I use the Mary Kay primer also  and nothing works as good.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my mother in law cuz she was desperated with out them..she said her skin was sick with out these products</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and in good condition. I love this product, it really does make your skin appear younger, softer and the wrinkles are decreased. No issues at all with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mother who really wanted a new set of face creams. She really loved this set!</li>
            <li> i received this timewise repair set from mary kay.  i am still using the set...but the repair volu-firm serum ran out very quickly..i started using it 2x&#x27;s a day..but then only once a day because i wasn&#x27;t getting that much out...it ran out about a month later...i don&#x27;t know if this was used or not...i&#x27;ll be careful now of who i ordered it from</li>
            <li> Using this product for 2 years, not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy Lamer, not such good effect with its expensive price.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my favorite products at a lower price!</li>
            <li> Love the product and would have given a 5 star, but didn&#x27;t take ten years off my face.  But my skin is softer and less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> i love mary  kay make up but the serum container stops working very shortly after i  received. it has happened twice now , one i got directly from mary kay and the other i got from amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product line. I have used it for years from a private MK representative. It outperforms every product line of its kind . Mary Kay stands behind all of their products 100%.  I hope it comes to me as advertised because it saved me a great deal of money.</li>
            <li> I have used some of the most expensive skin product lines over the years, 65 now, and a month a go I purchased this kit.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed at the results in just a few short weeks. Other friends and family have commented on how great my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first because I had used Mary Kay many many years ago and was not pleased. The products have improved, are FDA approved, no cancer causing petroleum and I especially love the lip balm.</li>
            <li> My wife has used Mary Kay products for years, and she simply loves these.  The value of this package is great.</li>
            <li> This product is not what is advertised.  It is a different product.</li>
            <li> I am unable to give this repair set with more than two stars.  I started using it in mid-December and within a month my face was breaking out.  After reading other reviews it very well may have been old?  It didn&#x27;t give me the results I felt I would get after a friend recommended it.  I went back to my MK Timewise Miracle Set and within a week my skin went back to a healthy glow and no pimple break outs!</li>
