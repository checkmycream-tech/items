            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will buy more.</li>
            <li>Good luck!ed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is good but not as good as this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good with it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about 12, but 8 is good in my book, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since L&#x27;Oreal stopped making &amp;#34;Ideal Balance&amp;#34; liquid makeup, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good replacement.</li>
            <li>Good coverage even at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Feels light but provides excellent blended coverage.</li>
            <li>It looked great and had a nice matte finish hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*A good medium buildable coverage</li>
            <li>I’ve tried foundations from just about every drugstore brand except, surprisingly, L’Oreal.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, as good as my clinique!</li>
            <li>I am super impressed!</li>
            <li>I believe the perfect shade for me would have been right between the two, but I picked up Ivory.  </li>
            <li>I mix some liquid highlighter to this foundation to give it more of a glow!</li>
            <li>I love the way this applies!  </li>
            <li>This has easily become my favorite foundation!!</li>
            <li>This is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Despite this, I still liked how the foundation wore on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>the package design itself looks really nice.  </li>
            <li>In addition to the breakouts I was also noticing how much dryer my skin has felt and looks, and my pores are incredibly clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition to the breakouts I was also noticing how much dryer my skin has felt and looks, and my pores are incredibly clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good coverage with pretty good staying power.</li>
            <li>It has good full coverage</li>
            <li>I have super fair skin with hints of rosacea and visible veins.</li>
            <li>think this is a great foundation for those who want a nice matte finish and have normal skin.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to give flawless coverage, but it was cakey and settled into my pores and looked just gross.  </li>
            <li>Gradually, more and more whiteheads started appearing.</li>
            <li>Gradually, more and more whiteheads started appearing.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>such an amazing foundation!!!</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this</li>
            <li>I got this foundation because it had rave reviews from makeup artists who chose it as one of their all time favorite drug store foundations</li>
            <li>That could just be because of how I apply it myself, but I found that using a damp beauty blender helps spread the product more efficiently without it drying before I can get it where it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this makeup.</li>
            <li>Loreal infallible provided outstanding coverage.  </li>
            <li>I love how lightweight and non-greasy it feels on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that it’s in squeeze tube and</li>
            <li>I just wish they would come out with more in-between colors.</li>
            <li>may be good for oily skin too if you&#x27;re not acne prone and already using oil-free acne products because this stuff is somehow pretty drying.</li>
            <li>The good news is that you will get good coverage and a matt appearance that lasts through your entire day.</li>
            <li>The consistency is really light, almost gel like, but creamy and seemed to blend into my skin really nicely leaving a true matte finish.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth look this cover up gives</li>
            <li>It last all day, it&#x27;s super light weight, its buildable, the coverage is awesome and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>Easy to remove.</li>
            <li>One thing I really love about this product is that it feels more like a BB cream than a foundation with how light it is, yet it still provides adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>and it holds it&#x27;s own against some of the higher end products as well.</li>
            <li>Great foundation if you are looking for a matte finish without the cakey results of standard matte foundations.</li>
            <li>I found stipling with a damp heavy make up sponge works best.</li>
            <li>It really is as light as a feather and feels like a dream going on.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great matte foundation.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite foundation!</li>
            <li>It does give great coverage for being so light-weight, and the coverage is also slightly buildable for more troublesome spots.  </li>
            <li>I did use a primer (Magic Lumi) first.</li>
            <li>It blended pretty seamlessly with my super pale/translucent type skin tone, and the coverage was great for my blemishes</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Matte Foundation is good, but you&#x27;d better be quick with the application, or you will be left with a mess you will not be happy with at all.</li>
            <li>The dampness from the Beauty Blender really helps with this, and allows for some more time before it dries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now 8 hours later and it still looks good</li>
            <li>It provides medium coverage and is true to it&#x27;s word in that it&#x27;s a matte finish.</li>
            <li>It was too light, but happily it oxidized slightly throughout the day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, long lasting foundation, and the packaging is nice to look at on my cosmetic organizer.</li>
            <li>(Super Stay - which doesn&#x27;t stay and oxidizes).</li>
            <li>I mix it with a more dewy foundation and it works a better but not enough to repurchase.</li>
            <li>Skin type: normal/combination, mild acne</li>
            <li>Better than any high end foundation that says it controls oil.  </li>
            <li>I love this foundation came in just 2 days to New York</li>
            <li>Long Lasting, great coverage and texture; I would buy this again!</li>
            <li>Stays matte but looks really healthy, very natural in both appearance and feel.</li>
            <li>This is the first makeup I used that gave me pore issues!</li>
            <li>I hope they never discontinue this as I have finally found a foundation I love!</li>
            <li>I thought if it really was as fantastic as people all over the Internet are saying.</li>
            <li>It also helps to make the foundation look more natural.</li>
            <li>Complete coverage (no redness or veins visible) and way better than what I was using</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the 12 dollars.</li>
            <li>I had to find the right color</li>
            <li>The ivory shade is perfect for pale skin, I like it even better than Revlon Colorstay (my previous go-to drugstore choice).</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed, though, was that finding the right shade would be tricky.  </li>
            <li>Works awesome for her, especially because her skin is so pale.</li>
            <li>First off, I didn&#x27;t buy this foundation via Amazonbecause</li>
            <li>foundation seemed like it was heaven sent at first.</li>
            <li>This is the first time trying this foundation</li>
            <li>But overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li>So when Wal-Mart finally got it in stock and before my coupon expired, I bought it to try out and am pretty pleased.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not for everyone and it most certainly isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not for everyone and it most certainly isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>Now the real test for me will be when it heats up outside and the humidity is back, if it stays on well then, that will be amazing!</li>
            <li>First pro is that it keeps shine and oil at bay really really well.</li>
            <li>Most make me too oily throughout the day and others cling on to every flaw, line, or dry patch and end up pooling in my pores, yuck.</li>
            <li>dry areas will become more noticeable</li>
            <li>(I recently fell in love with a new one from Physicians Formula, which I reviewed here:</li>
            <li>Really matte.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame because I really hoped that this would work for me, but at this point I won&#x27;t risk breaking out again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame because I really hoped that this would work for me, but at this point I won&#x27;t risk breaking out again.</li>
            <li>It dries fast but does not take much.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is quite oily, so this drier foundation really helps to control that issue I have of my face melting off in humid weather.</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation for combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it really stays on well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>so that makes it more comparable to other picks.  </li>
            <li>nice but settled in small lines</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s matte, oil free and keeps the oils at bay, it has made my chin area dry and is causing some breakouts&lt;br /&gt;*Any</li>
            <li>I bought the shade Classic Ivory (which is the lightest shade) at CVS for $11.99.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the color selection isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>Make sure you moisturize your face a little bit before applying.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also  kind of hard to tell the difference between shades</li>
            <li>Also, most foundations slide off after a few hours or oxidize and turn orange on my face.  </li>
            <li>Although my previous HG foundation, Revlon Colorstay, gave great coverage, it felt heavy and tacky.  </li>
            <li>Does not sweat off (I live in Texas), does not accentuate pores, does not turn orange, not thick, and does not wear off during day</li>
            <li>I have extremely light skin with very pink undertones</li>
            <li>After applying a light layer of this foundation I just go over my more troubled areas with a concealer</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not even sure what demi matte is since i usually dont wear matte foundations</li>
            <li>I wanted to see the color selection in person, even though I&#x27;m typically the lightest or second to lightest shade in most drugstore foundations.</li>
            <li>With the brushes it felt like it was just sitting on top of my skin and leaned toward the cakey side, despite how little product I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this foundation along with the corresponding powder for a total of 3 days until I noticed the breakouts.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a damp beauty blender, and it gives me that soft Demi matte finish.</li>
            <li>The Pro-Matte foundation from L’Oreal keeps my skin feeling soft and velvety.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and it helps blur pores.  </li>
            <li>May not be appropriate for people with very dry skin due to its matte finish.</li>
            <li>And, it dries almost instantly -- I mean really fast, so you will have one heck of a time blending to get a smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve tried a few other drug store matte foundations since trying this one and honestly</li>
            <li>However, because of this it really makes the skin look flat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it especially for my oily skin girls.</li>
            <li>Light, takes very little.</li>
            <li>If you have normal to oily skin you should definitely give this a go.</li>
            <li>It is a little tricky to put on because it dries quickly on your face even if you use lotion.</li>
            <li>If you are not careful to apply a moisutrizer and/or a primer, it can really exaggerate the appearance of your pores and any dry patches you might have.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t recommend it because it&#x27;s so hard to get a smooth look.</li>
            <li>Goes on blotchy and leaves you looking like your pores are craters... is long lasting and very matte.  </li>
            <li>Very drying and made my face  feel uncomfortably tight</li>
            <li>foundation DOES last, but I think it lasts a little too much in</li>

            <li> It blended pretty seamlessly with my super pale/translucent type skin tone, and the coverage was great for my blemishes</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Matte Foundation is good, but you&#x27;d better be quick with the application, or you will be left with a mess you will not be happy with at all.</li>
            <li> The dampness from the Beauty Blender really helps with this, and allows for some more time before it dries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now 8 hours later and it still looks good</li>
            <li> It provides medium coverage and is true to it&#x27;s word in that it&#x27;s a matte finish.</li>
            <li> It was too light, but happily it oxidized slightly throughout the day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, long lasting foundation, and the packaging is nice to look at on my cosmetic organizer.</li>
            <li> (Super Stay - which doesn&#x27;t stay and oxidizes).</li>
            <li> I mix it with a more dewy foundation and it works a better but not enough to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Skin type: normal/combination, mild acne</li>
            <li> Better than any high end foundation that says it controls oil.  </li>
            <li> I love this foundation came in just 2 days to New York</li>
            <li> Long Lasting, great coverage and texture; I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> Stays matte but looks really healthy, very natural in both appearance and feel.</li>
            <li> This is the first makeup I used that gave me pore issues!</li>
            <li> I hope they never discontinue this as I have finally found a foundation I love!</li>
            <li> I thought if it really was as fantastic as people all over the Internet are saying.</li>
            <li> It also helps to make the foundation look more natural.</li>
            <li> Complete coverage (no redness or veins visible) and way better than what I was using</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the 12 dollars.</li>
            <li> I had to find the right color</li>
            <li> The ivory shade is perfect for pale skin, I like it even better than Revlon Colorstay (my previous go-to drugstore choice).</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed, though, was that finding the right shade would be tricky.  </li>
            <li> Works awesome for her, especially because her skin is so pale.</li>
            <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t buy this foundation via Amazonbecause</li>
            <li> foundation seemed like it was heaven sent at first.</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying this foundation</li>
            <li> But overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li> So when Wal-Mart finally got it in stock and before my coupon expired, I bought it to try out and am pretty pleased.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not for everyone and it most certainly isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not for everyone and it most certainly isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Now the real test for me will be when it heats up outside and the humidity is back, if it stays on well then, that will be amazing!</li>
            <li> First pro is that it keeps shine and oil at bay really really well.</li>
            <li> Most make me too oily throughout the day and others cling on to every flaw, line, or dry patch and end up pooling in my pores, yuck.</li>
            <li> dry areas will become more noticeable</li>
            <li> (I recently fell in love with a new one from Physicians Formula, which I reviewed here:</li>
            <li> Really matte.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame because I really hoped that this would work for me, but at this point I won&#x27;t risk breaking out again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame because I really hoped that this would work for me, but at this point I won&#x27;t risk breaking out again.</li>
            <li> It dries fast but does not take much.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is quite oily, so this drier foundation really helps to control that issue I have of my face melting off in humid weather.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation for combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it really stays on well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> so that makes it more comparable to other picks.  </li>
            <li> nice but settled in small lines</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s matte, oil free and keeps the oils at bay, it has made my chin area dry and is causing some breakouts&lt;br /&gt;*Any</li>
            <li> I bought the shade Classic Ivory (which is the lightest shade) at CVS for $11.99.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the color selection isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Make sure you moisturize your face a little bit before applying.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also  kind of hard to tell the difference between shades</li>
            <li> Also, most foundations slide off after a few hours or oxidize and turn orange on my face.  </li>
            <li> Although my previous HG foundation, Revlon Colorstay, gave great coverage, it felt heavy and tacky.  </li>
            <li> Does not sweat off (I live in Texas), does not accentuate pores, does not turn orange, not thick, and does not wear off during day</li>
            <li> I have extremely light skin with very pink undertones</li>
            <li> After applying a light layer of this foundation I just go over my more troubled areas with a concealer</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not even sure what demi matte is since i usually dont wear matte foundations</li>
            <li> I wanted to see the color selection in person, even though I&#x27;m typically the lightest or second to lightest shade in most drugstore foundations.</li>
            <li> With the brushes it felt like it was just sitting on top of my skin and leaned toward the cakey side, despite how little product I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this foundation along with the corresponding powder for a total of 3 days until I noticed the breakouts.</li>
            <li> I apply it with a damp beauty blender, and it gives me that soft Demi matte finish.</li>
            <li> The Pro-Matte foundation from L’Oreal keeps my skin feeling soft and velvety.  </li>
            <li> It looks natural and it helps blur pores.  </li>
            <li> May not be appropriate for people with very dry skin due to its matte finish.</li>
            <li> And, it dries almost instantly -- I mean really fast, so you will have one heck of a time blending to get a smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried a few other drug store matte foundations since trying this one and honestly</li>
            <li> However, because of this it really makes the skin look flat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it especially for my oily skin girls.</li>
            <li> Light, takes very little.</li>
            <li> If you have normal to oily skin you should definitely give this a go.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to put on because it dries quickly on your face even if you use lotion.</li>
            <li> If you are not careful to apply a moisutrizer and/or a primer, it can really exaggerate the appearance of your pores and any dry patches you might have.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t recommend it because it&#x27;s so hard to get a smooth look.</li>
            <li> Goes on blotchy and leaves you looking like your pores are craters... is long lasting and very matte.  </li>
            <li> Very drying and made my face  feel uncomfortably tight</li>
            <li> foundation DOES last, but I think it lasts a little too much in</li>
            <li> foundation DOES last, but I think it lasts a little too much in</li>
            <li> color was right on point, and doesn&#x27;t have that strange pinky-orange tint that a lot of foundations I tend to buy usually have.</li>
            <li> I get the usual hormonal few every month, but they are easily combated.</li>
            <li> I get the usual hormonal few every month, but they are easily combated.</li>
            <li> I am older and need a little moisturizer no matter which brand of make-up</li>
            <li> The only downfall is if your skin is a little dry, it really shows the dry skin areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried applying it a number of ways: with RealTecnique&#x27;s Expert Face Brush, my fingers, a flat foundation brush, and a Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*You&#x27;ll definitely need to use a damp sponge (or everyone&#x27;s fave, the BB) for easier application as it does dry fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was neither long wearing, or matte on my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry, flaky or patchy skin - skip it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Any matte foundation is probably not for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t settle in my dry patches!</li>
            <li> It lasted all day with only a slight oliness around the the T zone, but the foundation stayed put.  </li>
            <li> Ivory looked too light, but 102 Shell Beige looked too dark and with the wrong undertones.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not nearly as oily looking as with other foundations.</li>
            <li> although I feel like it also fades a little, especially around my acne spots.  </li>
            <li> I have broken capillaries on my face, one is large and ugly that I can see through most foundations that I try.  </li>
            <li> These are proving much harder to get cleared up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are proving much harder to get cleared up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it just sinks into my pores.</li>
            <li> It broke up on my t-zone after only a few hours.  </li>
            <li> :  too many :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And especially cause I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin but hate the stickiness and heaviness of other full coverage foundations, then I definitely recommend giving this a try.  </li>
            <li> This foundation dries EXTREMELY fast, making it difficult to blend before it dries.</li>

            <li> That is the only big downside, other than that, the only other bad thing I can think of to say is that it dries faster than I&#x27;d like it to while applying.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to find a foundation that isn&#x27;t too dark or that doesn&#x27;t make my skin look yellow, and I finally found something that works.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s SO matte in fact that even highlighter (I use Kevyn Aucoin&#x27;s Celestial Powder) hardly shows up and doesn&#x27;t produce the desired glow I typically have when using it with other foundations.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days before posting this review.  </li>
            <li> Too dry and very hard to blend.</li>

            <li> Usually matte has a moisturizer but this does not..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am so impressed! The best drugstore foundation and it holds it&#x27;s own against some of the higher end products as well. If you have normal to oily skin you should definitely give this a go. If you have dry, flaky or patchy skin - skip it. The foundation dries nicely, no stickiness whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually give one star, but this makeup was horrible.  It is supposed to give flawless coverage, but it was cakey and settled into my pores and looked just gross.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t buy this foundation via Amazonbecause I wanted to see the color selection in person, even though I&#x27;m typically the lightest or second to lightest shade in most drugstore foundations. That being said, I wanted to review this product anyway. I bought the shade Classic Ivory (which is the lightest shade) at CVS for $11.99. The price wasn&#x27;t too bad I thought if it really was as fantastic as people all over the Internet are saying. Lately my foundations just haven&#x27;t been doing it for me. Most make me too oily throughout the day and others cling on to every flaw, line, or dry patch and end up pooling in my pores, yuck. Needless to say I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation seemed like it was heaven sent at first. The consistency is really light, almost gel like, but creamy and seemed to blend into my skin really nicely leaving a true matte finish. Really matte. Seriously matte. This is got its pros and cons. First pro is that it keeps shine and oil at bay really really well. However, because of this it really makes the skin look flat. It&#x27;s almost too matte for my taste. It&#x27;s SO matte in fact that even highlighter (I use Kevyn Aucoin&#x27;s Celestial Powder) hardly shows up and doesn&#x27;t produce the desired glow I typically have when using it with other foundations. Despite this, I still liked how the foundation wore on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried applying it a number of ways: with RealTecnique&#x27;s Expert Face Brush, my fingers, a flat foundation brush, and a Beauty Blender. I&#x27;d say I had the best result with the Beauty Blender since its best used damp. This foundation dries EXTREMELY fast, making it difficult to blend before it dries. The dampness from the Beauty Blender really helps with this, and allows for some more time before it dries. It also helps to make the foundation look more natural. With the brushes it felt like it was just sitting on top of my skin and leaned toward the cakey side, despite how little product I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this foundation along with the corresponding powder for a total of 3 days until I noticed the breakouts. Gradually, more and more whiteheads started appearing. It took about two days total until I started getting deep cystic pimples around my chin, jawline, and in the softer tissue on either side of my nose below my eyes. In addition to the breakouts I was also noticing how much dryer my skin has felt and looks, and my pores are incredibly clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation DOES last, but I think it lasts a little too much in that it reminds in your pores even after cleansing. I use the Luna Mini and even that was no match for the staying power of this foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not worn makeup in 3 days now, and the breakouts have been persisting. Whatever is in this formula to make it stay is not good for my skin AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame because I really hoped that this would work for me, but at this point I won&#x27;t risk breaking out again. I&#x27;m 32 and am in no mood for acne like this. I didn&#x27;t even have breakouts like this when I was a teen. I get the usual hormonal few every month, but they are easily combated. These are proving much harder to get cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are prone to acne, and clogged pores, be weary. It&#x27;s definitely not for everyone and it most certainly isn&#x27;t for me.

            <li> This is the first time trying this foundation and I love it. It gives me a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> This is simply amazing. Does not sweat off (I live in Texas), does not accentuate pores, does not turn orange, not thick, and does not wear off during day (I have been wearing it for over 12 hours).Photographs well too. I did use a primer (Magic Lumi) first. I applied it with my fingers over the primer. It dries fast but does not take much. I have super fair skin with hints of rosacea and visible veins. Complete coverage (no redness or veins visible) and way better than what I was using (Super Stay - which doesn&#x27;t stay and oxidizes). Infallible - not sure, flawless - yes. Pricier than what I was using but well worth it.</li>
            <li> such an amazing foundation!!! I am super impressed! I mix some liquid highlighter to this foundation to give it more of a glow!</li>
            <li> Staying power is there and a perfect color match but it just sinks into my pores. This is the first makeup I used that gave me pore issues! I mix it with a more dewy foundation and it works a better but not enough to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days before posting this review.  But I LOVE IT!!!!!!  I have very oily skin.  And this has always been a struggle.  And I was using NYX foundation for awhile and it is good but not as good as this.  I had to find the right color and I apply it with my hands since my face seems to break out with a foundation brush.  I&#x27;m good with it.  But it definitely controls my oil.  I&#x27;m happy to find this.  Better than any high end foundation that says it controls oil.  I highly recommend it especially for my oily skin girls.</li>
            <li> item came in a terrible state&lt;br /&gt;very iced&lt;br /&gt;how such a thing can be sold?</li>
            <li> Love the smooth look this cover up gives</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin like me this is a wonderful foundation, I am very pleased with it. It&#x27;s now 8 hours later and it still looks good and I&#x27;m not nearly as oily looking as with other foundations. I used my foundation brush and it was perfect. Worth the 12 dollars. And especially cause I have very pale skin and the ivory is just about perfect with my skin tone! I hope they never discontinue this as I have finally found a foundation I love!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this but it was so hard to blend. It has good full coverage but I can&#x27;t recommend it because it&#x27;s so hard to get a smooth look.</li>
            <li> Silky texture and great wear.  Great foundation if you are looking for a matte finish without the cakey results of standard matte foundations.</li>
            <li> Add a little moisturizer and it&#x27;s probably the best make up I&#x27;ve ever used. I am older and need a little moisturizer no matter which brand of make-up I use. Just wish there was uv protection, Still the best coverage and still very light</li>
            <li> Too dry and very hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I got this foundation because it had rave reviews from makeup artists who chose it as one of their all time favorite drug store foundations and I definitely see why. My skin is quite oily, so this drier foundation really helps to control that issue I have of my face melting off in humid weather. It doesn&#x27;t sink into lines on my face, but if you have a little face fuzz, it will cling to it like your mustache is it&#x27;s mother. That is the only big downside, other than that, the only other bad thing I can think of to say is that it dries faster than I&#x27;d like it to while applying. That could just be because of how I apply it myself, but I found that using a damp beauty blender helps spread the product more efficiently without it drying before I can get it where it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was right on point, and doesn&#x27;t have that strange pinky-orange tint that a lot of foundations I tend to buy usually have. It blended pretty seamlessly with my super pale/translucent type skin tone, and the coverage was great for my blemishes I tend to get around my jaw line and mouth/chin area It&#x27;s a great, long lasting foundation, and the packaging is nice to look at on my cosmetic organizer. I will be buying again, even though it looks like I won&#x27;t have to buy it too often, because one application lasts me 8+ hrs...I don&#x27;t know about 12, but 8 is good in my book, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I included a before/after picture (naked face with blemishes vs. Loreal Infallible Pro Matte foundation)</li>
            <li> Since L&#x27;Oreal stopped making &amp;#34;Ideal Balance&amp;#34; liquid makeup, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good replacement. This is excellent. Good coverage even at the end of the day. No oily shine. Feels light but provides excellent blended coverage. Works well with L&#x27;Oreal powder. Easy to remove. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup. Light, takes very little. I use it with a Primer. Hides imperfections!!</li>
            <li> Long Lasting, great coverage and texture; I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> nice but settled in small lines</li>
            <li> This has easily become my favorite foundation!! It last all day, it&#x27;s super light weight, its buildable, the coverage is awesome and it&#x27;s cheap! I have dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t settle in my dry patches! I apply it with a damp beauty blender, and it gives me that soft Demi matte finish. I definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> bought this for my sister. Works awesome for her, especially because her skin is so pale. Only issue is that the package was delayed.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation for combination/oily skin. It looked great and had a nice matte finish hours after I applied it. It is a little tricky to put on because it dries quickly on your face even if you use lotion. I found stipling with a damp heavy make up sponge works best. My only complaint is that the color selection isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Skin type: normal/combination, mild acne prone skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;*A good medium buildable coverage&lt;br /&gt;*Definitely matte (or demi-matte ..but I&#x27;m not even sure what demi matte is since i usually dont wear matte foundations and it&#x27;s been a while)&lt;br /&gt;*Long lasting (through sweat!)&lt;br /&gt;*No signs of oil seeping through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  too many :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*While it&#x27;s matte, oil free and keeps the oils at bay, it has made my chin area dry and is causing some breakouts&lt;br /&gt;*Any dry areas will become more noticeable&lt;br /&gt;*Color is a little lighter than you would think and it&#x27;s also  kind of hard to tell the difference between shades&lt;br /&gt;*You&#x27;ll definitely need to use a damp sponge (or everyone&#x27;s fave, the BB) for easier application as it does dry fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great foundation for those who want a nice matte finish and have normal skin. may be good for oily skin too if you&#x27;re not acne prone and already using oil-free acne products because this stuff is somehow pretty drying.</li>
            <li> Usually matte has a moisturizer but this does not..</li>
            <li> This was neither long wearing, or matte on my oily skin.  It broke up on my t-zone after only a few hours.  I tried it several times with different application techniques and with and without a primer.</li>
            <li> Goes on blotchy and leaves you looking like your pores are craters... is long lasting and very matte.  i prefer&lt;br /&gt;Kat Von D Lock and Load Foundation...</li>
            <li> I love this foundation came in just 2 days to New York</li>
            <li> For a drug store foundation, this is great. Good coverage with pretty good staying power. It will crease after awhile but so does my expensive foundations. May not be appropriate for people with very dry skin due to its matte finish.</li>
            <li> Very nice. The only downfall is if your skin is a little dry, it really shows the dry skin areas. Make sure you moisturize your face a little bit before applying. Otherwise, it really stays on well. Now the real test for me will be when it heats up outside and the humidity is back, if it stays on well then, that will be amazing! I feel like it could cost a lil less than what it does. But overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have extremely light skin with very pink undertones so it&#x27;s difficult to find a foundation that isn&#x27;t too dark or that doesn&#x27;t make my skin look yellow, and I finally found something that works. I use the lightest shade and it suits my skintone perfectly. It provides medium coverage and is true to it&#x27;s word in that it&#x27;s a matte finish. After applying a light layer of this foundation I just go over my more troubled areas with a concealer and I&#x27;m ready to go. One thing I really love about this product is that it feels more like a BB cream than a foundation with how light it is, yet it still provides adequate coverage.</li>
            <li> My new favorite foundation! Stays matte but looks really healthy, very natural in both appearance and feel. I have dry/sometimes combo skin, did not need to set with powder. The ivory shade is perfect for pale skin, I like it even better than Revlon Colorstay (my previous go-to drugstore choice).</li>
            <li> Very drying and made my face  feel uncomfortably tight</li>
            <li> Love this product, as good as my clinique!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Matte Foundation is good, but you&#x27;d better be quick with the application, or you will be left with a mess you will not be happy with at all. If you are not careful to apply a moisutrizer and/or a primer, it can really exaggerate the appearance of your pores and any dry patches you might have. And, it dries almost instantly -- I mean really fast, so you will have one heck of a time blending to get a smooth appearance. The good news is that you will get good coverage and a matt appearance that lasts through your entire day. It&#x27;s a good product, and the trick is in the application!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and Roscea.  I have broken capillaries on my face, one is large and ugly that I can see through most foundations that I try.  Also, most foundations slide off after a few hours or oxidize and turn orange on my face.  Loreal infallible provided outstanding coverage.  I was completely amazed, absolutely no redness showed through it.  It lasted all day with only a slight oliness around the the T zone, but the foundation stayed put.  It did not lose it&#x27;s staying power and it did not lose its color.  Any matte foundation is probably not for people with dry skin. Personally for me?  I think this stuff is a miracle.</li>
            <li> 4.5 Stars  **Update**  So I&#x27;ve tried a few other drug store matte foundations since trying this one and honestly, none compare!  This is the only foundation that keeps my oily skin under control and I&#x27;m so impressed!  This is my HG!**  I’ve tried foundations from just about every drugstore brand except, surprisingly, L’Oreal.  I’ve used liners and mascaras and lip colors from this brand, but have never come across a foundation that appealed to me.  However, when they introduced this Pro-Matte line, my ears perked up and my interest peaked.  Having oily/combo skin, I am always on the lookout for foundations that claim to minimize shine and control oil.  So when Wal-Mart finally got it in stock and before my coupon expired, I bought it to try out and am pretty pleased.  The first thing I noticed, though, was that finding the right shade would be tricky.  101 Ivory looked too light, but 102 Shell Beige looked too dark and with the wrong undertones.  I believe the perfect shade for me would have been right between the two, but I picked up Ivory.  It was too light, but happily it oxidized slightly throughout the day so it came closer to my skin color, though still not perfect.  I love the way this applies!  It really is as light as a feather and feels like a dream going on.  Although my previous HG foundation, Revlon Colorstay, gave great coverage, it felt heavy and tacky.  The Pro-Matte foundation from L’Oreal keeps my skin feeling soft and velvety.  It looks natural and it helps blur pores.  It does give great coverage for being so light-weight, and the coverage is also slightly buildable for more troublesome spots.  It does stay matte all day (I set it with Physicians Formula 100% Natural Origins Powder and thin E.L.F Studio powder in Luminous) although I feel like it also fades a little, especially around my acne spots.  Overall, I think this is a great matte foundation.  I love how lightweight and non-greasy it feels on the skin.  I love that it’s in squeeze tube and the package design itself looks really nice.  If you have oily skin but hate the stickiness and heaviness of other full coverage foundations, then I definitely recommend giving this a try.  While it is on the higher price range among drugstore foundations, there are coupons from Red Plum ever week (usually for $2 or $3 off) so that makes it more comparable to other picks.  This isn’t my HG foundation (I recently fell in love with a new one from Physicians Formula, which I reviewed here: http://www.amazon.com/Physicians-Formula-Glowing-Foundation-Light/dp/B00RGDZJJG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424394866&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;Physicians+Formula+Nude+Wear+Glowing+Nude+Foundation) but it’s a close second, I think replacing Revlon Colorstay (gasp! I never thought I’d see the day!).  I just wish they would come out with more in-between colors.</li>
