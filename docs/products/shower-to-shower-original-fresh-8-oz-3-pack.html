I JUST FEEL FRESHER WHEN I USE IT ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMERTIME. I DO RECOMMEND THIS POWDER. FAST SHIPPING. YES, IT IS HARDER THESE DAYS TO FIND IN STORES BUT NO REASON TO JACK UP THE PRICE.</li>

            <li> I regret buying the triple pack because the smell is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Been using this powder for years and I love it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> i was very dissapointed. It was not what i grew up with. The smell is totally different and i&#x27;m not happy. In fact, i don&#x27;t even use it. it&#x27;s just sitting here all three bottles. Sad!</li>
            <li> Do not buy Shower To Shower Absorbent Body Powder-Original Fresh-8 or 16 oz  from the  sellers that have jacked up the price 2 to 3 times the regular price. The 8 oz should sell for 2.99 and the 16 oz for 4.49. Go to the Shower to Shower web site to get the regular prices.</li>
