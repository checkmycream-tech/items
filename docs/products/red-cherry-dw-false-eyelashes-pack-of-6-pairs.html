            <li> but if you have thick lashes these will give you a little extra something.  </li>
            <li> Wear them almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> save your money and your trouble.</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday and</li>
            <li> Normally I always buy Ardell&#x27;s #DW from Sally&#x27;s, but at $5 a pair it gets expensive for me because I wear false lashes every single day.</li>
            <li> Also, the strip of these lashes are very thin, giving it a seamless appearance.</li>
            <li> they were dried out and broken off ...</li>
            <li> I find, for me, they are a bit too thin and wispy</li>
            <li> Not a great shape, was disappointed by these.</li>
            <li> You are getting volume and length without it being crazy and you get that cat eye effect.</li>
            <li> but they were in horrible condition!</li>

            <li> I love these lashes.  They are very natural looking when on, most people are surprised I&#x27;m wearing lashes.  They also last a long time if taken care of properly.  No additional mascara is needed... They&#x27;re fabulous!</li>
            <li> Red Cherry DW&#x27;s are my favorite lasesh! Great for everyday ues. I&#x27;m able to wear them 7-8 times before having to toss them. Very inexpensive for the quanitity. Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> Very nice lashes, quick delivery, will order again. Very whisper not too thick, more of a day time look.</li>
            <li> These are cute .. Not my favorite out of the red cherry line which I&#x27;m usually obsessed with. It&#x27;s a very wispy looking lash but they aren&#x27;t that long. They are great for everyday use but not lashes I would wear to a special event.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just in love with these lashes&lt;br /&gt;For every day use&lt;br /&gt;Thanx</li>
            <li> My favorite lashes by far!  Wear them almost everyday.  Natural looking with a little extra umph!!! I highly recommend these lashes</li>
            <li> I love these lashes especially for smaller eyes, they fit perfectly. You are getting volume and length without it being crazy and you get that cat eye effect. Love&#x27;em</li>
            <li> these came in fast but they were in horrible condition! they were dried out and broken off ...looks like from improper storage. I couldn&#x27;t use any of them they were so damaged . I was disappointed because usually red cherry is a really great brand. save your money and your trouble. go with something else or you&#x27;ll regret it</li>
            <li> I bought these looking to save money. Normally I always buy Ardell&#x27;s #DW from Sally&#x27;s, but at $5 a pair it gets expensive for me because I wear false lashes every single day. I bought these after reading the reviews and hearing good things about Red Cherry. These lashes are good quality and they are inexpensive, but these do not compare to Adrell&#x27;s lashes in look. I find these to be more natural looking from Adrell&#x27;s Demi Wispies. I will not be repurchasing #DW from Red Cherry, but I will be trying over styles from  Red Cherry.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful,soft and lush. Very dramatic without being over the top. Very good for everyday looks if you have small lashes. Also very easy to put on and do not show up in pictures as fake lashes. I will definitely order more, however I will look for a cheaper price, worth the money but Still.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are awesome I wear them everyday and no one can believe that they&#x27;re not really mine. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. They are easy to apply and look so natural but add length and fullness to any look. I wear them at least three times a week and use them on my clients more often than any other lashes.</li>
            <li> best falsh eyelashes ever!  easy to apply, and ends won&#x27;t curl up</li>
            <li> I love #DW because they look beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> Love Red Cherry Lashes</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THESE LASHES QUICKLY. I THINK IT ONLY TOOK A WEEK IF THAT. ANYWAY WHEN I RECEIVED THEM THEY WERE IN AMAZING SHAPE THE PACKAGING IS NICE BECAUSE YOU CAN USE IT TO PUT THEM BACK IN IT. YOU CAN LITERALLY GET 20-25 USES OUT OF THEM IF YOU TAKE CARE OF THEM CORRECTLY. I LOVE THEM. THE BAN IS AMAZING. THEY ARE JUST BEAUTIFUL LASHES. DEFINITELY WOULD RE-PURCHASE AND WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE.</li>
            <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Like what I want</li>
            <li> They are not as comfortable to wear the band was not as soft as I prefer they are very nice other than that</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t like The way they look in person. Besides it appear as if the lashes were mismatch! !</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lashes because it looks very real. I have natural bushy/curly lashes and these looked so natural on my eyes. If you have very curly and or bushy lashes, I would recommend this for you. Also, the strip of these lashes are very thin, giving it a seamless appearance. 4 stars because I wish it was a bit fuller. However, it is perfect for a realistic everyday look.</li>
            <li> Amazing lashes♡ &amp;&amp; Such an awesome deal! These lashes are perfect for everyday wear because they are not too flashy, but will compliment your eyes to still make them stand out without looking fake!</li>
            <li> LOVE&#x27;EM!!! These are great!! I double them up but if you have thick lashes these will give you a little extra something.  Great for daily wear.  I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Red Cherry makes the best lashes you can buy, However The #DW are not my faves. I find, for me, they are a bit too thin and wispy If you have long thick natural lashes these will be great for you but I do not. I have very straight, short and thin lashes so these are not ideal for me. My faves are the #48....check them out too! They give me a big open eyed look, they are the perfect thickness and curl for me. These are worth a try tho and I just wore mine yesterday but like I said they are not my faves..</li>
            <li> The only lashes I&#x27;d wear.</li>
            <li> Love! ! Perfect length</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! No need to trim them down, they fit perfectly and aren&#x27;t too long, so they don&#x27;t look overly dramatic</li>
            <li> An amazing set of lashes, maybe not so natural but definantly beautiful for making the eyes pop. Great value for 6 and great delivery time. Will definantly order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ardell lashes for about a year and I tried these because they were on sale and I love this brand! The DW is similar to the Ardell demi wispers, but trust me this is a superior product. This looks as natural as individual lashes. They are very short and appropriate for everyday use. If you are look to add edge into your look, try Red Cherry #43.</li>
            <li> Love love love! The shipping was so fast and the falsies are everything I expected them to be, defiantly recommend it</li>
            <li> easy to put on, good fit. lashers could be shorter</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. Not a great shape, was disappointed by these.</li>
            <li> Payment has been made and did not I receive a final stuff</li>
            <li> Favorite lashes. Long but natural looking.</li>
