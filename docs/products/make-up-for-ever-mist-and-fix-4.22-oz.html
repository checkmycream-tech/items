            <li> I have extremely oily skin, like EXTREMELY oily. I would put on my makeup in the morning and by the time I get to work (2 hrs later), my face was so oily you could fry an egg on it!!! I couldnt stand it and it was so bad that I just decided to stop wearing makeup alltogether. I did my research and read many reviews and decided to try the mist &amp; fix. I thought nothing would be able to conquer my horrible oil prone skin but MUFE Mist &amp; Fix did! I don&#x27;t even have to touch up my makeup once during the day (unless I want to)! It gives my face a nice natural look between dewy and matte, which is perfect for me. This stuff really works for me and I am so happy that I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I received this product  as a Sephora rewards bonus . I have menopausal skin and living in Texas , we need staying power if we are gonna wear make up.This does exactly what it says it will do. I mist it on after I have applied everything I plan on wearing . It can be used during the day w/out buildup or a gunky feeling. One spritz is all it takes so the product is worth the price. I plan on buying this product as soon as my little one runs out . I have had the little one for about 3 months and there is still a good amount of product in it. Worth the price</li>
            <li> Perfect for setting makeup</li>
            <li> this freshens up the skin a lot after finishing  make up! especially if you use heavy coverage foundation or thick products!    I just try it a few times, but I guess that it works better on dry or normal skins</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sold on this when I got the sample to try, but then I realized I wasn&#x27;t getting raccoon eyes from my mascara when I did use it. Also noticed my makeup didn&#x27;t rub off on my husband when we hugged. Now I&#x27;m hooked. One or two sprays after I apply my makeup, and I don&#x27;t need to touch up throughout the day! Eye makeup smear and troubles are over, and I am insanely happy about that. Will continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this product and gave it a try. I have oily skin and wanted something that would make my makeup stay longer and look more natural.  I did not see much difference after i sprayed it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I needed something to help me set my foundation without the use of powder.  I have sensitive dry skin, large pores, and some mild rosecea (sp.?).  I use a sunscreen to protect me from getting sunburned and a liquid foundation to cover up the ruddiness.  However, when I tried to use powder to set my make-up, it would settle into my pores and make me look ashy and \\&quot;drag-queeny.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does what it is supposed to do.  Just make sure you spray it 12\\&quot; to 16\\&quot; away from your face.  Any closer and you wind up with sticky spots.  Also use only 1 to 3 sprays to set your make-up.  Anything more than that and again, you&#x27;ll wind up with a sticky feeling.  I mist it on my face after I put on my eyeliner and mascara.  It helps prevent me from getting raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product and would recommend it if you are looking for an alternative to powder setting your make-up.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! It keeps my make-up on while I teach aerobics for 2-3 hours everyday, after my classes I used to have to freshen up my foundation if I was going anywhere after work but not anymore. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up while teaching but I do use colorscience pressed powder to even out my skin tone a bit with a little blush. I look exactly the same after teaching my classes as I do before... UNBELIEVABLE! I do wish it was more of a mist so it wasn&#x27;t so wet when I first spray it on. I do hold it a foot away from my face so it is more misty by the time it reaches my face and then don&#x27;t touch it just let it dry. I ordered the small travel size first to see if I liked it but will be ordering the full size today!</li>
            <li> A few key points -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I struggle with adult acne, and this product does not give me new breakouts on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Love the dewy look after spraying but you might have to mist again later to achieve the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Makes my makeup last all day, regardless of activity.</li>
            <li> With this product, my makeup lasts most of the day which is better than the two hours it used to last.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...does help set my makeup and lasts all day. I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I hate that powdery look when I use mineral make up and this spray sets it so beautifully, with dewy look. Skin looks very natural and make up last definitely longer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s alcohol free and I don&#x27;t have any bad reaction from it, smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;The only minus is that nozzle hole is too big and a lot of product comes out with each spray, leaving skin wet. I wish it would be fine mist, I think I will change the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the small size to try which is great to try and for traveling. I&#x27;ve also tried:&lt;br /&gt;1-Urban Decay All Nighter-their 3 sprays have exactly the same ingredients, dried my skin out in a long run,&lt;br /&gt;2-Skindinavia 10 years younger-great dewy look, make up last longer, contains alcohol though&lt;br /&gt;3- natural ingredients Bare Minerals Mist, more of a toner, does not prolong make up on my face, but nice refreshing feeling&lt;br /&gt;4- Glo Minerals, as above, does not sets powder,&lt;br /&gt;5- MAC, moisturizing and makes skin look dewy, similar quality.</li>
            <li> ...I don&#x27;t really think this spray is doing anything for me. It feels great misting it on my face, but I don&#x27;t notice it making any difference for my makeup or oil control. To me it&#x27;s just like spraying some water on my face, but a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> This really does make your makeup stay put. My face would be greasy half way through the work day, but after using this, it looks great all the way to nighttime with just a little touch up. Also gives a nice dewy look.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Makeup stays on all day even on hot humid days.  Just make sure you wash your face at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This really does keep your make up on, even in hot humid weather.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last any longer with or without it</li>
            <li> This review is based off of purchasing other mister that work much better than this one.  You will get the dewy look but it only last for a couple of hours...2 at max.  My suggestion would be to buy a smaller mist so you can take along and refresh as needed.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product at Sephora, but it&#x27;s only sold in small travel size containers. This is a large bottle and its great for setting makeup. I usually put an extra spray or two on my face for a natural dewy glow. Lasts all day, even through workouts!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Not very cheap obviously Makeup forever but does an amazing job. I use it on special ocasions and my makeup looks amazing even after dancing and sweating</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a family member &amp; she said it was amazing! I&#x27;m glad she liked it! I&#x27;m going to purchase one for myself.</li>
            <li> I use the mist prior to going and it works very well even it hot conditions.  I wear a bit of makeup to the gym and it old my make very well.</li>
            <li> Helps to set makeup, but not as well as others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Best Product to keep your make up all day</li>
            <li> I get compliment, that I nedver got before using this, as to how nice my makeup is. I can workout and this spray keeps my makeup fresh!,,</li>
            <li> I am stick to this product...go fr it</li>
            <li> I hae always liked this product as you can go whole day without having to redomakeup</li>
            <li> Cant say its the best mist it isnt that great. Make up looks nice the minute you apply and later fades on and doesnt last longer.</li>
