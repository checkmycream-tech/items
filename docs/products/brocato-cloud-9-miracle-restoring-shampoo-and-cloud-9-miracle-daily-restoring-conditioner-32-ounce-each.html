            <li>Not only does it smell great, I love using this product on my hair.</li>
            <li>It is not that easy to find in the stores</li>
            <li>At first I really liked it-</li>
            <li>it was a good change from the pureology or enjoy hair products that I normally use.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well, even though it is sulfate free which is a huge bonus to me.</li>
            <li>I tried using Brazilian blowout brand sulfate free but doesn&#x27;t compare</li>
            <li>my hair felt silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Brocato has helped to smooth and defrizz.  </li>
            <li>When I saw these were available online, I was thrilled because I really like Brocato but hadn&#x27;t used them in awhile because of the inconvenience of special ordering them through a salon.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Sulphate free, super moisturizing and a value at this price.</li>
            <li>A great product for color treated hair that doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry or damaged.</li>
            <li>I now have the whole Brocato line and LOVE IT</li>
            <li>When I contacted the seller and told them I would like to return the almost full bottles they informed me that they had a two week return policy which is not stated on their ad.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, my hair turns out so thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel smooth and the smell is soft and lovely.</li>
            <li>The more regularly I use it, the better my hair&#x27;s condition.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for long hair, the conditioner makes it easy to comb through long hair with no tangles.  </li>
            <li>(so very hot here)..</li>
            <li>I have tried many products including WEN (which I also like but needed something new.)  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner but can&#x27;t find it anywhere near this price in my area.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky - like healthy, untreated hair when I use these products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes it so soft and smells literally like roses to me, it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>When i first tried the Miracle Repair Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li>after one use on Cloud9, my hair felt soft and looked shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have since bought another product and it performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>you get the two large 1 liter bottles</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every 2-3 days and also it lathers up really well</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much shampoo.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much healthier my hair looks and feels despite age, sun, and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These products do not protect from heat very well.  </li>
            <li>Basically, she said any professional hair products not bought through a reputable salon are likely counterfeit.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes your hair so soft and actually help mine get healthy.</li>
            <li>Brocato Cloud 9 Miracle Repair Shampoo and Treatmemt continue to leave my naturally curly hair soft, light, and bouncy; and my color has stayed vibrant.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price because these large containers last me approx 4-5 months.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t use anything else and highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair with a natural curly/wavy hair, and live in AZ</li>
            <li>The only kind I use-have used it for years, my hair is bleached and it looks like real hair, long, really long and silky</li>
            <li>I bought this after a friend finally told me the secret to her great hair.</li>
            <li>If you are considering buying the liters for personal use to get a better $ rate per ounce I think you&#x27;ll be fine, but I definitely recommend switching between other formulas every month or so in order to avoid making the same mistakes I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid Brocato user and immediately thought the shampoo looked different compared the stuff</li>
            <li>and then it feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Brocato Cloud 9 Repair Shampoo and conditioner really surprised me.</li>
            <li>They are both in their early 20s.</li>
            <li>No fade or color change and my hair is silky soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>However, the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t smell or work like the stuff I used to get through my old salon.</li>
            <li>Even the shampoo makes my hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li>how shiny and soft my hair is now.</li>
            <li>Added body and made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft, shiny, and bouncy!!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and a scalp that&#x27;s on the oily side, and this does not weigh my hair down at all, keeps it soft and shiny, and I can now even go two days or so without washing  (</li>
            <li>Best product I have used in a long time, try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I had to apply a special prescription oil to keep it from being raw.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>I have super long, extremely thick, naturally wavy/course/frizzy color treated hair and it loves this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your hair is dry and or treated this is the key to soft manageable hair.</li>

            <li> This conditioner is the most moisturizing, wonderful hair product I&#x27;ve ever encountered. It is the one thing I can use on my color treated hair that makes it feel like anything but straw. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I have super long, extremely thick, naturally wavy/course/frizzy color treated hair and it loves this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It makes it so soft and smells literally like roses to me, it is fabulous. Definitely worth the price because these large containers last me approx 4-5 months. I wash my hair every 2-3 days and also it lathers up really well so you don&#x27;t need much shampoo. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t lather but I will put in my hair and work it through( il brush it with a mini &amp;#34;&#x27;wet&#x27; brush&amp;#34;[look it up/it&#x27;s a great detangling brush/must have for my hair type and I wish I would have known about it sooner, especially while growing up] while in the shower to work through conditioner) and let sit on my hair for a few minutes and then it feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!! Makes my hear look so healthy.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for a number of years and it is really hard to find in my area.  I absolutely love it, my hair turns out so thick and beautiful. thanks.</li>
            <li> The products I received looked different than what&#x27;s pictured. I&#x27;m an avid Brocato user and immediately thought the shampoo looked different compared the stuff I but at my salon. Long story short... it was. Word to the wise... but from a salon.</li>
            <li> I thought the price for this product purchase was a very good deal -and would purchase again when I am out of the product.</li>
            <li> Brocato Cloud 9 Repair Shampoo and conditioner really surprised me. 2 years again I was in a bad car accident and the stress of not being able to take care of my husband , myself and granddaughter properly caused psoriasis to break out all over my body. I have tried a lot of of the shelf shampoos and the scales and/or scabs were still there. I had to apply a special prescription oil to keep it from being raw. These products enable&lt;br /&gt;me to shampoo and condition my hair on a daily basis and use the prescription oil once monthly (wear for prox 24 hours) monthly. What a&lt;br /&gt;blessing. Now I just have flaking like dandruff, What a blessing. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so crazy expensive and after an extensive search, this seller provided a great value for this product.It arrived as described.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick naturally red hair (with a slight wave to it) and I&#x27;m over 50. I spend a fair amount of time outdoors. My hair has some color/highlights to hide the gray and over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners from stores and salons. My stylist gave me a sample of Brocato and told me to use just a small amount (it&#x27;s concentrated). I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much healthier my hair looks and feels despite age, sun, and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both bottles have lasted me more than 6 months making it well worth the price! My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy, fried, or dull from build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has wavy, thin hair and my son has hair thicker than mine. They are both in their early 20s. They have used this shampoo and conditioner, too with gorgeous results. All 3 of us get compliments on how healthy our hair looks when we use Brocato Cloud 9 Repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use anything else and highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> If you have color treated hair this product is a must. Sulphate free, super moisturizing and a value at this price. No fade or color change and my hair is silky soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> When I saw these were available online, I was thrilled because I really like Brocato but hadn&#x27;t used them in awhile because of the inconvenience of special ordering them through a salon. However, the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t smell or work like the stuff I used to get through my old salon. I mentioned it to my current stylist today, and she said people buy the bottles and put whatever they want in them to sell - so you never know what it is you&#x27;re putting on your hair. Yikes.  Basically, she said any professional hair products not bought through a reputable salon are likely counterfeit. While I realize it&#x27;s in her best interest to keep people ordering through the salon, I&#x27;m inclined to believe her because I noticed the difference before talking to her. I won&#x27;t be ordering any more online.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner but can&#x27;t find it anywhere near this price in my area.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and treatment. Its my favorite. It cleans well and does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Love these products.  My hair &amp;#34;came to life&amp;#34; after using these. I have used hundreds of products and none have cleaned or made my hair look or feel as nicely.</li>
            <li> The only kind I use-have used it for years, my hair is bleached and it looks like real hair, long, really long and silky</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave me Brocato Cloud 9 Miracle Repair Shampoo &amp; Conditioner after I had a keratin treatment on my already color treated hair.  This is the best shampoo &amp; conditioner I have ever used.  My hair feels soft and silky - like healthy, untreated hair when I use these products.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another brand again.  Buy the 1 liter combo pack to save $$.  At $60 for the set you get the two large 1 liter bottles and they last a long time.  This is a fraction of the cost you would pay for the same products at the salon.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> leaves hair soft best shampoo! I tried using Brazilian blowout brand sulfate free but doesn&#x27;t compare</li>
            <li> When i first tried the Miracle Repair Shampoo and Conditioner my hair felt silky smooth.  Even the shampoo makes my hair feel soft.  I have recommended this product to everyone. I&#x27;ve even bought some for my mother and daughter.  I have thick, curly hair and when i finish washing my hear it feels like heaven!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Best product I have used in a long time, try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a friend finally told me the secret to her great hair. It&#x27;s expensive, but a little goes a long way and I actually get compliments on how shiny and soft my hair is now.</li>
            <li> I purchased the liter duo and used the product for a little over 6 months.  At first I really liked it- it was a good change from the pureology or enjoy hair products that I normally use.  My hair has always been manageable and healthy without signs of breakage or damage.  I may have made a mistake by not switching this product for another formula every few months because my hair is actually in the poorest condition it has ever been.  I now have TONS of breakage, loss of elasticity and body, and I&#x27;m hesitant to even use a brush when I&#x27;m drying my hair- which is now frizzy if I don&#x27;t use a lot of product to protect from heat damage. These products do not protect from heat very well.  Since nothing about my routine has changed (no new hairdryer or styling products) I have to suspect it has something to do with using these products long term.  If you are considering buying the liters for personal use to get a better $ rate per ounce I think you&#x27;ll be fine, but I definitely recommend switching between other formulas every month or so in order to avoid making the same mistakes I did.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My hair feels amazing after using it.  Had tried a different organic shampoo that made my hair feel like straw -but after one use on Cloud9, my hair felt soft and looked shiny and smooth.  Great price for the combo pack and it works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> I have very dry thick curly hair.  Brocato has helped to smooth and defrizz.  I have tried many products including WEN (which I also like but needed something new.)  I now have the whole Brocato line and LOVE IT</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used.. Pic of before and after Brocato mended my hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes your hair so soft and actually help mine get healthy.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; shampoo. I have problems due to chemo and I gave it a month because with this type of product you can&#x27;t expect overnight results. When I contacted the seller and told them I would like to return the almost full bottles they informed me that they had a two week return policy which is not stated on their ad. I have since bought another product and it performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great Product will order again. Added body and made my hair soft. A little bit goes a long way. Recommend</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell great, I love using this product on my hair. A great product for color treated hair that doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> I love this product- I have long, fine hair and a scalp that&#x27;s on the oily side, and this does not weigh my hair down at all, keeps it soft and shiny, and I can now even go two days or so without washing  (provided they&#x27;re off days for exercise)! Even washing every day, this combo is great. Shipping was way faster than I&#x27;d expected, and the product was wrapped extremely well. I&#x27;m not a frequent 5-star poster, but this product and seller earned it!</li>
            <li> This is the best. If your hair is dry and or treated this is the key to soft manageable hair. I got a really good price on it also. It is not that easy to find in the stores so I was happy to find it  on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for long hair, the conditioner makes it easy to comb through long hair with no tangles.  It makes hair shiny and beautiful, love itQQ</li>
            <li> I have tried everything!! Pureology, Kendra, Wella, Freikka, Joico, Pantene, Redken, Bumble, Moroccanoil, etc.. And this stuff is absolutely the best... Left my hair soft, shiny, and bouncy!! Did not weight it down.. I have long fine hair with a natural curly/wavy hair, and live in AZ (so very hot here)..</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. Have used it for years.  It&#x27;s so great that it affords me the latitude to use styling products from the ultra inexpensive store brands, I.e. Tr* S*mm* and L&#x27;Or*al, without damaging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus - this is the best part - do the math on price per ounce comparison cost to store brand shampoo and conditioner.  awesome value, especially considering the results.</li>
