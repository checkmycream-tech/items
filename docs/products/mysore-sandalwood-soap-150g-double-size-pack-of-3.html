            <li>The strength of the scent was most surprising.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always looking for, ahemm.. &amp;#34;reasonably&amp;#34; priced nice soaps.</li>
            <li>it lingers nicely though, so don&#x27;t be put off.</li>
            <li>but it was not the warm smoky smell of sandalwood</li>
            <li>It lathers great and leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Great soap, lasts long and smell delicious.</li>
            <li>First of all, the lather is just incredible-</li>
            <li>This soap has a wonderful sandalwood scent and its round shape is very good for use with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>This soap has a very strong sandalwood smell - that&#x27;s the reason why I use it.</li>
            <li>and wow... it was awesome...</li>

            <li>He loved it so much he asked me to get him some more!</li>
            <li>In this case, the right soap can invigorate a shower and get the day off to a more pleasant start.  </li>
            <li>as its been around forever according to online reviews and statements, but i am sure all of them use IVORY too..</li>
            <li>Spend your money on something that is a better quality and better scented sandalwood this is a knock-off trying being passed off as sandalwood...</li>
            <li>Would give it a 5 if the smell was stronger on the skin but that would cost us more I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>The scent of it clears your mood and makes for a healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of sandalwood</li>
            <li>If you love sandalwood, this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li>many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>This is the most luxurious sandalwood soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>Love this soap and it&#x27;s simply the best deal on Amazon for sandalwood soap.</li>
            <li>but it is striking.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice fresh sandalewood scent after showering.</li>
            <li>Although I love the smell of sandalwood, this soap&#x27;s aroma has an all too familiar sent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having discovered the joy of a premium French milled sandalwood soap, I searched out Amazon to try as many as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is clean, and confident.</li>
            <li>It also comes from a region known for its fine sandalwood exports, one of the oldest aromatic indulgences on the planet.</li>
            <li>i went cheap and bought three for $10 bucks...</li>
            <li>My niece liked it so much that I had to have it for myself.</li>
            <li>It smells cheap like a cleaning product in a highway motel.</li>
            <li>My wife an I both enjoy the scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of far away, adventurous smell that makes you want to get up and DO what needs to be done, like Powder Milk Biscuits.</li>
            <li>This soap has a very powerful smell in the bathroom, though not overpowering at all on your body.  </li>
            <li>Good on the skin, not too strong and does not dissolve quickly like many other soaps.</li>
            <li>This soap leaves me feeling and smelling clean.</li>
            <li>its true...</li>
            <li>smells good made a second order..</li>
            <li>Intensely fragrant soap, almost like incense ... lovely.  </li>
            <li>I even had to tailor my own kind of antiperspirant down to one non-allergenic brand..</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m pretty cheap,</li>
            <li>It really seems to clean well, my pores always look free of blackheads after I wash with it.</li>
            <li>great smell, long lasting and most of all no reaction at all...</li>
            <li>Very good product and hard to beat for the price.</li>
            <li>The use of this soap at bath time, will leave your skin feeling smooth and cleansed with the aromatic scent of pure sandalwood.</li>
            <li>i have been through every brand you can find in walmart, grocery stores, CVS, walgreens, Hooks (in the old days) and more... and this is nothing but IVORY based soap...</li>
            <li>Powerful stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as their soap box will tell you is quite rare.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth honoring and preserving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second.</li>
            <li>I kept a bar in my sock drawer to use the fresh smell</li>
            <li>i mean i suppose there are a good many people that like it..</li>
            <li>There is more rich history in one bar of Mysore than in an entire crate of P&amp;G or Unilever branded soaps.</li>
            <li>until i find the one sandalwood that is right for me.</li>
            <li>This soap lathers very well and leaves you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s well worth the price and should be tried and without doubt enjoyed by everyone.</li>
            <li>It is sold at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very pungent!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll most likely reorder this one.</li>
            <li>This is the sandalwood scent I have been looking for, and definitely will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel smooth and fragrant and woody and masculine.</li>
            <li>Each bar lasts a long, long time and smells great.</li>
            <li>the box - strong enough to scent even the largest bathroom - just sitting in the soap dish.</li>
            <li>The remaining scent left on body is not as strong - but noticeable.</li>
            <li>It is a vegetable oil based with pure Indian sandelwood oil.</li>
            <li>I told my wife I would certainly keep her supplied with Mysore Sandalwood soap from now on.</li>
            <li>; This is the real deal: government contract (probably subsidized), 100% pure sandalwood is one of the ingredients-</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>The problem is that it has so much incense smell in it that I cannot smell the sandalwood.</li>
            <li>However, I bought so much that I need (a) to give it away, or</li>
            <li>I now know what real sandalwood smells like and this was not it.</li>
            <li>(yes, I&#x27;m straight).  </li>
            <li>Very strong/</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re misguided by modern synthetic products that claim to be &amp;</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re used to bar soaps get ready for a renaissance.</li>
            <li>thing: Amazon retailers charge way too much for this soap.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and this really helps my skin not be irritated.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife and we both ended up really liking it.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong and lasts on your skin for a few hours, the bar does not dry or split and it makes good lather till nothing is left.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure I would recommend one way or the other on this soap.  </li>
            <li>It provides you with a thick, creamy lather that cleans very good yet does not, by any means, dry you out.  </li>
            <li>With that being said I will continue to use this soap as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thought to be effective against infectious sores, acne, rashes and excessive sweating.</li>
            <li>This soap lathers well, has a rich and lasting scent, and is very natural.</li>
            <li>Has worked wonders for my skin, and it&#x27;s mild enough to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>This soap also has no additional harsh chemicals which really makes it so lovely.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>well i ran out and never replaced it.. over the time i have been trying to find the same one and not had much success...</li>
            <li>Dear Consumers, let me first preface this with, I&#x27;m not normally a soapy kind of guy, but since i was a kid i have had skin allergies and constantly have to be careful of allergic reactions to soaps and shampoos and colognes and even women&#x27;s perfumes from time to time...</li>
            <li>Lots of fragrance but not a crude assault on the nose, a true old-fashioned, delicately floral sandalwood aroma.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to make you want to hang on - to the \\&quot;outside\\&quot; - of Bangalore commuter metro :) - So either you love the sandalwood smell - or hate it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;First things first, Mysore does not qualify as a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; french milled soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance is present even when you first step into the shower.  </li>
            <li>Lovely soap but not the small I remembered from another brand.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and clean; the scent helps center me when I am stressed.</li>
            <li>It is fairly long lasting with one bar lasting more than a month.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few sandalwood products (even expensive Roger and Gallet) and this one is the best value for the price.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood also has many properties that are beneficial to skin, at least according to Ayurvedic tradition.</li>
            <li>Looks like they will last the whole month or longer.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a masculine scent, but I can understand the folks who can see it going either way.</li>
            <li>it really smells like a 3rd world country, not like sandalwood</li>
            <li>While it is a good value for the money, I am unlikely to buy it again.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite different from other sandalwood products available.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how it scented all my little apartment with a clean but not perfumy scent.  </li>
            <li>It actually does the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>The smell at first seemed extremely pungent and kindof &amp;#34;incensey&amp;#34; in a spicy curry way.</li>
            <li>Very Masculine - reminiscent of the old \\&quot;English Leather\\&quot; soap on a rope smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The smell is loud in the air but slight on your skin as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>Hard to find, but worth  looking.</li>

            <li> as their soap box will tell you is quite rare.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth honoring and preserving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second.</li>
            <li> I kept a bar in my sock drawer to use the fresh smell</li>
            <li> i mean i suppose there are a good many people that like it..</li>
            <li> There is more rich history in one bar of Mysore than in an entire crate of P&amp;G or Unilever branded soaps.</li>
            <li> until i find the one sandalwood that is right for me.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers very well and leaves you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s well worth the price and should be tried and without doubt enjoyed by everyone.</li>
            <li> It is sold at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very pungent!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll most likely reorder this one.</li>
            <li> This is the sandalwood scent I have been looking for, and definitely will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> First.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel smooth and fragrant and woody and masculine.</li>
            <li> Each bar lasts a long, long time and smells great.</li>
            <li> the box - strong enough to scent even the largest bathroom - just sitting in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> The remaining scent left on body is not as strong - but noticeable.</li>
            <li> It is a vegetable oil based with pure Indian sandelwood oil.</li>
            <li> I told my wife I would certainly keep her supplied with Mysore Sandalwood soap from now on.</li>
            <li> ; This is the real deal: government contract (probably subsidized), 100% pure sandalwood is one of the ingredients-</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it has so much incense smell in it that I cannot smell the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> However, I bought so much that I need (a) to give it away, or</li>
            <li> I now know what real sandalwood smells like and this was not it.</li>
            <li> (yes, I&#x27;m straight).  </li>
            <li> Very strong/</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re misguided by modern synthetic products that claim to be &amp;</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re used to bar soaps get ready for a renaissance.</li>
            <li> thing: Amazon retailers charge way too much for this soap.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this really helps my skin not be irritated.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and we both ended up really liking it.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong and lasts on your skin for a few hours, the bar does not dry or split and it makes good lather till nothing is left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure I would recommend one way or the other on this soap.  </li>
            <li> It provides you with a thick, creamy lather that cleans very good yet does not, by any means, dry you out.  </li>
            <li> With that being said I will continue to use this soap as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thought to be effective against infectious sores, acne, rashes and excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well, has a rich and lasting scent, and is very natural.</li>
            <li> Has worked wonders for my skin, and it&#x27;s mild enough to use on my face.  </li>
            <li> This soap also has no additional harsh chemicals which really makes it so lovely.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> well i ran out and never replaced it.. over the time i have been trying to find the same one and not had much success...</li>
            <li> Dear Consumers, let me first preface this with, I&#x27;m not normally a soapy kind of guy, but since i was a kid i have had skin allergies and constantly have to be careful of allergic reactions to soaps and shampoos and colognes and even women&#x27;s perfumes from time to time...</li>
            <li> Lots of fragrance but not a crude assault on the nose, a true old-fashioned, delicately floral sandalwood aroma.</li>
            <li> Strong enough to make you want to hang on - to the \\&quot;outside\\&quot; - of Bangalore commuter metro :) - So either you love the sandalwood smell - or hate it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first, Mysore does not qualify as a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; french milled soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance is present even when you first step into the shower.  </li>
            <li> Lovely soap but not the small I remembered from another brand.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and clean; the scent helps center me when I am stressed.</li>
            <li> It is fairly long lasting with one bar lasting more than a month.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few sandalwood products (even expensive Roger and Gallet) and this one is the best value for the price.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood also has many properties that are beneficial to skin, at least according to Ayurvedic tradition.</li>
            <li> Looks like they will last the whole month or longer.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a masculine scent, but I can understand the folks who can see it going either way.</li>
            <li> it really smells like a 3rd world country, not like sandalwood</li>
            <li> While it is a good value for the money, I am unlikely to buy it again.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite different from other sandalwood products available.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how it scented all my little apartment with a clean but not perfumy scent.  </li>
            <li> It actually does the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> The smell at first seemed extremely pungent and kindof &amp;#34;incensey&amp;#34; in a spicy curry way.</li>
            <li> Very Masculine - reminiscent of the old \\&quot;English Leather\\&quot; soap on a rope smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The smell is loud in the air but slight on your skin as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, but worth  looking.</li>
            <li> It is also a very long lasting bar in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This soap is long lasting, even when left wet!</li>
            <li> The bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> almost caustic smelling right out</li>
            <li> okay, that&#x27;s how bad this stuff is...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, whoever makes this stuff.. really needs to go back to formula.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for classy soaps..</li>
            <li> This is not real sandalwood.</li>
            <li> do need to mention one odd thing though</li>
            <li> I like to smell the sandalwood, and will go back to Yardley or another of the (expensive) soaps that simply smell like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I bought 5 of the 150g bars for less than 10 bucks today at an Indian grocery.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t understand how anyone could write  a less than five star review.</li>
            <li> These are really high quality in every way, not as expensive as the &amp;#34;big names&amp;#34;, but are on a par with the highest priced so-called luxury soaps.</li>
            <li> After the shower you&#x27;ll notice the scent for a little while-</li>
            <li> : On a few occasions, I think this soap has altered my sense of taste.</li>
            <li> And if I don&#x27;t exactly smell like Babe Winkelman after a day on the lake, is that a bad thing?</li>
            <li> this stuff is awful.. smells like nothing more than IVORY.. .TRUST</li>
            <li> you have an Indian grocer nearby, they usually sell the 150g size for two bucks, or the 75g size for a buck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the difference</li>
            <li> Okay I&#x27;m done... just had to share because i cant believe anyone really likes this stuff and want to save you the grief of facing the awful smell...  </li>
            <li> Hard milled, delicately scented.</li>
            <li> And i mean that literally i opened the amazon package, then opened the sealed package containing the soap and then the smell hit me...</li>
            <li> They mean India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sadly i brought this on myself...</li>
            <li> I gave up the chemical smelling crap on the grocery store shelves</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give this stuff to my worst enemy.. figure of speech... but</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They smell wonderful and they are great soaps but the aroma can be overpowering even if it still in the packaging. You won&#x27;t need cologne anymore and sandalwood is great for your skin.</li>
            <li> Dear Consumers, let me first preface this with, I&#x27;m not normally a soapy kind of guy, but since i was a kid i have had skin allergies and constantly have to be careful of allergic reactions to soaps and shampoos and colognes and even women&#x27;s perfumes from time to time... I even had to tailor my own kind of antiperspirant down to one non-allergenic brand.. anyway... about three years ago a friend bought me some Sandalwood soap and wow... it was awesome... great smell, long lasting and most of all no reaction at all... well i ran out and never replaced it.. over the time i have been trying to find the same one and not had much success... so yet again i went in search of soap and found this on, so I bought it, this Mysore brand... And Oh My Holiness... Listen.... This stuff never made it to my bathroom okay, that&#x27;s how bad this stuff is... And i mean that literally i opened the amazon package, then opened the sealed package containing the soap and then the smell hit me... I wouldn&#x27;t give this stuff to my worst enemy.. figure of speech... but its true... this stuff is awful.. smells like nothing more than IVORY.. .TRUST Me.... i have been through every brand you can find in walmart, grocery stores, CVS, walgreens, Hooks (in the old days) and more... and this is nothing but IVORY based soap... YUCK...... sadly i brought this on myself... i went cheap and bought three for $10 bucks... now i will just save my self the sensory sadness and buy the best brand i can find for more if i have to...   I&#x27;m sorry, whoever makes this stuff.. really needs to go back to formula..... i mean i suppose there are a good many people that like it.. as its been around forever according to online reviews and statements, but i am sure all of them use IVORY too.. which i cant stand the smell of nor tolerate on my skin.. so back to the drawing board for me.. oatmeal soap.. until i find the one sandalwood that is right for me. Spend your money on something that is a better quality and better scented sandalwood this is a knock-off trying being passed off as sandalwood... Okay I&#x27;m done... just had to share because i cant believe anyone really likes this stuff and want to save you the grief of facing the awful smell...  Kind Regards, and best of luck soap hunting..</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. It is a vegetable oil based with pure Indian sandelwood oil. The fragrance is mild and not overwhelming. Can be an unisexed soap. It lathers great and leaves your skin feeling clean. I used it on my face and have had no problem. I have not used commercial bar soap for years. With that being said I will continue to use this soap as long as it is available.  The bar lasts a long time. This is the sandlewood soap I have been looking for. Just know it comes from India and takes awhile to receive it, so if you like it don&#x27;t wait until you are almost out.</li>
            <li> This soap has a very strong sandalwood smell - that&#x27;s the reason why I use it. Sandalwood also has many properties that are beneficial to skin, at least according to Ayurvedic tradition. It&#x27;s thought to be effective against infectious sores, acne, rashes and excessive sweating. I just like the fact that I smell good after I shower with it - I&#x27;ve even been complemented on my smell by women when I&#x27;ve used this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do need to mention one odd thing though: On a few occasions, I think this soap has altered my sense of taste. For instance, even hours after using it, I&#x27;ve had red wine taste like sandalwood to me (but not to my drinking buddy). Powerful stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an Indian grocer nearby, they usually sell the 150g size for two bucks, or the 75g size for a buck.</li>
            <li> And I am especially glad to see that I received bars of 150 gram soap -- not 75 gram sizes like I received from another source.</li>
            <li> Very pungent! I&#x27;m using it now as a deodorizer in my coat closet.</li>
            <li> I bought a case of this soap. It is sold at a very reasonable price. It&#x27;s scent is very pleasant -- and very strong. The problem is that it has so much incense smell in it that I cannot smell the sandalwood. While it is a good value for the money, I am unlikely to buy it again. I like to smell the sandalwood, and will go back to Yardley or another of the (expensive) soaps that simply smell like sandalwood. However, I bought so much that I need (a) to give it away, or (b) wait about a year until I use it up.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few sandalwood products (even expensive Roger and Gallet) and this one is the best value for the price. The scent is strong and lasts on your skin for a few hours, the bar does not dry or split and it makes good lather till nothing is left.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap. The sandlewood aroma is great.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the simple things brighten our day.  In this case, the right soap can invigorate a shower and get the day off to a more pleasant start.  Having discovered the joy of a premium French milled sandalwood soap, I searched out Amazon to try as many as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, Mysore does not qualify as a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; french milled soap.  It does not have the luxurious scent of a premium sandalwood soap.  It&#x27;s scent is very strong and the lather feels more like Dove.  The strength of the scent was most surprising.  We have a bar in the spare bathroom.  The shower is seldom used, yet the scent of the soap is noticeable on walking into the room and actually pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I would recommend one way or the other on this soap.  I can&#x27;t rave about it, but I can&#x27;t knock it either.  I&#x27;ll just say we prefer the Casswell Massey soaps.</li>
            <li> These are good size bars.Looks like they will last the whole month or longer.I would order these again.The smell is good and one shower will smell up the bathroom all day and night.The best part is how clean you feel.You can hear your skin squeek.The smell is loud in the air but slight on your skin as far as I can tell.But I&#x27;ll most likely reorder this one.Would give it a 5 if the smell was stronger on the skin but that would cost us more I&#x27;m sure.Very good product and hard to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  Has worked wonders for my skin, and it&#x27;s mild enough to use on my face.  I love the results!!!!</li>
            <li> Years ago, I used to buy Mysore Sandalwood soup.  I had forgotten how it scented all my little apartment with a clean but not perfumy scent.  Recently I rediscovered the soap again at Amazon.  Most soap is made of lard and lye - ugh!  This one is made with sandalwood oil only, and Ayurveda medicine recommends it for your skin.  The scent of it clears your mood and makes for a healthy feeling. Good for body and soul!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of sandlewood soap for over 10 years. It makes my skin feel soft and clean; the scent helps center me when I am stressed. It&#x27;s made of all-natural ingredients, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about toxins. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself but my teenage son took it one day when he ran out of his soap. He loved it so much he asked me to get him some more! This soap is long lasting, even when left wet! The smell is clean, and confident.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice fresh sandalewood scent after showering. Also use it lathered with a shaving brush to shave.</li>
            <li> My niece liked it so much that I had to have it for myself. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful soap for my oily summer face.</li>
            <li> Its so good it does wonders</li>
            <li> Mysore Sandalwood is a very, very good quality soap.  It&#x27;s fragrance is present even when you first step into the shower.  It provides you with a thick, creamy lather that cleans very good yet does not, by any means, dry you out.  It actually does the exact opposite. Overall, it&#x27;s well worth the price and should be tried and without doubt enjoyed by everyone.</li>
            <li> This is not real sandalwood. I now know what real sandalwood smells like and this was not it. I feel a bit duped.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe people think this smells good! It smells cheap like a cleaning product in a highway motel.</li>
            <li> Great soap, lasts long and smell delicious. Good on the skin, not too strong and does not dissolve quickly like many other soaps.</li>
            <li> Lovely soap but not the small I remembered from another brand.  Too intensly &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; smelling for me.  Not the sellers fault, it&#x27;s just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of sandalwood (yes, I&#x27;m straight).  This soap leaves me feeling and smelling clean. It really seems to clean well, my pores always look free of blackheads after I wash with it.</li>
            <li> This is the sandalwood scent I have been looking for, and definitely will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Love the Sandalwood scent!</li>
            <li> This is the best, most beautiful sandalwood soap out there! If you love sandalwood, this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for classy soaps.. what can I say. I gave up the chemical smelling crap on the grocery store shelves many, many years ago. That said, I&#x27;m pretty cheap, so I&#x27;m always looking for, ahemm.. &amp;#34;reasonably&amp;#34; priced nice soaps. These are really high quality in every way, not as expensive as the &amp;#34;big names&amp;#34;, but are on a par with the highest priced so-called luxury soaps. Smooth, not drying, skin feels GREAT after washing, and the scent is indescribable. Lots of fragrance but not a crude assault on the nose, a true old-fashioned, delicately floral sandalwood aroma. Definitely aroma-therapeutic! And if I don&#x27;t exactly smell like Babe Winkelman after a day on the lake, is that a bad thing? ;)</li>
            <li> smells good made a second order..</li>
            <li> Very strong/almost caustic smelling right out the box - strong enough to scent even the largest bathroom - just sitting in the soap dish. The remaining scent left on body is not as strong - but noticeable. Very Masculine - reminiscent of the old \\&quot;English Leather\\&quot; soap on a rope smell. Strong enough to make you want to hang on - to the \\&quot;outside\\&quot; - of Bangalore commuter metro :) - So either you love the sandalwood smell - or hate it...</li>
            <li> First. For those who say that this is not a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sandalwood smell- you&#x27;re misguided by modern synthetic products that claim to be &amp;#34;Sandalwood.&amp;#34; This is the real deal: government contract (probably subsidized), 100% pure sandalwood is one of the ingredients- as their soap box will tell you is quite rare. It also comes from a region known for its fine sandalwood exports, one of the oldest aromatic indulgences on the planet. There is more rich history in one bar of Mysore than in an entire crate of P&amp;G or Unilever branded soaps. Anyway, I&#x27;m not trying to preach, but I&#x27;m telling you I was wishy washy about this soap until I tried it TODAY and it is THAT good. It&#x27;s worth honoring and preserving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second. The smell at first seemed extremely pungent and kindof &amp;#34;incensey&amp;#34; in a spicy curry way. NOT that I don&#x27;t like spicy curry, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not an all the time smell, ya know? My fears were allayed when I showered with it and experienced the lather. First of all, the lather is just incredible- if you&#x27;re used to bar soaps get ready for a renaissance. Secondly the scent is simply intoxicating, and that&#x27;s not being melodramatic. It&#x27;s the kind of far away, adventurous smell that makes you want to get up and DO what needs to be done, like Powder Milk Biscuits. It&#x27;s simply amazing. After the shower you&#x27;ll notice the scent for a little while- it lingers nicely though, so don&#x27;t be put off. You&#x27;ll feel smooth and fragrant and woody and masculine. I think it&#x27;s a masculine scent, but I can understand the folks who can see it going either way. It&#x27;s so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing: Amazon retailers charge way too much for this soap. I bought 5 of the 150g bars for less than 10 bucks today at an Indian grocery. And if you don&#x27;t have an Indian grocery nearby, chances are your local filipino or Asian market will.</li>
            <li> These smell heavenly. This soap lathers well, has a rich and lasting scent, and is very natural. Lovely.</li>
            <li> This is the most luxurious sandalwood soap I have ever used. The use of this soap at bath time, will leave your skin feeling smooth and cleansed with the aromatic scent of pure sandalwood.</li>
            <li> These soaps are birthday and Christmas gifts. I gave one to my friend for her birthday recently. She was so happy with it- smiled and said what did you do? OMG!! are you kidding me? This soap is still used in the royal palace in England so you can image how elegant it is!! Beautiful product!!</li>
            <li> Although I love the smell of sandalwood, this soap&#x27;s aroma has an all too familiar sent.&lt;br /&gt;It smells just like my dog&#x27;s flea shampoo.  No kidding.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well maybe it&#x27;ll keep the fleas off me anyway???</li>
            <li> This soap has a wonderful sandalwood scent and its round shape is very good for use with a washcloth. It is fairly long lasting with one bar lasting more than a month. Didn&#x27;t leave any sores on my body, ha, ha.</li>
            <li> Intensely fragrant soap, almost like incense ... lovely.  Good service from this seller -</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is so wonderful makes my skin so soft smells great.  I have eczema and this really helps my skin not be irritated.  This soap also has no additional harsh chemicals which really makes it so lovely.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and we both ended up really liking it. The scent neither leans toward female nor male but smells well on both .I can&#x27;t understand how anyone could write  a less than five star review. This soap lathers very well and leaves you feeling clean and refreshed. I told my wife I would certainly keep her supplied with Mysore Sandalwood soap from now on.</li>
            <li> it really smells like a 3rd world country, not like sandalwood</li>
            <li> They mean India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This not the greatest soap but it is pretty good.  The scent as well as the skin care is very good</li>
            <li> Love this soap and it&#x27;s simply the best deal on Amazon for sandalwood soap. Each bar lasts a long, long time and smells great. I&#x27;ve ordered multiple times. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Best way to wake up in the morning and go to sleep at night! It also leaves the bathroom smelling lovely!</li>
            <li> Hard to find, but worth  looking. Hard milled, delicately scented.</li>
            <li> This soap has a very powerful smell in the bathroom, though not overpowering at all on your body.  My wife an I both enjoy the scent.  It is also a very long lasting bar in my opinion.  The price is satisfactory and for those who enjoy sandalwood, the soap is great.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite different from other sandalwood products available. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the difference but it is striking. I kept a bar in my sock drawer to use the fresh smell but it was not the warm smoky smell of sandalwood I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also irritated my skin.</li>
