            <li>Love the rubber edges and sculpted bristles.  </li>
            <li>On my last dental appointment, my dentist said my gums were perfect &amp; healthy.  </li>

            <li>The toothbrush is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Not exactly the one I thought it was but am still happy with it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look cleaner, feel better and are overall much better.  </li>
            <li>, it offers a strong yet comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>You can feel the clean the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>so worth having them shipped from Amazon and</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different toothbrushes looking for one I really liked.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in another country, the price might be worth it IF you can&#x27;t find an alternative here on Amazon or elsewhere.</li>

            <li>This toothbrush gives my mouth a real workout.  </li>
            <li>They are available for $6.00 for the pair at the local discount monster store</li>
            <li>I also really like the handle</li>
            <li>I thought fancy tooth brushes were just a scam, but this brush really gets in between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this from the store the other day, for more than what Amazon is asking.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone who is using other brushes and feel that their teeth do not get as clean as they would like!</li>
            <li>This is truly worth paying the extra price.</li>
            <li>I almost never go to because of the super long lines and unsavory characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, in the last year of buying, them, at first I thought I got a defective batch and kept buying them.  </li>
            <li>Other brushes I tried never gave me a clean feeling like this one does.</li>
            <li>They were just right for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I use to use the soft bristle, but switched to medium bristle.  </li>
            <li>normally brush really hard, so on cheap brushes I bend the bristles within a week</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s your teeth for goodness sake, spend the extra 2-4 dollars to get a decent brush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and if you are a clean teeth obsessed person, so will you!</li>

            <li> Product was opened. Will not buy again. Someone could have used them to scratch their -$$ for all I know.</li>
            <li> Product description says Twin Pack, 2-count.  Only receive 1 Twin Pack.  Expected 2.  I would not have ordered at $10.99 for only 1 twin pack.  Product not as described.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gives my mouth a real workout.  I like it a lot.  This toothbrush gives my mouth a real workout.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different toothbrushes looking for one I really liked.  This is it!  Like the shape and the grip of the handle.</li>
            <li> Love these. They work nearly as well as my Sonicare and cost a lot less than new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price here is way out of line. They are available for $6.00 for the pair at the local discount monster store I almost never go to because of the super long lines and unsavory characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves these as well. When we broke open the pack and both used at the same time we were actually a little shocked at how well they worked and how it felt when using. It actually feels in your hand like you&#x27;re doing something. I think that&#x27;s the cross bristles, at angle to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They wear out a little faster than other brushes but for $3.00 each who cares? I plan to stock up on these and replace as soon as they look worn.</li>
            <li> Excellent !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Too expensive, found a similar pair on sale for half the price at a local supermarket.</li>
            <li> good toothbrush. been using it for years. good price</li>
            <li> Easy packaging. Arrived as expected. No surprises. I don&#x27;t have any other words to add. Ridiculous that I have to have a length limit.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is my number 1 choice. Other brushes I tried never gave me a clean feeling like this one does. I can even SEE the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I love the white bristles feature that massages the gums while you brush. I also really like the handle, it offers a strong yet comfortable grip. Highly recommended to anyone who is using other brushes and feel that their teeth do not get as clean as they would like!</li>
            <li> This is truly worth paying the extra price. Once you use it you&#x27;ll feel how the other brushes do not seem to cover your entire teeth, especially if you happen to have to use another type b/c of travel. Great product design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but the price is way out of line compared to the ~ $6-$7 price a pack costs at a Discount retailer.  You get what&#x27;s advertised, as long as you don&#x27;t mis-read thinking this is two packs of double brushes: it IS just the one pack.  And, like I stated, you can purchase it for a LOT less at a stateside retailer.  If you&#x27;re in another country, the price might be worth it IF you can&#x27;t find an alternative here on Amazon or elsewhere.</li>
            <li> They came on time, in good shape, just as ordered. We are glad to have such quality toothbrushes at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> i have been buying these toothbrushes for years and years.  Love the rubber edges and sculpted bristles.  They were just right for a long time.  However, in the last year of buying, them, at first I thought I got a defective batch and kept buying them.  The rubber tines along the edge shear off constantly and you find rubber plugs in your mouth when you are brushing and spit.  I don&#x27;t like spitting out toothbrush parts every time I brush my teeth.  All the rubber tunes break off one by one and the rubber grip coating on the toothbrush end, peels off too.  I&#x27;m tired of this newly cheapened quality, choking hazard toothbrush.  My teeth haven&#x27;t changed any (ie, I&#x27;m not brushing braces or anything), so I don&#x27;t know if they changed their manufacturing formulas but these don&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> On my last dental appointment, my dentist said my gums were perfect &amp; healthy.  I use to use the soft bristle, but switched to medium bristle.  I think the firmer bristles massage my gums better.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush to keep your teeth and gums healthy. The backside of the toothbrush head is a good tongue cleaner. The toothbrush is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from the store the other day, for more than what Amazon is asking. I thought fancy tooth brushes were just a scam, but this brush really gets in between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally brush really hard, so on cheap brushes I bend the bristles within a week, this has seemed to hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s your teeth for goodness sake, spend the extra 2-4 dollars to get a decent brush.</li>
            <li> Good quality tooth brush. These are my husband and I&#x27;s go-to tooth brushes. Simple and they get the job done.</li>
