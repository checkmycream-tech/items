    <ol>
            <li>Great customer service tho.</li>
            <li>I stopped buying them at department stores because they are phenominally high in price!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The product is perfect; however I learned I payed much more for it through this vendor than if I had purchased it at Dillards or Macys.</li>
            <li>From order placement, through delivery and product usage, successful purchase.  </li>
            <li>and she loved it also.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the speedy delivery of this product.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better!  </li>
            <li>This perfume is amazing.</li>
            <li>This perfume reminds me I&#x27;ve come into my own.</li>
            <li>I would rather us purchased it at a reputable retailer.  </li>
            <li>I love this Chanel Mademoiselle</li>
            <li>I have used this parfum for 6 years now, and I love it more and more.  </li>
            <li>and I thank you :)</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>Smells more like alcohol, than Coco Mademoiselle.  </li>
            <li>This is a very wonderful perfume I wear on special occasions or when I just want to feel extra feminine and sexy.</li>
            <li>Hmm.......&lt;br /&gt;It smells very good, but not for long, the fragrance fades within 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased in good faith a perfume of which when it arrived it was definately not what I normally wear.  </li>
            <li>The lid would barely even stay ON the bottle and the label was perfectly centered on the bottle, which, if you know anything about real Coco mademoiselle, it&#x27;s not centered.  </li>
            <li>mademoiselle has been the only one I would wear for every ocassion because it&#x27;s that great.  </li>
            <li>No surprises found, and a great transaction overall.</li>
            <li>I will most certainly still buy things through Amazon</li>
            <li>For being a tester bottle, it seemed rather full.</li>
            <li>but I bet other sellers are great too.</li>
            <li>Coco Mademoiselle is lighter and more contemporary than Coco (which I used to wear).</li>
            <li>the lid dyed and lost its golden color.</li>
            <li>Not accurately described   Great perfume, but this is a rip off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and trust me 50&#x27;s are feminine, fun and fierce.</li>
            <li>It was a diluted repackaged item, if not entirely fake altogether.  </li>
            <li>but regardless, this is amazing and the scent has a fresh, sweet, powder, but i&#x27;t hard to explain.  </li>
            <li>I bought the large size...;)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this perfume but from the smell itself I had a doubt it wasnt real.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal still sealed, packaged and in box.</li>
            <li>so,so much and saved a ton buying it from YouthBerry &amp; Co</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much discount anyway, so just order from Macys online if you don&#x27;t want to be ripped off.</li>
            <li>Too much like Chanel which always seemed for a older lady imo.</li>
            <li>When I found out how much he paid for it, I was surprised!</li>
            <li>I sprayed a tiny tiny bit just to make sure, and my 4 year old covered her nose and said \\&quot;mommy that stinks!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>think this is high time Amazon should take action against all these vendors who are persistently selling fakes on Amazon and cheating us like this.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>I love perfumes and I can make out fake and original</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon right away and they emailed me straight back and sorted this all out for me and gave me my money back etc.  </li>
            <li>Completely unsatisfyed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like something totally different and very unflattering to me.</li>
            <li>I am not sure now that the positive reviews are real or not??</li>
            <li>Totally worth waiting a few days to have it ship versus running to the department stores.  </li>
            <li>I have tons of other high end perfumes and nothing compares to the sensual smell of Coco Mademoiselle.</li>

            <li> I have tons of other high end perfumes and nothing compares to the sensual smell of Coco Mademoiselle.</li>
            <li> To his disappointment, it was a tester in very cheap packaging.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feminine, classy, but not too overly girly fruity smell that I find is not appropriate in my office.  </li>
            <li> I retract my previous rating of neutral now that I have actually opened and used this perfume.  </li>
            <li> The little white label around the lid was falling off.  </li>
            <li> So, with the postage due upon delivery and loss of nearly $100 for trying to treat myself to a perfume I had wanted for more than 2 years...I feel sick and cheated!  </li>
            <li> To say that I am disappointed would be a HUGE understatement.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Only to get it, open it and discover I had been sent a fake!  </li>
            <li> I am expecting to get a full refund, including reimbursement for shipping back because I refuse to spend even ONE cent on this disgusting forgery.  </li>
            <li> The product I got is a total fake, now I am certain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually prefer perfumes b/c</li>
            <li> thought this was oringinal parfum, doesn&#x27;t smell anything like what I&#x27;ve been wearing for the past 8 year.  </li>
            <li> The vast majority of the time, Chanels will be fake.  </li>
            <li> There are quite a few reviews who have said this perfume is fake - A Madmoiselle wearer will know this.</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> But shame on this seller for thinking the rest of us are idiots enough to not know a fake when we get it!  </li>
            <li> so I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> 100% FAKE.    </li>
            <li> am so disappointed because I wanted this perfume so badly and all I get is a fake on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.....</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was very pleased with the speedy delivery of this product.  I will use this site again.</li>
            <li> The item description said like 3.3oz when it&#x27;s suppose to be 3.4 oz from chanel so I was skeptical. I read another reviewer from here and they said it was legit so i took a chance. It&#x27;s the real deal still sealed, packaged and in box.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this perfume for me on Amazon.com because he wanted to surprise me with it.  To his disappointment, it was a tester in very cheap packaging.  When I found out how much he paid for it, I was surprised! I would rather us purchased it at a reputable retailer.  For being a tester bottle, it seemed rather full. Hmm.......&lt;br /&gt;It smells very good, but not for long, the fragrance fades within 15 minutes.  I think we definitely got ripped off.  Do not buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product..... i love Coco Mademoiselle, but what i got from The speedy store was a fake bottle.... i sent 2 mails with no answer....</li>
            <li> I retract my previous rating of neutral now that I have actually opened and used this perfume.  It was a diluted repackaged item, if not entirely fake altogether.  I went so far as to apply 10+ sprays directly to one area of a knit scarf, waited a few seconds, covered my nose with it and inhaled as strongly as I possibly could....no detectable scent whatsoever! So, with the postage due upon delivery and loss of nearly $100 for trying to treat myself to a perfume I had wanted for more than 2 years...I feel sick and cheated!  Buyer Beware, DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> 100% FAKE.    The smell stays on max 10 minutes. After two times open/close  the lid dyed and lost its golden color. Completely unsatisfyed.  Will sue the amazon.com when I come back from Europe. It was a gift and how embarassed I  should feel now!</li>
            <li> I love this Chanel Mademoiselle so,so,so,so much and saved a ton buying it from YouthBerry &amp; Co, but I bet other sellers are great too. I just havent tried others. but regardless, this is amazing and the scent has a fresh, sweet, powder, but i&#x27;t hard to explain.  you&#x27;ll just have to try it.  It&#x27;s feminine, classy, but not too overly girly fruity smell that I find is not appropriate in my office.  mademoiselle has been the only one I would wear for every ocassion because it&#x27;s that great.  I have used this parfum for 6 years now, and I love it more and more.  I stopped buying them at department stores because they are phenominally high in price!!!!!!! The one I purchased on Amazon is the same and the condition, scent and everything was the same.  I saved $35! Totally worth waiting a few days to have it ship versus running to the department stores.  I also just purchased the smaller 1.7 fl oz bottle as a gift and she loved it also.  But for me...I bought the large size...;)</li>
            <li> I purchased in good faith a perfume of which when it arrived it was definately not what I normally wear.  I contacted Amazon right away and they emailed me straight back and sorted this all out for me and gave me my money back etc.  I commend there efforts as I thought I would of just had to lose out but it is stories like these that give you confidence in internet sites.  I will most certainly still buy things through Amazon and I thank you :)</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing. I receive so many compliments when I wear this. I have tons of other high end perfumes and nothing compares to the sensual smell of Coco Mademoiselle.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect; however I learned I payed much more for it through this vendor than if I had purchased it at Dillards or Macys.</li>
            <li> Received a perfume tester,!!!    Not a retail item.  Not accurately described   Great perfume, but this is a rip off.  Will not use this site again. !!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very wonderful perfume I wear on special occasions or when I just want to feel extra feminine and sexy. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but just enough. Coco Mademoiselle is lighter and more contemporary than Coco (which I used to wear). But once I smelled Coco Mademoiselle I was hooked. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and trust me 50&#x27;s are feminine, fun and fierce. This perfume reminds me I&#x27;ve come into my own.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few reviews who have said this perfume is fake - A Madmoiselle wearer will know this. I am not sure now that the positive reviews are real or not?? plus there is no return on the perfume? should this seller and perfume be checked out by consumer people, like watchdog or which or someone?</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this perfume but from the smell itself I had a doubt it wasnt real. I love perfumes and I can make out fake and original so yesterday I went to Macy&#x27;s and Dillard&#x27;s and checked it out. The product I got is a total fake, now I am certain.&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed because I wanted this perfume so badly and all I get is a fake on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is high time Amazon should take action against all these vendors who are persistently selling fakes on Amazon and cheating us like this.&lt;br /&gt;BTW I bought it from MunozWholesale.</li>
            <li> From order placement, through delivery and product usage, successful purchase.  No surprises found, and a great transaction overall.</li>
            <li> To say that I am disappointed would be a HUGE understatement.  I have hemmed and hawed for weeks over spending the money to buy this perfume, and finally decided to treat myself.  Only to get it, open it and discover I had been sent a fake!  Seriously!  The little white label around the lid was falling off.  The lid would barely even stay ON the bottle and the label was perfectly centered on the bottle, which, if you know anything about real Coco mademoiselle, it&#x27;s not centered.  Not only that but it smells WRETCHED!  I sprayed a tiny tiny bit just to make sure, and my 4 year old covered her nose and said \\&quot;mommy that stinks!\\&quot; Which is a definite sign that it&#x27;s fake for me because she is in love with the bottle of Coco Mademoiselle that I already have.  I am expecting to get a full refund, including reimbursement for shipping back because I refuse to spend even ONE cent on this disgusting forgery.  I should have known better!  But shame on this seller for thinking the rest of us are idiots enough to not know a fake when we get it!  SHAME ON YOU!  The only reason I even give it one star is because I have to!</li>
            <li> I did not like it. I usually prefer perfumes b/c they&#x27;re stronger so they last longer, but this smelled nothing like the eau de toilette at all. It&#x27;s like something totally different and very unflattering to me. Too much like Chanel which always seemed for a older lady imo. I was never a fan of the Chanel fragrances except for Chance. My husband actually got me the Mademoiselle eau de toilette on his way home from Dubai and I love it, so I gave the perfume to my sister. Great customer service tho.</li>
            <li> thought this was oringinal parfum, doesn&#x27;t smell anything like what I&#x27;ve been wearing for the past 8 year.  Smells more like alcohol, than Coco Mademoiselle.  Very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy high-end perfumes on Amazon or eBay.  The vast majority of the time, Chanels will be fake.  There isn&#x27;t much discount anyway, so just order from Macys online if you don&#x27;t want to be ripped off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The 3.4 oz eau de toilette is only $90.  The 3.4 eua de parfum is $115.</li>
