            <li>Was nice to be able to purchase through amazon without a contract but</li>
            <li>All in all its a great product and worth the buy</li>
            <li>My pores look smaller,my skin is smooth, my skintone is bright and more even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure we will reorder.</li>
            <li>The most I have to buy this stuff is three times a year.</li>
            <li>I love my Proactive.</li>
            <li>Love it used it for years .</li>
            <li>I love the exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>Mary Kay works better.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin look a lot better and smoother.  </li>
            <li>I love proactive.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better for me than Proactiv.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>So I am looking for something more affordable.  </li>
            <li>My parents even believe that it is a magical product based on how well and efficient the product works.</li>
            <li>i love you proactive.</li>
            <li>broke out with more acne.</li>
            <li>cause the more</li>
            <li>I used it more i broke out in acne.&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li>I discontinued the product, I broke out even more.</li>
            <li>I love proactive.</li>
            <li>His skin looks so much better which makes him feel do much better about himself</li>
            <li>Love proactiv.</li>
            <li>This product definitely helps with acne but do not get it if you want perfect skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 5-10 years and everytime I am impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my grand daughter .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun (short of prescription medication) and this works the best for me.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>I love it&lt;</li>
            <li>Works OK</li>
            <li>Everything was ok. :)</li>
            <li>This is the best products for teenagers oily facial skin that we have found on the market.  </li>
            <li>Better than cystic.</li>
            <li>I found better results using an oil-free 2% salicylic acid acne wash</li>
            <li>(I currently use the Walgreen&#x27;s brand--which costs about $6.00) works beyond great!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the results.  </li>
            <li>Great to see you can still get the older version.</li>
            <li>Even came in original box!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say her face has improved tremendously since doing so.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice system but this really doesn&#x27;t work filor me, I really liked using it.</li>
            <li>Proactiv has not cleared my face 100% yet, but I am really happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li>You are better building your own three part system - you can find everything you need right here on amazon.</li>
            <li>After a month, I now have clear, smooth and beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>After week three I started to really think, this can&#x27;t be good for</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon carries the original Proactiv.</li>
            <li>Seemed too strong for my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Too strong.</li>
            <li>Love it and was delivered quickly</li>
            <li>With two more headed that way, we&#x27;ll be loyal customers for years to come.</li>
            <li>I used this system back when I was a teenager (about 15 yrs ago lol).</li>
            <li>My face is 95% free of acne.</li>
            <li>and my face was filled with acne.</li>
            <li>Free shipping makes this cheaper than going through Proactive.</li>
            <li>Plus it comes with a free supply of VitaClear.</li>
            <li>My sister experienced the same thing</li>
            <li>So, I know everyone complains about being billed a bunch of times to their credit card - there is a way to make sure that never happens and that&#x27;s to use a GIFT VISA or a gift credit card with just the right amount for Proactiv.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I found I could still get the original system.</li>
            <li>It came with original packaging (no box though).&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv</li>
            <li>At first it broke out more however now</li>
            <li>Proactiv is the only one that effectively removed most of my pimples.</li>
            <li>My complexion is fine with out make up and acne is very, very infrequent.</li>
            <li>Just as described great product recommend to other</li>
            <li>yup, I was lucky to get all the embarrassing times).  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Great deal as I paid this much for a 30 day supply at the my local mall.</li>
            <li>I experienced redness, peeling, cracking just about everything negative not to mention the fact that it made me break out even more.</li>
            <li>So, as you can see, I highly recommend using Proactiv :)</li>
            <li>Now, this is our second purchase of the 60 day system, and her face is beautiful and clear.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin calm.</li>
            <li>I tried the proactive plus and honestly it didn&#x27;t improve my skin enough to keep paying for it.</li>
            <li>Bought it for the wife and it&#x27;s honestly the only thing that works for her skin.</li>
            <li>doing a good job of getting rid of cycstic acne on my 14 year old&#x27;s sensitive face.</li>
            <li>everything is natural &amp; healthy and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>has completely changed my skin for the better -</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s rare.</li>
            <li>seemed to clear my skin better than anything else that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth ur money.</li>
            <li>We went right to the skin doctor.  </li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s as great as it claims though...</li>
            <li>Ordered for teenage sons--works great if used properly!</li>
            <li>I have very, very oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping and quality products</li>
            <li>Ive tried many different cleansers and 3 step systems for my face.</li>
            <li>Proactiv definitely does not help with oil, if anything it seemed to make me more oily.</li>
            <li>and it turned my face red and peely and oily on top of the acne, so</li>
            <li>I used it for about three weeks at first</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I was sketchy to purchase this at first based on all of the reviews however its been about two weeks</li>
            <li>The first time I bought Proactive Solution</li>
            <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again for us but might work for others like it did for us the first time.</li>
            <li>It really helped improve my acne!</li>
            <li>And what is most upsetting is that I used it per the directions, and gave it time to start to correct my skin, and not only did it not work</li>
            <li>If you have enough money on the gift card for more Proactiv, spend it on something immediately.</li>
            <li>This product is mediocre at best, albeit I do not have severe acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for nearly 17years and have only been using this for about a week and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used Proactiv long enough to confidently say it looks, feels, smells and works like authentic Proactiv.</li>
            <li>The green tea moisturizer is great, I have sensitive skin and the lotion burns sometimes, the moisturizer relieves this.</li>
            <li>Their faces are clear and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves her skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I have used proactiv in the past and loved it</li>
            <li>After some strong arming, she finally agreed.  </li>
            <li>Using for 3 weeks now so far so good however dark spots are taking the longest to fade...</li>
            <li>I used Proactiv many years ago and loved it then and thought I&#x27;d try it again when other much more expensive treatment options haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li>Nobody especially a young person deserves to have their self esteem and face ruined forever</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use the whole set all the time</li>
            <li>I really like the results</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t have much of an effect now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even let up a bit on the whole no-sweets diet.  </li>
            <li>When on occasion I eat a whole candy bar or something, I&#x27;ll get one pimple out of nowhere, so there might be something to it.</li>
            <li>I suffered my whole life with acneoff &amp; on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very hopeful.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my face pimple free.</li>
            <li>But if it dries out your skin too fast then do it once a day until your skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li>Anyone using Proactive really needs to take caution with this product.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, my skin was able to repair itself with a lot of TLC, and is fully repaired now, but people need to be careful with Proactive.</li>
            <li>I used proactive for two years and it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to improve my acne.</li>
            <li>This product has done very well.</li>
            <li>and they really like it.</li>
            <li>I used this product before, really damaged my skin.</li>
            <li>But what people don&#x27;t really realize is just how toxic their ingredients are.</li>
            <li>My skin became very irritated after using the product, and it was damaged for some time after that.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as much product as I thought.</li>
            <li>a soft, smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>They use all kind of harsh chemicals like parabens and triethanolamine in their formulas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not even kidding; that was about the only lifestyle change besides an altered appetite (which, again, was just ridding myself of any unhealthy and delicious foods-- mainly the sugary</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve done nothing special for my body since it&#x27;s left</li>
            <li>I remembered the great success I had long ago with Proactiv and went back to it again recently and again was amazed in a very short period of time (a couple of weeks)</li>
            <li>Started to clear up my skin within the first three days.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t clear everyone&#x27;s skin, it&#x27;s not a miracle</li>
            <li>I have tried so many over the counter acne treatments on my teen daughter&#x27;s acne (face, neck, chest, &amp; a virtual sheet of back acne).</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m much older.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and prevents pre-period breakouts, that as an adult, I still get (except no longer, now that I&#x27;m using this!)</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.......</li>
            <li>I used this stuff during high school and to say it did not help my acne is an understatement.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about it being authentic ordering through an Amazon seller</li>
            <li>This original set has worked for me for a very long time.</li>
            <li>This has really helped clear my sons face up.  </li>
            <li>I would buy the sensitive gentle formula if I could find it here.</li>
            <li>This really helped clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>About 2 months ago, I started getting cystic acne all over my face even in places, where I don&#x27;t normally get them.</li>
            <li>It was more embarrassing than having a few pimples on my face.</li>
            <li>but there was no way I could use a three or more step system since I was young and pretty much lazy.</li>
            <li>As long as u use daily &amp; as directed you&#x27;ll notice the difference in 3-5 days and be completely satisfied in a month&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>(it all left right at the end of high school... ...</li>
            <li>If you are more prone to dry skin, I recommend using it only once a day instead of twice as suggested.</li>
            <li>I tried the new Proactiv Plus and did not like it at all.</li>
            <li>Although I Do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I only rated this product three stars because when I first started using this product it did wonders for my face.</li>
            <li>I have used proactiv for 14 years (I wish I didn&#x27;t need it anymore at 32 years old!)</li>
            <li>Trie going through proactiv.com and got completely ripped off!  </li>
            <li>The price of this kit is also greater than other similar products.</li>
            <li>the system is designed to clear your skin temporarily (a few weeks) but the harsh scrubs only tear at the skin causing more breakouts and causes you more money.</li>
            <li>my scars are slowly healing and I haven&#x27;t seen too many new break outs.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many other things (and wasted so much money!)</li>
            <li>Within a week her acne was clearly going away.  </li>
            <li>once a day to keep clear.</li>
            <li>Her skin has never looked so clear.</li>
            <li>, i did order another 60 days and hopefully will clear my face after this.</li>
            <li>My wife had adult acne and was told by a friend to try Proactiv.</li>
            <li>I can use a sensitive skin face wipe and step 2 &amp; 3</li>
            <li>but it always last much, much longer than that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the only skin care product that works for so well for me.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with acne since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li>Now, I am 30 years old</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m 19 years old my skin got used to proactive</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter started to suffer from some acne about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>So far I do see a difference with my skin.  </li>
            <li>Think old saddle bags.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I recommend using LUSH products</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I started experiencing adult acne and decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>Product is working to help clear my adult acne.</li>
            <li>*, I d give it negative stars of I could :)</li>
            <li>so I surprised him.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my grandson (14 years old).</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne, and this just did not work.</li>
            <li>Her acne was so bad that it was leaving scars on her cheeks of her beautiful face.  </li>
            <li>I just stopped eating things like candies, cakes, and just generally anything that was bad for me (except an assorted list of sweet drinks), and my face slooooooowly cleared up on it&#x27;s own (8+ months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really did not clear up my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I wish the refining mask was larger, but I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li>The only things that helped were getting on birth control and switching to a real, hand made, all natural goat&#x27;s milk soap - which is actually gentle on skin - and using argan oil as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff.</li>
            <li>it does clear your skin, the results may only be temporary.</li>
            <li>only caution is that my sensitive skin is burning a hit from the treatment.</li>
            <li>purchased 60 day supply and barely made it thru 30 days</li>
            <li>And one spot on my face actually felt like it was burning and is still sensitive.</li>
            <li>But being a teen is hard enough ;)!!!</li>
            <li>So people will buy the more expensive new proactive.</li>
            <li>It helper me  a little, I would recommend this to someone with very little acne, but for Now  I&#x27;m  on a more natural method</li>
            <li>The formula is not overly powerful or hard for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a noticeable decrease of acne after a couple days using this kit, the revitalizing toner had no success decreasing the oil in my skin (that is very oily).</li>
            <li>and not sure if the price is worth it,</li>
            <li>When she hit her late 40s, the acne finally stopped and she was able to begin using other products.  </li>
            <li>He is a 16 year old farm boy who doesn&#x27;t have much interest in anything past soap and water, so this is a big thumbs up to this product!!</li>
            <li>I decided to try Proactiv despite the negative reviews and because my friend had an apothecary store in LA for years &amp; she heard positive things about Proactiv frequently.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll get to use at least half from each.&lt;br /&gt;Go to the mall and spend the extra few dollars and get the good, non defective products.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My pores look smaller,my skin is smooth, my skintone is bright and more even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure we will reorder.</li>
            <li> The most I have to buy this stuff is three times a year.</li>
            <li> I love my Proactive.</li>
            <li> Love it used it for years .</li>
            <li> I love the exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay works better.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin look a lot better and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I love proactive.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better for me than Proactiv.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> So I am looking for something more affordable.  </li>
            <li> My parents even believe that it is a magical product based on how well and efficient the product works.</li>
            <li> i love you proactive.</li>
            <li> broke out with more acne.</li>
            <li> cause the more</li>
            <li> I used it more i broke out in acne.&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li> I discontinued the product, I broke out even more.</li>
            <li> I love proactive.</li>
            <li> His skin looks so much better which makes him feel do much better about himself</li>
            <li> Love proactiv.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helps with acne but do not get it if you want perfect skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 5-10 years and everytime I am impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my grand daughter .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun (short of prescription medication) and this works the best for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;</li>
            <li> Works OK</li>
            <li> Everything was ok. :)</li>
            <li> This is the best products for teenagers oily facial skin that we have found on the market.  </li>
            <li> Better than cystic.</li>
            <li> I found better results using an oil-free 2% salicylic acid acne wash</li>
            <li> (I currently use the Walgreen&#x27;s brand--which costs about $6.00) works beyond great!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the results.  </li>
            <li> Great to see you can still get the older version.</li>
            <li> Even came in original box!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say her face has improved tremendously since doing so.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice system but this really doesn&#x27;t work filor me, I really liked using it.</li>
            <li> Proactiv has not cleared my face 100% yet, but I am really happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> You are better building your own three part system - you can find everything you need right here on amazon.</li>
            <li> After a month, I now have clear, smooth and beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> After week three I started to really think, this can&#x27;t be good for</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon carries the original Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Seemed too strong for my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Too strong.</li>
            <li> Love it and was delivered quickly</li>
            <li> With two more headed that way, we&#x27;ll be loyal customers for years to come.</li>
            <li> I used this system back when I was a teenager (about 15 yrs ago lol).</li>
            <li> My face is 95% free of acne.</li>
            <li> and my face was filled with acne.</li>
            <li> Free shipping makes this cheaper than going through Proactive.</li>
            <li> Plus it comes with a free supply of VitaClear.</li>
            <li> My sister experienced the same thing</li>
            <li> So, I know everyone complains about being billed a bunch of times to their credit card - there is a way to make sure that never happens and that&#x27;s to use a GIFT VISA or a gift credit card with just the right amount for Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I found I could still get the original system.</li>
            <li> It came with original packaging (no box though).&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv</li>
            <li> At first it broke out more however now</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the only one that effectively removed most of my pimples.</li>
            <li> My complexion is fine with out make up and acne is very, very infrequent.</li>
            <li> Just as described great product recommend to other</li>
            <li> yup, I was lucky to get all the embarrassing times).  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Great deal as I paid this much for a 30 day supply at the my local mall.</li>
            <li> I experienced redness, peeling, cracking just about everything negative not to mention the fact that it made me break out even more.</li>
            <li> So, as you can see, I highly recommend using Proactiv :)</li>
            <li> Now, this is our second purchase of the 60 day system, and her face is beautiful and clear.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin calm.</li>
            <li> I tried the proactive plus and honestly it didn&#x27;t improve my skin enough to keep paying for it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the wife and it&#x27;s honestly the only thing that works for her skin.</li>
            <li> doing a good job of getting rid of cycstic acne on my 14 year old&#x27;s sensitive face.</li>
            <li> everything is natural &amp; healthy and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> has completely changed my skin for the better -</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s rare.</li>
            <li> seemed to clear my skin better than anything else that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth ur money.</li>
            <li> We went right to the skin doctor.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s as great as it claims though...</li>
            <li> Ordered for teenage sons--works great if used properly!</li>
            <li> I have very, very oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping and quality products</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different cleansers and 3 step systems for my face.</li>
            <li> Proactiv definitely does not help with oil, if anything it seemed to make me more oily.</li>
            <li> and it turned my face red and peely and oily on top of the acne, so</li>
            <li> I used it for about three weeks at first</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was sketchy to purchase this at first based on all of the reviews however its been about two weeks</li>
            <li> The first time I bought Proactive Solution</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again for us but might work for others like it did for us the first time.</li>
            <li> It really helped improve my acne!</li>
            <li> And what is most upsetting is that I used it per the directions, and gave it time to start to correct my skin, and not only did it not work</li>
            <li> If you have enough money on the gift card for more Proactiv, spend it on something immediately.</li>
            <li> This product is mediocre at best, albeit I do not have severe acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for nearly 17years and have only been using this for about a week and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used Proactiv long enough to confidently say it looks, feels, smells and works like authentic Proactiv.</li>
            <li> The green tea moisturizer is great, I have sensitive skin and the lotion burns sometimes, the moisturizer relieves this.</li>
            <li> Their faces are clear and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves her skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I have used proactiv in the past and loved it</li>
            <li> After some strong arming, she finally agreed.  </li>
            <li> Using for 3 weeks now so far so good however dark spots are taking the longest to fade...</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv many years ago and loved it then and thought I&#x27;d try it again when other much more expensive treatment options haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> Nobody especially a young person deserves to have their self esteem and face ruined forever</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use the whole set all the time</li>
            <li> I really like the results</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t have much of an effect now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even let up a bit on the whole no-sweets diet.  </li>
            <li> When on occasion I eat a whole candy bar or something, I&#x27;ll get one pimple out of nowhere, so there might be something to it.</li>
            <li> I suffered my whole life with acneoff &amp; on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hopeful.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my face pimple free.</li>
            <li> But if it dries out your skin too fast then do it once a day until your skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li> Anyone using Proactive really needs to take caution with this product.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, my skin was able to repair itself with a lot of TLC, and is fully repaired now, but people need to be careful with Proactive.</li>
            <li> I used proactive for two years and it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to improve my acne.</li>
            <li> This product has done very well.</li>
            <li> and they really like it.</li>
            <li> I used this product before, really damaged my skin.</li>
            <li> But what people don&#x27;t really realize is just how toxic their ingredients are.</li>
            <li> My skin became very irritated after using the product, and it was damaged for some time after that.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as much product as I thought.</li>
            <li> a soft, smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> They use all kind of harsh chemicals like parabens and triethanolamine in their formulas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not even kidding; that was about the only lifestyle change besides an altered appetite (which, again, was just ridding myself of any unhealthy and delicious foods-- mainly the sugary</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve done nothing special for my body since it&#x27;s left</li>
            <li> I remembered the great success I had long ago with Proactiv and went back to it again recently and again was amazed in a very short period of time (a couple of weeks)</li>
            <li> Started to clear up my skin within the first three days.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t clear everyone&#x27;s skin, it&#x27;s not a miracle</li>
            <li> I have tried so many over the counter acne treatments on my teen daughter&#x27;s acne (face, neck, chest, &amp; a virtual sheet of back acne).</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m much older.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and prevents pre-period breakouts, that as an adult, I still get (except no longer, now that I&#x27;m using this!)</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.......</li>
            <li> I used this stuff during high school and to say it did not help my acne is an understatement.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about it being authentic ordering through an Amazon seller</li>
            <li> This original set has worked for me for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This has really helped clear my sons face up.  </li>
            <li> I would buy the sensitive gentle formula if I could find it here.</li>
            <li> This really helped clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> About 2 months ago, I started getting cystic acne all over my face even in places, where I don&#x27;t normally get them.</li>
            <li> It was more embarrassing than having a few pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> but there was no way I could use a three or more step system since I was young and pretty much lazy.</li>
            <li> As long as u use daily &amp; as directed you&#x27;ll notice the difference in 3-5 days and be completely satisfied in a month&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> (it all left right at the end of high school... ...</li>
            <li> If you are more prone to dry skin, I recommend using it only once a day instead of twice as suggested.</li>
            <li> I tried the new Proactiv Plus and did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Although I Do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I only rated this product three stars because when I first started using this product it did wonders for my face.</li>
            <li> I have used proactiv for 14 years (I wish I didn&#x27;t need it anymore at 32 years old!)</li>
            <li> Trie going through proactiv.com and got completely ripped off!  </li>
            <li> The price of this kit is also greater than other similar products.</li>
            <li> the system is designed to clear your skin temporarily (a few weeks) but the harsh scrubs only tear at the skin causing more breakouts and causes you more money.</li>
            <li> my scars are slowly healing and I haven&#x27;t seen too many new break outs.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many other things (and wasted so much money!)</li>
            <li> Within a week her acne was clearly going away.  </li>
            <li> once a day to keep clear.</li>
            <li> Her skin has never looked so clear.</li>
            <li> , i did order another 60 days and hopefully will clear my face after this.</li>
            <li> My wife had adult acne and was told by a friend to try Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I can use a sensitive skin face wipe and step 2 &amp; 3</li>
            <li> but it always last much, much longer than that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the only skin care product that works for so well for me.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li> Now, I am 30 years old</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m 19 years old my skin got used to proactive</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter started to suffer from some acne about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> So far I do see a difference with my skin.  </li>
            <li> Think old saddle bags.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I recommend using LUSH products</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started experiencing adult acne and decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> Product is working to help clear my adult acne.</li>
            <li> *, I d give it negative stars of I could :)</li>
            <li> so I surprised him.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson (14 years old).</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne, and this just did not work.</li>
            <li> Her acne was so bad that it was leaving scars on her cheeks of her beautiful face.  </li>
            <li> I just stopped eating things like candies, cakes, and just generally anything that was bad for me (except an assorted list of sweet drinks), and my face slooooooowly cleared up on it&#x27;s own (8+ months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really did not clear up my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I wish the refining mask was larger, but I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li> The only things that helped were getting on birth control and switching to a real, hand made, all natural goat&#x27;s milk soap - which is actually gentle on skin - and using argan oil as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff.</li>
            <li> it does clear your skin, the results may only be temporary.</li>
            <li> only caution is that my sensitive skin is burning a hit from the treatment.</li>
            <li> purchased 60 day supply and barely made it thru 30 days</li>
            <li> And one spot on my face actually felt like it was burning and is still sensitive.</li>
            <li> But being a teen is hard enough ;)!!!</li>
            <li> So people will buy the more expensive new proactive.</li>
            <li> It helper me  a little, I would recommend this to someone with very little acne, but for Now  I&#x27;m  on a more natural method</li>
            <li> The formula is not overly powerful or hard for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a noticeable decrease of acne after a couple days using this kit, the revitalizing toner had no success decreasing the oil in my skin (that is very oily).</li>
            <li> and not sure if the price is worth it,</li>
            <li> When she hit her late 40s, the acne finally stopped and she was able to begin using other products.  </li>
            <li> He is a 16 year old farm boy who doesn&#x27;t have much interest in anything past soap and water, so this is a big thumbs up to this product!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try Proactiv despite the negative reviews and because my friend had an apothecary store in LA for years &amp; she heard positive things about Proactiv frequently.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll get to use at least half from each.&lt;br /&gt;Go to the mall and spend the extra few dollars and get the good, non defective products.  </li>
            <li> Finally after trying several other things to clear my face up (apple cider vinegar, purpose, oil washing)</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed that she started to get wrinkles under her eyes (not normal for a 16 year old) and it did not clear up the acne.  </li>
            <li> Its harsh on the skin but its totally worth it, my skin dried out for the first few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> my face felt dry and gritty, then my skin started to peel.</li>
            <li> However, as an adult, I&#x27;m finding using regular soap is drying out my skin and leaving white dry, flaky, patches all over my face that severely itch and begin to peel (not to mention, left me with an uneven skin complexion)!  </li>
            <li> This product did not clear my skin and left a dry rash all over my face.</li>
            <li> No it will not completely erase every single flaw on your face but it definitely helps control breakouts.</li>
            <li> We tried some over the counter products including Lush (coal face and other alleged acne products), and some items we got from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> The only things I didn&#x27;t like was I would rather have a bigger size of the lotion and toner than the other item provided I never had any use for it.  </li>
            <li> was too embarrassing for high school, so I was forced to stick with the ol standard curse till healthier eating</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It did keep the large under the skin blemishes at bay, but little white heads and annoying spots are way way more noticable since using this.  </li>
            <li> long term use was breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> so my dermatologist suggested I only use once a day or once every other day.</li>
            <li> It will make your skin glow &amp; you&#x27;ll wonder why you waited so long to try this!</li>
            <li> This stuff made my face burn, and so dry it was flaky.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> so it may or may not work for you based on how oily/ dry etc your skin is.</li>
            <li> My face became extremely dry and was burned.  </li>
            <li> I had a towel I used to dry my face after using, the color was changing after as if I used bleach on it, would never recommend.</li>
            <li> Also it did dry my skin out in some places and of course the hassle of depending on an item you have to order.</li>
            <li> Proactiv made my skin so dry it&#x27;s peeling off.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 1.5 months now and all it has done is dry out my skin to the point that it started peeling.</li>
            <li> tried this Proactiv program (and a couple different scrubs here and there, including a doctor&#x27;s prescription program thing) for only a few days</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have sensitive skin, because Benzoyl Peroxide was unbelievably harsh.</li>
            <li> Proactive has such a huge hype, most likely due to there excessive commercials and ads, but the product itself is awful.</li>
            <li> now my acme at a point was bad enough that I gladly would have smeared gas (not really, but you get my drift) on my face.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for cystic (terrible, huge, painful mounds of acne- that lasts for weeks/months)</li>
            <li> It looks gross, and moisturizer will stop it for a little while</li>
            <li> His face trait isn&#x27;t that bad he mostly has oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out to the point that I had to actually oil it.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin, made it irritable and itchy, and red!</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> Such a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> did say a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have seen it work wonders for other people.</li>
            <li> All that moisturizer and other stuff</li>
            <li> but sometimes makes my skin a little dry</li>
            <li> The kit is composed by a renewing Cleanser and a repairing lotion, the active ingredient is Benzoyl Peroxide, there is also a revitalizing toner that helps removing excess oil from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She only uses a small amount every night on a few pimples.</li>
            <li> Even fading some of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> When I used this product a few years ago for small blemishes, they cleared up for 1 month and came back with rage, still while using proactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I tried this, very hopeful and my face is very broken out.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed his face gets less oily during the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> literally did no special face</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using I notice much less acne</li>
            <li> This product is miracles in little bottles.</li>
            <li> Although I think is was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> But it helped a little.</li>
            <li> Both lotion and cleanser came with broken tips on lids which I recently realized that half of the containers are already dried.</li>
            <li> I like the products but kinda dried out my skin</li>
            <li> really dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> Harsh on your face, so it can take awhile for your skin to get used to the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Really dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> I guess the tip of lid missing when u close them</li>
            <li> it took a few weeks before I saw results - but it does work</li>
            <li> Proactiv is notorious for their unethical business practices - all you have to do is read a few horror stories on the internet about how they won&#x27;t stop billing you.  </li>
            <li> It breaks out a little (usually once a month if you know what I mean), but there is really not much you can do about that.  </li>
            <li> Actually, my acne is the worst it has EVER been while using this for the full two months.</li>
            <li> Years later, my teenage daughter has now developed horrible acne.</li>
            <li> It also came with a small tube &amp;#34;Refining Mask&amp;#34;, and a sample size of the Green Tea Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My son has used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if it even works at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a 35 year old who suffers from Acme this product does work.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need them they&#x27;re pointless.</li>
            <li> After using Proactiv for the past month, my face has cleared up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than the cheaper stuff you can buy at any drug store.</li>
            <li> Ill update the results later</li>
            <li> Im always skeptical to purchase items that are over advertised but after ordering and using as directed I did notice my pores were smaller.  </li>
            <li> No more itching, peeling, discoloration of my skin, or blackheads on my nose.  </li>
            <li> This time it has hardly even controlled her acne.</li>
            <li> Bought this from the TV ad for my teenage daughter who suffers from acne.</li>
            <li> but  at least 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> so i thought it would work for in my late 20</li>
            <li> Kids don t fall this garbage with harsh chemicals that will make your skin look worse, they use celebrities to bring in people to buy this trash.</li>
            <li> I started having a serious breakout along my jawline and under my chin.</li>
            <li> I personally do not have bad acne, but when I&#x27;m breaking out because of stress etc.</li>
            <li> Big painful breakouts too.&lt;br /&gt;Dryness</li>
            <li> the doctor prescribed made her face worse.  </li>
            <li> I am 25 and still suffer from acne, worse in the summer.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have bad acne just those little break outs and her skin</li>
            <li> it was too expensive for me to use when I was a young&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact they&#x27;re worse, like cystic!</li>
            <li> Ah yes I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product hasnt worked for me.  </li>
            <li> The cost through Proactiv+ is just too expensive.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is not perfect yet.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had 3 teenagers and Proactiv hasn&#x27;t failed one yet.</li>
            <li> I started having really bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a bad reaction to these products.</li>
            <li> but i have to say sometimes i still get really bad pimples not like before</li>
            <li> you for bad sheeping</li>
            <li> He is 19 and is frustrated with his skin</li>
            <li> Therefore, I was desperate and I decided to buy a 5 step 30 day trial and Bingo!</li>
            <li> hated it, this product is definetly NOT made for every bodies skin.</li>
            <li> I HATE PROACTIVE!!!</li>
            <li> 1 week and my awful breakouts were GONE!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I had horrible sebaceous cysts that I had to take antibiotics for.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product</li>
            <li> the worst skincare system ever!</li>
            <li> I look horrible!  </li>
            <li> Ordered off TV and very disappointed with the results after using the product!</li>
            <li> I took antibiotics from the Dermatologist for my acne, the terrible peeling creams...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I would buy this again and again. Remarkable product. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My teenager daughter says this is helping with her facial issues. I&#x27;m sure we will reorder.</li>
            <li> Bought this from the TV ad for my teenage daughter who suffers from acne. She had an adverse reaction and her skin started to peel. We had to seek a dermatologist who told us this product has ruined people&#x27;s faces and caused irreversible affect. Please don&#x27;t buy this for yourself or others. Nobody especially a young person deserves to have their self esteem and face ruined forever</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.......</li>
            <li> This product is miracles in little bottles.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he is actually using it!! He is a 16 year old farm boy who doesn&#x27;t have much interest in anything past soap and water, so this is a big thumbs up to this product!!</li>
            <li> This has really helped clear my sons face up.  We have a ways to go but we will be doing it with Proactive!</li>
            <li> I have used proactiv in the past and loved it</li>
            <li> I HATE PROACTIVE!!! I DESTROYED MY SKIN!!! I had beautiful skin before I put this poison on my face! Please please please don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> My wife had adult acne and was told by a friend to try Proactiv. After years of acne, it finally cleared up her face.  When she hit her late 40s, the acne finally stopped and she was able to begin using other products.  Years later, my teenage daughter has now developed horrible acne. It covers her cheeks (and some of it appears to be cystic).  We tried some over the counter products including Lush (coal face and other alleged acne products), and some items we got from the dermatologist.  Nothing worked.  Finally we told her that she had to try the Proactiv.  I don&#x27;t know why she fought us, but she simply did not want to use it.  After some strong arming, she finally agreed.  Within a week her acne was clearly going away.  Her acne was so bad that it was leaving scars on her cheeks of her beautiful face.  Now, this is our second purchase of the 60 day system, and her face is beautiful and clear.  It breaks out a little (usually once a month if you know what I mean), but there is really not much you can do about that.  She is thrilled with the results and so are we.</li>
            <li> Seemed too strong for my daughter&#x27;s skin. Also the system takes quite a bit of time to do properly each day.</li>
            <li> Only product that works for me. I don&#x27;t have to use the whole set all the time but  at least 2-3 times a week. I can use a sensitive skin face wipe and step 2 &amp; 3 once a day to keep clear. Sometimes I&#x27;ll skip step 3 at night. I use Jojoba oil for moisturizer. I use Heather Loraine cosmetics cert org., (red label)&lt;br /&gt;My skin stays happy!</li>
            <li> It did a wonderful job I love it !!!</li>
            <li> Have both kids using Proactive with great success.  It works!</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv since I was in the 8th grade (I am now 20) and it works wonderfully. No it will not completely erase every single flaw on your face but it definitely helps control breakouts. If you are more prone to dry skin, I recommend using it only once a day instead of twice as suggested. Also, I understand the price may seem to hold you back on purchasing it but don&#x27;t let that stop you. It says 60 day treatment but it always last much, much longer than that. The most I have to buy this stuff is three times a year. So, as you can see, I highly recommend using Proactiv :)</li>
            <li> I used this system back when I was a teenager (about 15 yrs ago lol). My skin was AMAZING! Not a pore. Then I quit using it bc it was too expensive for me to use when I was a young&lt;br /&gt;adult just getting out on my own. Then recently, at the age of 30, my face decided to have an adolescent flashback! I started having really bad breakouts. In fact they&#x27;re worse, like cystic! I&#x27;d never has this in my life. I tried the proactive plus and honestly it didn&#x27;t improve my skin enough to keep paying for it. Finally after trying several other things to clear my face up (apple cider vinegar, purpose, oil washing) I found I could still get the original system. 1 week and my awful breakouts were GONE! My pores look smaller,my skin is smooth, my skintone is bright and more even. I&#x27;ll never quit again! My holy grail skin care routine!</li>
            <li> Proactive is amazing. I have seen the ad on TV for years and finally decided to try it out. I wish I had done this 10 year ago. After a month, I now have clear, smooth and beautiful skin. I&#x27;m a guy and yes, my skin is now beautiful ;-))</li>
            <li> I love my Proactive. It&#x27;s really the only skin care product that works for so well for me. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product and nice beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Horrible. This product is like the &amp;#34;beats&amp;#34; of facial wash. Proactive has such a huge hype, most likely due to there excessive commercials and ads, but the product itself is awful. I used the proactive 3 step acne treatment for almost 6 months before giving up because nothing had improved. I would recommend something like murad or epiduo. Those products will give you the actual results you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Love it used it for years .</li>
            <li> My son is very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I really like the results</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne since I was 12 years old. Now, I am 30 years old and I have tried everything you can think of including lasers. I have to say that a very effective treatment was birth control pills combined with antibiotics that a dermatologist prescribed. However, now that I am considering going to pregnancy, I need to stick with products. About 2 months ago, I started getting cystic acne all over my face even in places, where I don&#x27;t normally get them. Therefore, I was desperate and I decided to buy a 5 step 30 day trial and Bingo! My face is 95% free of acne. Proactiv has not cleared my face 100% yet, but I am really happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li> My son has used in the past.  He likes it</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 16 yrs olf great grand daughter and she like it</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different cleansers and 3 step systems for my face. Proactiv is the only one that effectively removed most of my pimples. I have very, very oily, acne prone skin. Proactiv definitely does not help with oil, if anything it seemed to make me more oily. Its harsh on the skin but its totally worth it, my skin dried out for the first few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I only rated this product three stars because when I first started using this product it did wonders for my face. I started using proactive around age 9-10 and I was using it for about 5-7 years. Now that I&#x27;m 19 years old my skin got used to proactive so it doesn&#x27;t have much of an effect now. I would recommend this product if your in the beginning stages of puberty.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter started to suffer from some acne about a year ago.  We went right to the skin doctor.  She tried like 4 or 5 different medications prescribed by the doctor to no avail.  To be honest...some of the medications (creams or pill) the doctor prescribed made her face worse.  I decided to try the Proactiv Repairing Treatment only.You can buy this 2oz size on Amazon for about $35.  I can honestly say her face has improved tremendously since doing so.  She only uses a small amount every night on a few pimples. We are sticking with it for the time being. Good luck everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> Ah yes I was skeptical. But I tried it. I am only 4 days in and there is a visible difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 48 and suddenly had acne again. Desperation sent me here. Day 1- saw a difference the next morning. The masque treatment shrunk my blemishes over night. I love the exfoliating cleanser. My skin is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution is that my sensitive skin is burning a hit from the treatment. It goes away after one to two hours. I would buy the sensitive gentle formula if I could find it here. Their regular site is a bit of an ordering nightmare so I will only buy here.</li>
            <li> I just stopped eating things like candies, cakes, and just generally anything that was bad for me (except an assorted list of sweet drinks), and my face slooooooowly cleared up on it&#x27;s own (8+ months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this Proactiv program (and a couple different scrubs here and there, including a doctor&#x27;s prescription program thing) for only a few days and it turned my face red and peely and oily on top of the acne, so I up n&#x27; quit.  I&#x27;m still not sure if it even works at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point is, red, peely, oily, and still with acne was too embarrassing for high school, so I was forced to stick with the ol standard curse till healthier eating seemingly did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally did no special face treatments-- not even a daily face washing-- except sleeping facedown (which I still do like everyday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even kidding; that was about the only lifestyle change besides an altered appetite (which, again, was just ridding myself of any unhealthy and delicious foods-- mainly the sugary kinds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So try drinking a lot alternatively.  Not alcohol you poseurs-- and definitely not what&#x27;s in these Proactiv containers.  Just try to flush it all out I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been 3 years without acne and I&#x27;ve done nothing special for my body since it&#x27;s left (it all left right at the end of high school... ...yup, I was lucky to get all the embarrassing times).  I&#x27;ve even let up a bit on the whole no-sweets diet.  When on occasion I eat a whole candy bar or something, I&#x27;ll get one pimple out of nowhere, so there might be something to it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the wife and it&#x27;s honestly the only thing that works for her skin.</li>
            <li> Get on time, works perfectly and the expiration date is on 2016.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He is starting to notice results.  His face trait isn&#x27;t that bad he mostly has oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;He says it feels great after using it and I have noticed his face gets less oily during the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars not 5 just bc is so dang expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did say a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I think proactiv has changed the formula of this. So people will buy the more expensive new proactive. We will no longer be purchasing this. Mary Kay works better.</li>
            <li> This really helped clear up my skin.  I use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> This product truly works, only thing I was bummed about was seeing that I could buy this set out of a vending machine in my local mall for $19.99 vs. the $60+ I paid here on amazon.</li>
            <li> doing a good job of getting rid of cycstic acne on my 14 year old&#x27;s sensitive face.</li>
            <li> got it for my daughter, works good</li>
            <li> So far I do see a difference with my skin.  It does make my skin look a lot better and smoother.  Even fading some of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> The best product there is.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my face burn, and so dry it was flaky. It was more embarrassing than having a few pimples on my face. I couldn&#x27;t cover up the flakes with makeup. I plan to try to use this product once a week to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> I love proactive. My skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Nothings change during those times i used .....</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t work as great as I thought it would I still have smaller acne around my check area.</li>
            <li> I like the products but kinda dried out my skin</li>
            <li> My granddaughter likes it and it has helped her skin condition.  She is very satisfied with it.  Although I think is was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping and quality products</li>
            <li> Proactiv you DO work!</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out to the point that I had to actually oil it. I have seen it work wonders for other people. Maybe it just isn&#x27;t what I needed.</li>
            <li> As a 35 year old who suffers from Acme this product does work. I used it for about three weeks at first it was great, but......&lt;br /&gt;I started getting acme in places I&#x27;d never gotten it before, my neck for one. Big painful breakouts too.&lt;br /&gt;Dryness, oh my. If I was to continue using this it was going to age my skin way faster than time and sun could. Think old saddle bags.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone was just...yuck. My ski color wasn&#x27;t the best.&lt;br /&gt;Everything except the moisturizer has chemicals in it...now my acme at a point was bad enough that I gladly would have smeared gas (not really, but you get my drift) on my face. After week three I started to really think, this can&#x27;t be good for me.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer sucks.&lt;br /&gt;Yea.... I won&#x27;t be back.</li>
            <li> I suffered my whole life with acneoff &amp; on. It just happens and I&#x27;d go through times buying and trying anything to fix it. Proactiv is the only thing that helped me. The cleanser, toner &amp; treatment are the only things that matter. All that moisturizer and other stuff you don&#x27;t need. Use the cleanser, toner and treatment on face and neck every day. Moisturizers and proactiv masks you don&#x27;t need them they&#x27;re pointless.</li>
            <li> hated it, this product is definetly NOT made for every bodies skin. I used it for literally 3days morning and night and yes my face cleared up but the side effect opened my pores and kept them open for 2 weeks! my face felt dry and gritty, then my skin started to peel. I felt so embarrassed. I recommend using LUSH products everything is natural &amp; healthy and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I had horrible sebaceous cysts that I had to take antibiotics for.  After using Proactiv for the past month, my face has cleared up. It is a great product and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great shipping!</li>
            <li> I decided to try Proactiv despite the negative reviews and because my friend had an apothecary store in LA for years &amp; she heard positive things about Proactiv frequently. I have tried so many over the counter acne treatments on my teen daughter&#x27;s acne (face, neck, chest, &amp; a virtual sheet of back acne). Her skin has cleared up 80% in 3 DAYS!!! My daughter is SO happy as her acne has been the bain of her existence.&lt;br /&gt;First world problems, I know. But being a teen is hard enough ;)!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expect to see</li>
            <li> wife loves this product</li>
            <li> Just started using it. Will see how it works in about a month.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft. Its actually giving me pimples instead of making them go away. Will not be ordering this product again</li>
            <li> My daughter had a bad reaction to these products. If your skin is sensitive this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Love it and was delivered quickly</li>
            <li> Will my card be charged every month?</li>
            <li> It was as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s proactive. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better for me than Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Great seller. Horrible product</li>
            <li> This is a really nice system but this really doesn&#x27;t work filor me, I really liked using it. It helper me  a little, I would recommend this to someone with very little acne, but for Now  I&#x27;m  on a more natural method</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves the product and it works.  My shipment came on time.</li>
            <li> My daughter was really happy with the results as well as the quickness of getting it to her, thankyou</li>
            <li> i used to use Proactiv when I was a teenager and my face was filled with acne. I don&#x27;t remember if it worked or not but I decided to give it another try now that I&#x27;m much older. I started having a serious breakout along my jawline and under my chin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 days now and I&#x27;m noticing improvements. I&#x27;m very hopeful. I should have done a before and after. Oh well.</li>
            <li> the worst skincare system ever! the system is designed to clear your skin temporarily (a few weeks) but the harsh scrubs only tear at the skin causing more breakouts and causes you more money. I have waisted hundreds of dollars on this skincare system and would not recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I got it today. Arrived quickly. Came in a nice packaged kit box. Had informative reading material. Came with a cleanser, toner, and some sort &amp;#34;Repairing Treatment&amp;#34;. It also came with a small tube &amp;#34;Refining Mask&amp;#34;, and a sample size of the Green Tea Moisturizer. Seems to work okay, I&#x27;ve only used it once, my face does feel tighter afterwards... not sure if it&#x27;s as great as it claims though... and not sure if the price is worth it, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> it seems to work but i have to say sometimes i still get really bad pimples not like before but i still get some but i have to say the product itself i would give an 8 out of 10 and it also has a very nice smell to it :)</li>
            <li> Good product but really dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> Still hasn&#x27;t cleared up her skin. But it helped a little.</li>
            <li> Great deal as I paid this much for a 30 day supply at the my local mall. It works!</li>
            <li> I have used proactiv for 14 years (I wish I didn&#x27;t need it anymore at 32 years old!) but it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my face pimple free.</li>
            <li> Does its job. Doesn&#x27;t treat blackheads and whiteheads or cystic acne though. Harsh on your face, so it can take awhile for your skin to get used to the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv many years ago and loved it then and thought I&#x27;d try it again when other much more expensive treatment options haven&#x27;t worked. I remembered the great success I had long ago with Proactiv and went back to it again recently and again was amazed in a very short period of time (a couple of weeks) how truly effective these products continue to be! I&#x27;ve already again recommended to others!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product hasnt worked for me.  I was using the Proactiv+ system and it was working MIRACLES for my skin.  The cost through Proactiv+ is just too expensive.  ($50 a month).  So I am looking for something more affordable.  I tried this, very hopeful and my face is very broken out.  It did keep the large under the skin blemishes at bay, but little white heads and annoying spots are way way more noticable since using this.  Bummer.  Returning the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactiv for years and this is the best anti-acne product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Even came in original box!</li>
            <li> Bought for my 13yo daughter. Her skin has never looked so clear. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about it being authentic ordering through an Amazon seller but I&#x27;ve used Proactiv long enough to confidently say it looks, feels, smells and works like authentic Proactiv. It came with original packaging (no box though).&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv has completely changed my skin for the better - I tried so many other things (and wasted so much money!) that didn&#x27;t work, then I found this about six years ago. I used to get big red pimples through my T-zone and deep cyst-like zits around my period. I still get the occasional zit but it&#x27;s rare. I have combination skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> When I need Proactive the most is when the product comes through in the clutch! I personally do not have bad acne, but when I&#x27;m breaking out because of stress etc. and need to clear my face from acne Proactive is the best product I have ever tried. My parents even believe that it is a magical product based on how well and efficient the product works.</li>
            <li> Product works amazing!!! Started to clear up my skin within the first three days. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> omg. never again will i ever use anything else, even a la roche posay. when it comes to my forehead, proactive has waved its wand. i love you proactive. i will continue to pray (pay) to the proactive gods</li>
            <li> I was sketchy to purchase this at first based on all of the reviews however its been about two weeks and my skin has cleared up fairly well. Like all products it depends on your skin type. Not everyone is the same so it may or may not work for you based on how oily/ dry etc your skin is. At first it broke out more however now my scars are slowly healing and I haven&#x27;t seen too many new break outs.  I am really impressed with this product and would reccomd that you try it out for yourself. Its good to apply morning and night for best results. But if it dries out your skin too fast then do it once a day until your skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li> Working great on my teens problem areas.</li>
            <li> Great product Works well</li>
            <li> Just as described great product recommend to other</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter and it has been awesome.  She doesn&#x27;t have bad acne just those little break outs and her skin looks great !!  Highly recommend!!!!  Rodan and Fields are awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work well at all.  Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> seemed to clear my skin better than anything else that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Really dried my skin out. I have sensitive skin. This product did not clear my skin and left a dry rash all over my face. Would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> broke out with more acne. this product did not work for me. i used it for 6 months and stop using it cause the more I used it more i broke out in acne.&lt;br /&gt;try Obagi cleanser gel it work amazing on my face...</li>
            <li> I started experiencing adult acne and decided to give this product a try.  A week later I have buyers remorse and a messed up face!  I actually got acne while using this product as directed.  My face became extremely dry and was burned.  I look horrible!  Do not buy.  See a dermatologist in your area for help with your acne.</li>
            <li> purchased 60 day supply and barely made it thru 30 days</li>
            <li> Anyone using Proactive really needs to take caution with this product. Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t clear everyone&#x27;s skin, it&#x27;s not a miracle potion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does clear your skin, the results may only be temporary. When I used this product a few years ago for small blemishes, they cleared up for 1 month and came back with rage, still while using proactive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I discontinued the product, I broke out even more. Thankfully, my skin was able to repair itself with a lot of TLC, and is fully repaired now, but people need to be careful with Proactive.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Product seemed to help my teenager but the cost is astronomical!  Trie going through proactiv.com and got completely ripped off!  Was nice to be able to purchase through amazon without a contract but long term use was breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> I love proactive. I wish the refining mask was larger, but I&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandson (16) and he is very pleased with it. His skin looks so much better which makes him feel do much better about himself</li>
            <li> Love proactiv. Only thing that clears up my acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it every day. Great product</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using I notice much less acne but my skin is not perfect yet. This product definitely helps with acne but do not get it if you want perfect skin.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and still suffer from acne, worse in the summer. I take care of my skin with multiple products and none of them stand up to proactive. I have been using this product for the last 5-10 years and everytime I am impressed with the results. It keeps my skin calm. The green tea moisturizer is great, I have sensitive skin and the lotion burns sometimes, the moisturizer relieves this.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my grand daughter . Product cleared her face in about two weeks .loved it I will continue buying it for her</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon carries the original Proactiv. Free shipping makes this cheaper than going through Proactive. Plus I can order and have it in 2 days with my Prime account. I tried the new Proactiv Plus and did not like it at all. This original set has worked for me for a very long time. I am thinking 8 years now. I haven&#x27;t worn any foundation, powder or concealer on my face since I have been using Proactiv. My complexion is fine with out make up and acne is very, very infrequent. Like once or twice a year infrequent. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used proactive for two years and it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to improve my acne. The only things that helped were getting on birth control and switching to a real, hand made, all natural goat&#x27;s milk soap - which is actually gentle on skin - and using argan oil as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for nearly 17years and have only been using this for about a week and my skin has never looked better! I love it! My skin a soft, smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Both lotion and cleanser came with broken tips on lids which I recently realized that half of the containers are already dried. I guess the tip of lid missing when u close them causes air to go in. Hopefully I&#x27;ll get to use at least half from each.&lt;br /&gt;Go to the mall and spend the extra few dollars and get the good, non defective products.  I would not recommend purchase of his product on Amazon to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is really good...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun (short of prescription medication) and this works the best for me. It&#x27;s gentle and prevents pre-period breakouts, that as an adult, I still get (except no longer, now that I&#x27;m using this!) Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This stuff works - it took a few weeks before I saw results - but it does work</li>
            <li> Ordered for teenage sons--works great if used properly!</li>
            <li> Product is working to help clear my adult acne. Although I Do have very sensitive skin so my dermatologist suggested I only use once a day or once every other day. This has become a part of my routine. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> This product has done very well. It&#x27;s actually for my kids and they really like it. Their faces are clear and clean.</li>
            <li> Kids don t fall this garbage with harsh chemicals that will make your skin look worse, they use celebrities to bring in people to buy this trash. Celebrities would never use this piece of ****, I d give it negative stars of I could :)</li>
            <li> Love this product...mask n tea tree cream also amazing...but sometimes makes my skin a little dry</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had 3 teenagers and Proactiv hasn&#x27;t failed one yet. With two more headed that way, we&#x27;ll be loyal customers for years to come.</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing for one week my face perfect</li>
            <li> thanks great product great price</li>
            <li> The first time I bought Proactive Solution it worked great for my daughter.This time it has hardly even controlled her acne.Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again for us but might work for others like it did for us the first time.</li>
            <li> Gift to granson.  He is 19 and is frustrated with his skin so I surprised him.  Just started using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson (14 years old). It is amazing after 2 weeks. I wish I had bought this sooner.</li>
            <li> It really helped improve my acne!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Dried out my skin, made it irritable and itchy, and red! Works for some, not for all.</li>
            <li> If you buy this, your basically buying bleach for your Face. I used this product before, really damaged my skin. I had a towel I used to dry my face after using, the color was changing after as if I used bleach on it, would never recommend.</li>
            <li> Works OK but I am still getting zits. But the ones that used to be there are gone</li>
            <li> Great product! Works like it says! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with acne problems!</li>
            <li> Too strong. This product burn my skin</li>
            <li> My girlfriend orders this treatment about every 3 months. She loves it. Does a great job! Leaves her skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li> It really did not clear up my skin at all. I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> Excellent! The best products to treat acne.</li>
            <li> Everything was ok. :)</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed that she started to get wrinkles under her eyes (not normal for a 16 year old) and it did not clear up the acne.  It&#x27;s no better than the cheaper stuff you can buy at any drug store.</li>
            <li> This is the best products for teenagers oily facial skin that we have found on the market.  I have twin grandsons in puberty, so they use it every night.  It cleans, nutralises and helps heal the blemishes.  Expensive but worth it and it lasts a long time.  Beauty cotton pads work best for application.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne, and this just did not work. Actually, my acne is the worst it has EVER been while using this for the full two months. And what is most upsetting is that I used it per the directions, and gave it time to start to correct my skin, and not only did it not work, it cost me $60. Such a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Ill update the results later</li>
            <li> Proactiv 3 Step System is used to treat and prevent acne formation. The kit is composed by a renewing Cleanser and a repairing lotion, the active ingredient is Benzoyl Peroxide, there is also a revitalizing toner that helps removing excess oil from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a noticeable decrease of acne after a couple days using this kit, the revitalizing toner had no success decreasing the oil in my skin (that is very oily). My sister also tried this kit but related no improvements in her skin, even after a fortnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may work in your skin, but the results vary a lot from person to person. The price of this kit is also greater than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is notorious for their unethical business practices - all you have to do is read a few horror stories on the internet about how they won&#x27;t stop billing you.  But what people don&#x27;t really realize is just how toxic their ingredients are. They use all kind of harsh chemicals like parabens and triethanolamine in their formulas.  You are better building your own three part system - you can find everything you need right here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this product back in 2009. Worked great but there was no way I could use a three or more step system since I was young and pretty much lazy. So, I know everyone complains about being billed a bunch of times to their credit card - there is a way to make sure that never happens and that&#x27;s to use a GIFT VISA or a gift credit card with just the right amount for Proactiv. If you have enough money on the gift card for more Proactiv, spend it on something immediately. That way, there is no way they&#x27;d want to send you anything with insufficient amount of funds on your card. So, I repeat, DO NOT USE YOUR CREDIT CARD! USE A GIFT CREDIT CARD that you can buy from CVS. Now, the prodcut has worked for my skin. I used to get cystic acne before I used it and then after that I got tiny white head breakouts. Better than cystic. Now I&#x27;m buying Proactiv Plus so hopefully that&#x27;ll do the same for my skin. Plus it comes with a free supply of VitaClear. Moral of this is: Do not use your personal credit card. Use a disposable one. :D</li>
            <li> Works great for those who struggle with acne wether it&#x27;s moderate or severe. As long as u use daily &amp; as directed you&#x27;ll notice the difference in 3-5 days and be completely satisfied in a month&#x27;s time. It&#x27;s worth ur money.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff during high school and to say it did not help my acne is an understatement. My skin became very irritated after using the product, and it was damaged for some time after that. I experienced redness, peeling, cracking just about everything negative not to mention the fact that it made me break out even more. Basically what I am saying is AVOID!!!</li>
            <li> Im always skeptical to purchase items that are over advertised but after ordering and using as directed I did notice my pores were smaller.  The formula is not overly powerful or hard for sensitive skin.  A small amount goes a long way.  The only things I didn&#x27;t like was I would rather have a bigger size of the lotion and toner than the other item provided I never had any use for it.  Also it did dry my skin out in some places and of course the hassle of depending on an item you have to order. All in all its a great product and worth the buy</li>

            <li> Proactiv made my skin so dry it&#x27;s peeling off. And one spot on my face actually felt like it was burning and is still sensitive. I haven&#x27;t used it for a week and my skin is STILL coming off. It looks gross, and moisturizer will stop it for a little while but then it starts peeling again. Be careful if you have sensitive skin, because Benzoyl Peroxide was unbelievably harsh. My sister experienced the same thing and I didn&#x27;t heed her warning.</li>
            <li> proactive worked for me when I was a teenager so i thought it would work for in my late 20 it did not. I have been using it for 1.5 months now and all it has done is dry out my skin to the point that it started peeling.</li>
            <li> Overpriced for bottle sizes.  Ordered off TV and very disappointed with the results after using the product! This product is mediocre at best, albeit I do not have severe acne.  However, as an adult, I&#x27;m finding using regular soap is drying out my skin and leaving white dry, flaky, patches all over my face that severely itch and begin to peel (not to mention, left me with an uneven skin complexion)!  So I began trying different methods.  I found better results using an oil-free 2% salicylic acid acne wash (I currently use the Walgreen&#x27;s brand--which costs about $6.00) works beyond great!  After washing my face with this wash, I use amLactin lotion which contains 12% lactic acid ( can get a 2 oz. bottle on Amazon for $2.99) otherwise; it can get pricey. I LOVE the results.  Only after a couple of uses I noticed a difference.  No more itching, peeling, discoloration of my skin, or blackheads on my nose.  This combination works great for me!</li>
            <li> Sister loves it.  Great to see you can still get the older version.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for cystic (terrible, huge, painful mounds of acne- that lasts for weeks/months) acne-- EVER!!!  I took antibiotics from the Dermatologist for my acne, the terrible peeling creams... Nightmares!!  Found Proactiv 13 years ago &amp; I&#x27;m HEALED &amp; maintain gorgeous skin... Don&#x27;t listen to the horror stories.  Use the product just as it says... It will heal deep acne!!!  It will make your skin glow &amp; you&#x27;ll wonder why you waited so long to try this!</li>
            <li> Good product better medicine that my dermatologist prescribed</li>
            <li> Using for 3 weeks now so far so good however dark spots are taking the longest to fade...maybe I&#x27;ll try proactive plus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working but slowly,almost run out of my 60 days, i did order another 60 days and hopefully will clear my face after this.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as much product as I thought. But shipped on time!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using Proactiv for about a week and she can already see improvements!</li>
            <li> Got my order on time and I am happy with it :)</li>
