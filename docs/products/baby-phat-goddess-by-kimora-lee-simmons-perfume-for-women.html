            <li>This is not the original Baby Phat Goddess.</li>
            <li>, I cannot understand how come a supposedly good brand like Baby Phat made a product labeled as Eau de parfum, but in reality is just a watery mix that won&#x27;t last pass 2</li>
            <li>this is awful!!.lling like sweet baby powder and having to reapply and spray every 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Next time, if I see a \\&quot;good parfum\\&quot; being sold for $20, I&#x27;ll just pass, I guess that saying that you get what you pay for, is absolutely true.</li>
            <li>This perfume came quick.</li>
            <li>At first whiff it smells like it, but it leaves hints of ammonia that the original does NOT.</li>
            <li>, the pink box looked good</li>
            <li>pretty but bad.&lt;br /&gt;-My recommendation for you ladies is: get it if you love cute pink bottles, don&#x27;t mind smelling like sweet baby powder and having to reapply and spray every 2 hours.</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful long lasting fragrance</li>
            <li>This Baby Phat Goddess along with the other 3 fragrances by Kimora are unique and lovely.</li>
            <li>brought it from the same seller because i ran out its smells good and it last</li>
            <li>It was not a fake, but the real thing.</li>
            <li>HER.I DID NOT RETURN,BECAUSE IT IS TO MUCH TO GO THROUGH,SO I THREW IT IN THE TRASH..</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>The fragrance: I&#x27;m a little confused about all the many good reviews</li>
            <li>The bottle is big ( I got the 3.4 oz one) but looks really pretty, the color is bright pink and has that little ring with fake diamonds around it in the neck, very cute ;</li>
            <li>I can barely feel it, is almost gone.</li>
            <li>I got this perfume not long ago:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>this perfume has, is not bad of course, but also is nothing extraordinary, it smells a bit like baby powder and some faint sweet flower scent mixed up, I have smelled this before in other brands and is nothing out of the ordinary.</li>

            <li> This used to be my fave perfume until heavily came out</li>
            <li> get a small bottle...</li>
            <li> I fear that they will just sell this bottle to somebody else, is not fair that other clueless woman gets this watery concoction (sorry Baby</li>
            <li> The smell is very, very faint, and it disappears in about 2 hours, maybe less</li>
            <li> but now that I have used it I feel bad to return it</li>
            <li> I have to keep a bad product and either use it or toss it.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>

            <li> I got this perfume not long ago:&lt;br /&gt;- It arrived well packed but the perfume&#x27;s pink box had no plastic wrap around it, like usually all perfumes sold in stores have, the pink box looked good but inside was a little wrinkly, I don&#x27;t know if  that means that it was a used box or not.&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle is big ( I got the 3.4 oz one) but looks really pretty, the color is bright pink and has that little ring with fake diamonds around it in the neck, very cute ;-)&lt;br /&gt;- The fragrance: I&#x27;m a little confused about all the many good reviews this perfume has, is not bad of course, but also is nothing extraordinary, it smells a bit like baby powder and some faint sweet flower scent mixed up, I have smelled this before in other brands and is nothing out of the ordinary. The smell is very, very faint, and it disappears in about 2 hours, maybe less, I applied it at 9 a.m. and now at 10 a.m. I can barely feel it, is almost gone. This should not be labeled as eau de parfum, is more like a faint body mist or eau de toilette, it doesn&#x27;t last at all.&lt;br /&gt;- I paid $20 for this and for what I got is a fair price, I was thinking on returning it but now that I have used it I feel bad to return it I fear that they will just sell this bottle to somebody else, is not fair that other clueless woman gets this watery concoction (sorry Baby Phat).&lt;br /&gt;- (I also think that maybe I got a counterfeit one, I cannot understand how come a supposedly good brand like Baby Phat made a product labeled as Eau de parfum, but in reality is just a watery mix that won&#x27;t last pass 2 hours.)&lt;br /&gt;- Next time, if I see a \\&quot;good parfum\\&quot; being sold for $20, I&#x27;ll just pass, I guess that saying that you get what you pay for, is absolutely true.
