            <li>However, the toner is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- tightens up the pores, so great to use in the morning before makeup and at night&lt;</li>
            <li>This is a great toner.  </li>
            <li>It smells great also.it get the job done</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what is going on with this formerly great product.</li>
            <li>She says its amazing, so if you wanna get your wife something or you women reading this go ahead and treat yourself!</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful, and when applied, it&#x27;s incredibly refreshing.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>it was out of stock s soon as they got it they sent me used couple of times its good.</li>
            <li>and this does a good job at removing dirt and oil off of my face.</li>
            <li>A good toner to try out,</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>also good for your pores</li>
            <li>Olay is suppose to be a good brand that doesn&#x27;t strip your skin&#x27;s moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the cheapest toner I&#x27;v ever bought, which is good.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t go out of my way to repurchase it though, Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a good one too.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this toner to any kind of skin,after cleansing my make-up away my face feels great and refreshing with this Olay toner.try</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I will be buying  more of this when my 2 bottles run out!</li>
            <li>Love this toner!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li>Amazing what is on the cotton ball after I use it.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent of this product, but i don&#x27;t feel it was a worthwhile addition to my skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li>This works nicely.</li>
            <li>And it will be popular soon.</li>
            <li>It great for the price, It leaves no traces of dirt and an nice clean tingly skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel, and it has a great fresh smell as well!</li>
            <li>Cheap &amp; Good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to keep your face moisturized when using this, though.</li>
            <li>May be prolonged use might help more.</li>
            <li>Love this toner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over two years now and fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the ingredients before ordering it -</li>
            <li>Not only was I able to find this product but it was awesome to get a pack of 2!</li>
            <li>I think I will buy some more on these gifts.</li>
            <li>Now even if I skip foundation my face looks and feels amazing and shine free.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing on your skin</li>
            <li>Even better yet, you cant beat the price:)</li>
            <li>Just make sure to put a moisturizer after using it.</li>
            <li>It is okay for now, but I would rethink buying this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife has been using Olay for years and has been always satisfied with their quality.</li>
            <li>I really love this and will buy more.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this toner at purchase was the price.  </li>
            <li>I looked at a lot of different toners and this one had great reviews for good reason.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>would, but better for it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t claim that it has worked any miracles for me, but I&#x27;d buy again if I needed more toner.</li>
            <li>The price is great, and I like the fact that this is a basic toner, and seems to be good for all skin types.</li>
            <li>I will be seeking a toner with more nutrients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Much better price than I would get in a store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toner for many years and I will not stop until Olay decides to stop making it.</li>
            <li>The toner itself is OK.  </li>
            <li>All in all though it may be better if I use the toner</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve experienced far fewer blemishes.</li>
            <li>However, as far as toners go, this one is great.</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Alcohol-Free Toner, instead.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how strong it is.</li>
            <li>I could feel and smell the strong fragrance and alcohol this stuff when I put the toner on my skin.</li>
            <li>The product does have a light flowery/springtime fragrance, so it may be an issue to those who dislike fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it on with a cotton ball and lightly go over my face when I&#x27;m feeling oily.</li>
            <li>great for humid weather or oily skin to help makeup last longer</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s what is important.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling clean and grit free.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>When I use it after washing my face, the toner makes my skin feel so fresh and clean!  </li>
            <li>i do not yet see any irritated reaction on my face, which is good, but i can smell a tint of alcohol when using, and perfume smell is definitely TOO strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li>It definitely has worked the best so far.  </li>
            <li>I just shrugged it off because I believed it meant my face was clean.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m just using to clean and disinfect stuff, basically anything that requires alcohol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does contain alcohol, so it will probably irritate your eyes a bit if you use it to clean your nose or the area immediately under your eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toner for years to clean my face every night.</li>
            <li>After using the toner, my skin feels fresh and super clean!  </li>
            <li>this toner is mostly witch hazel, I should just buy a bulk bottle of pure witch hazel for $4 or just use rice water.  </li>
            <li>And a cool color.</li>
            <li>This is a good, basic, no fuss toner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, and does not have much fragrance.</li>
            <li>will remove stray makeup (though it won&#x27;t replace a true makeup cleanser)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and thought this would help with oily areas but it didn&#x27;t do too much, even in the summertime when my face was more oily.</li>
            <li>This toner had very positive reviews and the price was extremely cheap</li>
            <li>I am middle-aged with acne-prone, sensitive fair skin with large pores and an oily t-zone</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until I try other toners, this is a great intro/</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, and I highly recommend the toner to other customers!</li>
            <li>Product came quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a very long time with good results.</li>
            <li>Would be great if they made a non-alcoholic version or made this less stringent.</li>
            <li>Use every day, and follow it with Olay night cream to keep your skin moist and fresh.</li>
            <li>l have tried a few toners and this one is the best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh on the face.</li>
            <li>You soak a cotton ball and wipe your face with it for a cool, crisp feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is the first toner I have been able to use with out doing damage to my super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Removes dirt very nicely too, although, I don&#x27;t know if this is too harsh for people with non-oily skin.</li>
            <li>But be sure to balance it out by using a good moisturizer regularly or you will end up with a super dry face, and then your face will over-produce oil to compensate, causing you to be even oilier than before!</li>
            <li>I love Oil of Olay products and use this to give my skin extra boost of clean.</li>
            <li>other than that good buy on my part.</li>
            <li>but in general this toner is effective at getting most of the dirt and makeup off of my face daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>price, great results as a simple and quick part of a daily regimen.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, doesn&#x27;t get my nose quite as clean as alcohol</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with an oily t-zone, and needed a more targeted product than a general face wash.</li>
            <li>As always, got a great price on Olay Oil Minimizing Toner, especially compared to my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>And it said it was good for sensitive skin which is definitely me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out from this, and it seems very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very cheap (especially in a double pack plus a $3 Amazon coupon)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It has a very strong and strange fragrance smell.  </li>
            <li>The 2 pack method is really awesome because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Has not done much to reduce oil!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this toner and all of a sudden could not find it anywhere</li>
            <li>Use a cotton ball and watch how much dirt comes off your face even after you wash it!</li>
            <li>The only thing that gets more dirt is the salysilic acid astringent.</li>
            <li>This was the first toner I&#x27;ve used when I just started getting into skin care.</li>
            <li>and I love how it can get the dirt you miss from deep in your pores.</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>Overall, the quality of the product is okay.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and I have never been able to find a product for my face that actually works.</li>
            <li>My nose gets pretty oily and I was looking for an alternative to the astringent I used to use.  </li>
            <li>i forget, better than my local grocery store $5.60 each.</li>
            <li>Hard to find locally, works great!</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out, and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It is an ok product, but doesn&#x27;t keep oil away for all that long like some have said.</li>
            <li>so a product to minimize oil was what I was looking for, but after reading up on toners I feared this one was leaving my skin so dry that my face might have been producing even more oil to compensate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prone to consistent, mild breakouts on my face, and nearly everything I&#x27;ve tried over the years that has been at all effective in controlling them has dried the hell out of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can continue to use something with such a strong scent</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with large pores</li>
            <li>Absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toner was very drying.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I bought this item was because it was on sale for a really cheap price.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by how my skin absorbed lotion after applying the toner.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, not expecting much.</li>
            <li>I think it will be easier if it was a press cap that allows you  to control how much you dispense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll preface by saying I have combination skin that gets very oily in this humid Georgia weather, and I&#x27;m practically allergic to everything.  </li>
            <li>gentle on skin and doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t feel that it did a ton for me</li>
            <li>and I often poured out too much.</li>
            <li>if you saw all the dirt thats left behind you would not be happy !</li>
            <li>Toners are the second step in the process after gentle washing your face, and is meant to clean up any leftover dirt or makeup without drying out your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, not too harsh, and leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get something higher quality.</li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all, while controlling oil as good as many other toners I tried, if not better.</li>
            <li>9/12/13: After using this for six months, I have to say it&#x27;s more harsh than I realized at first.</li>
            <li>It had a pretty strong odor when I first used it that was unappealing, but it dissipates quickly and now I don&#x27;t notice it as much.  </li>
            <li>Works decent, but still some make-up and dirt on my face after cleaning with it.</li>
            <li>I did some research and realized that the main ingredient alcohol was causing all this.</li>
            <li>I have never used a toner before and was looking for a gentle one for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I look at the ingredients, and the alcohol is high up there.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but I couldn&#x27;t use it because the smell (for me) is unbearable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s considering it.</li>
            <li>The biggest shock was how soft and clean it left my skin.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it does not have a strong odor like some other toners do.</li>
            <li>This toner works very well for sensitive skin and there is no dryness.</li>
            <li>I use this after washing my face and am always surprised how much dirt is still on the cotton ball.</li>
            <li>I normally use this toner at night after I have washed away all the makeup on my face.</li>
            <li>This toner feels like it&#x27;s doing its job - my pores are seemingly getting smaller and catching less dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>(i tried every pharmacy and grocery in the areas i work and live).  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my alcohol free Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner because it had gotten more expensive.</li>
            <li>As a vital part of my skin care routine, I&#x27;m glad to pay much less on Amazon than I would at the store!</li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of products that claim to minimize oil(from cleansers to moisturizers to primers to powders) and this is the first that actually does what it states.</li>
            <li>Since I wear makeup daily, this helps get my skin extra clean and leaves me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure exactly how effective it is, as I do use other products to control oil, but this doesn&#x27;t contribute to any skin problems.</li>
            <li>I noticed it picked up a lot of the makeup that was left behind, but since its primary ingredient is alcohol one would expect it to clean your face really well</li>
            <li>I just put some on a piece of paper towel, quickly wipe my entire face and neck, and instantly, my face and neck are oil-free.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong, and definitely not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I shower in the morning and wash my face with a Neutrogena bar, go to work, come home, enjoy my evening, and then put a little of this Blue/Green Lightning on a cotton pad.  </li>
            <li>bottle cap/ bottle is not one of those with a tiny hole like most toner bottles where you squeeze a little bit out.</li>
            <li>Using this two, even maybe three times a day keeps my face clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone skin that gets shiny just about as soon as my face dries.</li>
            <li>BUT, I have developed some flaky patches.</li>
            <li>This product arrived early, and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>This witch hazel based toner is supposed to be much gentler than using an alcohol, which strips your skin of necessary oils and can cause acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this toner for years, and recently started subscribing to it on Amazon, which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin, on the sensitive side.  </li>
            <li>And really that is the only advantage.  </li>
            <li>If you are chemically sensitive this is not for you.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a perfect base for my make up.</li>
            <li>Visible dirt and oil are removed, and my breakouts are very mild and very few and far between.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean without the burning you can sometimes get with harsh toners.  </li>
            <li>a bottle will last a month or two with conscientious use&lt;br /&gt;- compatible with other products without causing a reaction&lt;br /&gt;- leaves a clean feeling</li>
            <li>I have started using a makeup that has such great lasting power that it was difficult to get off.</li>
            <li>and I found the same results as far as keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li>This product dried up my face so quickly.</li>
            <li>As I said in my initial review, my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel clean and tight, and I really feel like my pores are less noticeable after using it.</li>
            <li>After searching high an low for a toner that suits me, I finally found this product abe to solve my problems.</li>
            <li>Since starting to use this I have also noticed my skin clear up quite a bit(which makes sense,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to have incredibly sensitive skin, but this product definitely stings when I apply it.</li>
            <li>This has been my toner from my early teen years.  </li>
            <li>I like to sleep with a bare face</li>
            <li>This cleanser cleans very deep and leaves my skin soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>and it does not dry out my skin!  </li>
            <li>It was gentle on my skin, but perhaps lacked effectivness due to that</li>
            <li>He uses it as a replacement for the toner in a proactive-type acne treatment system where the step 2 (toner) seems to go much faster than the other steps.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this toner because it&#x27;s not too strong or too weak.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and am always looking for ways to make it less oily.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced anything bad while using this product (no breakouts, dry skin, etc.)</li>
            <li>Can sting a little bit but does not bother me too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it&#x27;s a great price compared to purchasing it at the store.  </li>
            <li> It even smells great.</li>
            <li> great price for the quality</li>
            <li> Great value</li>
            <li> it is a great item.</li>
            <li> great product get alot for your money.</li>
            <li> Great price 2pak at $6.??</li>
            <li> It comes in a 2 pack, which is great.</li>
            <li> However, the toner is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- tightens up the pores, so great to use in the morning before makeup and at night&lt;</li>
            <li> This is a great toner.  </li>
            <li> It smells great also.it get the job done</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is going on with this formerly great product.</li>
            <li> She says its amazing, so if you wanna get your wife something or you women reading this go ahead and treat yourself!</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, and when applied, it&#x27;s incredibly refreshing.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> it was out of stock s soon as they got it they sent me used couple of times its good.</li>
            <li> and this does a good job at removing dirt and oil off of my face.</li>
            <li> A good toner to try out,</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> also good for your pores</li>
            <li> Olay is suppose to be a good brand that doesn&#x27;t strip your skin&#x27;s moisture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the cheapest toner I&#x27;v ever bought, which is good.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t go out of my way to repurchase it though, Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a good one too.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toner to any kind of skin,after cleansing my make-up away my face feels great and refreshing with this Olay toner.try</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I will be buying  more of this when my 2 bottles run out!</li>
            <li> Love this toner!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Amazing what is on the cotton ball after I use it.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of this product, but i don&#x27;t feel it was a worthwhile addition to my skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li> This works nicely.</li>
            <li> And it will be popular soon.</li>
            <li> It great for the price, It leaves no traces of dirt and an nice clean tingly skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel, and it has a great fresh smell as well!</li>
            <li> Cheap &amp; Good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to keep your face moisturized when using this, though.</li>
            <li> May be prolonged use might help more.</li>
            <li> Love this toner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over two years now and fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the ingredients before ordering it -</li>
            <li> Not only was I able to find this product but it was awesome to get a pack of 2!</li>
            <li> I think I will buy some more on these gifts.</li>
            <li> Now even if I skip foundation my face looks and feels amazing and shine free.</li>
            <li> It is so refreshing on your skin</li>
            <li> Even better yet, you cant beat the price:)</li>
            <li> Just make sure to put a moisturizer after using it.</li>
            <li> It is okay for now, but I would rethink buying this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Olay for years and has been always satisfied with their quality.</li>
            <li> I really love this and will buy more.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this toner at purchase was the price.  </li>
            <li> I looked at a lot of different toners and this one had great reviews for good reason.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> would, but better for it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t claim that it has worked any miracles for me, but I&#x27;d buy again if I needed more toner.</li>
            <li> The price is great, and I like the fact that this is a basic toner, and seems to be good for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I will be seeking a toner with more nutrients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Much better price than I would get in a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for many years and I will not stop until Olay decides to stop making it.</li>
            <li> The toner itself is OK.  </li>
            <li> All in all though it may be better if I use the toner</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve experienced far fewer blemishes.</li>
            <li> However, as far as toners go, this one is great.</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Alcohol-Free Toner, instead.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how strong it is.</li>
            <li> I could feel and smell the strong fragrance and alcohol this stuff when I put the toner on my skin.</li>
            <li> The product does have a light flowery/springtime fragrance, so it may be an issue to those who dislike fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it on with a cotton ball and lightly go over my face when I&#x27;m feeling oily.</li>
            <li> great for humid weather or oily skin to help makeup last longer</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what is important.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin feeling clean and grit free.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> When I use it after washing my face, the toner makes my skin feel so fresh and clean!  </li>
            <li> i do not yet see any irritated reaction on my face, which is good, but i can smell a tint of alcohol when using, and perfume smell is definitely TOO strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It definitely has worked the best so far.  </li>
            <li> I just shrugged it off because I believed it meant my face was clean.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just using to clean and disinfect stuff, basically anything that requires alcohol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does contain alcohol, so it will probably irritate your eyes a bit if you use it to clean your nose or the area immediately under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for years to clean my face every night.</li>
            <li> After using the toner, my skin feels fresh and super clean!  </li>
            <li> this toner is mostly witch hazel, I should just buy a bulk bottle of pure witch hazel for $4 or just use rice water.  </li>
            <li> And a cool color.</li>
            <li> This is a good, basic, no fuss toner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, and does not have much fragrance.</li>
            <li> will remove stray makeup (though it won&#x27;t replace a true makeup cleanser)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and thought this would help with oily areas but it didn&#x27;t do too much, even in the summertime when my face was more oily.</li>
            <li> This toner had very positive reviews and the price was extremely cheap</li>
            <li> I am middle-aged with acne-prone, sensitive fair skin with large pores and an oily t-zone</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until I try other toners, this is a great intro/</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, and I highly recommend the toner to other customers!</li>
            <li> Product came quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a very long time with good results.</li>
            <li> Would be great if they made a non-alcoholic version or made this less stringent.</li>
            <li> Use every day, and follow it with Olay night cream to keep your skin moist and fresh.</li>
            <li> l have tried a few toners and this one is the best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh on the face.</li>
            <li> You soak a cotton ball and wipe your face with it for a cool, crisp feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is the first toner I have been able to use with out doing damage to my super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Removes dirt very nicely too, although, I don&#x27;t know if this is too harsh for people with non-oily skin.</li>
            <li> But be sure to balance it out by using a good moisturizer regularly or you will end up with a super dry face, and then your face will over-produce oil to compensate, causing you to be even oilier than before!</li>
            <li> I love Oil of Olay products and use this to give my skin extra boost of clean.</li>
            <li> other than that good buy on my part.</li>
            <li> but in general this toner is effective at getting most of the dirt and makeup off of my face daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> price, great results as a simple and quick part of a daily regimen.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, doesn&#x27;t get my nose quite as clean as alcohol</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with an oily t-zone, and needed a more targeted product than a general face wash.</li>
            <li> As always, got a great price on Olay Oil Minimizing Toner, especially compared to my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> And it said it was good for sensitive skin which is definitely me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out from this, and it seems very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- very cheap (especially in a double pack plus a $3 Amazon coupon)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It has a very strong and strange fragrance smell.  </li>
            <li> The 2 pack method is really awesome because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Has not done much to reduce oil!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toner and all of a sudden could not find it anywhere</li>
            <li> Use a cotton ball and watch how much dirt comes off your face even after you wash it!</li>
            <li> The only thing that gets more dirt is the salysilic acid astringent.</li>
            <li> This was the first toner I&#x27;ve used when I just started getting into skin care.</li>
            <li> and I love how it can get the dirt you miss from deep in your pores.</li>
            <li> Thanks !</li>
            <li> Overall, the quality of the product is okay.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> and I have never been able to find a product for my face that actually works.</li>
            <li> My nose gets pretty oily and I was looking for an alternative to the astringent I used to use.  </li>
            <li> i forget, better than my local grocery store $5.60 each.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally, works great!</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out, and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It is an ok product, but doesn&#x27;t keep oil away for all that long like some have said.</li>
            <li> so a product to minimize oil was what I was looking for, but after reading up on toners I feared this one was leaving my skin so dry that my face might have been producing even more oil to compensate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to consistent, mild breakouts on my face, and nearly everything I&#x27;ve tried over the years that has been at all effective in controlling them has dried the hell out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can continue to use something with such a strong scent</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toner was very drying.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I bought this item was because it was on sale for a really cheap price.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by how my skin absorbed lotion after applying the toner.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, not expecting much.</li>
            <li> I think it will be easier if it was a press cap that allows you  to control how much you dispense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface by saying I have combination skin that gets very oily in this humid Georgia weather, and I&#x27;m practically allergic to everything.  </li>
            <li> gentle on skin and doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t feel that it did a ton for me</li>
            <li> and I often poured out too much.</li>
            <li> if you saw all the dirt thats left behind you would not be happy !</li>
            <li> Toners are the second step in the process after gentle washing your face, and is meant to clean up any leftover dirt or makeup without drying out your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, not too harsh, and leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get something higher quality.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all, while controlling oil as good as many other toners I tried, if not better.</li>
            <li> 9/12/13: After using this for six months, I have to say it&#x27;s more harsh than I realized at first.</li>
            <li> It had a pretty strong odor when I first used it that was unappealing, but it dissipates quickly and now I don&#x27;t notice it as much.  </li>
            <li> Works decent, but still some make-up and dirt on my face after cleaning with it.</li>
            <li> I did some research and realized that the main ingredient alcohol was causing all this.</li>
            <li> I have never used a toner before and was looking for a gentle one for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I look at the ingredients, and the alcohol is high up there.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I couldn&#x27;t use it because the smell (for me) is unbearable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s considering it.</li>
            <li> The biggest shock was how soft and clean it left my skin.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it does not have a strong odor like some other toners do.</li>
            <li> This toner works very well for sensitive skin and there is no dryness.</li>
            <li> I use this after washing my face and am always surprised how much dirt is still on the cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I normally use this toner at night after I have washed away all the makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> This toner feels like it&#x27;s doing its job - my pores are seemingly getting smaller and catching less dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> (i tried every pharmacy and grocery in the areas i work and live).  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my alcohol free Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner because it had gotten more expensive.</li>
            <li> As a vital part of my skin care routine, I&#x27;m glad to pay much less on Amazon than I would at the store!</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of products that claim to minimize oil(from cleansers to moisturizers to primers to powders) and this is the first that actually does what it states.</li>
            <li> Since I wear makeup daily, this helps get my skin extra clean and leaves me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly how effective it is, as I do use other products to control oil, but this doesn&#x27;t contribute to any skin problems.</li>
            <li> I noticed it picked up a lot of the makeup that was left behind, but since its primary ingredient is alcohol one would expect it to clean your face really well</li>
            <li> I just put some on a piece of paper towel, quickly wipe my entire face and neck, and instantly, my face and neck are oil-free.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, and definitely not in a good way.</li>
            <li> I shower in the morning and wash my face with a Neutrogena bar, go to work, come home, enjoy my evening, and then put a little of this Blue/Green Lightning on a cotton pad.  </li>
            <li> bottle cap/ bottle is not one of those with a tiny hole like most toner bottles where you squeeze a little bit out.</li>
            <li> Using this two, even maybe three times a day keeps my face clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin that gets shiny just about as soon as my face dries.</li>
            <li> BUT, I have developed some flaky patches.</li>
            <li> This product arrived early, and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> This witch hazel based toner is supposed to be much gentler than using an alcohol, which strips your skin of necessary oils and can cause acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for years, and recently started subscribing to it on Amazon, which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin, on the sensitive side.  </li>
            <li> And really that is the only advantage.  </li>
            <li> If you are chemically sensitive this is not for you.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a perfect base for my make up.</li>
            <li> Visible dirt and oil are removed, and my breakouts are very mild and very few and far between.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean without the burning you can sometimes get with harsh toners.  </li>
            <li> a bottle will last a month or two with conscientious use&lt;br /&gt;- compatible with other products without causing a reaction&lt;br /&gt;- leaves a clean feeling</li>
            <li> I have started using a makeup that has such great lasting power that it was difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> and I found the same results as far as keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> This product dried up my face so quickly.</li>
            <li> As I said in my initial review, my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin feel clean and tight, and I really feel like my pores are less noticeable after using it.</li>
            <li> After searching high an low for a toner that suits me, I finally found this product abe to solve my problems.</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this I have also noticed my skin clear up quite a bit(which makes sense,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have incredibly sensitive skin, but this product definitely stings when I apply it.</li>
            <li> This has been my toner from my early teen years.  </li>
            <li> I like to sleep with a bare face</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans very deep and leaves my skin soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> and it does not dry out my skin!  </li>
            <li> It was gentle on my skin, but perhaps lacked effectivness due to that</li>
            <li> He uses it as a replacement for the toner in a proactive-type acne treatment system where the step 2 (toner) seems to go much faster than the other steps.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like this toner because it&#x27;s not too strong or too weak.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and am always looking for ways to make it less oily.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced anything bad while using this product (no breakouts, dry skin, etc.)</li>
            <li> Can sting a little bit but does not bother me too much.</li>
            <li> I think it would work well for other people, but not for a sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I usually just use witch hazel for toner, but this has a much nicer smell to it.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like the oil minimizing nature of this toner ended up making my skin look flat.</li>
            <li> The product is not bad but my skin is still irritatingly oily.</li>
            <li> Everything else I tried just left my face dry.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling refreshed, too, as opposed to the harsher products, which leave my face feeling napalmed and dry enough to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nose)&lt;br /&gt;- is a little dry in certain climates, like when I visit Denver, CO (just immediately follow up with serum)&lt;br /&gt;- the only way to apply it is with a cotton ball or pad, which can soak up a lot and waste the product</li>
            <li> I got this because I&#x27;ve used Olay products since I was about 16 (a long time ago).</li>
            <li> So now, after washing my face, I wet a cotton ball and finish up with this (following up with a moisturizer).</li>
            <li> The acne that took so long to heal (weeks to months at a time) are almost gone.</li>
            <li> I have never used Olay until now -- and I have no idea why I waited so long</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin, after using this for few days,  </li>
            <li> And the second shipment came just in time as I was down to the last 1/2 bottle!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I replaced my morning acne wash with this a couple of weeks ago, and not only does it help keep the excess oil at bay, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Even in the winter when I get dry patches at times, the rest of my face will still get oily, and in the summer it just gets shinier.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my face or anything.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have oily skin - if anything, my skin is on the dry side.</li>
            <li> single bottle also lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Cleans great,may take several cotton balls to clean dirty face/neck.</li>
            <li> But the down side of this is that I can&#x27;t buy this product by itself which is going to cause some problems for me in future...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even noticing that the dark marks are slowly diminishing where I don&#x27;t have to use so much makeup to cover them.</li>
            <li> Only noticed a little difference with this product.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s, with sensitive, oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cap is too open</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and it arrived quicker than stated.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It works about like I expected, making my nose feel cleaner than it did, which therefore hopefully prevents breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I caught this two pack on sale and thought id be nice and get it for my wife, well now whenever she runs out ill have to buy it whether its on sale or not lol.</li>
            <li> I can get a little less than 2 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this toner goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The product is as described, and it seems to be helping with the excessive oil on my facial skin.</li>
            <li> and it is due to hormonal changes.</li>
            <li> may have to find other site to get this product.</li>
            <li> That day I started to notice that my face felt a little dry moments after using it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a last step to insure that there isn&#x27;t any left behind makeup after washing my face.</li>
            <li> only negative is that I can smell the alcohol in the product.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing about this is it has a twist on cap.</li>
            <li> Ended up tossing it away after a few tries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of just pouring it all down the drain since I purchased it while it was on sale.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other toner but this one!  </li>
            <li> less oil&#x3D;less breakouts).</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t use toner.</li>
            <li> it was less greasy.</li>
            <li> But it dries my skin out and may be contributing to my skin breaking out slightly.</li>
            <li> I hope the company figures this one out because it was a five star product previously.</li>
            <li> I found that my face felt slightly tight, and a little shiny after swabbing it with what should have been an oil minimizing toner.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product also helps a little to reduce the excess oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this twice a day along with African black soap a few days a week dramatically decreased the amount of oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I will update the review after I have been using a few months.</li>
            <li> once every couple days rather than everyday.</li>
            <li> It is not magically going to fix all your skin issues.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time finding this product in my area, so I had to order it online.  </li>
            <li> At least not for me.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was not thrilled that I was using a product w/witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it and went back to Thayer&#x27;s toner and my face stopped being a nasty oily mess.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell and it definitely doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or anything else.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would work, unfortunately it did not.</li>
            <li> I used a make-up removing cloth after and it was quite dirty afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this didn&#x27;t help control the oil in the slightest.:/ I gave it 2 stars because it did remove some leftover make up</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed if you but it.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with Olay products.</li>
            <li> -the worst of all worlds.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is an ok product, but doesn&#x27;t keep oil away for all that long like some have said. At least not for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have incredibly sensitive skin, but this product definitely stings when I apply it. The scent is very strong, and definitely not in a good way. I&#x27;m thinking of just pouring it all down the drain since I purchased it while it was on sale. Absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Alcohol-Free Toner, instead. The scent is wonderful, and when applied, it&#x27;s incredibly refreshing.</li>
            <li> The product is not bad but my skin is still irritatingly oily. Has not done much to reduce oil! May be prolonged use might help more.</li>
            <li> Love this toner and it&#x27;s a great price compared to purchasing it at the store.  Just what I expected and it arrived quicker than stated.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles w/out reading the information closely.  I do not have oily skin &amp; I was not thrilled that I was using a product w/witch hazel.  however--- I DO use it about 2x/week because it is tightening.  not drying.  I moisturize after. good product.</li>
            <li> i have very fair skin and have been using this product for about a month and it does not dry out my skin!  It is the first toner I have been able to use with out doing damage to my super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This has been my toner from my early teen years.  It does not dry my skin.  It prepares my skin for moisturizer and foundation make-up.  I will use it until I die.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for two or three years now.  It definitely has worked the best so far.  Everything else I tried just left my face dry.  Using this two, even maybe three times a day keeps my face clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This thing burns my eyes even as soon as I rub it on my face (even my chin). That&#x27;s how strong it is. I&#x27;ve used it a couple times but have noticed my pores enlarging after using it, so I think I&#x27;m going to discontinue. Not happy with this product and I would not recommend it to people.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this toner goes a long way. I just put some on a piece of paper towel, quickly wipe my entire face and neck, and instantly, my face and neck are oil-free. I haven&#x27;t experienced anything bad while using this product (no breakouts, dry skin, etc.) even though my face is moderately oily. The product does have a light flowery/springtime fragrance, so it may be an issue to those who dislike fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone wondering, the ingredients are listed below:&lt;br /&gt;water, SD alcohol 40, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) extract, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, allantoin, menthyl lactate, fragrance, blue 1, yellow 5</li>
            <li> I love this! Cheap &amp; Good. I&#x27;ve been using this for over two years now and fully satisfied. Five plus stars!</li>
            <li> This toner was very drying.  I should have paid more attention to the ingredients before ordering it - it contains both alcohol and witch hazel.  I have very oily skin with large pores so a product to minimize oil was what I was looking for, but after reading up on toners I feared this one was leaving my skin so dry that my face might have been producing even more oil to compensate.  I noticed increased breakouts a couple days after I started using it, so I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toner and all of a sudden could not find it anywhere (i tried every pharmacy and grocery in the areas i work and live).  Not only was I able to find this product but it was awesome to get a pack of 2!</li>
            <li> very good toner. My friends like them. I think I will buy some more on these gifts. Very good gifts for friends</li>
            <li> Use a cotton ball and watch how much dirt comes off your face even after you wash it! The only thing that gets more dirt is the salysilic acid astringent.</li>
            <li> it was out of stock s soon as they got it they sent me used couple of times its good.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toner to any kind of skin,after cleansing my make-up away my face feels great and refreshing with this Olay toner.try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this toner before I tried switching up makeup, primer, moisturizer, washes - all to no avail. I am middle-aged with acne-prone, sensitive fair skin with large pores and an oily t-zone -the worst of all worlds. After reading other reviews, I replaced my morning acne wash with this a couple of weeks ago, and not only does it help keep the excess oil at bay, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I&#x27;ve experienced far fewer blemishes. I am a fan of Olay products, and they have another winner here.</li>
            <li> Works decent, but still some make-up and dirt on my face after cleaning with it. I used a make-up removing cloth after and it was quite dirty afterwards.</li>
            <li> Grab it when it&#x27;s on sale. This toner works very well for sensitive skin and there is no dryness. My daughters use this product as well and swear by it.</li>
            <li> This was the first toner I&#x27;ve used when I just started getting into skin care. I have oily to combination skin and this does a good job at removing dirt and oil off of my face. Can sting a little bit but does not bother me too much. A good toner to try out,</li>
            <li> This is a must have if your skin is oily! I have tried all sorts of products that claim to minimize oil(from cleansers to moisturizers to primers to powders) and this is the first that actually does what it states. I have sensitive, acne prone skin that gets shiny just about as soon as my face dries. Even in the winter when I get dry patches at times, the rest of my face will still get oily, and in the summer it just gets shinier. Now even if I skip foundation my face looks and feels amazing and shine free. It is so refreshing on your skin and I love how it can get the dirt you miss from deep in your pores. Since starting to use this I have also noticed my skin clear up quite a bit(which makes sense, less oil&#x3D;less breakouts). Even better yet, you cant beat the price:)</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my alcohol free Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner because it had gotten more expensive. This toner had very positive reviews and the price was extremely cheap -- I received two bottles for about $4. I normally use this toner at night after I have washed away all the makeup on my face. I use this as a last step to insure that there isn&#x27;t any left behind makeup after washing my face. I noticed it picked up a lot of the makeup that was left behind, but since its primary ingredient is alcohol one would expect it to clean your face really well and it did. That day I started to notice that my face felt a little dry moments after using it. I just shrugged it off because I believed it meant my face was clean. In the morning I awoke to my face being covered in oil. My body must have overcompensated for the lack of oil. I tried again this time adding in a moisturizer after toning but that didn&#x27;t help at all. I like to sleep with a bare face so must of the time I do not use a moisturizer although sometimes I will use a drop of jojoba oil. I did some research and realized that the main ingredient alcohol was causing all this. I stopped using it and went back to Thayer&#x27;s toner and my face stopped being a nasty oily mess. Now I&#x27;m just using to clean and disinfect stuff, basically anything that requires alcohol.</li>
            <li> As always, got a great price on Olay Oil Minimizing Toner, especially compared to my local drugstore. The product is as described, and it seems to be helping with the excessive oil on my facial skin. Thanks !</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this toner. It makes the skin feel clean and tight, and I really feel like my pores are less noticeable after using it. But be sure to balance it out by using a good moisturizer regularly or you will end up with a super dry face, and then your face will over-produce oil to compensate, causing you to be even oilier than before!</li>
            <li> Only noticed a little difference with this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh, two thumbs up! I would recommend this product to y friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for years and it&#x27;s the best.  It removes all of the dirt and grime that sticks to your face all day.</li>
            <li> i bought this product as a gift for my friend. i seldom use toner because i don&#x27;t have oily skin..</li>
            <li> This product dried up my face so quickly. I think it would work well for other people, but not for a sensitive skin like mine. Overall, the quality of the product is okay. It does the job. Just make sure to put a moisturizer after using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay products since I was a teen (both Mom and Grandma used it), and continue to use Olay products well into my 50&#x27;s. This cleanser cleans very deep and leaves my skin soft and dewy. It even smells great. Use every day, and follow it with Olay night cream to keep your skin moist and fresh.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of this product, but i don&#x27;t feel it was a worthwhile addition to my skin care regimen.  I found that my face felt slightly tight, and a little shiny after swabbing it with what should have been an oil minimizing toner.  It was gentle on my skin, but perhaps lacked effectivness due to that</li>
            <li> It great for the price, It leaves no traces of dirt and an nice clean tingly skin. also good for your pores</li>
            <li> I love Oil of Olay products and use this to give my skin extra boost of clean. Then slather on a moisureizer and it&#x27;s a perfect base for my make up.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with an oily t-zone, and needed a more targeted product than a general face wash. This works nicely. I apply it to a cotton pad, and wipe the t-zone while leaving the rest of my face untouched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain alcohol, so it will probably irritate your eyes a bit if you use it to clean your nose or the area immediately under your eyes. Once the alcohol evaporates, the irritation goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single bottle also lasts a while. I can get a little less than 2 months of daily use. Having the two-pack on a 3 month delivery schedule end up working out well for me.</li>
            <li> everyone should use a toner after wsahing their face. if you saw all the dirt thats left behind you would not be happy ! great price for the quality</li>
            <li> This is your very basic toner from the brand you trust.  It does minimized oil as advertise however that is about it.</li>
            <li> As a vital part of my skin care routine, I&#x27;m glad to pay much less on Amazon than I would at the store! Remember it&#x27;s only *part* of a routine. It is not magically going to fix all your skin issues. However, as far as toners go, this one is great.</li>
            <li> Olay is suppose to be a good brand that doesn&#x27;t strip your skin&#x27;s moisture. I could feel and smell the strong fragrance and alcohol this stuff when I put the toner on my skin. I look at the ingredients, and the alcohol is high up there. Not what I expected. It is okay for now, but I would rethink buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle cap/ bottle is not one of those with a tiny hole like most toner bottles where you squeeze a little bit out. So thats another thing I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Olay for years and has been always satisfied with their quality.</li>
            <li> l have tried a few toners and this one is the best for sensitive skin. No sting, no alcohol smell, not at all drying. I really love this and will buy more.</li>
            <li> I got this because I&#x27;ve used Olay products since I was about 16 (a long time ago). And it said it was good for sensitive skin which is definitely me. I have started using a makeup that has such great lasting power that it was difficult to get off. So now, after washing my face, I wet a cotton ball and finish up with this (following up with a moisturizer). Amazing what is on the cotton ball after I use it. BUT, I have developed some flaky patches. Now trying to decide if it is from this toner or from something else. Great value though.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/12/13: After using this for six months, I have to say it&#x27;s more harsh than I realized at first. I am probably using it only once or twice a week now. As I said in my initial review, my skin is very sensitive. If yours is too, you may want to try something else. I&#x27;m going to.</li>
            <li> My skin had a reaction after I use it, maybe I&#x27;m allergic to it. Ended up tossing it away after a few tries.</li>
            <li> Using this twice a day along with African black soap a few days a week dramatically decreased the amount of oil on my face. Removes dirt very nicely too, although, I don&#x27;t know if this is too harsh for people with non-oily skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
            <li> I just received it today and used it after washing my face. My face was as oily as before in about 15min!! And no I was not wearing make up. I was disappointed that this didn&#x27;t help control the oil in the slightest.:/ I gave it 2 stars because it did remove some leftover make up</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this toner at purchase was the price.  2 bottles for the price you would spend on 1 of another type.  I looked at a lot of different toners and this one had great reviews for good reason.  It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell and it definitely doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or anything else.  I took a shower/washed my face, used this toner, and you could see the dirt that it still removed all over the cotton swab.  I will be buying  more of this when my 2 bottles run out!</li>
            <li> it is a great item. And it will be popular soon. I like it and i would like to recommand you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 and I have never been able to find a product for my face that actually works. I finally found it and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price! I use it twice a day and as spot treatment. It&#x27;s very important to keep your face moisturized when using this, though. I used this after dr dennis gross face peel (a much more expensive product) and I found the same results as far as keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> Love this toner! Def cleanses my skin!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but I couldn&#x27;t use it because the smell (for me) is unbearable.  It has a very strong and strange fragrance smell.  To me, it smelled like nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I gave it to my son and he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the smell. He uses it as a replacement for the toner in a proactive-type acne treatment system where the step 2 (toner) seems to go much faster than the other steps.  I&#x27;ve changed the rating of this product from a 1 to a 3.</li>
            <li> My skin is a pain in the ass.  I&#x27;m prone to consistent, mild breakouts on my face, and nearly everything I&#x27;ve tried over the years that has been at all effective in controlling them has dried the hell out of my skin.  Pick my poison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not do that.  I shower in the morning and wash my face with a Neutrogena bar, go to work, come home, enjoy my evening, and then put a little of this Blue/Green Lightning on a cotton pad.  Wipe it all over my face.  Visible dirt and oil are removed, and my breakouts are very mild and very few and far between.  Leaves my face feeling refreshed, too, as opposed to the harsher products, which leave my face feeling napalmed and dry enough to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, great results as a simple and quick part of a daily regimen.  And a cool color.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t use toner. The only reason I bought this item was because it was on sale for a really cheap price. I was really surprised by how my skin absorbed lotion after applying the toner. I have oily skin and this product also helps a little to reduce the excess oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that I can smell the alcohol in the product. If you don&#x27;t care about that, it&#x27;s really a good product for the price!</li>
            <li> This product arrived early, and was well packaged.  I usually have a hard time finding this product in my area, so I had to order it online.  It turns out to be cheaper ordering it here than buying it at the store (when it&#x27;s in stock).</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all, while controlling oil as good as many other toners I tried, if not better. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> great product get alot for your money. But took about a month to get here. other than that good buy on my part.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and sometime I just need a refresher which this product does wonders for. I put it on with a cotton ball and lightly go over my face when I&#x27;m feeling oily. Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, not expecting much. The biggest shock was how soft and clean it left my skin. I don&#x27;t even feel I need a moisturizer after using it. A truly divine product and I will definitely repurchase it. Thank you, Olay!</li>
            <li> My nose gets pretty oily and I was looking for an alternative to the astringent I used to use.  I really like this product, doesn&#x27;t get my nose quite as clean as alcohol would, but better for it I&#x27;m sure.  It had a pretty strong odor when I first used it that was unappealing, but it dissipates quickly and now I don&#x27;t notice it as much.  It works about like I expected, making my nose feel cleaner than it did, which therefore hopefully prevents breakouts.  I will update the review after I have been using a few months.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s, with sensitive, oily and acne-prone skin. I have never had acne until now and it is due to hormonal changes. It has left embarrassing scars on my face, that I have to cover them with makeup. I tried everything until I purchased this product, along with the Acne Control Face Wash. It&#x27;s been two weeks, and I have seen a difference. The acne that took so long to heal (weeks to months at a time) are almost gone. I&#x27;m even noticing that the dark marks are slowly diminishing where I don&#x27;t have to use so much makeup to cover them. I have never used Olay until now -- and I have no idea why I waited so long (maybe Mom was on to something all those years ago). I am hooked for life now!!</li>
            <li> Cleans great,may take several cotton balls to clean dirty face/neck. Waring it has alcohol for people w/sensitive faces/eyes but it does not bother me.Great price 2pak at $6.?? i forget, better than my local grocery store $5.60 each.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. Feels fresh on the face. I used it to remove my makeup sometimes. Doesn&#x27;t dry my face or anything. Can&#x27;t claim that it has worked any miracles for me, but I&#x27;d buy again if I needed more toner.</li>
            <li> I caught this two pack on sale and thought id be nice and get it for my wife, well now whenever she runs out ill have to buy it whether its on sale or not lol. She says its amazing, so if you wanna get your wife something or you women reading this go ahead and treat yourself!</li>
            <li> This is a good, basic, no fuss toner. It comes in a 2 pack, which is great. The only negative thing about this is it has a twist on cap. I think it will be easier if it was a press cap that allows you  to control how much you dispense. However, the toner is great. It&#x27;s refreshing, and does not have much fragrance. I do have oily skin, and this advertises as oil minimizing. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how effective it is, as I do use other products to control oil, but this doesn&#x27;t contribute to any skin problems. I don&#x27;t break out from this, and it seems very gentle on my skin. The price is great, and I like the fact that this is a basic toner, and seems to be good for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I have never used a toner before and was looking for a gentle one for my very sensitive skin.  I use this as part of my 5-Step Japanese Skincare Routine.  I&#x27;ll preface by saying I have combination skin that gets very oily in this humid Georgia weather, and I&#x27;m practically allergic to everything.  Toners are the second step in the process after gentle washing your face, and is meant to clean up any leftover dirt or makeup without drying out your skin.  You soak a cotton ball and wipe your face with it for a cool, crisp feeling.  This witch hazel based toner is supposed to be much gentler than using an alcohol, which strips your skin of necessary oils and can cause acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- gentle on skin and doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction&lt;br /&gt;- will remove stray makeup (though it won&#x27;t replace a true makeup cleanser)&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t burn eyes or skin&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t strip all the oils&lt;br /&gt;- very cheap (especially in a double pack plus a $3 Amazon coupon)&lt;br /&gt;- a bottle will last a month or two with conscientious use&lt;br /&gt;- compatible with other products without causing a reaction&lt;br /&gt;- leaves a clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;- tightens up the pores, so great to use in the morning before makeup and at night&lt;br /&gt;- great for humid weather or oily skin to help makeup last longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- smells like nail polish remover (hold your breath while cleaning around the chin/mouth/nose)&lt;br /&gt;- is a little dry in certain climates, like when I visit Denver, CO (just immediately follow up with serum)&lt;br /&gt;- the only way to apply it is with a cotton ball or pad, which can soak up a lot and waste the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I try other toners, this is a great intro/basic product that fits well into my Japanese Skincare Routine.  It&#x27;s cheap, not too harsh, and leaves my skin feeling clean.  I notice it also controls my oily skin and helps makeup last during the day.  I would buy it again, but will be looking for alternatives.  I feel likesince this toner is mostly witch hazel, I should just buy a bulk bottle of pure witch hazel for $4 or just use rice water.  I will be seeking a toner with more nutrients.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and am always looking for ways to make it less oily. I thought this would work, unfortunately it did not. I was still getting oily spots where I had before. Maybe my skin is too oily, but this product didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally, works great!</li>
            <li> Not the best toner out there. I really didn&#x27;t feel that it did a ton for me and I feel like the oil minimizing nature of this toner ended up making my skin look flat. I have combination skin and thought this would help with oily areas but it didn&#x27;t do too much, even in the summertime when my face was more oily. Spend a little more and get something higher quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t sting your skin, and my skin feels refreshed afterwards. I don&#x27;t have oily skin - if anything, my skin is on the dry side. Since I wear makeup daily, this helps get my skin extra clean and leaves me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Use it all  the time.  Very gentle, and I love the scent.  Never drying and gets rid of the shine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for years, and recently started subscribing to it on Amazon, which is very convenient. I like this toner because it&#x27;s not too strong or too weak. It&#x27;s just right. I supplement with occasional clay masks here and there, but in general this toner is effective at getting most of the dirt and makeup off of my face daily. I also like the fact that it does not have a strong odor like some other toners do.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin, after using this for few days,  i do not yet see any irritated reaction on my face, which is good, but i can smell a tint of alcohol when using, and perfume smell is definitely TOO strong for me.  lets see how long can i bare with this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for years to clean my face every night. Perfect for cleaning without drying out your skin. Much better price than I would get in a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for many years and I will not stop until Olay decides to stop making it.</li>
            <li> The toner itself is OK.  My only complaint is that the cap is too open and I often poured out too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the cheapest toner I&#x27;v ever bought, which is good. However, it smells like alcohol and is stimulating. I threw it away after using it for two days. You will be disappointed if you but it.</li>
            <li> And the second shipment came just in time as I was down to the last 1/2 bottle! I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s considering it.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other toner but this one!  I have combo skin, on the sensitive side.  After using the toner, my skin feels fresh and super clean!  Great price, too!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s the only toner i will ever use. Im not switching. It keeps my skin feeling clean and grit free. I love it!</li>
            <li> I do have oily skin and realized after I started using this minimizing toner it was less greasy. The 2 pack method is really awesome because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner.  It makes my skin feel clean without the burning you can sometimes get with harsh toners.  I have never been disappointed with Olay products.</li>
            <li> I use this after washing my face and am always surprised how much dirt is still on the cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I usually just use witch hazel for toner, but this has a much nicer smell to it.  And really that is the only advantage.  It performs the same function, although I guess it might be a bit moisturizing.  I probably won&#x27;t go out of my way to repurchase it though, Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a good one too.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out, and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.It smells great also.it get the job done and that&#x27;s what is important.</li>
            <li> Todo bien empacado lo que permitio que llegara en muy buenas condiciones, la pieza es tal cual como lo indica las imagenes.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly. I love the way it makes my skin feel, and it has a great fresh smell as well! Glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> She loves this brand, recommended for women with sensitive or rough skin. Maybe men too would like them, just saying.</li>
            <li> After searching high an low for a toner that suits me, I finally found this product abe to solve my problems. But the down side of this is that I can&#x27;t buy this product by itself which is going to cause some problems for me in future...may have to find other site to get this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Olay Oil Minimizing Toner for all skin types.  When I use it after washing my face, the toner makes my skin feel so fresh and clean!  This is an excellent product, and I highly recommend the toner to other customers!</li>
            <li> I like it.best deal ever.I will order this again for my family and friends.I will recommend this to my friends .........</li>
            <li> This toner feels like it&#x27;s doing its job - my pores are seemingly getting smaller and catching less dirt and oil. But it dries my skin out and may be contributing to my skin breaking out slightly. All in all though it may be better if I use the toner once every couple days rather than everyday. Would be great if they made a non-alcoholic version or made this less stringent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is going on with this formerly great product. I&#x27;ve used it for a very long time with good results. Suddenly, the scent is just totally over powering. It&#x27;s always been scented but nothing like this! It smells like they dumped a bottle of perfume in there! My husband says it smells like dish detergent. I don&#x27;t think I can continue to use something with such a strong scent, it is headache producing. I hope the company figures this one out because it was a five star product previously. If you are chemically sensitive this is not for you.</li>
