            <li>These image plates make it easy for you to have artful and unique nails without paying the cost of a manicurist!!</li>

            <li>I love this nail art stamp image plate.</li>
            <li>I love konad image plates.</li>
            <li>buy original way better</li>
            <li>and I thought this is sooo easy to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that making sure I use acetone to clean the plate after each time I stamp helps a lot.</li>
            <li>Konad makes the best plates, hands down.</li>
            <li>luck and enjoy</li>
            <li>The designs on this are great and we&#x27;ve used them multiple times.  </li>
            <li>I really like all the Konad plates and products!!!  </li>
            <li>I love my new plate!!!</li>
            <li>I love all the different designs and I love to do them with my gelish/shellac polishes on my clients and they love them too.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up.</li>
            <li>Their designs are crisp and detailed, and transfer easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes.</li>
            <li>saves money and it&#x27;s sooo sweet.</li>
            <li>It has to be the just perfect amount, not too much, not to little.</li>
            <li>I own about 15 of these plates, all of the Konad brand plates are of high quality and with large prints.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I esnted!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practice and patience to get the designs exactly how you want them, but its also fun and unique.</li>
            <li>Always a clean and consistent stamping image</li>
            <li>I use old gift cards/credit cards to scrape the top of the plate when applying polish.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this plate for the abstract designed at the bottom right.  </li>
            <li>I practiced for a long time before I kind of figure it out.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough</li>
            <li>I became interested in.  </li>
            <li>gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails.</li>
            <li>i really like my konad plates</li>
            <li>I am very skilfull</li>
            <li>The designs stamp really well</li>
            <li>I really like two of the 5 images</li>
            <li>and they work really well.</li>
            <li>The aparently trick is on the second step, when you clean the excess from the plate.</li>
            <li>A lot of cool designs that again you can use different colors with.</li>
            <li>I did buy a Konad brand stamper on Amazon and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel</li>
            <li>Stamping plates work best with Konad polishes as they are dark and thick and will definitely stand out.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li>Large enough to cover larger/wide nails.</li>
            <li>is not original cheap copy.</li>
            <li>My sister purcahsed this as so far no complaints</li>
            <li>I like this particular plate because the designs on it are all completely different with lots of possibilities..</li>
            <li>I felt I spent too much money on this new hobby</li>
            <li>Sure, they&#x27;re a little more expensive</li>
            <li>- this is such a fun little hobby.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the product it got here a little later than I expected</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> There is a little bit of a learning curve for using it, but after a few tries it is fairly easy.</li>
            <li> place these on a paper towel (instead of buying a holder) and it keeps the plate from slipping around.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever tried other stampers so I can&#x27;t attest to Konad brand there.</li>
            <li> I have a few of the imposter plates.</li>
            <li> They look really pretty and work with any nail polish as long as the base layer is lighter and the layer you stamp with is darker and opaque.  </li>
            <li> We can do nail art on a customer in less than 10 minutes on all 10 nails!</li>
            <li> I found it hard to get the stencil to apply to the stamping tool evenly and apply it too.  </li>
            <li> They are hard for me to work with.</li>
            <li> However, some of the smaller designs are nearly impossible to get to show up.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with these!</li>
            <li> sad face</li>
            <li> That way if they turn out wonky I can wipe it off with non-acetone polish remover and start again without worrying about ruining my base coat.</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t so what it says it will :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Konad makes the best plates, hands down. Their designs are crisp and detailed, and transfer easily. I bought this one and another, and those should be enough designs to keep me occupied for some time.</li>
            <li> i really like my konad plates i cant wait to buy some more i lovvee doing my nails i change the design once a week ppl think i go to the shop to get them done...nope i do them myself. saves money and it&#x27;s sooo sweet.</li>
            <li> I own about 15 of these plates, all of the Konad brand plates are of high quality and with large prints. Large enough to cover larger/wide nails. Stamping plates work best with Konad polishes as they are dark and thick and will definitely stand out.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and transfers great! Nice nail design size. Great tool to have at your home nail salon.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love this! It was exactly like described...and for a great price too!! Love love love love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> The design transfer nicely, but the are best for short nails. If you have medium length, you&#x27;ll have to reload the plate and stamp again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, easy to use and looks great!  Variety of designs that will work with many seasons, colors, and manis to come : )</li>
            <li> I have a few of the imposter plates. Even though they are cheaper, most of the images don&#x27;t stamp. I love my new plate!!!</li>
            <li> Great condition - gorgeous designs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this plate for the abstract designed at the bottom right.  I found it hard to get the stencil to apply to the stamping tool evenly and apply it too.  I felt I spent too much money on this new hobby I became interested in.  I resold the piece with the others I bought by Monster ...something like that.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the product it got here a little later than I expected but overall I am very happy with this item</li>
            <li> Love all Konad plates.</li>
            <li> These image plates make it easy for you to have artful and unique nails without paying the cost of a manicurist!!</li>
            <li> I am very skilfull and I thought this is sooo easy to do. But when I tried to do it. I just couldn&#x27;t. I practiced for a long time before I kind of figure it out. The aparently trick is on the second step, when you clean the excess from the plate. I have to practice a lot before I could learn how to take the extra polish paint from the plate. It has to be the just perfect amount, not too much, not to little. VEry nice product but not that easy as seen on the pictures or video. And for that misleading I give it two stars.</li>
            <li> I really like all the Konad plates and products!!!  They work great and every time.  We can do nail art on a customer in less than 10 minutes on all 10 nails!</li>
            <li> I have used the flower design, which works well.  They look really pretty and work with any nail polish as long as the base layer is lighter and the layer you stamp with is darker and opaque.  With a topcoat they stay on nicely and look really good.  There is a little bit of a learning curve for using it, but after a few tries it is fairly easy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the last one in my circle of friends to hear about stamping plates. It&#x27;s practice and patience to get the designs exactly how you want them, but its also fun and unique. I like this particular plate because the designs on it are all completely different with lots of possibilities..</li>
            <li> I love this nail art stamp image plate. Of course Konad puts the best of nail art stamping image products out there on the market. Always a clean and consistent stamping image</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this! Designs are not etched deeP enough to transfer to your nails. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an artist and so having these stamps to do nails with is awesome! I love all the different designs and I love to do them with my gelish/shellac polishes on my clients and they love them too. Using the gelish, the designs last weeks! However, some of the smaller designs are nearly impossible to get to show up. I&#x27;ve found that making sure I use acetone to clean the plate after each time I stamp helps a lot.</li>
            <li> The designs stamp really well plate is backed with paper and covered with plastic film to prevent scratching in transit</li>
            <li> Not really happy with these! They are hard for me to work with. I should have sent them back.&lt;br /&gt;I kept trying them but they wouldn&#x27;t go on very smooth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the knock off brands, buy a Konad!  Sure, they&#x27;re a little more expensive but they make a perfect stamp every time.  They are expertly engraved so I&#x27;ve never had a problem getting a perfect stamp every time.  I never have voids or scratches or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I place these on a paper towel (instead of buying a holder) and it keeps the plate from slipping around.  I use old gift cards/credit cards to scrape the top of the plate when applying polish.  I did buy a Konad brand stamper on Amazon and highly recommend it.  I haven&#x27;t ever tried other stampers so I can&#x27;t attest to Konad brand there.</li>
            <li> Love this konad stamp plate! Details come out perfect on my nails! Easy to use on my kids nails too!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have gotten this plate! I really like two of the 5 images and they work really well.</li>
            <li> Another great konad stamping plate. A lot of cool designs that again you can use different colors with. I used a couple already with gold and silver. They came out very nice with all the intricate detail in them.</li>
            <li> Works great compared to the knock off ones i bought. I will never buy the bulk ones without the Konads name on it. Plate worked well.</li>
            <li> I love konad image plates. There is no reason to spend big bucks on nail art. There is always a nice variety to choose from Konad and have had good luck using all of Konad products.</li>
            <li> does not work, follwed directions had several others try it just doesn&#x27;t so what it says it will :( sad face</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed with this nail plate! I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes. I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes. I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough I&#x27;ll chalk it up to a lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been also playing around with gel nails - so I&#x27;ll do my gel nails gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails. That way if they turn out wonky I can wipe it off with non-acetone polish remover and start again without worrying about ruining my base coat. I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would note (as others have as well), if you buy the stamping kits, don&#x27;t bother with the included scraper. I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up. I use an old credit card, and it&#x27;s awesome. It made all the difference between polish actually sitting in the design so the stamp could be picked up, and the image being smeared all over and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and enjoy - this is such a fun little hobby. All of my girlfriends now are having me practice my stamps on them, and are buying their own sets as well!</li>
            <li> My sister purcahsed this as so far no complaints the on it at all, looks like it was a good buy</li>
            <li> Exactly what I esnted!</li>
            <li> is not original cheap copy. dont buy, i can see the lines that the laser did not cut through. buy original way better</li>
            <li> The designs on this are great and we&#x27;ve used them multiple times.  Thank you for this great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These plates are really nice but are way overpriced! you can get the same plates for alot cheaper if you look at Bundle Monster and Cheeky Products.</li>
