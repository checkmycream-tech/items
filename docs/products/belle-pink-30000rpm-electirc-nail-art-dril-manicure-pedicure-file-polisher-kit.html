            <li>I&#x27;m not a licensed manicurist, but I am a nail artist and do my own nails at home.  </li>
            <li>nice that I don&#x27;t have to wait for my manicurist for touch ups,</li>
            <li>Really nice files come with it.  </li>
            <li>love love love it great product</li>
            <li>, it was very easy with this item.</li>
            <li>Easy to use , works great , looks just as described , good price , I feel like this is just as nice for home use , as well as professional</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be so glad you did and saved a lot of money  :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could do it and at one point</li>
            <li>it was safe and bits will stay in place.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Has more speed than I need, since just learning to do Acrylics at home.  </li>
            <li>I had bought a cheaper electric file before this, but for the price, this is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail drill .</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>You can easily get carried away, but I love having it.</li>
            <li>So far a great product.</li>
            <li>Bits were easy to insert, this is a feature I like, because you have to twist the front to insert and removed bits, which gave me confidence</li>
            <li>but once you read the instructions or watch the video on YouTube,  it becomes easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great purchase I made.</li>
            <li>If you are a nail Technician, spend a little more money on a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very professional and sturdy drill and it will save me a lot of money! :)</li>
            <li>and I thought that one was powerful but this one beats it.</li>
            <li>but I simply re-read the directions and was able to figure it out.  </li>
            <li>Delivered packaged well and fast!</li>
            <li>It came with everything I needed to get started, replacement pieces are universal and easy to find and, once I had the instructions, using it was a breeze.  </li>
            <li>This item works very well.</li>
            <li>I recieved my package today and I tested it out on one of my nails, it works great, but at first it was difficult for me to remove and insert a bit</li>
            <li>This little machine is not only cute, but works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and this is such a powerful drill.</li>
            <li>The most heavy duty one I have owned.</li>
            <li>so I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>I was actually getting ready to bite the bullet and spend a couple of hundred on a &#x27;professional&#x27; machine when I was given this one as a gift.  </li>
            <li>My old one is 15 years old.</li>
            <li>I did purchase the Young Nails Safety Bit, which helps not to cut myself.  </li>
            <li>This has so much vibration in the handle that it actually hurts to use it!</li>
            <li>It is a little difficult to align properly at first and you need to take great care in doing so before you start using, but once it clicks in correctly, no problems at all.</li>
            <li>It removes the hard gel and makes very quick, efficient work of putting on and taking off acrylics.  </li>
            <li>I could not possibly be happier and I suggest to everyone thinking of buying a more expensive machine to try this one first.  </li>

            <li> Fabulous.  Works great.  No problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used once seemed to do fine, but it does sorta feel bogged down a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a licensed manicurist, but I am a nail artist and do my own nails at home.  Trying to save money, I tried several drugstore brands in the twenty to thirty dollar range hoping to get the kind of performance my manicurist&#x27;s machine gave, but they were utterly useless and a waste of money.  I was actually getting ready to bite the bullet and spend a couple of hundred on a &#x27;professional&#x27; machine when I was given this one as a gift.  I only wish I had seen it a couple of years ago!  For a third of what I would have spent on a &#x27;professional&#x27; machine, this one does everything I need and works just as well as the one my manicurist uses in his salon.  It removes the hard gel and makes very quick, efficient work of putting on and taking off acrylics.  It came with everything I needed to get started, replacement pieces are universal and easy to find and, once I had the instructions, using it was a breeze.  I could not possibly be happier and I suggest to everyone thinking of buying a more expensive machine to try this one first.  You&#x27;ll be so glad you did and saved a lot of money  :)</li>
            <li> love love love it great product</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this! I&#x27;m using it on myself and I haven&#x27;t perfected the art just yet, but I&#x27;m almost there! It&#x27;s a very professional and sturdy drill and it will save me a lot of money! :)</li>
            <li> This is great to have...nice that I don&#x27;t have to wait for my manicurist for touch ups, etc. It is a little difficult to align properly at first and you need to take great care in doing so before you start using, but once it clicks in correctly, no problems at all. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could do it and at one point I thought I was going to have to send it back, but I got it to align, thankfully. You do have to be careful not to over do it. You can easily get carried away, but I love having it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, never study how to do nails, I bought this for my cousin how lives in another country, so I decided to try the drill before I sent it to her. I&#x27;m very impressed at the quality and speed of this drill. I did not feel any difference with the ones my neighborhood nail technician have. I did the nails myself both hands, it was very easy with this item. It is sturdy and heavy. Bits were easy to insert, this is a feature I like, because you have to twist the front to insert and removed bits, which gave me confidence it was safe and bits will stay in place. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My previous drill died on me so I needed a new one.  I ordered this drill on Sunday night and it arrived in 2 days.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  At first I had a hard time changing drill bits but I simply re-read the directions and was able to figure it out.  Awesome buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy but I love it. My old one is 15 years old. Lol very easy to use. Perfect nails when finish.</li>
            <li> This little machine is not only cute, but works fantastic.  Can use the foot petal, or hand control.  Has more speed than I need, since just learning to do Acrylics at home.  Really nice files come with it.  I did purchase the Young Nails Safety Bit, which helps not to cut myself.  I had bought a cheaper electric file before this, but for the price, this is so much better.  Would recommend this file over some of the $20 or below ones.  Great customer service also, to answer any questions.  Very Happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I loved works great....</li>
            <li> I love this nail drill . I have been a nail tech for 23 years and this is such a powerful drill. The most heavy duty one I have owned. My last one I had for 8 years and I thought that one was powerful but this one beats it. Love it</li>
            <li> This item works very well. It is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> If you are a nail Technician, spend a little more money on a good product. This has so much vibration in the handle that it actually hurts to use it!</li>

            <li> So far a great product. Lots for your money and works well.  Delivered packaged well and fast!</li>
            <li> Easy to use , works great , looks just as described , good price , I feel like this is just as nice for home use , as well as professional</li>
