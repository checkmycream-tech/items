            <li>but it was perfect for me and it looks supper cute &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>The bangs were a good fit on me!!!</li>

            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>This wig, for the price is a good buy.</li>
            <li>So the shipping is fair.</li>
            <li>im very happy that this was cheap ans.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend although it was good for one time use.</li>
            <li>but this one works and is good quality.</li>
            <li>still good for the price.</li>
            <li>It is a light brown with a red-ish tint, that&#x27;s the best way to describe it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;non-itchy, good quality&lt;br /&gt;came</li>
            <li>Everything was good with the wig except for how it hangs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it fits me perfectly, but my friend tried it on and it didnt fit her, but she had to bun up her hair versus me</li>
            <li>but I assume it is the camera light, because the color of the wig is great!</li>
            <li>and it was good quality.</li>
            <li>Had some good laughs.  </li>
            <li>good for the price.</li>
            <li>I loved this wig .</li>
            <li>Awesome fit and</li>
            <li>I must say IM IN LOVEEEEEEEEE WITH THIS WIG!&lt;br /&gt;It fit perfectly, and framed my face quit flatteringly.</li>
            <li>Good structure to the cut and wave and will wear well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it in a photoshoot and people have loved the pictures.</li>
            <li>It was a fantastic buy and at a great price !</li>
            <li>fairly real&lt;br /&gt;Seems</li>
            <li>like good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thank you and keep up the good work .</li>
            <li>They loved it and so do I.</li>
            <li>The quality of the wig I received was good.</li>
            <li>This is an incredible steal for the price, just trim the bangs to fit your face/head, and you&#x27;re all set!  </li>
            <li>Good News***&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price was good.</li>
            <li>But the wig is good quality</li>
            <li>A good value and quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good buy indeed.</li>
            <li>and everyone loved it.</li>
            <li>It came with a wig cap, which was good.</li>
            <li>:) Loved it!</li>
            <li>It tangles very easy, colors great</li>
            <li>wig isn&#x27;t too terribly full, but perfect for plays or dummies.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a light-medium brown; I was hoping it would be more auburn, but it still looks great!</li>
            <li>which I&#x27;m fine with!!</li>
            <li>So this is a very cute wig.</li>
            <li>In fact it is very believable color of hair.</li>
            <li>but i am VERY SATISFIED with my order.</li>
            <li>As a 1st time buyer of a wig, I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I think if you like wearing wigs for fun then this wig is a great choice!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still very pleased.</li>
            <li>The bangs are great, looks shinny-ish and healthy.</li>
            <li>, this wig looks and feels very healthy.</li>
            <li>The color is more auburn then brown, but still very nice.</li>
            <li>Love this wig!  </li>
            <li>For this price I could not have asked for more!</li>
            <li>It also is light and flows beautifully.</li>
            <li>Although this took forever to come in the mail, it&#x27;s FABULOUS!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li>I plan to get more wigs from this place!</li>
            <li>but more of a plaything!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still definitely cute!</li>
            <li>Have had this wig for about a week now and have worn it over three times and must say I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I have since bought more!</li>
            <li>I really love the quality of hair!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more!</li>

            <li>Excellent quality, easy to brush, easy to wear.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast, arriving almost two weeks before it was predicted to which was a nice surprise. :D</li>

            <li>Nice wig, i truly love it!</li>
            <li>Awesome quick shipping, it came about 2 days early, which was awesome!</li>
            <li>Amazing curls.</li>
            <li>Amazing customer service with this</li>
            <li>I ordered another wig from this company and it fit great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m on the heavier side, and it still looks amazing on me.</li>
            <li>Then the picture but still amazing...</li>
            <li>The hair is really nice quality.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this on a whim with two others I really liked.</li>
            <li>it is nice for me because it allows be to brush it with out have to worry about pulling the wig off when i hit a snag.</li>
            <li>Nice thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a costume party or something of that sort but not for a sophisticated event(work,dinner etc)</li>
            <li>Nice wig cap comes with the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>kind.</li>
            <li>I am kind of wondering what it is going to look like.</li>
            <li>The hair is nice.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how nice it is.</li>
            <li>This is a nice wig.</li>
            <li>like I saw in pictures that I really liked.</li>
            <li>nice quality of a wig.</li>
            <li>the hair is nice and manageable to brush...  </li>
            <li>Nice for a costume.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>But for 8.99 who honestly expects perfection out of the package?  </li>
            <li>and the color is nice, just like in the picture</li>
            <li>Until I found these ones in Amazon pictures (some others are nice too</li>
            <li>It is nice.</li>
            <li>I can blend my own hair in with the wig and make it look two-toned with a darker color.</li>
            <li>I liked it, but my sister liked it</li>
            <li>I bought this wig cuz there was so many good ratings..</li>
            <li>Great feel, and fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Extremely happy with what I received.</li>
            <li>This wig looks nice, it is darker then it is pictured.</li>
            <li>a nice wig for one day use--not an every day wig -i tryed to style the wig</li>
            <li>The wig is nice</li>
            <li>It still works nicely, and looks nice on me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li>The colour is nice.</li>
            <li>Which may look nice from the side but...</li>
            <li>kind of a bowlcut BUT</li>
            <li>It came with a wig cap which was really handy seeing as I lost mine.</li>
            <li>It is worth it, if your looking for good quality wig for a lower price!</li>
            <li>I was so surprise when I got the wig, the color was beautiful, the fit perfect and the look almost natural.</li>
            <li>and my doctors say that it was very beautiful and realistic.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick &amp; they even come with hair nets that fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good wig nice length great quality and fast delivery</li>
            <li>It feels incredibly silky and although it&#x27;s a little shiny it doesn&#x27;t scream out &amp;#34;wig&amp;#34;, it adjusts to my head perfectly, took a while for shipping</li>
            <li>I will say this wig sheds a lot and gets easily tangled, so good maintenance/care and wig detangler is a must.</li>
            <li>perfectly packaged!Cant say enough good stuff.</li>
            <li>Tangles very easily though.</li>
            <li>but all together its a pretty good lil gidy up and go product!</li>
            <li>, im seriously in love with this wig, will purchase more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still really pretty, and a good wig!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try because it&#x27;s GREAT FUN!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to change my haircut without getting it cut.</li>
            <li>Amazing I love it</li>
            <li>I currently own 3 wigs, this one is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best wig I&#x27;ve bought off of Amazon so far.</li>
            <li>if more so than my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Fits perfectly and the color is exactly what they state, a light brown.</li>
            <li>Surprising quality for the price, tangles easily, but most synthetic wigs do.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tangle too easy, either!</li>
            <li>But I was surprised that it was just FABULOUS!!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this wig along with three others--out of the three that have arrived so far, I can confidently say this is the best one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, even if I only get 2 wears out of this, what a great price for this wig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its price, this wig is great-</li>
            <li>Overall this was a great price on a great wig.</li>
            <li>then i thought it would while brushing, it wasn&#x27;t to shiny,came with a hair net, had a nice clip to hold in place,and wig had excellent body.  </li>
            <li>I paid around $6 for this wig, including shipping, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but when it arrived I was stunned by how beautiful the hair is.</li>
            <li>great for the price, but the wig cut doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture.</li>
            <li>The wig is great for the price, the color was pretty close</li>
            <li>I love the color and shape but not the material because break it easily brushing it!</li>
            <li>This wig is pretty good quality, a nice value for the price.  </li>
            <li>good looking, good cut, very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I never thought that the hair fibers would be so great and very realistic.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT product for someone considering permanently coloring or perming their hair, but isn&#x27;t certain how it would look on them.  </li>
            <li>And as an FYI I do not have a huge had either!.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Better quality than many higher-priced wigs.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It feels like real hair and looks great on.</li>
            <li>Might be able to find a style to cover that up.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing it away because it can&#x27;t be brush or combed to look more polished.</li>
            <li>Wig from he&#x27;ll it had a permanent hump in the top ....</li>
            <li>I still wear this wig and is still cute.</li>
            <li>it looks more like that hair texture..</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail today really lovely</li>
            <li>Fits great not itchy and looks real.</li>
            <li>I love wigs.</li>
            <li>It was more of a mousey brown than what it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li>I gifted it to someone</li>
            <li>It even comes with a free bonus wig cap!</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the length.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite wig from my collection.</li>
            <li>And cute</li>
            <li>The part is just a dot at the top, but you can curl or straighten the hair using heat.</li>
            <li>so I just wear hats and beanies with my wig. :)</li>
            <li>Wig cap included as well! :)</li>
            <li>The rounder the head shape, the better the wig will fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are more like waves than anything.</li>
            <li>But so much better.</li>
            <li>Love this wig..</li>
            <li>it looked sure as hell like a wig.</li>
            <li>But still, this wig is quite a steal :)</li>
            <li>The wig itself is cute.</li>
            <li>More close to pic of wig in the box not on the model.</li>
            <li>, just hope it wears well :-)</li>
            <li>The wigs sold by X&amp;Y Angel are a hundred times better.</li>
            <li>Love the cut and color.</li>
            <li>Will be perfect for future makeup looks.</li>
            <li>but it is one of my most worn wigs and one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>and i still looks wonderful!its a bit more reddish than pictured</li>
            <li>but i actually love that about it.</li>
            <li>Love the wig.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just an ok wig.</li>
            <li>She is pleased with the fit/feel of this wig and recommends it.  </li>
            <li>I thought the underside would be brown and top blond, i can see where people get this misconception.</li>
            <li>Love the fiber it is made out of.</li>
            <li>I love the waves.</li>

            <li>This is my all time favorite wig I have ver owned.</li>
            <li>I kept having to run to the bathroom to check it and make sure it wasn&#x27;t pulling up, thank goodness for the bangs.</li>
            <li>made my mom feel sexy</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Great, satisfying wig</li>
            <li>I simply love my wig.</li>

            <li>but i cute them that way</li>
            <li>okay,  yes</li>
            <li>Despite my rating, I acknowledge that it&#x27;s actually not terrible for it&#x27;s price range.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>And I really love the fact that it&#x27;s heat-resistant xD</li>
            <li>will buy again:)</li>
            <li>I LOVE the volume at the crown.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderfully made wig!</li>
            <li>the price you get more than you pay for a lot more.</li>
            <li>I love it ...thnksss ;</li>
            <li>i love the color and the length.</li>
            <li>i was hoping it would be able to be cut and styled</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still really cute.</li>
            <li>but the curls are still there. :]</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest paying more than $10 for it though.  </li>
            <li>I just love the way it feels</li>
            <li>much more proffesionally constructed.if</li>
            <li>the bangs looked so cute</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>: the color on this is lovely.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t wait for fall and winter to sport cute hats.</li>
            <li>Even so, most people like how it looks on me.</li>
            <li>I have felt nothing but sexy when out with this wig</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re both LOVELY.</li>
            <li>When we have our hair styled in a hair salon we look a bit more stylized...</li>
            <li>but these are more what I want from a hairstyle).</li>
            <li>hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>Way more than it is</li>
            <li>But it is much more layered and wavy at the bottom than the pic.</li>
            <li>Girls, this is NOT a wig cap, and is not meant to secure your hair under a wig!</li>
            <li>wig will perform a 100 times better with one.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am ultimately glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love two-toned or three-toned hair.</li>
            <li>more so she took it</li>
            <li>But all in all, satisfied :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me though because I love the color.</li>
            <li>No one suspected a thing. :)</li>
            <li>The minute I took the wig out, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this wig and will be buying others...</li>
            <li>The wig comes with an awesome clasp that hooks together at the top of your neck in the back, and it holds everything on quite</li>
            <li>where.. I almost like this one better.</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>It was a nice cheap way to have the hair I&#x27;ve always wanted, instead of spending hundreds of dollars for hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I saws this wig and fell all the way in love.</li>
            <li>Not as cute as in the picture here on Amazon, but it can be worked with.</li>
            <li>The packaging was top quality, too.</li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;m still pleased with the wig I received.</li>
            <li>The color is ok.  </li>
            <li>It looks ok when you wear it although anybody can tell it&#x27;s a wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>But the color is more ginger than the picture.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly for having paid $8.00 (AND free shipping)</li>
            <li>So pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>Okay I don&#x27;t know what else to write.</li>
            <li>Cute</li>
            <li>I am beyond satisfied.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a present for my friend and she is very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it t/b top quality @ $7-8.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK tho.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had more hair</li>
            <li>Have gotten so many compliments when I wear it, most people do not think it is a wig.  </li>
            <li>I received it and no clips on it to make sure stays on your head, I love the color of it</li>
            <li>it gives me so much confidence and strength for anything coming my way!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this wig, its super cute!</li>
            <li>The cheap price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li>and it looks super cute!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect, even if the bangs are too long to be front bangs</li>
            <li>Makes a good first wig.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It came in pretty good time.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and doesn&#x27;t feel like a cheap wig, good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>It has a snug fit which I love, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have tons of wigs and this is def a super nice wig for the money.</li>
            <li>The hair tangles too easily and when you attempt to brush it out you end up with more hair in the brush than in the wig.</li>
            <li>The wig itself looked highly realistic ; I bought this wig as a Christmas Present for a friend , and the happiness on her face was priceless.</li>
            <li>In bright/direct light it does look a bit too glossy, but it&#x27;s definitely perfect for indoor events (or if you&#x27;re outside just stick to the shade).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say if you need a cheap wig for a costume, it is better than most costume wigs.</li>
            <li>well, I am sure it will be fine for some.</li>
            <li>This wig is great, nice and soft and really pretty!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t ran into any huge tangle issues, and it&#x27;s an adorable wig on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great for my purposes, hair looks natural.  </li>
            <li>So happy I got it great for days when I am lazy and I do t want to do my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the light brown color and the wig style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a medium brown than light brown, though.</li>
            <li>I got it as part of a costume for a play &amp; it would have been perfect - or would have been if it hadn&#x27;t kept slipping off my head.</li>
            <li>If you take good care of the wig, it won&#x27;t tangle so much.  </li>
            <li>but I am very pleased with the product and will buy more as my needs and look wants to change</li>
            <li>wig is a quick and easy way to have a perfect hair day instantly.</li>
            <li>Very nice hair, soft and shinny,</li>
            <li>Other than that the wig is great!</li>
            <li>If the color would have been more true to the pic (or darker option) and it would fit better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t last me for more than a dozen wearings, but that&#x27;s still lan amazing deal!</li>
            <li>A bit shiny but not bad at all!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not bad!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and stays in place.</li>
            <li>Had NO smell and brushes easily.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to clip my hair extensions that I dyed into the piece</li>
            <li>Became tangled fairly easy</li>
            <li>It tangles a bit easily but not in an unmanageable way</li>
            <li>Easy to care for,</li>
            <li>No instructions!!&lt;br /&gt;Hair falls out easily when I tried to untangle it with my fingers</li>
            <li>and I look great, natural, and comfortable wearing it.</li>
            <li>no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great material, it is the right size, the right color, and the right length!</li>
            <li>the wig is gorgeous and really high quality.  </li>
            <li>I think she liked it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned a wig before, but I&#x27;m sure that most are pretty itchy, and that is very true for this one.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig and wow its amazing!</li>
            <li>color is nice and the cut is exactly like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li>but I liked it so much!</li>
            <li>At first i didn&#x27;t like this wig, but after putting on makeup, and wearing nice clothing.</li>
            <li>I ordered the wig and it came in exactly on time which was nice.</li>
            <li>A very nice light brown wig for only $5 &amp; free postage !</li>
            <li>Ok, first off I would like to say the shipping on this product is really interesting.</li>
            <li>Its fine though i should&#x27;ve got a color that went to me.</li>
            <li>The color of this wig is true to the description, very shine-y, &amp; good texture.  </li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s fine if you are going to wear it</li>
            <li>The color was fine</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my go to wig I can throw on quick and feel sexy and chic</li>
            <li>This wig is super cute.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and safely.</li>
            <li>a little darker in color than the picture, but altogether beautiful and worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>However, I think it is still beautiful and enjoy wearing it for a classy and fun look.</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous, it looks really natural!</li>
            <li>This wig is gorgeous, soft, flowy!  </li>
            <li>Love love love my new wig.</li>
            <li>Besides a little thinness, it&#x27;s a perfect wig for your money</li>
            <li>The front and sides fit great, but the back around the occipital bone bunches up a lot when I use the tightening straps.</li>
            <li>The photo is accurate.</li>
            <li>but I must have a huge head, because the darn thing wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>This wig is soft and the color is the perfect brown for anyone looking for a natural brown.  </li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m light brown color hair</li>
            <li>Color was off, it looked cheap.</li>
            <li>The wig fit fantastic.</li>
            <li>Some may say it came darker or really light</li>
            <li>I ordered light brown &amp; my wig is an auburn color.</li>
            <li>it is a light brown with a coppery undertone.</li>
            <li>the wig is a rather snug fit</li>
            <li>color is not the light brown as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter will enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li>most likely my favorite wig I own</li>
            <li>light brown color with reddish undertones&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic wig.</li>
            <li>The bag however does say on it Light brown, which leads me to think the manufacturer is at fault.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had to cut the bangs to fit.</li>
            <li>but I generally fit wigs with a bit of tightness.</li>
            <li>Kind of staticy, really.</li>
            <li>It came in a neat package and was curled and free of knots upon arrival.</li>
            <li>overall great for the price.</li>
            <li>The color light brown i got is comparable to a p4/27.</li>
            <li>does shed a bit, but honestly that&#x27;s because I kept running my fingers through it like it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider the picture light brown to begin with, and it is darker than the pic  anyhow.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers said they got a light colored wig.</li>
            <li>add says light brown,  </li>
            <li>The hair was way too light.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite wigs, natural looking, very beautiful, I look like a totally different person in it . .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
            <li>light brown.</li>
            <li>This is a great costume wig, but if you&#x27;re looking for a daily wearer, or something to wear out, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>It says the the wig is supposed to be light brown.</li>
            <li>It arrived 2 weeks after placing the order even though  the product receipt said it would take about a month because of free shipping</li>
            <li>then ok have fun.</li>
            <li>however I could not even lightly brush it or run my fingers through it [to style] without losing a ton of hair from the wig.</li>
            <li>This is good for a natural look.  </li>
            <li>This wig is great, the wavy long wig is flattering on anyone, and it is super cute.  </li>
            <li>many gaps where you can see the underlying fabric right through the strands</li>
            <li>it is cute when styled right.</li>
            <li>Overall, This is a very nice piece..</li>
            <li>just wish their was more volume on the wig and bangs expecially to make it look more realistic , but</li>
            <li>Great quality but light brown is more like dark brown.</li>
            <li>so I had to cut them a bit, but it is a very well constructed, super cute wig!</li>
            <li>But it still looks really nice and feels fairly realistic.</li>
            <li>Very easy to fix using bobby pins, but still very unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but many people thought it was my natural hair, which I guess proves that quality of the wig is pretty pretty good!</li>
            <li>Besides that it&#x27;s a nice wig and has the right amount of waves in it and is the exact length as portrayed in the picture.</li>
            <li>- it looks cute, and it would move less (i.e. tangle less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for what I paid, this wig is great.</li>
            <li>This wig is so pretty, with soft waves and a very nice shade of Medium to Lightish brown, with highlights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to brush, realistic low lights, nice bounce, easy to detangle, nice fit, and arrived within a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>and they have never disappointed me with their wig quality.</li>
            <li>Ok first off the shipping took a while - which was expected.(5weeks)</li>
            <li>This wig was worth the money!</li>
            <li>It is beautiful and long and brown, and cut very pretty.</li>
            <li>other than that i loved it !</li>
            <li>This wig is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>So Much! :)</li>
            <li>had a lot of fun and got alot of compliments!</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money but would have regretted if it cost anymore!</li>
            <li>I love this wig so much!</li>
            <li>WIG IS FANTASTIC, it is light and comfortable, realistic and cute.  </li>
            <li>it takes a lil bit to get used to new looks but was amazing</li>
            <li>, I quickly ordered this cheap wig....</li>
            <li>and I love them... &amp; Not to mention it camr in almost 2wks early :)</li>
            <li>Great company, great product, lousy shipping time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soft and has a nice sheen</li>
            <li>However, it looks great in a single side braid with some styling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can tangle up pretty easily (my husband said some tangle in it made it look even more real though) and clings to some materials, but an easy run through with a brush afterwards</li>
            <li>other than that its beautiful.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s super cute and looks real!</li>
            <li>I think after receiving it, that the image uploaded by the seller, and definitely by other customers is a very accurate representation of what you will receive :) I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the wig is very pretty!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice wig, doesn&#x27;t shed much, and it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>It looks really natural otherwise and is super cute on!</li>
            <li>The wig holds very true to the picture, arriving styled exactly.</li>
            <li>They are beautifully made and such (once again) HIGH quality!</li>
            <li>I received my wig sooner than expected, which was great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, silky, just amazing.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty happy overall.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments, and it looks real.</li>
            <li>i love the color and the style its very versital</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a full wig-</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>it, the color is true to what was pictured, I think given the thickness of this wig</li>
            <li>Straight wig would be better</li>
            <li>Good shape, bangs pre-cut, and only 3 weeks shipping from HK to US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its feels so soft, and nice.</li>
            <li>We occasionally attend theme parties with friends and this wig is a good addition for my wife.  </li>
            <li>cool2day,should be cool with me.  </li>
            <li>and it does look  good and will buy another one later</li>
            <li>Would wear it if i fixed it nice.</li>
            <li>but overall, for this price it think it&#x27;s a fair deal.</li>
            <li>This item would be good for a one time use only...</li>
            <li>It fits nice and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Thanks Cool2day. :)</li>
            <li>BUT it is NOT as full as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>The wig has so far shown to be nice quality, but it looks nothing like the color shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>It brushes out nicely and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>The waves were really nice and the fibers were really soft too.  </li>
            <li>The only thing would be that the hair gets tangled kind of easily</li>
            <li>Great wig, very soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>too fit right.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t fit it on right.</li>
            <li>or maybe it&#x27;s hair envy because my own hair is very fine and pretty flat at the crown -</li>
            <li>It holds up pretty well, doesn&#x27;t shed or get tangled as easily as others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered many wigs in the past, but this one is by far the best (and ironically, cheapest)</li>
            <li>But other wigs from this company have been great.</li>
            <li>little shiny to look REAL, but awesome for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took about half an hour to brush out after a day&#x27;s wear in fair weather outdoors, though I was really impressed with how well the hair stayed in the wig and how little of it ended up on my brush, considering I was basically picking apart almost-matted hair at that</li>
            <li>It does shed if you comb it, but i just got it, but overall for the price its super cute, i can rock it :)</li>
            <li>Came WITH a free wig cap and a net over the wig to keep in tidy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too silky and gets tangled quickly.</li>
            <li>I am used to more vibrant colors</li>
            <li>, glad I bought for such price :)</li>
            <li>, i was expecting something super shiny like i see in halloween stores</li>
            <li>it gets tangled quickly</li>
            <li>Vendor has refunded quickly though.</li>
            <li>It looks nice when on,  its straight with straight bangs.  </li>
            <li>The hair tangles way to fast , you&#x27;ll be very lucky if you get a full days wear.</li>
            <li>Very, very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>the color is pretty close to pic..but cheaply made..</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this wig.</li>
            <li>In the light it is a really pretty copper color.</li>
            <li>the wig I got was very pretty</li>
            <li>nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The wig was light brown, exactly as shown in the picture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wig is SOOO THICK, i love it and best part is everyone thinks it&#x27;s my natural hair..</li>
            <li>Its still a nice wig, looks good and is in the same quality of what I was looking for but, still, very different.</li>
            <li>granddaughter had a great time wearing it and will pass it down to her siblings.</li>
            <li>Looks nice in picture, but it gets tangled real easily and is really hard to comb and untangle.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be some kind of costume wig when I got it for less then $10 , then when it showed up to my house ( with a wig cap &amp;a pair of free cute purple socks ) but its a very high quality wig !</li>
            <li>Feels soft, quality good, combed easy and no loose hairs came out.</li>
            <li>but it gets really tangled easy.</li>
            <li>It tangles sooo easily, and if you don&#x27;t have much experience with detangling wigs without shedding you might find yourself SOL.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is such a pretty wig with an amazing light brown color.</li>
            <li>It is made exactly like the pictures shown!</li>
            <li>though I was someone else at first glance!</li>
            <li>amazing price and quality, super saver shipping took ten days.</li>
            <li>but WOW it looks REAL and it looks SEXY!  </li>
            <li>Mine was perfect, no tangles and only 2-3 loose hairs that came out when running my fingers through.</li>
            <li>I thought it didn&#x27;t look right on me at first, but the more I wore it and put on my makeup for the day, it INSTANTLY became one of my favorite wigs.</li>
            <li>the color is a little lighter, but it looks great...</li>
            <li>I was able to wash net and use the wig fine.</li>
            <li>Color was good, light brown with a little bit auburn.</li>
            <li>A bit shiny for everyday use, but I am happy.  </li>
            <li>Over all this is a great costume wig nothing for everyday use.</li>
            <li>but once here it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>I bought it for fun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  bought my share of wigs for costumes, but have never had one so lifelike.</li>
            <li>I recommend this wig for anyone who&#x27;s looking it have fun with wigs and incorporate it into their fashion.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the warm brown that is photographed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price I guess ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, this wig is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Not as red as in the pics, It is a nice brunet color.</li>
            <li>so I probably am not going to wear it out, fun for pictures</li>
            <li>however, i just wear it to show to people who comes to the house just for fun.  </li>
            <li>It is more  professional looking.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun item to wear as part of a costume but not something you&#x27;d want to wear out during the day.</li>
            <li>my own husband thought that I had simply walked into the bathroom and put in extensions.&lt;br /&gt;Ten</li>
            <li>Its a fun wig to have though</li>
            <li>While this wig was affordable and just fun to have.  </li>
            <li>I love this, and all my friends say it looks natural.</li>
            <li>They also included a wig cap that was very nice and a little gift aas well.  </li>
            <li>They are more side swept long, but I easily cut them blunt.</li>
            <li>My only problem is it tangles very easily and a lot of hair came out when I first took it out of the package, overall pretty good.</li>
            <li>Its lightweight and tangles less and looks amazing on me!</li>
            <li>super pretty</li>
            <li>The service was quick it did look funni at first</li>
            <li>Also the hair itself is super soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have to be a hair stylist to make a wig look good&amp;#34; because in all reality, you can totally buy a wig that comes perfect right out of the box that you don&#x27;t have to tweak at all, but you&#x27;re certainly not gonna pay just $10 for it like this one!</li>
            <li>This seller always has great wigs its a natural color and while a little shiny it is easily taken care of.</li>
            <li>Might trim to get bangs just right.</li>
            <li>Right length right color</li>
            <li>It has a lot of lumps it seems, it doesn&#x27;t sit right on my head.</li>
            <li>rockstar look to myself; with the right clothes too of course.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned my lesson with buying wigs with bangs because they never turn out right</li>
            <li>And it thined right out.</li>
            <li>but if it were the right color just like the model it wouldve been nicer.</li>
            <li>And I still didn&#x27;t get it on right.</li>
            <li>see my posted photos, wig was put on right out of the package no adjusting in anyway.</li>
            <li>The title&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>My only complain that it&#x27;s a bit shiny and some hair can easily fall, but it still look good for synthetic hair to match human hair.</li>
            <li>As someone who has chemotherapy that tends to make my hair fall out, this was a decent and cheap buy (instead of me paying 5 to 600 dollars in-store).</li>
            <li>the color of mine is more of a dark brown, but i don&#x27;t mind, as it suits me better.  </li>
            <li>it looks pretty realistic, it doesn&#x27;t tangle, and it&#x27;s really easy to style, although i don&#x27;t use heat on it.</li>
            <li>It tangles very easy and when it&#x27;s being brushed a lot of hair falls out.</li>
            <li>I brushed it out a couple of times because it gets tangled very easily, and now there is hair all over my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>Was hoping it would be more red but can&#x27;t really complain it was so cheap</li>
            <li>The size is also very small, so be prepared for that!&lt;br /&gt;Besides for its thinness, it looks gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I love me a synthetic wig.u get what u pay for in general.</li>
            <li>part was kind of strange..</li>
            <li>your own long hair to tuck under there is plenty of room.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>l love this wig the color, the texture, and the hair is heat resistant, a lot better the john renau wig and my Amanda wig, This wig doesn&#x27;t get frizzy like other wigs, in any case you can use a steam product for smart hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of these wigs surprised me in a positive way!!!</li>
            <li>This wig was a bit on the thinner side but the fibers were soft and didnt tangle too easily.</li>
            <li>shake it out a bit to let the strands separate a bit, and if that does not cut back the shine to a level you are comfortable with, dust it lightly with a translucent powder.</li>
            <li>Great quality for such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s a nice soft natural looking wig</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t get a nicer, quick hairstyle for any cheaper than this.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It looks and feels super real.</li>
            <li>So soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig, and as a balding woman, with little extra income, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even fit on my 5 year old well!</li>
            <li>so if you have a larger head or alot of hair you may not find it very comfortable</li>
            <li>looks and feels very real...</li>
            <li>All in all Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Got very very knotted and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for a friend of mine who has a hair problem and she like it very much.</li>
            <li>Yes, the hair looks very real-</li>
            <li>It looked exactly like the picture, maybe a tiny bit darker, and the length was very accurate as well.</li>
            <li>The quality is good, the color is a little darker than the photo.</li>
            <li>super super soft.</li>
            <li>Same color as pictured, perfect little curls hold, too!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>This is my first wig.</li>
            <li>but some bobby pins in it to fix that problem overall its lovely wig for the price.</li>
            <li>most that you&#x27;ll see are pretty sparse in the back-</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail and first of all i took it out</li>
            <li>The color is what attracted me to it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>love it, im getting another one in blonde.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise when you first take it out of the bag</li>
            <li>Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>but mine were pretty blunt cut to begin with (which I don&#x27;t mind at all)</li>
            <li>It looks so real too!</li>
            <li>it looks and feels absolutely real!</li>
            <li>so soft and light...</li>
            <li>it would actually look cute pinned up...</li>
            <li>but they did look cute when i pinned them back.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t even a pretty cosplay wig.</li>
            <li>I have worn this wig several times and I love it.</li>
            <li>I cannot get the entire wig to fit on my head!</li>
            <li>this took forever to get here first of all.</li>
            <li>not even cute enough for a costume.</li>
            <li>This wig arrived exactly on</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t lug this thing into a hairdressers to have her cut in the bangs that should have been there in the first place.  </li>
            <li>it not the exact color of the picture</li>
            <li>i guess if you have more than above shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>overall love the wig and</li>
            <li>i know some may want that exact color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many double takes because of the length!</li>
            <li>This looks pretty real!</li>
            <li>It does come pretty close the way it is shown in the photo</li>
            <li>Overall quite pleased with this wig!&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m actually quite pleased with this wig.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>l wanted that one but the one l got is ok l wouldn&#x27;t trade it back</li>
            <li>This is the first wig I have ever boughten</li>
            <li>And overall it was okay.</li>
            <li>Plus, omg it sheds way too much that it scares me!</li>
            <li>It is still pretty and for the price, I will not complain.  </li>
            <li>Its my first wig.</li>
            <li>Thought it would have more volume or hair to clip back a bit for work.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use it at Anime and Comic conventions for cosplaying (:</li>
            <li>This is the first wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>more red thank anything.</li>
            <li>I got the wig sooner than expected, which was great because I was so impatient :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s how I look with my wigs!&lt;br /&gt;These are my first wigs.</li>
            <li>:))&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I can only recommend this wig to girls who like the pictures but are puzzled because of some rewiews.</li>
            <li>But, if I brush them back and play with it a bit with some spray to hold them it looks much better.</li>
            <li>They are flesh colored and the same material as the control top from a pair of pantyhose.</li>
            <li>and stays on my hed nicely without slipping....</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>The color and length are exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>So this is the first wig I ever purchased.</li>
            <li>After wearing it out for the day to run errands on Sunday, I took it home and found it was pretty tangled.</li>
            <li>at first i thought that its wasnt what i wanted when it came in the  mail , but when i opened up the bag .</li>
            <li>Everyone thinks it is my real hair!</li>
            <li>This is my first introduction to wig land</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever trying on a wig</li>
            <li>I look funny wearing this wig</li>
            <li>When I wore the wig, not only I got many compliments</li>
            <li>Its actually more on the blonde side.</li>
            <li>Its my first time buying a wig</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks like real Hair too!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually my first wig , so i&#x27;m not used to it yet.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be coming back!</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed was the color.</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m pleased with it..</li>
            <li>It is lighter than the picture would indicate but really a pretty wig</li>
            <li>I actually have more hair than this wig</li>
            <li>it did have a few good points...</li>
            <li>Usually most cheap wig are nothing like the photo and turn out to be a frizzy mess of junk after combing .</li>
            <li>/&gt; was able to flat iron it and that help.</li>
            <li>the top two thirds of wig is dark brown, bottom third is almost reddish brown kind of like ombre.  </li>
            <li>This was really easy to brush through originally out of the package, and some hair fell out (not much at all, but I was expecting some)</li>
            <li>right for character cosplays, and pretty realistic for what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>It looks a little more shinier and more auburn than in the photo, but other than that, pretty real looking : )</li>
            <li>Top is kind of thin, can see the stitching.</li>
            <li>This wig is kind of thin, and more for caucasion women...</li>
            <li>Is was cheaply made, and it does not fit if you are going to sell some thing please do a better job.</li>
            <li>Left a good impression for any purchases i make in the future.</li>
            <li>The actual quality of the wig is alright, and it&#x27;s an okay thickness and everything, but the wig isn&#x27;t straight in the slightest.</li>
            <li>Not enough long hair attached to the wig to make it real believable.  </li>
            <li>even though most of cheap wigs look odd, this one does not!  </li>
            <li>It has a bit too much wave in it but that won&#x27;t take very much to straighten out.</li>
            <li>and it was super soft!</li>
            <li>was pretty much what I thought I was ordering and arrived in a timely fashion..</li>
            <li>It is better than those halloween costume wigs and the issues are minor.</li>
            <li>The wig is okay, though very small fitting I find.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The thing is, the wig&#x27;s color is listed as light brown - its definitely red/orange-y brown, more red than brown even.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and curly and I love it.</li>
            <li>it looks like I have a bowl haircut on top of my long hair.</li>
            <li>fully plan to use this wig for school, parties, holidays, going out and about, and pretty much just whenever I can.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything else is pretty much as pictured except for that.</li>
            <li>when I first received it, it smelled really</li>
            <li>But other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with this product, and if I ever need another wig, I&#x27;ll definitely order from here again!</li>
            <li>Soft, silky, full, and just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Needs a wig tangle conditioner.</li>
            <li>loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head,</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have the cash to buy a high-end wig and you have the balls to get a little innovative and take a pair of scissors to a meesly $10 purchase, GET THIS WIG! ^__^</li>
            <li>A new semester is about to start at school, and I fried my hair having too much fun</li>
            <li>The color is a rich light auburn, and the length comes down almost to my waist (at 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I brushed the hair easily like it said to and guess what the hair started falling out</li>
            <li>wig looks realistic with a bit of work, its quite shiny in natural light if worn straight from packaging.</li>
            <li>Very realistic for a synthetic wig</li>
            <li>I like the wig, but the color they send me is kind of like a blondish in between ginger color, which looks kid of odd on me because of my tan skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how easily it gets tangled, even just sitting on it&#x27;s wig stand.</li>
            <li>It is very realistic</li>
            <li>My only concern was that the wig started to tangle as I took it out of the packaging, but it was really easy to fix with a bit of finger combing.</li>
            <li>I have a slightly large head, with medium/short hair</li>
            <li>but you can see bald spots in certain areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The positive: the wig is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;The irony: it tangles like there is no tomorrow.</li>
            <li>I think my first impression was that the hair looks like its in way better quality than what I actually expected, but it just doesn&#x27;t suit my scalp very well...</li>
            <li>the wig is true to color though i know monitors tend to show color in a number of different spectrums (i.e. lighter darker, colder warmer, more reddish or yellow)</li>
            <li>so I cut the fringe in the light brown wig and kept the dark one longer (as it was), because it&#x27;s almost the same as my own hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the first wig i have ever bought and was nervous it wouldnt turn out right but was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It still looked good, but less like natural hair at that point.</li>
            <li>perfect , the only critical comment that i really must make is that i do not like the way the bangs are cut , but you can make it work , with a little time with the straight iron !</li>
            <li>If you really dont care if it is dark or light and just want brown, this is a nice wig, especially for</li>
            <li>For the price, this was amazingly realistic!</li>
            <li>Downsides are that is a little shiny, and the strands are kind of itchy against the skin.</li>
            <li>I got this with very low expectations due to the $6 price tag, but this is actually a pretty good quality wig.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels just like real hair, very soft, is the right colour, and doesn&#x27;t have too much shine.</li>
            <li>very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>, however given the price you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>And you really can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li>and they really like it.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe this was so inexpensive and arrived so fast.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has a straight blunt bang.</li>
            <li>Overall I really enjoy taking pictures and playing with it.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve washed it a couple of times using dish soap and fabric softener, and it doesn&#x27;t really shed at all.</li>
            <li>The wig looks beautiful,a lot like the one in the picture, and in fact looks a lot like real hair to me.</li>
            <li>Much better than expected quality.</li>
            <li>Feels and looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>Feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>but it gets tangled way too fast</li>
            <li>Now i have something to put on when my hubby wants me to ride to town with him</li>
            <li>nothing like the picture way to light Almost sand blonde</li>
            <li>to much shine</li>
            <li>, the shipping takes forever, and its way too shiny to pass for real.</li>
            <li>In all, I highly recommend it~!</li>
            <li>you are looking for a light brown wig, I would suggest searching for a different one.</li>
            <li>i really need it</li>
            <li>i dont have much hair because alot of it came out</li>
            <li>soft and shiny like freshly styled hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>this wig is better than i expected.</li>
            <li>it looks real, and it feels real.</li>
            <li>A bit shiny in the sun or with camera flash, but it&#x27;s expected with most wigs of this price range and quite</li>
            <li>The cap is adjustable and the hair looks real.</li>
            <li>I didnt get my wig on the date posted on amazon, but when I informed the seller, they handled it very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem with seeing too much shine or anything like that.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just watch too much anime</li>
            <li>It looks real it feels real</li>
            <li>The price makes it cheap enough to cut and play with it.</li>
            <li>I think as a result, shes going to let the real hair grow out now.  </li>
            <li>toy makes her look so real</li>
            <li>Be gentle with this wig though, I had a knot in it</li>
            <li>For the price, the quality was better than expected.</li>
            <li>i try not to flip the hair or touch it too much.</li>
            <li>May look real in pictures or on video.</li>
            <li>Pictures taken with the flash on cause it to be really brassy looking</li>
            <li>but with the flash off it looks as real as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price, I wish they had a whole array of colors to choose from because I would be buying one in every shade.</li>
            <li>I always wanted to have one but had never bought because I used to find all the wigs I saw very pompous and unnatural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really shiny and B)</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really mind.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Has some tangling issues,  but nothing to really worry about..</li>
            <li>It doesnt shed much at all either.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really know what to expect with reading the reviews</li>
            <li>The only thing is the wig I received is a copper orange color instead of light brown.</li>
            <li>and get damage to fast.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy wearing it, keeps me from constantly changing the color of my hair now</li>
            <li>The color is very close to the product image, maybe a shade darker.</li>
            <li>shipped fast and as described</li>
            <li>I like it, but not what I really wanted at all..</li>
            <li>After brushing hair fell out and end became very frizzy</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m receiving another wig thanks to them</li>
            <li>it looks real and all</li>
            <li>But hey didn&#x27;t pay much for it, so I didn&#x27;t expect it to be an A+ wig.</li>
            <li>Shipping was amazingly fast for the projected arrival date.</li>
            <li>Feels real.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much tangling to it</li>
            <li>I got this for photoshoots, to change up my looks, and it photographed really well, so thats</li>
            <li>we could not believe the hair was/is real, but appeared to be real.</li>
            <li>The color is stated as Light Brown, when it is actually closer to brown.</li>
            <li>Lets put it this way, it is so shiny that it looks very &amp;#34;wiggy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But to try to pass it off as your real hair, it is not going to happen.</li>
            <li>I did this because the bottom layer did not look real.  </li>
            <li>It was frizzy and didn&#x27;t look real.  </li>
            <li>It looks really brassy and plastic.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed, if it tangles it is a simple fix with a light brushing</li>
            <li>It is much thinner than shown.</li>
            <li>It is also a bit shorter, but not by much.</li>
            <li>However, this one is a real gem amongst inexpensive wigs .</li>
            <li>and now they look a bit better but not much.</li>
            <li>However, the texture is much like doll hair.</li>
            <li>The wig also looks very shiny and unreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this for my friend and it worked out really well.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to reach me that fast.  </li>
            <li>Too cheap to ship back</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Nice but not for an African American person</li>
            <li>and I own quite a few wigs at a variety of prices.</li>
            <li>This wig is super soft and full especially for the price I paid for it although I did not give it a 5 because it was not the color in the picture</li>
            <li>mean, it&#x27;s a good wig</li>
            <li>and I mean different by a large amount my wig is definitely more of a blonde color than brown, but I can&#x27;t complain too much because the price is amazing!</li>
            <li>It gets knotted easy , synthetic hair is not the way to go if your looking for long term hair</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft and would easily pass for actual hair.</li>
            <li>i love it this wig, was amaizing and is exatly what the seller said, long hair and much hair you can feel like natural</li>
            <li>Better than I expected it would be!</li>
            <li>The bangs were fine, not too long at all.  </li>
            <li>My advice, you&#x27;ll be fine as long and there is no wind</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a much lighter brown like the picture and instead got a normal brown that is much darker than the image shown here.</li>
            <li>Even when I offered to pay the difference for a new wig when they get more they just kept pushing the partial refund.  </li>
            <li>This wig looks like real hair and is very silky with a natural wave!</li>
            <li>I bought some dry shampoo to take care of the shine, and it was fine.</li>
            <li>arrived early and looks exactly as pictured</li>
            <li>It looked more real after I brushed it through with my regular brush</li>
            <li>But it falls very naturally in lovely loose waves and it is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>The hair at the back of the wig has some nice loose waves.</li>
            <li>The texture is really silky, but it&#x27;s not hard to just brush it out.</li>
            <li>its a very good product, the size is a litlle small than expected, however can adapt well, and the color is very natural...</li>
            <li>then it is fine, but if I wear it out, it will be obvious that it is not my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural when it&#x27;s on EXCEPT in certain lighting, then it&#x27;s just a smidge too shiny.</li>
            <li>To Amazon: The dark brown wig was ordered by my sister because my budget was kind of low (haha, too much shopping)</li>
            <li>A slight trim to the bangs and looked not terrible.  </li>
            <li>i would def rec if your looking for something inexpensive that looks decent on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it looks fairly realistic on me, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind wearing it out.</li>
            <li>It looks real, is super soft, and once you brush it out a bit the shedding is kept at a minimal.</li>
            <li>Soft, has a natural shine to it, looks and feels like it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft, it looks and feels like real hair, and it fits very snug after adjusting the straps on the inside.</li>
            <li>I tried this wig on, not only was it super shiny and the baby powder trick was hopeless, you could see the wig cap any way you move it.  </li>
            <li>This wig is made of decent quality.  </li>
            <li>The photo in the advertisement isn&#x27;t exactly realistic, so I suggest looking at the customer-provided pictures instead.</li>
            <li>Because within about 15 minutes of me getting this wig and a little light trimming of the bangs to get them blunt and straight across, I got this wig to look PRETTY DANG CLOSE to the product picture - and don&#x27;t say &amp;</li>
            <li>The wig hair is very soft and bouncy like real hair.</li>
            <li>Very soft MUCH pbetter quality than any costume wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>But when I took it out of the package it was very soft and WAS NOT tangle at all!</li>
            <li>The colors very natural looking too!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all wig collectors.</li>
            <li>and I used to pay high price till I found these</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be high quality for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s new out of the package and/or brushed, it looks pretty much like real hair -</li>
            <li>the wig is soft and feels like real hair, it get tangle somewhat easily due to the very pretty light waves it has but it isn&#x27;t to much of an issue or nusences for me, you may be different though.</li>
            <li>It looks just like the picture, maybe a little more red-ish</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more pricy</li>
            <li>For the  price it is ok and the shipping takes a little while</li>
            <li>Soft wig, shine easily removed with dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Its so soft and so realistic!</li>
            <li>This wig is pretty true to color - a little bit darker than the picture, but not by much.</li>
            <li>The quality was great but the color was wrong.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s to be expected for a cheap wig.</li>
            <li>Compared to normal wigs, this one has a strap to adjust it.  </li>
            <li>You really need to make your skull as round as possible in order for the wig to fill out nicely.</li>
            <li>Feel like its not quite as long, but cute enough.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s well worth the price</li>
            <li>matched the color of my normal hair, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>it would looks amazing with a few tracks added for security!!  </li>
            <li>I bought this wig and a couple others because I have very short hair right now because I needed to start over with my hair</li>
            <li>but the wig doesn&#x27;t cover the cap in the back right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like real hair its shiny and soft it would fool anyone into thinking it was natural!</li>
            <li>i more of a dark brown(color #2) and had little highlights that are a light is brown( color #4).&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>Also it is kind of tight if you have a bigger head (like mine,</li>
            <li>the side(s) is good too I bought a second one and the color was totally different from the first not sure why</li>
            <li>compared to more expensive wigs that i&#x27;ve had, this one&#x27;s really noticeable, most likely because A)i</li>
            <li>I wore it this past weekend (May 25th) to a Renaissance Faire and while it looked great, within two hours I could feel it starting to feel like giant dreadlocks in its three sections</li>
            <li>of my other wigs are light weight like this one, but the wig cap doesn&#x27;t show and I can even style it in a pony tail, pig tails etc with/out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not light brown either ifs more light dark brown.</li>
            <li>Item arrived ahead of time in new condition.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wig</li>
            <li>but he too is completely fond of me wearing my two new looks (with my earrings!)</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really style it too much in an updue without netting underneath showing, but when flat it really does look natural.  </li>
            <li>while its no high quality wig, its not bad like some of the others are.</li>
            <li>this wig came in early, its supper soft, it can get tangly if you live in a very windy place</li>
            <li>easy to wash, tangles slightly.  </li>
            <li>Fits comfortably, and lined in a way where with short hair, a wig cap is not totally necessary.</li>
            <li>Made for a childs head, the color was much darker in real life and the inner netting is costume grade.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s to be expected coming from so far and for so cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and a decent color</li>
            <li>There was a little of the shedding that others had mentioned (normal hair does that too) but overall, good quality, especially for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, the colour is as described and very natural looking.</li>
            <li>They look very natural, a bit like when I go to a haidresser</li>
            <li>ok for a few wears and the price!</li>
            <li>but I have a small head so its ok.</li>
            <li>It could be possible to put into higher ponytails if desired, but I have not tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i does not have dark highlights at the root as the photo shows, its light brownish all the way thru.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how much I&#x27;d like this wig - I was afraid it would arrive as a &amp;#34;party wig&amp;#34; - some cheap quality reminiscent of a Halloween store.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The only positve aspect of it is that the bang is exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Wore this on a night out, and it looked incredibly natural!</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig in light brown but mine arrived a dark brown with auburn highlights.  </li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture, same color and length, except the fringe which is longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty obvious</li>
            <li>this wig is comparable to other wigs that i&#x27;ve bought for $30 - $40 dollars, and i&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from this shop.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I received the wig on time, not late or early...</li>
            <li>The fibers were falling out at first, but it shouldn&#x27;t be falling out later.</li>
            <li>This should cut the shine back to a more real level, and make the wig useable for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>mine came true to the color I expected</li>
            <li>Its pretty long ,and looks realistic...</li>
            <li>It looks pretty much identical to the picture (minus the fact that there is a little bit of excess length in the bangs, which could easily be swept to the side or trimmed to look like the picture).</li>
            <li>The bangs are long so if I get it on right, I&#x27;ll have to trim them a bit.</li>
            <li>long as you wear clean clothing and are well put together, this hair will blend right in with your appearance and simply give you that extra professional super-tidy air about you.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be black on the scalp and get light brown toward the bottom.</li>
            <li>I received my order this morning and when I first tried it on, I&#x27;ll be honest: I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a pretty good alternative to a hat on those cold days, but if it&#x27;s windy, you&#x27;ll need a bandana or something.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s just onetime use for Halloween or some other special occasion.</li>
            <li>I would recommend NOT buying this wig, unless you feel lucky enough where you may actually get the one you payed for.</li>
            <li>Fits secure but not too tight and got here ahead of schedule</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s cool, Delivery was fast, fits snug, the color is a dull light brown and not the pretty ambre-ish color like pic, the bangs are nice and thick and contours pretty to my face I did have to trim them slightly, because of the length and how messy it gets with movement</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s due date, which was super</li>
            <li>It is a little shiny, but genuinely passes off as real hair if properly taken care of.</li>
            <li>It came REALLY Early!! :O</li>
            <li>It is just 1 huge clump after wearing it for a few minutes and it looks like it was burned in a spot in the front.</li>
            <li>The trick to making this wig cap fit is to gather as much hair onto the CROWN of your head as possible to create a round skull shape.</li>
            <li>I did trim about eight inches off of it, and fixed the bangs.</li>
            <li>My niece has very curly hair, tying this over her short curly pony</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and life of the wig.</li>
            <li>it has to be brushed too much and it doesn&#x27;t lay style-ish like the pic</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when she arrived.</li>
            <li>The bangs are pretty long, but I like it.</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems not as much hair as I thought it would have.</li>
            <li>its a natural thin.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>/&gt;the wig looks natural on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;the length of the wig is a pictured.&lt;br /&gt;the hair i soft, natural looking, and you cant see the tracks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, wow, was my head sore at the end of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived early.  </li>
            <li>looks natural if you play with the style.</li>
            <li>But WOW.</li>
            <li>Because of the price I was surprised when I received the wig</li>
            <li>If I saw this on someone I might not notice that it is a wig unless I was really checking it out, but I would instantly think that she colored her hair.</li>
            <li>It is soft and does not tangle excessively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow looks jst like the picture lenghth and color.</li>
            <li>The wig is soft, and the style staid until I ran my hands through it.</li>
            <li>felt just as soft</li>
            <li>It was actually early and supposed to be here in February.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would give this product and seller a 5 star rating if only they could figure out how to ship it it in a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d rather spend $100 on a professional wig</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to plastics you may not want to get this wig..</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth the 8 dollars spent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on each of my other wigs but this ine is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I would love to return it and possibly get the correct one (Watch me return it and get the same one back), but since it took so long to come in I&#x27;d rather just keep it, and maybe sell it to a friend.</li>
            <li>Beautiful hair but a little thin</li>
            <li>what, but this brand is not a typical Kanekalon wig that I buy.</li>
            <li>Even so, the item got to me very quickly (in just 2-3 days with One-Day Shipping, meaning pay a little extra)!  </li>
            <li>one problem I do have with it is that unlike real hair, it tangles REALLY easily and is tough to brush out.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have any funky smell to it like some other wigs I bought, so this one got used right away.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for two different cosplays, Renge from Ouran High School Host Club and Asuna from Sword Art Online.</li>
            <li>With a little playing around with it, it looks decent, but it really doesn&#x27;t look very natural.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and looks very natural, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Looks kind of real- feels fake , obviously.</li>
            <li>When I saw this wig online and really learned all the information about it, I was expecting something long, and sleek.</li>
            <li>The bangs are cut straight across, but they were so long that I still had to cut them.</li>
            <li>It was not what I expected, but I think for the price it is, is consistent with the quality.</li>
            <li>so it was a big change to the normal for me.</li>
            <li>Poor quality and tangles easily!</li>
            <li>The color was a little lighter than I expected, but I did love it.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend to any of my friends looking for a new look.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural, and is great to wear every day, or if you are having a bad hair day..</li>
            <li>My only real problem with it is that it is too big for my head.</li>
            <li>This means the hair looks natural enough, but I can&#x27;t seem to part the hair in a flattering and natural way.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the wig I got is curly, but the picture shows a wig with wavy hair.</li>
            <li>and if you really try and play around with it, it could totally pass in public.</li>
            <li>It is still comfortable and soft, just not as thick as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The wig s pretty, look a little fake but good with the price</li>
            <li>It makes my face look really broad as a consequence.</li>
            <li>This is probably the one major thing that makes my wig look \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE impossibly bouncy, full hair like this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long, silky and feels so realistic.</li>
            <li>Apparently, there was no other loop for the strap of the wig</li>
            <li>it is more of a medium brown with subtle ting of red.</li>
            <li>but I was thinking that was encase of some sort of screw up not as a general rule.  </li>
            <li>The color is NOT light brown, it is a dark brown, more brunette.</li>
            <li>However, it is no where near the same color as the picture.  </li>
            <li>To hide my natural hair I would have to brush all the hair on the wig to the back, but I want some hair in the front to frame my face, which I can&#x27;t do if I&#x27;m trying to cover my natural hair at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thank God i didnt spent too much to be upstet.</li>
            <li>WHAT I EXPECTED VERY DISSAPOINTED</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it is too shiny to look natural.</li>
            <li>The wig looked identical to the photo above , and it&#x27;s texture was soft .</li>
            <li>Red tint to the wig, natural color once shine is removed (google search deshine wig).</li>
            <li>This wig is not real hair, but it feels and looks so real.  </li>
            <li>I think that possibly it was not fit for my head size, so it ended up looking a lot more shorter than expected.</li>
            <li>thin!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;color wasn&#x27;t right!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;tangles easily!&amp;#34; but the one I received was fairly thick, the color was exact, and really wigs do tangle.</li>
            <li>At first I was disappointed with the color, but after getting several comments from friends, everyone loved it.</li>
            <li>nice but came in the wrong color....</li>
            <li>They actually took time to handle the issue and shipped me new wigs the same day!</li>
            <li>One other issue is the hair is starting to fall out after the first brushing, and yes I used a wig comb.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that mine is very thin, and you can just barely see the netting through the top!</li>
            <li>My other hasn&#x27;t given me this much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt tight at first, but my head got used to it after an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>since it is so cheap ill give it to m daughter and never order anything like this again very dissapointed</li>
            <li>my natural hair color is similar to the color of the wig, only shorter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it on since I got it out of the packaging (ran a brush through it gently and played a bit with the style) and it hasn&#x27;t tangled itself up like many of the artificial fiber wigs do at the slightest movement.</li>
            <li>It will fit tightly and keep your wig from moving around or slipping back off your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>The cap is a bit tight, so if you have long hair make sure to pin it down well.</li>
            <li>I wore it right out of the &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; (bag rather) and my husband was shocked at how cute it was.</li>
            <li>My head is average size and the cap of the wig fit odd.  </li>
            <li>Hair this long would naturally be lighter at the ends, even if it was colored.</li>
            <li>But on to the product: It is no where near as long as the picture.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that the plugs come out that are secured to the cap which the wing is put on if you are trying to untangle it with fingers gently but not much, but Ive only wore it once.</li>
            <li>This wig is very tangle-resistant compared to any of my other wigs!</li>
            <li>But the wig is a little small and a bid more lighter than the pic</li>
            <li>Right before I put it on, a small glued in chunk of hair fell out, too.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The long section of the wig hair isn&#x27;t even really equivalent to a thick, full head of natural hair - it&#x27;s the heavy fringe and the crown volume that makes this look like a TON of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not terribly so, but it is worth noting here.&lt;br /&gt;-Aside from the wig cap being too small, it&#x27;s weirdly shaped and a bit lumpy even when not on.</li>
            <li>I read some other reviews that mentioned &amp;#34;wig brushes&amp;#34; so I didn&#x27;t try to brush it with my normal brush, but tried with my hands.</li>
            <li>The hair is a little thinner then my other wig was full at the head</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely shiny and I highly doubt this is actually made of the Kanekalon fiber that they claim it&#x27;s made of.  </li>
            <li>The adjustment straps don&#x27;t stay real well but a pin or holding the wig tight as you put it on fixes</li>
            <li>complaint is that this wig is nowhere near the aforementioned light shade of brown--it&#x27;s actually quite dark.</li>
            <li>Fits fine not great, vertical ear-to-ear ripples.</li>
            <li>I think at their prices you have to play a little roulette, but I don&#x27;t think the risk is too much for a $7 bucks!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s maybe just a little lighter then in pic but not by much.  </li>
            <li>Thin and very (TOO) smooth and has shiny hairs, doesn&#x27;t hold a tight enough grip on my head.</li>
            <li>The back is a little thin but for 7 bucks its still amazing deal.</li>
            <li>when I first brushed it little hair came out and the curls stayed for a long time.</li>
            <li>was my first time buying and wearing a wig, and it took me very little time at all to figure it out.</li>
            <li>The bangs are a bit too long, so I may have to cut them down a bit or try to curl them with a large hair roller to get a bit of a lift.</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig and from all the good and bad reveiws</li>

            <li> but it was perfect for me and it looks supper cute &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The bangs were a good fit on me!!!</li>
            <li> Color is pleasant.</li>

            <li> So the shipping is fair.</li>
            <li> im very happy that this was cheap ans.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend although it was good for one time use.</li>
            <li> but this one works and is good quality.</li>
            <li> still good for the price.</li>
            <li> It is a light brown with a red-ish tint, that&#x27;s the best way to describe it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;non-itchy, good quality&lt;br /&gt;came</li>
            <li> Everything was good with the wig except for how it hangs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it fits me perfectly, but my friend tried it on and it didnt fit her, but she had to bun up her hair versus me</li>
            <li> but I assume it is the camera light, because the color of the wig is great!</li>
            <li> and it was good quality.</li>
            <li> Had some good laughs.  </li>
            <li> good for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved this wig .</li>

            <li> I must say IM IN LOVEEEEEEEEE WITH THIS WIG!&lt;br /&gt;It fit perfectly, and framed my face quit flatteringly.</li>

            <li> They loved it and so do I.</li>
            <li> The quality of the wig I received was good.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible steal for the price, just trim the bangs to fit your face/head, and you&#x27;re all set!  </li>
            <li> Good News***&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price was good.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Good buy indeed.</li>
            <li> and everyone loved it.</li>
            <li> It came with a wig cap, which was good.</li>
            <li> :) Loved it!</li>
            <li> It tangles very easy, colors great</li>
            <li> wig isn&#x27;t too terribly full, but perfect for plays or dummies.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a light-medium brown; I was hoping it would be more auburn, but it still looks great!</li>
            <li> which I&#x27;m fine with!!</li>
            <li> So this is a very cute wig.</li>
            <li> In fact it is very believable color of hair.</li>
            <li> but i am VERY SATISFIED with my order.</li>
            <li> As a 1st time buyer of a wig, I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I think if you like wearing wigs for fun then this wig is a great choice!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still very pleased.</li>
            <li> The bangs are great, looks shinny-ish and healthy.</li>
            <li> , this wig looks and feels very healthy.</li>
            <li> The color is more auburn then brown, but still very nice.</li>
            <li> Love this wig!  </li>
            <li> For this price I could not have asked for more!</li>
            <li> It also is light and flows beautifully.</li>
            <li> Although this took forever to come in the mail, it&#x27;s FABULOUS!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li> I plan to get more wigs from this place!</li>
            <li> but more of a plaything!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still definitely cute!</li>
            <li> Have had this wig for about a week now and have worn it over three times and must say I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I have since bought more!</li>
            <li> I really love the quality of hair!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Clean , great waves, good color and shine.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, easy to brush, easy to wear.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast, arriving almost two weeks before it was predicted to which was a nice surprise. :D</li>
            <li> not a bad wig, good color, great price.  </li>
            <li> Nice wig, i truly love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome quick shipping, it came about 2 days early, which was awesome!</li>
            <li> Amazing curls.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service with this</li>
            <li> I ordered another wig from this company and it fit great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m on the heavier side, and it still looks amazing on me.</li>
            <li> Then the picture but still amazing...</li>
            <li> The hair is really nice quality.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim with two others I really liked.</li>
            <li> it is nice for me because it allows be to brush it with out have to worry about pulling the wig off when i hit a snag.</li>
            <li> Nice thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a costume party or something of that sort but not for a sophisticated event(work,dinner etc)</li>
            <li> Nice wig cap comes with the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kind.</li>
            <li> I am kind of wondering what it is going to look like.</li>
            <li> The hair is nice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how nice it is.</li>
            <li> This is a nice wig.</li>
            <li> like I saw in pictures that I really liked.</li>
            <li> nice quality of a wig.</li>
            <li> the hair is nice and manageable to brush...  </li>
            <li> Nice for a costume.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> But for 8.99 who honestly expects perfection out of the package?  </li>
            <li> and the color is nice, just like in the picture</li>
            <li> Until I found these ones in Amazon pictures (some others are nice too</li>
            <li> It is nice.</li>
            <li> I can blend my own hair in with the wig and make it look two-toned with a darker color.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but my sister liked it</li>
            <li> I bought this wig cuz there was so many good ratings..</li>
            <li> Great feel, and fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Extremely happy with what I received.</li>
            <li> This wig looks nice, it is darker then it is pictured.</li>
            <li> a nice wig for one day use--not an every day wig -i tryed to style the wig</li>
            <li> The wig is nice</li>
            <li> It still works nicely, and looks nice on me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li> The colour is nice.</li>
            <li> Which may look nice from the side but...</li>
            <li> kind of a bowlcut BUT</li>
            <li> It came with a wig cap which was really handy seeing as I lost mine.</li>
            <li> It is worth it, if your looking for good quality wig for a lower price!</li>
            <li> I was so surprise when I got the wig, the color was beautiful, the fit perfect and the look almost natural.</li>
            <li> and my doctors say that it was very beautiful and realistic.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick &amp; they even come with hair nets that fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good wig nice length great quality and fast delivery</li>
            <li> It feels incredibly silky and although it&#x27;s a little shiny it doesn&#x27;t scream out &amp;#34;wig&amp;#34;, it adjusts to my head perfectly, took a while for shipping</li>
            <li> I will say this wig sheds a lot and gets easily tangled, so good maintenance/care and wig detangler is a must.</li>
            <li> perfectly packaged!Cant say enough good stuff.</li>
            <li> Tangles very easily though.</li>
            <li> but all together its a pretty good lil gidy up and go product!</li>
            <li> , im seriously in love with this wig, will purchase more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still really pretty, and a good wig!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to try because it&#x27;s GREAT FUN!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to change my haircut without getting it cut.</li>
            <li> Amazing I love it</li>
            <li> I currently own 3 wigs, this one is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best wig I&#x27;ve bought off of Amazon so far.</li>
            <li> if more so than my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and the color is exactly what they state, a light brown.</li>
            <li> Surprising quality for the price, tangles easily, but most synthetic wigs do.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tangle too easy, either!</li>
            <li> But I was surprised that it was just FABULOUS!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig along with three others--out of the three that have arrived so far, I can confidently say this is the best one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, even if I only get 2 wears out of this, what a great price for this wig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its price, this wig is great-</li>
            <li> Overall this was a great price on a great wig.</li>
            <li> then i thought it would while brushing, it wasn&#x27;t to shiny,came with a hair net, had a nice clip to hold in place,and wig had excellent body.  </li>
            <li> I paid around $6 for this wig, including shipping, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but when it arrived I was stunned by how beautiful the hair is.</li>
            <li> great for the price, but the wig cut doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture.</li>
            <li> The wig is great for the price, the color was pretty close</li>
            <li> I love the color and shape but not the material because break it easily brushing it!</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty good quality, a nice value for the price.  </li>
            <li> good looking, good cut, very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I never thought that the hair fibers would be so great and very realistic.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product for someone considering permanently coloring or perming their hair, but isn&#x27;t certain how it would look on them.  </li>
            <li> And as an FYI I do not have a huge had either!.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Better quality than many higher-priced wigs.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It feels like real hair and looks great on.</li>
            <li> Might be able to find a style to cover that up.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it away because it can&#x27;t be brush or combed to look more polished.</li>
            <li> Wig from he&#x27;ll it had a permanent hump in the top ....</li>
            <li> I still wear this wig and is still cute.</li>
            <li> it looks more like that hair texture..</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail today really lovely</li>
            <li> Fits great not itchy and looks real.</li>
            <li> I love wigs.</li>
            <li> It was more of a mousey brown than what it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> I gifted it to someone</li>
            <li> It even comes with a free bonus wig cap!</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the length.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite wig from my collection.</li>
            <li> And cute</li>
            <li> The part is just a dot at the top, but you can curl or straighten the hair using heat.</li>
            <li> so I just wear hats and beanies with my wig. :)</li>
            <li> Wig cap included as well! :)</li>
            <li> The rounder the head shape, the better the wig will fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are more like waves than anything.</li>
            <li> But so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this wig..</li>
            <li> it looked sure as hell like a wig.</li>
            <li> But still, this wig is quite a steal :)</li>
            <li> The wig itself is cute.</li>
            <li> More close to pic of wig in the box not on the model.</li>
            <li> , just hope it wears well :-)</li>
            <li> The wigs sold by X&amp;Y Angel are a hundred times better.</li>
            <li> Love the cut and color.</li>
            <li> Will be perfect for future makeup looks.</li>
            <li> but it is one of my most worn wigs and one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> and i still looks wonderful!its a bit more reddish than pictured</li>
            <li> but i actually love that about it.</li>
            <li> Love the wig.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just an ok wig.</li>
            <li> She is pleased with the fit/feel of this wig and recommends it.  </li>
            <li> I thought the underside would be brown and top blond, i can see where people get this misconception.</li>
            <li> Love the fiber it is made out of.</li>
            <li> I love the waves.</li>

            <li> /&gt;i will be buying more wig from them.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite wig I have ver owned.</li>
            <li> I kept having to run to the bathroom to check it and make sure it wasn&#x27;t pulling up, thank goodness for the bangs.</li>
            <li> made my mom feel sexy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this</li>
            <li> shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Great, satisfying wig</li>
            <li> I simply love my wig.</li>
            <li> Save money and get a better wig</li>
            <li> but i cute them that way</li>
            <li> okay,  yes</li>
            <li> Despite my rating, I acknowledge that it&#x27;s actually not terrible for it&#x27;s price range.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> And I really love the fact that it&#x27;s heat-resistant xD</li>
            <li> will buy again:)</li>
            <li> I LOVE the volume at the crown.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderfully made wig!</li>
            <li> the price you get more than you pay for a lot more.</li>
            <li> I love it ...thnksss ;</li>
            <li> i love the color and the length.</li>
            <li> i was hoping it would be able to be cut and styled</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still really cute.</li>
            <li> but the curls are still there. :]</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest paying more than $10 for it though.  </li>
            <li> I just love the way it feels</li>
            <li> much more proffesionally constructed.if</li>
            <li> the bangs looked so cute</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> : the color on this is lovely.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t wait for fall and winter to sport cute hats.</li>
            <li> Even so, most people like how it looks on me.</li>
            <li> I have felt nothing but sexy when out with this wig</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re both LOVELY.</li>
            <li> When we have our hair styled in a hair salon we look a bit more stylized...</li>
            <li> but these are more what I want from a hairstyle).</li>
            <li> hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> Way more than it is</li>
            <li> But it is much more layered and wavy at the bottom than the pic.</li>
            <li> Girls, this is NOT a wig cap, and is not meant to secure your hair under a wig!</li>
            <li> wig will perform a 100 times better with one.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am ultimately glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I love two-toned or three-toned hair.</li>
            <li> more so she took it</li>
            <li> But all in all, satisfied :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me though because I love the color.</li>
            <li> No one suspected a thing. :)</li>
            <li> The minute I took the wig out, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this wig and will be buying others...</li>
            <li> The wig comes with an awesome clasp that hooks together at the top of your neck in the back, and it holds everything on quite</li>
            <li> where.. I almost like this one better.</li>
            <li> I love this wig.</li>
            <li> It was a nice cheap way to have the hair I&#x27;ve always wanted, instead of spending hundreds of dollars for hair extensions.</li>
            <li> I saws this wig and fell all the way in love.</li>
            <li> Not as cute as in the picture here on Amazon, but it can be worked with.</li>
            <li> The packaging was top quality, too.</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;m still pleased with the wig I received.</li>
            <li> The color is ok.  </li>
            <li> It looks ok when you wear it although anybody can tell it&#x27;s a wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> But the color is more ginger than the picture.</li>
            <li> Quite honestly for having paid $8.00 (AND free shipping)</li>
            <li> So pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> Okay I don&#x27;t know what else to write.</li>
            <li> Cute</li>
            <li> I am beyond satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my friend and she is very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it t/b top quality @ $7-8.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK tho.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had more hair</li>
            <li> Have gotten so many compliments when I wear it, most people do not think it is a wig.  </li>
            <li> I received it and no clips on it to make sure stays on your head, I love the color of it</li>
            <li> it gives me so much confidence and strength for anything coming my way!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this wig, its super cute!</li>
            <li> The cheap price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> and it looks super cute!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect, even if the bangs are too long to be front bangs</li>
            <li> Makes a good first wig.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It came in pretty good time.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and doesn&#x27;t feel like a cheap wig, good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> It has a snug fit which I love, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have tons of wigs and this is def a super nice wig for the money.</li>
            <li> The hair tangles too easily and when you attempt to brush it out you end up with more hair in the brush than in the wig.</li>
            <li> The wig itself looked highly realistic ; I bought this wig as a Christmas Present for a friend , and the happiness on her face was priceless.</li>
            <li> In bright/direct light it does look a bit too glossy, but it&#x27;s definitely perfect for indoor events (or if you&#x27;re outside just stick to the shade).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say if you need a cheap wig for a costume, it is better than most costume wigs.</li>
            <li> well, I am sure it will be fine for some.</li>
            <li> This wig is great, nice and soft and really pretty!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t ran into any huge tangle issues, and it&#x27;s an adorable wig on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great for my purposes, hair looks natural.  </li>
            <li> So happy I got it great for days when I am lazy and I do t want to do my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the light brown color and the wig style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a medium brown than light brown, though.</li>
            <li> I got it as part of a costume for a play &amp; it would have been perfect - or would have been if it hadn&#x27;t kept slipping off my head.</li>
            <li> If you take good care of the wig, it won&#x27;t tangle so much.  </li>
            <li> but I am very pleased with the product and will buy more as my needs and look wants to change</li>
            <li> wig is a quick and easy way to have a perfect hair day instantly.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair, soft and shinny,</li>
            <li> Other than that the wig is great!</li>
            <li> If the color would have been more true to the pic (or darker option) and it would fit better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t last me for more than a dozen wearings, but that&#x27;s still lan amazing deal!</li>
            <li> A bit shiny but not bad at all!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not bad!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and stays in place.</li>
            <li> Had NO smell and brushes easily.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to clip my hair extensions that I dyed into the piece</li>
            <li> Became tangled fairly easy</li>
            <li> It tangles a bit easily but not in an unmanageable way</li>
            <li> Easy to care for,</li>
            <li> No instructions!!&lt;br /&gt;Hair falls out easily when I tried to untangle it with my fingers</li>
            <li> and I look great, natural, and comfortable wearing it.</li>
            <li> no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great material, it is the right size, the right color, and the right length!</li>
            <li> the wig is gorgeous and really high quality.  </li>
            <li> I think she liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a wig before, but I&#x27;m sure that most are pretty itchy, and that is very true for this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig and wow its amazing!</li>
            <li> color is nice and the cut is exactly like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> but I liked it so much!</li>
            <li> At first i didn&#x27;t like this wig, but after putting on makeup, and wearing nice clothing.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wig and it came in exactly on time which was nice.</li>
            <li> A very nice light brown wig for only $5 &amp; free postage !</li>
            <li> Ok, first off I would like to say the shipping on this product is really interesting.</li>
            <li> Its fine though i should&#x27;ve got a color that went to me.</li>
            <li> The color of this wig is true to the description, very shine-y, &amp; good texture.  </li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s fine if you are going to wear it</li>
            <li> The color was fine</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my go to wig I can throw on quick and feel sexy and chic</li>
            <li> This wig is super cute.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> a little darker in color than the picture, but altogether beautiful and worth it!!!  </li>
            <li> However, I think it is still beautiful and enjoy wearing it for a classy and fun look.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous, it looks really natural!</li>
            <li> This wig is gorgeous, soft, flowy!  </li>
            <li> Love love love my new wig.</li>
            <li> Besides a little thinness, it&#x27;s a perfect wig for your money</li>
            <li> The front and sides fit great, but the back around the occipital bone bunches up a lot when I use the tightening straps.</li>
            <li> The photo is accurate.</li>
            <li> but I must have a huge head, because the darn thing wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> This wig is soft and the color is the perfect brown for anyone looking for a natural brown.  </li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m light brown color hair</li>
            <li> Color was off, it looked cheap.</li>
            <li> The wig fit fantastic.</li>
            <li> Some may say it came darker or really light</li>
            <li> I ordered light brown &amp; my wig is an auburn color.</li>
            <li> it is a light brown with a coppery undertone.</li>
            <li> the wig is a rather snug fit</li>
            <li> color is not the light brown as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter will enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li> most likely my favorite wig I own</li>
            <li> light brown color with reddish undertones&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic wig.</li>
            <li> The bag however does say on it Light brown, which leads me to think the manufacturer is at fault.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had to cut the bangs to fit.</li>
            <li> but I generally fit wigs with a bit of tightness.</li>
            <li> Kind of staticy, really.</li>
            <li> It came in a neat package and was curled and free of knots upon arrival.</li>
            <li> overall great for the price.</li>
            <li> The color light brown i got is comparable to a p4/27.</li>
            <li> does shed a bit, but honestly that&#x27;s because I kept running my fingers through it like it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider the picture light brown to begin with, and it is darker than the pic  anyhow.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said they got a light colored wig.</li>
            <li> add says light brown,  </li>
            <li> The hair was way too light.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite wigs, natural looking, very beautiful, I look like a totally different person in it . .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
            <li> light brown.</li>
            <li> This is a great costume wig, but if you&#x27;re looking for a daily wearer, or something to wear out, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> It says the the wig is supposed to be light brown.</li>
            <li> It arrived 2 weeks after placing the order even though  the product receipt said it would take about a month because of free shipping</li>
            <li> then ok have fun.</li>
            <li> however I could not even lightly brush it or run my fingers through it [to style] without losing a ton of hair from the wig.</li>
            <li> This is good for a natural look.  </li>
            <li> This wig is great, the wavy long wig is flattering on anyone, and it is super cute.  </li>
            <li> many gaps where you can see the underlying fabric right through the strands</li>
            <li> it is cute when styled right.</li>
            <li> Overall, This is a very nice piece..</li>
            <li> just wish their was more volume on the wig and bangs expecially to make it look more realistic , but</li>
            <li> Great quality but light brown is more like dark brown.</li>
            <li> so I had to cut them a bit, but it is a very well constructed, super cute wig!</li>
            <li> But it still looks really nice and feels fairly realistic.</li>
            <li> Very easy to fix using bobby pins, but still very unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but many people thought it was my natural hair, which I guess proves that quality of the wig is pretty pretty good!</li>
            <li> Besides that it&#x27;s a nice wig and has the right amount of waves in it and is the exact length as portrayed in the picture.</li>
            <li> - it looks cute, and it would move less (i.e. tangle less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for what I paid, this wig is great.</li>
            <li> This wig is so pretty, with soft waves and a very nice shade of Medium to Lightish brown, with highlights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to brush, realistic low lights, nice bounce, easy to detangle, nice fit, and arrived within a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> and they have never disappointed me with their wig quality.</li>
            <li> Ok first off the shipping took a while - which was expected.(5weeks)</li>
            <li> This wig was worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and long and brown, and cut very pretty.</li>
            <li> other than that i loved it !</li>
            <li> This wig is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> So Much! :)</li>
            <li> had a lot of fun and got alot of compliments!</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money but would have regretted if it cost anymore!</li>
            <li> I love this wig so much!</li>
            <li> WIG IS FANTASTIC, it is light and comfortable, realistic and cute.  </li>
            <li> it takes a lil bit to get used to new looks but was amazing</li>
            <li> , I quickly ordered this cheap wig....</li>
            <li> and I love them... &amp; Not to mention it camr in almost 2wks early :)</li>
            <li> Great company, great product, lousy shipping time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very soft and has a nice sheen</li>
            <li> However, it looks great in a single side braid with some styling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can tangle up pretty easily (my husband said some tangle in it made it look even more real though) and clings to some materials, but an easy run through with a brush afterwards</li>
            <li> other than that its beautiful.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super cute and looks real!</li>
            <li> I think after receiving it, that the image uploaded by the seller, and definitely by other customers is a very accurate representation of what you will receive :) I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the wig is very pretty!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice wig, doesn&#x27;t shed much, and it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> It looks really natural otherwise and is super cute on!</li>
            <li> The wig holds very true to the picture, arriving styled exactly.</li>
            <li> They are beautifully made and such (once again) HIGH quality!</li>
            <li> I received my wig sooner than expected, which was great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, silky, just amazing.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty happy overall.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments, and it looks real.</li>
            <li> i love the color and the style its very versital</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a full wig-</li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> it, the color is true to what was pictured, I think given the thickness of this wig</li>
            <li> Straight wig would be better</li>
            <li> Good shape, bangs pre-cut, and only 3 weeks shipping from HK to US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its feels so soft, and nice.</li>
            <li> We occasionally attend theme parties with friends and this wig is a good addition for my wife.  </li>
            <li> cool2day,should be cool with me.  </li>
            <li> and it does look  good and will buy another one later</li>
            <li> Would wear it if i fixed it nice.</li>
            <li> but overall, for this price it think it&#x27;s a fair deal.</li>
            <li> This item would be good for a one time use only...</li>
            <li> It fits nice and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Thanks Cool2day. :)</li>
            <li> BUT it is NOT as full as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> The wig has so far shown to be nice quality, but it looks nothing like the color shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> It brushes out nicely and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> The waves were really nice and the fibers were really soft too.  </li>
            <li> The only thing would be that the hair gets tangled kind of easily</li>
            <li> Great wig, very soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> too fit right.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t fit it on right.</li>
            <li> or maybe it&#x27;s hair envy because my own hair is very fine and pretty flat at the crown -</li>
            <li> It holds up pretty well, doesn&#x27;t shed or get tangled as easily as others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many wigs in the past, but this one is by far the best (and ironically, cheapest)</li>
            <li> But other wigs from this company have been great.</li>
            <li> little shiny to look REAL, but awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about half an hour to brush out after a day&#x27;s wear in fair weather outdoors, though I was really impressed with how well the hair stayed in the wig and how little of it ended up on my brush, considering I was basically picking apart almost-matted hair at that</li>
            <li> It does shed if you comb it, but i just got it, but overall for the price its super cute, i can rock it :)</li>
            <li> Came WITH a free wig cap and a net over the wig to keep in tidy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too silky and gets tangled quickly.</li>
            <li> I am used to more vibrant colors</li>
            <li> , glad I bought for such price :)</li>
            <li> , i was expecting something super shiny like i see in halloween stores</li>
            <li> it gets tangled quickly</li>
            <li> Vendor has refunded quickly though.</li>
            <li> It looks nice when on,  its straight with straight bangs.  </li>
            <li> The hair tangles way to fast , you&#x27;ll be very lucky if you get a full days wear.</li>
            <li> Very, very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> the color is pretty close to pic..but cheaply made..</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this wig.</li>
            <li> In the light it is a really pretty copper color.</li>
            <li> the wig I got was very pretty</li>
            <li> nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The wig was light brown, exactly as shown in the picture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wig is SOOO THICK, i love it and best part is everyone thinks it&#x27;s my natural hair..</li>
            <li> Its still a nice wig, looks good and is in the same quality of what I was looking for but, still, very different.</li>
            <li> granddaughter had a great time wearing it and will pass it down to her siblings.</li>
            <li> Looks nice in picture, but it gets tangled real easily and is really hard to comb and untangle.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be some kind of costume wig when I got it for less then $10 , then when it showed up to my house ( with a wig cap &amp;a pair of free cute purple socks ) but its a very high quality wig !</li>
            <li> Feels soft, quality good, combed easy and no loose hairs came out.</li>
            <li> but it gets really tangled easy.</li>
            <li> It tangles sooo easily, and if you don&#x27;t have much experience with detangling wigs without shedding you might find yourself SOL.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is such a pretty wig with an amazing light brown color.</li>
            <li> It is made exactly like the pictures shown!</li>
            <li> though I was someone else at first glance!</li>
            <li> amazing price and quality, super saver shipping took ten days.</li>
            <li> but WOW it looks REAL and it looks SEXY!  </li>
            <li> Mine was perfect, no tangles and only 2-3 loose hairs that came out when running my fingers through.</li>
            <li> I thought it didn&#x27;t look right on me at first, but the more I wore it and put on my makeup for the day, it INSTANTLY became one of my favorite wigs.</li>
            <li> the color is a little lighter, but it looks great...</li>
            <li> I was able to wash net and use the wig fine.</li>
            <li> Color was good, light brown with a little bit auburn.</li>
            <li> A bit shiny for everyday use, but I am happy.  </li>
            <li> Over all this is a great costume wig nothing for everyday use.</li>
            <li> but once here it was worth the wait</li>
            <li> I bought it for fun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  bought my share of wigs for costumes, but have never had one so lifelike.</li>
            <li> I recommend this wig for anyone who&#x27;s looking it have fun with wigs and incorporate it into their fashion.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the warm brown that is photographed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price I guess ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, this wig is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Not as red as in the pics, It is a nice brunet color.</li>
            <li> so I probably am not going to wear it out, fun for pictures</li>
            <li> however, i just wear it to show to people who comes to the house just for fun.  </li>
            <li> It is more  professional looking.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun item to wear as part of a costume but not something you&#x27;d want to wear out during the day.</li>
            <li> my own husband thought that I had simply walked into the bathroom and put in extensions.&lt;br /&gt;Ten</li>
            <li> Its a fun wig to have though</li>
            <li> While this wig was affordable and just fun to have.  </li>
            <li> I love this, and all my friends say it looks natural.</li>
            <li> They also included a wig cap that was very nice and a little gift aas well.  </li>
            <li> They are more side swept long, but I easily cut them blunt.</li>
            <li> My only problem is it tangles very easily and a lot of hair came out when I first took it out of the package, overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> Its lightweight and tangles less and looks amazing on me!</li>
            <li> super pretty</li>
            <li> The service was quick it did look funni at first</li>
            <li> Also the hair itself is super soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have to be a hair stylist to make a wig look good&amp;#34; because in all reality, you can totally buy a wig that comes perfect right out of the box that you don&#x27;t have to tweak at all, but you&#x27;re certainly not gonna pay just $10 for it like this one!</li>
            <li> This seller always has great wigs its a natural color and while a little shiny it is easily taken care of.</li>
            <li> Might trim to get bangs just right.</li>
            <li> Right length right color</li>
            <li> It has a lot of lumps it seems, it doesn&#x27;t sit right on my head.</li>
            <li> rockstar look to myself; with the right clothes too of course.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson with buying wigs with bangs because they never turn out right</li>
            <li> And it thined right out.</li>
            <li> but if it were the right color just like the model it wouldve been nicer.</li>
            <li> And I still didn&#x27;t get it on right.</li>
            <li> see my posted photos, wig was put on right out of the package no adjusting in anyway.</li>
            <li> The title&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> My only complain that it&#x27;s a bit shiny and some hair can easily fall, but it still look good for synthetic hair to match human hair.</li>
            <li> As someone who has chemotherapy that tends to make my hair fall out, this was a decent and cheap buy (instead of me paying 5 to 600 dollars in-store).</li>
            <li> the color of mine is more of a dark brown, but i don&#x27;t mind, as it suits me better.  </li>
            <li> it looks pretty realistic, it doesn&#x27;t tangle, and it&#x27;s really easy to style, although i don&#x27;t use heat on it.</li>
            <li> It tangles very easy and when it&#x27;s being brushed a lot of hair falls out.</li>
            <li> I brushed it out a couple of times because it gets tangled very easily, and now there is hair all over my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would be more red but can&#x27;t really complain it was so cheap</li>
            <li> The size is also very small, so be prepared for that!&lt;br /&gt;Besides for its thinness, it looks gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I love me a synthetic wig.u get what u pay for in general.</li>
            <li> part was kind of strange..</li>
            <li> your own long hair to tuck under there is plenty of room.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> l love this wig the color, the texture, and the hair is heat resistant, a lot better the john renau wig and my Amanda wig, This wig doesn&#x27;t get frizzy like other wigs, in any case you can use a steam product for smart hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of these wigs surprised me in a positive way!!!</li>
            <li> This wig was a bit on the thinner side but the fibers were soft and didnt tangle too easily.</li>
            <li> shake it out a bit to let the strands separate a bit, and if that does not cut back the shine to a level you are comfortable with, dust it lightly with a translucent powder.</li>
            <li> Great quality for such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> but otherwise it&#x27;s a nice soft natural looking wig</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t get a nicer, quick hairstyle for any cheaper than this.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It looks and feels super real.</li>
            <li> So soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig, and as a balding woman, with little extra income, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even fit on my 5 year old well!</li>
            <li> so if you have a larger head or alot of hair you may not find it very comfortable</li>
            <li> looks and feels very real...</li>
            <li> All in all Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Got very very knotted and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a friend of mine who has a hair problem and she like it very much.</li>
            <li> Yes, the hair looks very real-</li>
            <li> It looked exactly like the picture, maybe a tiny bit darker, and the length was very accurate as well.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, the color is a little darker than the photo.</li>
            <li> super super soft.</li>
            <li> Same color as pictured, perfect little curls hold, too!</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> This is my first wig.</li>
            <li> but some bobby pins in it to fix that problem overall its lovely wig for the price.</li>
            <li> most that you&#x27;ll see are pretty sparse in the back-</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail and first of all i took it out</li>
            <li> The color is what attracted me to it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> love it, im getting another one in blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise when you first take it out of the bag</li>
            <li> Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> but mine were pretty blunt cut to begin with (which I don&#x27;t mind at all)</li>
            <li> It looks so real too!</li>
            <li> it looks and feels absolutely real!</li>
            <li> so soft and light...</li>
            <li> it would actually look cute pinned up...</li>
            <li> but they did look cute when i pinned them back.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t even a pretty cosplay wig.</li>
            <li> I have worn this wig several times and I love it.</li>
            <li> I cannot get the entire wig to fit on my head!</li>
            <li> this took forever to get here first of all.</li>
            <li> not even cute enough for a costume.</li>
            <li> This wig arrived exactly on</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t lug this thing into a hairdressers to have her cut in the bangs that should have been there in the first place.  </li>
            <li> it not the exact color of the picture</li>
            <li> i guess if you have more than above shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> overall love the wig and</li>
            <li> i know some may want that exact color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many double takes because of the length!</li>
            <li> This looks pretty real!</li>
            <li> It does come pretty close the way it is shown in the photo</li>
            <li> Overall quite pleased with this wig!&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m actually quite pleased with this wig.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> l wanted that one but the one l got is ok l wouldn&#x27;t trade it back</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I have ever boughten</li>
            <li> And overall it was okay.</li>
            <li> Plus, omg it sheds way too much that it scares me!</li>
            <li> It is still pretty and for the price, I will not complain.  </li>
            <li> Its my first wig.</li>
            <li> Thought it would have more volume or hair to clip back a bit for work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it at Anime and Comic conventions for cosplaying (:</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> more red thank anything.</li>
            <li> I got the wig sooner than expected, which was great because I was so impatient :)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s how I look with my wigs!&lt;br /&gt;These are my first wigs.</li>
            <li> :))&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I can only recommend this wig to girls who like the pictures but are puzzled because of some rewiews.</li>
            <li> But, if I brush them back and play with it a bit with some spray to hold them it looks much better.</li>
            <li> They are flesh colored and the same material as the control top from a pair of pantyhose.</li>
            <li> and stays on my hed nicely without slipping....</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> The color and length are exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> So this is the first wig I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> After wearing it out for the day to run errands on Sunday, I took it home and found it was pretty tangled.</li>
            <li> at first i thought that its wasnt what i wanted when it came in the  mail , but when i opened up the bag .</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks it is my real hair!</li>
            <li> This is my first introduction to wig land</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever trying on a wig</li>
            <li> I look funny wearing this wig</li>
            <li> When I wore the wig, not only I got many compliments</li>
            <li> Its actually more on the blonde side.</li>
            <li> Its my first time buying a wig</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks like real Hair too!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually my first wig , so i&#x27;m not used to it yet.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be coming back!</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed was the color.</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m pleased with it..</li>
            <li> It is lighter than the picture would indicate but really a pretty wig</li>
            <li> I actually have more hair than this wig</li>
            <li> it did have a few good points...</li>
            <li> Usually most cheap wig are nothing like the photo and turn out to be a frizzy mess of junk after combing .</li>
            <li> /&gt; was able to flat iron it and that help.</li>
            <li> the top two thirds of wig is dark brown, bottom third is almost reddish brown kind of like ombre.  </li>
            <li> This was really easy to brush through originally out of the package, and some hair fell out (not much at all, but I was expecting some)</li>
            <li> right for character cosplays, and pretty realistic for what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> It looks a little more shinier and more auburn than in the photo, but other than that, pretty real looking : )</li>
            <li> Top is kind of thin, can see the stitching.</li>
            <li> This wig is kind of thin, and more for caucasion women...</li>
            <li> Is was cheaply made, and it does not fit if you are going to sell some thing please do a better job.</li>
            <li> Left a good impression for any purchases i make in the future.</li>
            <li> The actual quality of the wig is alright, and it&#x27;s an okay thickness and everything, but the wig isn&#x27;t straight in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Not enough long hair attached to the wig to make it real believable.  </li>
            <li> even though most of cheap wigs look odd, this one does not!  </li>
            <li> It has a bit too much wave in it but that won&#x27;t take very much to straighten out.</li>
            <li> and it was super soft!</li>
            <li> was pretty much what I thought I was ordering and arrived in a timely fashion..</li>
            <li> It is better than those halloween costume wigs and the issues are minor.</li>
            <li> The wig is okay, though very small fitting I find.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thing is, the wig&#x27;s color is listed as light brown - its definitely red/orange-y brown, more red than brown even.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and curly and I love it.</li>
            <li> it looks like I have a bowl haircut on top of my long hair.</li>
            <li> fully plan to use this wig for school, parties, holidays, going out and about, and pretty much just whenever I can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything else is pretty much as pictured except for that.</li>
            <li> when I first received it, it smelled really</li>
            <li> But other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with this product, and if I ever need another wig, I&#x27;ll definitely order from here again!</li>
            <li> Soft, silky, full, and just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Needs a wig tangle conditioner.</li>
            <li> loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head,</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the cash to buy a high-end wig and you have the balls to get a little innovative and take a pair of scissors to a meesly $10 purchase, GET THIS WIG! ^__^</li>
            <li> A new semester is about to start at school, and I fried my hair having too much fun</li>
            <li> The color is a rich light auburn, and the length comes down almost to my waist (at 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I brushed the hair easily like it said to and guess what the hair started falling out</li>
            <li> wig looks realistic with a bit of work, its quite shiny in natural light if worn straight from packaging.</li>
            <li> Very realistic for a synthetic wig</li>
            <li> I like the wig, but the color they send me is kind of like a blondish in between ginger color, which looks kid of odd on me because of my tan skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how easily it gets tangled, even just sitting on it&#x27;s wig stand.</li>
            <li> It is very realistic</li>
            <li> My only concern was that the wig started to tangle as I took it out of the packaging, but it was really easy to fix with a bit of finger combing.</li>
            <li> I have a slightly large head, with medium/short hair</li>
            <li> but you can see bald spots in certain areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The positive: the wig is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;The irony: it tangles like there is no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I think my first impression was that the hair looks like its in way better quality than what I actually expected, but it just doesn&#x27;t suit my scalp very well...</li>
            <li> the wig is true to color though i know monitors tend to show color in a number of different spectrums (i.e. lighter darker, colder warmer, more reddish or yellow)</li>
            <li> so I cut the fringe in the light brown wig and kept the dark one longer (as it was), because it&#x27;s almost the same as my own hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the first wig i have ever bought and was nervous it wouldnt turn out right but was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It still looked good, but less like natural hair at that point.</li>
            <li> perfect , the only critical comment that i really must make is that i do not like the way the bangs are cut , but you can make it work , with a little time with the straight iron !</li>
            <li> If you really dont care if it is dark or light and just want brown, this is a nice wig, especially for</li>
            <li> For the price, this was amazingly realistic!</li>
            <li> Downsides are that is a little shiny, and the strands are kind of itchy against the skin.</li>
            <li> I got this with very low expectations due to the $6 price tag, but this is actually a pretty good quality wig.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels just like real hair, very soft, is the right colour, and doesn&#x27;t have too much shine.</li>
            <li> very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> , however given the price you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> And you really can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> and they really like it.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe this was so inexpensive and arrived so fast.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has a straight blunt bang.</li>
            <li> Overall I really enjoy taking pictures and playing with it.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve washed it a couple of times using dish soap and fabric softener, and it doesn&#x27;t really shed at all.</li>
            <li> The wig looks beautiful,a lot like the one in the picture, and in fact looks a lot like real hair to me.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected quality.</li>
            <li> Feels and looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> Feels like real hair.</li>
            <li> It looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> but it gets tangled way too fast</li>
            <li> Now i have something to put on when my hubby wants me to ride to town with him</li>
            <li> nothing like the picture way to light Almost sand blonde</li>
            <li> to much shine</li>
            <li> , the shipping takes forever, and its way too shiny to pass for real.</li>
            <li> In all, I highly recommend it~!</li>
            <li> you are looking for a light brown wig, I would suggest searching for a different one.</li>
            <li> i really need it</li>
            <li> i dont have much hair because alot of it came out</li>
            <li> soft and shiny like freshly styled hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> this wig is better than i expected.</li>
            <li> it looks real, and it feels real.</li>
            <li> A bit shiny in the sun or with camera flash, but it&#x27;s expected with most wigs of this price range and quite</li>
            <li> The cap is adjustable and the hair looks real.</li>
            <li> I didnt get my wig on the date posted on amazon, but when I informed the seller, they handled it very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with seeing too much shine or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just watch too much anime</li>
            <li> It looks real it feels real</li>
            <li> The price makes it cheap enough to cut and play with it.</li>
            <li> I think as a result, shes going to let the real hair grow out now.  </li>
            <li> toy makes her look so real</li>
            <li> Be gentle with this wig though, I had a knot in it</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality was better than expected.</li>
            <li> i try not to flip the hair or touch it too much.</li>
            <li> May look real in pictures or on video.</li>
            <li> Pictures taken with the flash on cause it to be really brassy looking</li>
            <li> but with the flash off it looks as real as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price, I wish they had a whole array of colors to choose from because I would be buying one in every shade.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to have one but had never bought because I used to find all the wigs I saw very pompous and unnatural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really shiny and B)</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really mind.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Has some tangling issues,  but nothing to really worry about..</li>
            <li> It doesnt shed much at all either.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really know what to expect with reading the reviews</li>
            <li> The only thing is the wig I received is a copper orange color instead of light brown.</li>
            <li> and get damage to fast.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy wearing it, keeps me from constantly changing the color of my hair now</li>
            <li> The color is very close to the product image, maybe a shade darker.</li>
            <li> shipped fast and as described</li>
            <li> I like it, but not what I really wanted at all..</li>
            <li> After brushing hair fell out and end became very frizzy</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m receiving another wig thanks to them</li>
            <li> it looks real and all</li>
            <li> But hey didn&#x27;t pay much for it, so I didn&#x27;t expect it to be an A+ wig.</li>
            <li> Shipping was amazingly fast for the projected arrival date.</li>
            <li> Feels real.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much tangling to it</li>
            <li> I got this for photoshoots, to change up my looks, and it photographed really well, so thats</li>
            <li> we could not believe the hair was/is real, but appeared to be real.</li>
            <li> The color is stated as Light Brown, when it is actually closer to brown.</li>
            <li> Lets put it this way, it is so shiny that it looks very &amp;#34;wiggy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But to try to pass it off as your real hair, it is not going to happen.</li>
            <li> I did this because the bottom layer did not look real.  </li>
            <li> It was frizzy and didn&#x27;t look real.  </li>
            <li> It looks really brassy and plastic.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed, if it tangles it is a simple fix with a light brushing</li>
            <li> It is much thinner than shown.</li>
            <li> It is also a bit shorter, but not by much.</li>
            <li> However, this one is a real gem amongst inexpensive wigs .</li>
            <li> and now they look a bit better but not much.</li>
            <li> However, the texture is much like doll hair.</li>
            <li> The wig also looks very shiny and unreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend and it worked out really well.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to reach me that fast.  </li>
            <li> Too cheap to ship back</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nice but not for an African American person</li>
            <li> and I own quite a few wigs at a variety of prices.</li>
            <li> This wig is super soft and full especially for the price I paid for it although I did not give it a 5 because it was not the color in the picture</li>
            <li> mean, it&#x27;s a good wig</li>
            <li> and I mean different by a large amount my wig is definitely more of a blonde color than brown, but I can&#x27;t complain too much because the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> It gets knotted easy , synthetic hair is not the way to go if your looking for long term hair</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and would easily pass for actual hair.</li>
            <li> i love it this wig, was amaizing and is exatly what the seller said, long hair and much hair you can feel like natural</li>
            <li> Better than I expected it would be!</li>
            <li> The bangs were fine, not too long at all.  </li>
            <li> My advice, you&#x27;ll be fine as long and there is no wind</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a much lighter brown like the picture and instead got a normal brown that is much darker than the image shown here.</li>
            <li> Even when I offered to pay the difference for a new wig when they get more they just kept pushing the partial refund.  </li>
            <li> This wig looks like real hair and is very silky with a natural wave!</li>
            <li> I bought some dry shampoo to take care of the shine, and it was fine.</li>
            <li> arrived early and looks exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> It looked more real after I brushed it through with my regular brush</li>
            <li> But it falls very naturally in lovely loose waves and it is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> The hair at the back of the wig has some nice loose waves.</li>
            <li> The texture is really silky, but it&#x27;s not hard to just brush it out.</li>
            <li> its a very good product, the size is a litlle small than expected, however can adapt well, and the color is very natural...</li>
            <li> then it is fine, but if I wear it out, it will be obvious that it is not my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural when it&#x27;s on EXCEPT in certain lighting, then it&#x27;s just a smidge too shiny.</li>
            <li> To Amazon: The dark brown wig was ordered by my sister because my budget was kind of low (haha, too much shopping)</li>
            <li> A slight trim to the bangs and looked not terrible.  </li>
            <li> i would def rec if your looking for something inexpensive that looks decent on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it looks fairly realistic on me, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind wearing it out.</li>
            <li> It looks real, is super soft, and once you brush it out a bit the shedding is kept at a minimal.</li>
            <li> Soft, has a natural shine to it, looks and feels like it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly soft, it looks and feels like real hair, and it fits very snug after adjusting the straps on the inside.</li>
            <li> I tried this wig on, not only was it super shiny and the baby powder trick was hopeless, you could see the wig cap any way you move it.  </li>
            <li> This wig is made of decent quality.  </li>
            <li> The photo in the advertisement isn&#x27;t exactly realistic, so I suggest looking at the customer-provided pictures instead.</li>
            <li> Because within about 15 minutes of me getting this wig and a little light trimming of the bangs to get them blunt and straight across, I got this wig to look PRETTY DANG CLOSE to the product picture - and don&#x27;t say &amp;</li>
            <li> The wig hair is very soft and bouncy like real hair.</li>
            <li> Very soft MUCH pbetter quality than any costume wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> But when I took it out of the package it was very soft and WAS NOT tangle at all!</li>
            <li> The colors very natural looking too!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to all wig collectors.</li>
            <li> and I used to pay high price till I found these</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be high quality for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s new out of the package and/or brushed, it looks pretty much like real hair -</li>
            <li> the wig is soft and feels like real hair, it get tangle somewhat easily due to the very pretty light waves it has but it isn&#x27;t to much of an issue or nusences for me, you may be different though.</li>
            <li> It looks just like the picture, maybe a little more red-ish</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more pricy</li>
            <li> For the  price it is ok and the shipping takes a little while</li>
            <li> Soft wig, shine easily removed with dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Its so soft and so realistic!</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty true to color - a little bit darker than the picture, but not by much.</li>
            <li> The quality was great but the color was wrong.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected for a cheap wig.</li>
            <li> Compared to normal wigs, this one has a strap to adjust it.  </li>
            <li> You really need to make your skull as round as possible in order for the wig to fill out nicely.</li>
            <li> Feel like its not quite as long, but cute enough.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s well worth the price</li>
            <li> matched the color of my normal hair, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> it would looks amazing with a few tracks added for security!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this wig and a couple others because I have very short hair right now because I needed to start over with my hair</li>
            <li> but the wig doesn&#x27;t cover the cap in the back right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like real hair its shiny and soft it would fool anyone into thinking it was natural!</li>
            <li> i more of a dark brown(color #2) and had little highlights that are a light is brown( color #4).&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> Also it is kind of tight if you have a bigger head (like mine,</li>
            <li> the side(s) is good too I bought a second one and the color was totally different from the first not sure why</li>
            <li> compared to more expensive wigs that i&#x27;ve had, this one&#x27;s really noticeable, most likely because A)i</li>
            <li> I wore it this past weekend (May 25th) to a Renaissance Faire and while it looked great, within two hours I could feel it starting to feel like giant dreadlocks in its three sections</li>
            <li> of my other wigs are light weight like this one, but the wig cap doesn&#x27;t show and I can even style it in a pony tail, pig tails etc with/out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not light brown either ifs more light dark brown.</li>
            <li> Item arrived ahead of time in new condition.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wig</li>
            <li> but he too is completely fond of me wearing my two new looks (with my earrings!)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really style it too much in an updue without netting underneath showing, but when flat it really does look natural.  </li>
            <li> while its no high quality wig, its not bad like some of the others are.</li>
            <li> this wig came in early, its supper soft, it can get tangly if you live in a very windy place</li>
            <li> easy to wash, tangles slightly.  </li>
            <li> Fits comfortably, and lined in a way where with short hair, a wig cap is not totally necessary.</li>
            <li> Made for a childs head, the color was much darker in real life and the inner netting is costume grade.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s to be expected coming from so far and for so cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and a decent color</li>
            <li> There was a little of the shedding that others had mentioned (normal hair does that too) but overall, good quality, especially for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, the colour is as described and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> They look very natural, a bit like when I go to a haidresser</li>
            <li> ok for a few wears and the price!</li>
            <li> but I have a small head so its ok.</li>
            <li> It could be possible to put into higher ponytails if desired, but I have not tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i does not have dark highlights at the root as the photo shows, its light brownish all the way thru.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how much I&#x27;d like this wig - I was afraid it would arrive as a &amp;#34;party wig&amp;#34; - some cheap quality reminiscent of a Halloween store.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The only positve aspect of it is that the bang is exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Wore this on a night out, and it looked incredibly natural!</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig in light brown but mine arrived a dark brown with auburn highlights.  </li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture, same color and length, except the fringe which is longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty obvious</li>
            <li> this wig is comparable to other wigs that i&#x27;ve bought for $30 - $40 dollars, and i&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from this shop.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I received the wig on time, not late or early...</li>
            <li> The fibers were falling out at first, but it shouldn&#x27;t be falling out later.</li>
            <li> This should cut the shine back to a more real level, and make the wig useable for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> mine came true to the color I expected</li>
            <li> Its pretty long ,and looks realistic...</li>
            <li> It looks pretty much identical to the picture (minus the fact that there is a little bit of excess length in the bangs, which could easily be swept to the side or trimmed to look like the picture).</li>
            <li> The bangs are long so if I get it on right, I&#x27;ll have to trim them a bit.</li>
            <li> long as you wear clean clothing and are well put together, this hair will blend right in with your appearance and simply give you that extra professional super-tidy air about you.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be black on the scalp and get light brown toward the bottom.</li>
            <li> I received my order this morning and when I first tried it on, I&#x27;ll be honest: I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a pretty good alternative to a hat on those cold days, but if it&#x27;s windy, you&#x27;ll need a bandana or something.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s just onetime use for Halloween or some other special occasion.</li>
            <li> I would recommend NOT buying this wig, unless you feel lucky enough where you may actually get the one you payed for.</li>
            <li> Fits secure but not too tight and got here ahead of schedule</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s cool, Delivery was fast, fits snug, the color is a dull light brown and not the pretty ambre-ish color like pic, the bangs are nice and thick and contours pretty to my face I did have to trim them slightly, because of the length and how messy it gets with movement</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s due date, which was super</li>
            <li> It is a little shiny, but genuinely passes off as real hair if properly taken care of.</li>
            <li> It came REALLY Early!! :O</li>
            <li> It is just 1 huge clump after wearing it for a few minutes and it looks like it was burned in a spot in the front.</li>
            <li> The trick to making this wig cap fit is to gather as much hair onto the CROWN of your head as possible to create a round skull shape.</li>
            <li> I did trim about eight inches off of it, and fixed the bangs.</li>
            <li> My niece has very curly hair, tying this over her short curly pony</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and life of the wig.</li>
            <li> it has to be brushed too much and it doesn&#x27;t lay style-ish like the pic</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when she arrived.</li>
            <li> The bangs are pretty long, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems not as much hair as I thought it would have.</li>
            <li> its a natural thin.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> /&gt;the wig looks natural on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;the length of the wig is a pictured.&lt;br /&gt;the hair i soft, natural looking, and you cant see the tracks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, wow, was my head sore at the end of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived early.  </li>
            <li> looks natural if you play with the style.</li>
            <li> But WOW.</li>
            <li> Because of the price I was surprised when I received the wig</li>
            <li> If I saw this on someone I might not notice that it is a wig unless I was really checking it out, but I would instantly think that she colored her hair.</li>
            <li> It is soft and does not tangle excessively.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow looks jst like the picture lenghth and color.</li>
            <li> The wig is soft, and the style staid until I ran my hands through it.</li>
            <li> felt just as soft</li>
            <li> It was actually early and supposed to be here in February.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would give this product and seller a 5 star rating if only they could figure out how to ship it it in a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d rather spend $100 on a professional wig</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to plastics you may not want to get this wig..</li>
            <li> but I think it is worth the 8 dollars spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on each of my other wigs but this ine is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I would love to return it and possibly get the correct one (Watch me return it and get the same one back), but since it took so long to come in I&#x27;d rather just keep it, and maybe sell it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair but a little thin</li>
            <li> what, but this brand is not a typical Kanekalon wig that I buy.</li>
            <li> Even so, the item got to me very quickly (in just 2-3 days with One-Day Shipping, meaning pay a little extra)!  </li>
            <li> one problem I do have with it is that unlike real hair, it tangles REALLY easily and is tough to brush out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any funky smell to it like some other wigs I bought, so this one got used right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for two different cosplays, Renge from Ouran High School Host Club and Asuna from Sword Art Online.</li>
            <li> With a little playing around with it, it looks decent, but it really doesn&#x27;t look very natural.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and looks very natural, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Looks kind of real- feels fake , obviously.</li>
            <li> When I saw this wig online and really learned all the information about it, I was expecting something long, and sleek.</li>
            <li> The bangs are cut straight across, but they were so long that I still had to cut them.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected, but I think for the price it is, is consistent with the quality.</li>
            <li> so it was a big change to the normal for me.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and tangles easily!</li>
            <li> The color was a little lighter than I expected, but I did love it.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend to any of my friends looking for a new look.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural, and is great to wear every day, or if you are having a bad hair day..</li>
            <li> My only real problem with it is that it is too big for my head.</li>
            <li> This means the hair looks natural enough, but I can&#x27;t seem to part the hair in a flattering and natural way.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the wig I got is curly, but the picture shows a wig with wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and if you really try and play around with it, it could totally pass in public.</li>
            <li> It is still comfortable and soft, just not as thick as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The wig s pretty, look a little fake but good with the price</li>
            <li> It makes my face look really broad as a consequence.</li>
            <li> This is probably the one major thing that makes my wig look \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but I LOVE impossibly bouncy, full hair like this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, silky and feels so realistic.</li>
            <li> Apparently, there was no other loop for the strap of the wig</li>
            <li> it is more of a medium brown with subtle ting of red.</li>
            <li> but I was thinking that was encase of some sort of screw up not as a general rule.  </li>
            <li> The color is NOT light brown, it is a dark brown, more brunette.</li>
            <li> However, it is no where near the same color as the picture.  </li>
            <li> To hide my natural hair I would have to brush all the hair on the wig to the back, but I want some hair in the front to frame my face, which I can&#x27;t do if I&#x27;m trying to cover my natural hair at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thank God i didnt spent too much to be upstet.</li>
            <li> WHAT I EXPECTED VERY DISSAPOINTED</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is too shiny to look natural.</li>
            <li> The wig looked identical to the photo above , and it&#x27;s texture was soft .</li>
            <li> Red tint to the wig, natural color once shine is removed (google search deshine wig).</li>
            <li> This wig is not real hair, but it feels and looks so real.  </li>
            <li> I think that possibly it was not fit for my head size, so it ended up looking a lot more shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> thin!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;color wasn&#x27;t right!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;tangles easily!&amp;#34; but the one I received was fairly thick, the color was exact, and really wigs do tangle.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed with the color, but after getting several comments from friends, everyone loved it.</li>
            <li> nice but came in the wrong color....</li>
            <li> They actually took time to handle the issue and shipped me new wigs the same day!</li>
            <li> One other issue is the hair is starting to fall out after the first brushing, and yes I used a wig comb.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that mine is very thin, and you can just barely see the netting through the top!</li>
            <li> My other hasn&#x27;t given me this much</li>
            <li> /&gt;It felt tight at first, but my head got used to it after an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> since it is so cheap ill give it to m daughter and never order anything like this again very dissapointed</li>
            <li> my natural hair color is similar to the color of the wig, only shorter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it on since I got it out of the packaging (ran a brush through it gently and played a bit with the style) and it hasn&#x27;t tangled itself up like many of the artificial fiber wigs do at the slightest movement.</li>
            <li> It will fit tightly and keep your wig from moving around or slipping back off your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> The cap is a bit tight, so if you have long hair make sure to pin it down well.</li>
            <li> I wore it right out of the &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; (bag rather) and my husband was shocked at how cute it was.</li>
            <li> My head is average size and the cap of the wig fit odd.  </li>
            <li> Hair this long would naturally be lighter at the ends, even if it was colored.</li>
            <li> But on to the product: It is no where near as long as the picture.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the plugs come out that are secured to the cap which the wing is put on if you are trying to untangle it with fingers gently but not much, but Ive only wore it once.</li>
            <li> This wig is very tangle-resistant compared to any of my other wigs!</li>
            <li> But the wig is a little small and a bid more lighter than the pic</li>
            <li> Right before I put it on, a small glued in chunk of hair fell out, too.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The long section of the wig hair isn&#x27;t even really equivalent to a thick, full head of natural hair - it&#x27;s the heavy fringe and the crown volume that makes this look like a TON of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not terribly so, but it is worth noting here.&lt;br /&gt;-Aside from the wig cap being too small, it&#x27;s weirdly shaped and a bit lumpy even when not on.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews that mentioned &amp;#34;wig brushes&amp;#34; so I didn&#x27;t try to brush it with my normal brush, but tried with my hands.</li>
            <li> The hair is a little thinner then my other wig was full at the head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely shiny and I highly doubt this is actually made of the Kanekalon fiber that they claim it&#x27;s made of.  </li>
            <li> The adjustment straps don&#x27;t stay real well but a pin or holding the wig tight as you put it on fixes</li>
            <li> complaint is that this wig is nowhere near the aforementioned light shade of brown--it&#x27;s actually quite dark.</li>
            <li> Fits fine not great, vertical ear-to-ear ripples.</li>
            <li> I think at their prices you have to play a little roulette, but I don&#x27;t think the risk is too much for a $7 bucks!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s maybe just a little lighter then in pic but not by much.  </li>
            <li> Thin and very (TOO) smooth and has shiny hairs, doesn&#x27;t hold a tight enough grip on my head.</li>
            <li> The back is a little thin but for 7 bucks its still amazing deal.</li>
            <li> when I first brushed it little hair came out and the curls stayed for a long time.</li>
            <li> was my first time buying and wearing a wig, and it took me very little time at all to figure it out.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a bit too long, so I may have to cut them down a bit or try to curl them with a large hair roller to get a bit of a lift.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig and from all the good and bad reveiws</li>
            <li> The only reason it wouldn&#x27;t last long is if you don&#x27;t know how to take care of it properly.</li>
            <li> Then they turned around and said my only option was to keep the wig and receive a partial refund because the wig was out of stock due to the chinese new year.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t believe I have a large head as I am a faily small woman.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying wigs (especially at this price, but I risked it and bought a few) and I&#x27;m so glad that I did!</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about it looking cheap because of some negative reviews I read and because it was only $10</li>
            <li> It came in a soft envelope neatly folded inside of a black net.</li>
            <li> Color is a soft honey-brown...not too dark which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Also, the bangs are kinda long so you must trim them if necessary.</li>
            <li> I initially started to find interest in getting a wig because I have long hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter what gender you are and how long or short your hair is, you&#x27;ll always need one.</li>
            <li> but its a bit thin not bad tho</li>
            <li> the part/ bangs go a little too far back.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a simple long wig for some cosplays and this did the trick!</li>
            <li> Also it gets tangled and messy after a while and lost those beautiful curls. :(</li>
            <li> The hair is soft but has a shine to it though and the color appears a little darker in the pic.</li>
            <li> I was thinking that maybe the wigs would look too fake, or ridiculous, or good for halloween...</li>
            <li> The wig is short and straight with bangs that swoop to the side, VERY small (Barely fits on my head) and dark brown.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time putting on the wig because I didn&#x27;t (and still don&#x27;t, really) know how to put it on</li>
            <li> The bangs are too long, but that&#x27;s fixable.</li>
            <li> made it look like she truly had a long pony tail</li>
            <li> Long.</li>
            <li> I used my straightener on its lowest setting while the hair is wet and after adding a leave-in conditioner, and it instantly smooths away any frizz.</li>
            <li> and not that long.</li>
            <li> The bangs come long but you can cut them or put them to the side.</li>
            <li> some say they are too long</li>
            <li> I just received it, and the bangs are long, so you will have to cut them if you want them to look like the model pictured, but otherwise they&#x27;re just side-swept</li>
            <li> My hair is not comfortably covered completely any way I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> the bang is kinda long, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Downfall was it took a long time to be delivered...</li>
            <li> Wig arrived 6 days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> not as long as I thought</li>
            <li> The wig arrived later than I wished but it was expected as the shipping details had told me</li>
            <li> Bangs are long and you&#x27;ll have to trim them.</li>
            <li> Also, It is not a natural looking color to me.</li>
            <li> The wig is as expected for the very low price paid.</li>
            <li> Did not take long to get.</li>
            <li> I understand it came a long way from China.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it looks long in the picture, but once you put it on, BOY IS IT LONG.  </li>
            <li> However, the fullness of long hair that seems to be shown in the picture is deceptive.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this back in september and it came sooner than i expected.</li>
            <li> know that the seller specifies this long shipping time</li>
            <li> OMG too long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as long as it looks in the pictures.</li>
            <li> and it is long which is</li>
            <li> The wig is not accurate as far as the color.</li>
            <li> It seems to be fairly thick and covers very well.  </li>
            <li> It can get tangled when it&#x27;s windy, but a little finger combing usually sets it right.</li>
            <li> Only negative things I can think of was that it took a little working with to get the bangs the way I wanted and to keep the lace cap concealed (the cap is black but wig is light brown</li>
            <li> ; By that i mean some hairs want to curl, some want to be straight, and some try to be wavy.</li>
            <li> rather late and slow but other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Its not very high quality</li>
            <li> The curls look natural, but boy is this wig TIGHT!</li>
            <li> The only default I see, ( Which comes with any synthetic wig) was it&#x27;s extremely</li>
            <li> is nothing like any of my other wigs and for similar prices.  </li>
            <li> Its so realistic and hardly ever sheds.</li>
            <li> It is thick, and it barely shed when I brushed it multiple times.</li>
            <li> the bangs are very long and i will of to trim them</li>
            <li> Warning this company takes a very long time to ship***&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a long wig it is very long!</li>
            <li> I had to adjust it once or twice, but considering that it lasted all day without so much as a single tangle</li>
            <li> For less than $10, you can potentially save yourself from a costly, long term hair disaster.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth it to return back to sender</li>
            <li> Does anyone else have this problem or is my head just bigger than average?</li>
            <li> so a good length for other is annoying for me because it goes over/ under my glasses.</li>
            <li> , it seems to loose a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I have a condition that makes me loose my hair</li>
            <li> but if it hangs down the sides of your face, there is nothing in the back but bald patches.</li>
            <li> a little stringy and thin but no net shows through and looks very real.</li>
            <li> especially considering I paid less than 10 bucks for it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly concerned with that though.</li>
            <li> I trimmed the fringe still not realistic at all...</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because I have a smaller head, and my previous wigs were made custom.</li>
            <li> the wig is not realistic.</li>
            <li> then I thought it would be and the bangs are side bangs not classic bangs...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super thin!</li>
            <li> The reason in which I give this four stars is just due to the fact that it wasn&#x27;t as long as it looked in the photos.</li>
            <li> I always had long thick hair but recently cut it short and regret it.</li>
            <li> The hair is awesome, just wished it was thicker as it&#x27;s too thin and get messed up making it too hard or impossible to brush</li>
            <li> 1/3 down my back and the other two over my shoulders in front).</li>
            <li> After a while the wig gets a little luscious, and it totally looks like that &amp;#34;woke up from my sleep, but i still look awesome&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the cut was a bit different but that can be changed with a little tweaking.</li>
            <li> The fringes needed a little cut, but that&#x27;s probably cause I have a short forehead.</li>
            <li> cap is not huge like other people said, but it&#x27;s probably because I have such long hair.</li>
            <li> The bangs are cut way to far back on my wig and are very thick.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be very thick throughout the whole wig, not just on the bottom.</li>
            <li> bad because if the cap was smaller I think it would have been fantastic...</li>
            <li> but I expected that for a cheaper wig.</li>
            <li> but that is expected since it shipped from China.</li>
            <li> Not much curl to it</li>
            <li> but i will rag roll it carefully &amp;</li>
            <li> Just not what i expected.</li>
            <li> it s quite sorter than i expected in the picture</li>
            <li> The Bangs were also were shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> they were very short and uneven</li>
            <li> delivery quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> ur a drag queen order like 3.</li>
            <li> : the wig is tiny tiny tiny and construction is poor.</li>
            <li> But, I only gave it 3 stars for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bangs are not as wide as it is in the pic.</li>
            <li> but as is expected of like a $10 wig</li>
            <li> It came when it was expected.</li>
            <li> It is a bit darker, than shown, but that can be expected.</li>
            <li> Not the color that was expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected and in a bubble mailer.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected in a wig</li>
            <li> Thick and soft.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick as I would like, which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if the wig is big enough to hide all my hair.</li>
            <li> Down fall is it took a long time for it to get to me.</li>
            <li> Everyone who said the wig was very long must be imp status or something because this wig was so short (just a couple inches past my shoulders)</li>
            <li> The wife has long black hair to her butt...</li>
            <li> The only down side was how tight it was.</li>
            <li> Um... how long did you mess with and try adjusting the wig?</li>
            <li> The short pieces fall over the long hair all the way back to behind my ears.</li>
            <li> I tried my usual method of placing my hair evenly around my head, but that left empty spaces along the cap.</li>
            <li> Bangs were a little long, but nothing a pair of scissors won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I had to trim the bangs and the bottom because it was a little too long for me.</li>
            <li> little too long so they need trimming.</li>
            <li> Like another wig I bought from this seller this wig surprised me, it is thick and has a slight wave it</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I have a big head or something</li>
            <li> everyone who is complaining about it being too small must have really big heads.</li>
            <li> and I agree with the other writers</li>
            <li> The bangs were even as described, which I did not expect from other reviews.</li>
            <li> I plan on experimenting with StaticGuard, just to see if it will change anything, but I&#x27;ve never had it happen to me before with any of my other wigs.&lt;br /&gt;-For</li>
            <li> The delay was probably due to the Haiyan hurricane.</li>
            <li> big dangling earrings can catch hold to the hair and tangle into the hair, but small profile earrings don&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> At least 4 inches off the bottom, and some layers, especially angled around the face to try and blend in the heavy bangs.on mine.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to search through this shippers wigs and see if they carry something lighter that is not platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> I go and open the package, and looking back at me is the wrong wig entirely!</li>
            <li> At first I was sad about the hair but after I talk to my seller they agreed to help with the hair problem.</li>
            <li> Waaaay sooner then expected!</li>
            <li> I have 7 other wigs made of this fiber and the texture, look and weight</li>
            <li> next issue that I had with this wig is that the bang is very uneven.</li>
            <li> The bad thing is, it easily tangles when i tried combing in my fingers.</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected much less.</li>
            <li> I had much more expensive wigs with much worse quality.</li>
            <li> The curls aren&#x27;t terrible, but I wanted the wavy look for something more natural.</li>
            <li> I pulled it back into a tight half up, half down</li>
            <li> I have my thin, shoulder-length hair in a wig cap, and it will not fit on my head if I put it in a pony tail first, and even then I&#x27;m still a little worried it will pop off of my head eventually.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stringy which I expected for the price</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a little straighter and curlier at the ends.</li>
            <li> I suggest spraying a little dry shampoo on it to tone the shine down a little bit.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen bad quality wigs ( like costume wigs) that are far more expensive.</li>
            <li> also it is dark dark brown.</li>
            <li> My wig is dark reddish brown and not what I paid for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too silky, and the advertised wig has dark roots.</li>
            <li> The wig I got is a medium brown to dark brown color.</li>
            <li> very stringy tangles way to easily..very shiny and fake looking</li>
            <li> It was a dark brown and nothing but curls.</li>
            <li> So if you are buying this for a specific occasion, order at least a month before your event.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> I bought another one - a dark brown one -</li>
            <li> As for the quality of the wig, it&#x27;s a bit shiny, but not so much that you can immediately say it&#x27;s fake.  </li>
            <li> It looked a little shiny but that&#x27;s nothing a little dry shampoo can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> however when mine arrived it was straight in some parts and slightly curled in random areas.i purchased it for some of my celebrity tutorials on youtube.</li>
            <li> Length is down to my waist.</li>
            <li> two thumbs down</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll see hair down the sides</li>
            <li> You can also wear it up or down...</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfy wearing it all down, but I fishtail braided it and put my fave hat on</li>
            <li> down</li>
            <li> If I comb them down like the pic</li>
            <li> I am just sticking with the X &amp; Y brand since they have never let me down once in this</li>
            <li> That being said, the sides of the bangs end very abruptly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how flat the hair was on my head, but the hair was really thick on the bottom, if that makes since.</li>
            <li> it black</li>
            <li> Slightly darker color,</li>
            <li> I spent about an hour trying it on, cutting the bangs to be straight across instead of side swept</li>
            <li> It arrived in half the shipping time.</li>
            <li> its slightly darker</li>
            <li> And it came with a black fishnet wig cap too.  </li>
            <li> 3 stars because it took me half an hour to get it on.</li>
            <li> The color is slightly darker than the product&#x27;s picture.  </li>
            <li> I ended up cutting it to make it wearable but yu cant complain that much ased on the price!  </li>
            <li> This wig is a lighter color with an orange tint and not full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible for me to keep my hair long with it being so fine and thin.</li>
            <li> This wig is definitely not a light brown nor even a medium brown, it is closer to a dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;Either</li>
            <li> The wig however is long and curly and thick.</li>
            <li> The bangs are thick, but the rest of the long hair is quite scarce.  </li>
            <li> Obviously for ten dollars the part will be a little weird, the hair will be a little shiney, and it&#x27;s going to tangle a little bit.</li>
            <li> so it shows through when hair is pulled tight)</li>
            <li> Also, when I attach the straps the\\&quot;headband\\&quot; it creates is too tight.</li>
            <li> But you can def tell its fake live.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t shiny, doesn&#x27;t look fake, and it&#x27;s pretty thick as well.</li>
            <li> This seems like a 100 doller wig ONLY DOWN FALL ITS THIN.</li>
            <li> Color is a little darker than the picture.</li>
            <li> It shed a little</li>
            <li> The bangs for me were a little too severe</li>
            <li> the bangs are cut a little bit</li>
            <li> but has too little hair.</li>
            <li> A little darker in color than I was hoping for</li>
            <li> It was packaged quite well, a little darker than pictured but fits well and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> a little combing does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit darker then</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little lighter in the sun, but nothing too dramatic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it out for over a year with little results.</li>
            <li> It is a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than the image</li>
            <li> nothing a little adjusting can fix.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty wig don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it isn&#x27;t made for all heads it runs very small.</li>
            <li> It is a little thin in the back</li>
            <li> Alright - I have to say first, that anybody that whines about this wig is just plain silly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely short, too shinny, horrible color on azn light skin tone,horrible cut,etc.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t quite what I expected, and it&#x27;s not as thick as it appears in the product pictures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this wig for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> This product is not fir for everyday  wear.</li>
            <li> def a everyday look</li>
            <li> I recommend this for Halloween costumes not for everyday wear type.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> The only thing is the bangs are so thin?</li>
            <li> ive had it for a few months</li>
            <li> Adding a few extensions and no one should notice it&#x27;s a wig at all.</li>
            <li> this may not fit you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - maybe the remnants of styling products/head oils killed any unnatural shine?</li>
            <li> I did have a few problems with it, however.</li>
            <li> Shes worn it a few times and likes the look a lot.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are having trouble with it getting tangled, braid it when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
            <li> I was scared the color was going to be to harsh against my skin.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a few colors to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I just wear my hair and interchange with the few wigs I&#x27;ve boughten.</li>
            <li> I washed it a few times and straightened it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig around the end of November and received it a few days after Christmas.</li>
            <li> The color of the wig was dead on!The wig</li>
            <li> got this wig for a alice in wonderland costume, but my mom put the wig on and went out the door in it, I would wear this wig on a bad hair day, I didn&#x27;t notice excessive shedding, like  your hair, gotta work with it, its soft, shinny enough,about the same length in the picture.</li>
            <li> did not like the color at all ... item very small could not really pull it over my head as needed.</li>
            <li> I found it very odd.</li>
            <li> The wig cap is a little small</li>
            <li> Was little too small for my head plus my hair.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little bit thin, but the tracks don&#x27;t show so</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that the bangs are&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had ordered this wig and two others and out of the three this one was not only the least expensive, but lacking in the quality of the other two.</li>
            <li> very little shedding</li>
            <li> The bangs were a little thick</li>
            <li> size is a little small but made it work...not as thick as the picture made it seem</li>
            <li> The wig was to small for my head</li>
            <li> The wig cap attached to this wig is so small.</li>
            <li> I cannot wear this wig because it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the color and length of the wig, it isn&#x27;t too awful shiny and is a breeze to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure.</li>
            <li> and it was not elegant at all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to wear to prevent me from cutting y natural hair as I&#x27;m growing it out.</li>
            <li> wig size is RATHER small, even at it&#x27;s largest unclasped size.</li>
            <li> and it is kinda small on my head.</li>
            <li> But alot of the hair came out also :/</li>
            <li> , it was a small price to pay.&lt;br</li>
            <li> me, being a guy, need to do a small part.</li>
            <li> The only sad thing about this is that the colour is not at all like the photo.</li>
            <li> I have a small forehead</li>
            <li> I got the wig not caring if it was ugly or bad because its for a costume I&#x27;ll have to wear to disguise my identity, but my god i love it!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m very impatient</li>
            <li> and I pulled it too hard and the fibers frizzed :/</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t tangle as bad as the other wig I have, (not from the same company)</li>
            <li> Too bad though, I have 10 other wigs and they are lasting me up to and over 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Can not brush or comb this wig too hard or the hair will shed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look like a dull idiot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little but thin, but can&#x27;t be seen through.</li>
            <li> I gotta say is, its a little thin and shiny.</li>
            <li> but at least you&#x27;ll see what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of unrealistic shine to it, but for a $12 synthetic wig, that&#x27;s sort of expected.</li>
            <li> I plan on cutting mine into a different style.</li>
            <li> Still loses a lot of hairs, though.</li>
            <li> This wig sucks.</li>
            <li> and it is thick hair</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thick hair that I struggle to hide under the wig.</li>
            <li> Not too thick.</li>
            <li> Thick, well cut.  </li>
            <li> I have seen someone is obviously color blind and does not know what they are doing !</li>
            <li> and i feel a bit lazy!</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s bad about this wig is that the cap is way to small and that is not that dense.</li>
            <li> Who ever left bad reviews are clearly not creative.</li>
            <li> This one, did not tangle TOO easily at first, but after the 4th use, it was getting to the point of bad tangling, UNABLE to be tamed with brushing, all that did was, tie knots (</li>
            <li> only for dress up and cosplay..very very very very fake.</li>
            <li> AS FAR AS THE LENGHT IS CONCERNED. :(</li>
            <li> did have to let it air out a bit because it had a somewhat weird smell, but other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> but now I have to pay for t he return to CHINA, not real impressed with this company</li>
            <li> for serious use.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s technically styled and length like the picture, but unfortunately this wig looks extremely fake.  </li>
            <li> Needs tons of Bobby pins for the loose and awkward hairstrands.</li>
            <li> , the netting is very weak and I&#x27;ve been having trouble trying to make it stay on my head.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about it is that it frizzed up on the second day, and I took well care of it.</li>
            <li> it was a hazel brown not light brown.all wrong</li>
            <li> Not too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few comments on this wig (and other Cool2Day wigs) that they received their order and were disappointed because it didn&#x27;t wear anything like the picture shows.....</li>
            <li> I was so shocked that it would take so long to get here.</li>
            <li> so I had a tough time putting it on.</li>
            <li> I hated waiting the excessive long time to get this, but now I am sold and am going to purchase another.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is a bit thin</li>
            <li> Not happy with this hair at all</li>
            <li> Too thin- tracks show.</li>
            <li> I am not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is thin but</li>
            <li> honetly looks like how Asians hair is, thin but beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thin, but it&#x27;s a 7 dollar wig, so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Like Barbie hair but worse</li>
            <li> I got it for my Anna of Arendale cosplay and it&#x27;s too thin.  </li>
            <li> But thin.</li>
            <li> It was extremely thin out you can see the your hair under it...</li>
            <li> With a headband on it doesn&#x27;t look half bad.  </li>
            <li> biggest complaint would be the bangs, they&#x27;re rather short, but it&#x27;s not the worst thing in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I read a review that also got the wrong color.</li>
            <li> fake looking plastic like doll hair&lt;</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to wigs!</li>
            <li> Really fake looking and</li>
            <li> the manufacturer is color blind or the seller mistakenly packaged the wrong wig into the bag.</li>
            <li> wrong color and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the wrong color</li>
            <li> the length and the curl was wrong and the color was off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a wig like this!</li>
            <li> Ill post picture</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> but i was unable to do anything but straighten them out.</li>
            <li> nothing like this color and fake looking.  </li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t look fake and falls into place well</li>
            <li> But for that type of wig it would be expensive.</li>
            <li> Wtf...</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> And I contacted the seller and had to send five pictures to prove it was wrong.</li>
            <li> I got a call from the seller who admitted it was wrong then said.</li>
            <li> But in the summer sun, its obviously fake because it shines like tinsel.  </li>
            <li> pple knowing my wigs are fake and the wig cap never shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> know if I got the wrong wig or</li>
            <li> this looks so fake and not anything close to the photo that you see.</li>
            <li> The bang is somewhat so weird.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> By last week I was thinking I was going to leave a nasty review.</li>
            <li> For this price you just can&#x27;t go wrong .</li>
            <li> so i just have a completely useless wig</li>
            <li> a very thin wig.</li>
            <li> Looks very fake and the hair is thin.</li>
            <li> The color&#x27;s a little lighter than it is in the picture, but I didn&#x27;t mind terribly.</li>
            <li> the ends were pokey and kept stabbing my face.</li>
            <li> The hair is falling out like it&#x27;s diseased.  </li>
            <li> I ask again r u crazy?</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s at an awkward stage, I needed something to distract me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> My hair is in that awkward stage where I an&#x27;t do anything with it</li>
            <li> I did end up cutting about 5 inches off of the bottom to make it shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> like crazy</li>
            <li> However, the wig fits really awkwardly on my head and it sheds a lot.  </li>
            <li> Way way too fake looking wig!</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t bad, it is a chestnut brown.</li>
            <li> Ugly wig.</li>
            <li> I am just disappointed about the color.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s shedding like crazy!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed .</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T buy it you will just be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So annoying.</li>
            <li> And getting sew-in and extensions is annoying</li>
            <li> It looks very fake!</li>
            <li> and it was tangled BAD!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy!</li>
            <li> I Have to say this is an awful item.</li>
            <li> The hair lines awful</li>
            <li> This wig is horrible.</li>
            <li> And it sheds HORRIBLY</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this is a horrible wig but between the size and color</li>
            <li> My husband was skeptical about the idea (well, he didn&#x27;t want me to pierce my ears!!!!!)</li>
            <li> so well the hair looks horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This wig is super soft and full especially for the price I paid for it although I did not give it a 5 because it was not the color in the picture and I mean different by a large amount my wig is definitely more of a blonde color than brown, but I can&#x27;t complain too much because the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> Came as pictured! I love this wig, its super cute!</li>
            <li> Bangs was side ways......dont look like pic</li>
            <li> daughter loved it for cosplay</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the bangs..In the picture they look short, above the eye brows, but they are actually a bit longer than that and when I wear it I have to side sweep my bangs.. But this could just be because my head is shaped differently from the girl in the picture. Overall, This is a very nice piece..</li>
            <li> I got the wig not caring if it was ugly or bad because its for a costume I&#x27;ll have to wear to disguise my identity, but my god i love it! It&#x27;s like real hair its shiny and soft it would fool anyone into thinking it was natural! Came a week ahead of schedule. Love it it&#x27;s perfect, even if the bangs are too long to be front bangs I can just cut them.</li>
            <li> Good wig. As pictured. Might trim to get bangs just right. Would purchase from them again. Was hoping it would be more red but can&#x27;t really complain it was so cheap</li>
            <li> the wig pictured must be a different item than what was shipped. the color is different, the cut of the bangs are different, the length is probably also different. very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I just received my wig (almost a week sooner than the earliest delivery date) and I must say, I&#x27;m fairly impressed (especially considering I paid less than 10 bucks for it). The color isn&#x27;t quite what I expected, and it&#x27;s not as thick as it appears in the product pictures. But it falls very naturally in lovely loose waves and it is incredibly soft. I&#x27;ve had it on since I got it out of the packaging (ran a brush through it gently and played a bit with the style) and it hasn&#x27;t tangled itself up like many of the artificial fiber wigs do at the slightest movement. In bright/direct light it does look a bit too glossy, but it&#x27;s definitely perfect for indoor events (or if you&#x27;re outside just stick to the shade).&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint would be the bangs, they&#x27;re rather short, but it&#x27;s not the worst thing in the world.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend to any of my friends looking for a new look.</li>
            <li> Thick and soft. It doesn&#x27;t have that unnatural shine to it. I did trim about eight inches off of it, and fixed the bangs. I get a lot of compliments on my hair when I wear this out in public. I&#x27;m going to buy a second one to keep on hand in case I need it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than I expected. My only real problem with it is that it is too big for my head. I think I can make it work though. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this wig!  Built-in elastic cap helps keep it in place.  Hair is of very good quality.  Color is a soft honey-brown...not too dark which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is good for a natural look.  Compared to normal wigs, this one has a strap to adjust it.  If you take good care of the wig, it won&#x27;t tangle so much.  The bangs are too long, but that&#x27;s fixable.</li>
            <li> Color is a little darker than the picture. Easy to use and stays in place. Tangles very easily though. Had NO smell and brushes easily.  Looks kind of real- feels fake , obviously. For the price, it&#x27;s great. Makes a good first wig.</li>
            <li> Great for my purposes, hair looks natural.  Very, very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I looooved this wig! It feels incredibly silky and although it&#x27;s a little shiny it doesn&#x27;t scream out &amp;#34;wig&amp;#34;, it adjusts to my head perfectly, took a while for shipping but once here it was worth the wait</li>
            <li> The shape is out after couple times of wearing it.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and tangles easily!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and great quality!  Best buy for the price.  Better quality than many higher-priced wigs.</li>
            <li> u can tell its wiggery</li>
            <li> I really like it! I&#x27;ve had it for a couple mouths now, and it works great. I have gotten so many compliments, and it looks real. It&#x27;s just the color is a bit darker than pictured.</li>
            <li> great item AAAAA++++++</li>
            <li> ok,so for the price I will not return and will use it on Halloween, however, to use this for every day there is just no way.  The wig looks great but is made for an elephant; the cap is the biggest I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad because if the cap was smaller I think it would have been fantastic...oh well.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig. I bought it for fun and I love it. It feels like real hair and looks great on. The color is more auburn then brown, but still very nice.</li>
            <li> Color was good, light brown with a little bit auburn. Top is kind of thin, can see the stitching. Might be able to find a style to cover that up. Length is down to my waist. The bangs were fine, not too long at all.  It shed a little but I expected that for a cheaper wig. I appreciate the consumer pictures, and I will post one as well (once i find the style I like).</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m light brown color hair w/blonde this wig you sent me had no bangs like it shows in the picture and its the darkest brown Red hair color I have seen someone is obviously color blind and does not know what they are doing ! since it is so cheap ill give it to m daughter and never order anything like this again very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig thinking it would look basic.  My head is average size and the cap of the wig fit odd.  The bangs started all the way towards the back of my head.  I ended up cutting it to make it wearable but yu cant complain that much ased on the price!  You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Color was off, it looked cheap. I ended up throwing it away because it can&#x27;t be brush or combed to look more polished.</li>
            <li> Wig from he&#x27;ll it had a permanent hump in the top ....two thumbs down</li>
            <li> I still wear this wig and is still cute. I don&#x27;t wear it often tho.</li>
            <li> This wig was a bit on the thinner side but the fibers were soft and didnt tangle too easily. I was very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This wig is kind of thin, and more for caucasion women...it looks more like that hair texture..the color is pretty close to pic..but cheaply made..ok for a few wears and the price!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a beautiful wig cant wait until comes!!! i love the color and the style its very versital looks good for all occassions!!!</li>
            <li> My niece has very curly hair, tying this over her short curly pony made it look like she truly had a long pony tail, she could not stop looking at herself in the mirror.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected, but I think for the price it is, is consistent with the quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair but a little thin, however given the price you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> The wig fit fantastic. I wore it for a photo shoot and it stay in place despite all the moving and jumping I put it through. A bit shiny for everyday use, but I am happy.  And you really can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail today really lovely but its a bit thin not bad tho i just wear a beanie or but some bobby pins in it to fix that problem overall its lovely wig for the price.</li>
            <li> Fits great not itchy and looks real. So happy I got it great for days when I am lazy and I do t want to do my hair.</li>
            <li> I love wigs. and I have bout from cool2day before and they have never disappointed me with their wig quality. They are beautifully made and such (once again) HIGH quality! especially for the price! Now there have been some revives like, &amp;#34;to thin!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;color wasn&#x27;t right!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;tangles easily!&amp;#34; but the one I received was fairly thick, the color was exact, and really wigs do tangle. You can&#x27;t expect a wig that will never tangle especially this length. But when I took it out of the package it was very soft and WAS NOT tangle at all! It really is a beautiful wig! ^-^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Do I like it? YES&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? Heck yea!</li>
            <li> The quality was great but the color was wrong. It was more of a mousey brown than what it shows in the picture. I gifted it to someone and they really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  bought my share of wigs for costumes, but have never had one so lifelike. I still can&#x27;t believe this was so inexpensive and arrived so fast. It&#x27;s a full wig- most that you&#x27;ll see are pretty sparse in the back- you&#x27;ll see hair down the sides but if it hangs down the sides of your face, there is nothing in the back but bald patches. Not this one. It looks just like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> For this price I could not have asked for more! It is such a pretty wig with an amazing light brown color. I really like that it has a straight blunt bang. Downsides are that is a little shiny, and the strands are kind of itchy against the skin. Overall I really enjoy taking pictures and playing with it. It even comes with a free bonus wig cap! I wasn&#x27;t expecting that and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected much less. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and life of the wig. Wore it out and nobody realised it was a wig. I was not recognized with it on at all. Many thanks. -Michelle</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail and first of all i took it out and it was tangled BAD! I brushed the hair easily like it said to and guess what the hair started falling out and it is thick hair also it is dark dark brown. When I put the wig on I looked like I was a MURDERER!</li>
            <li> This wig, for the price is a good buy. The hair is really nice quality.  Down fall is it took a long time for it to get to me. 2 months</li>
            <li> I received my wig sooner than expected, which was great.  I love the texture and the length.  However, it is no where near the same color as the picture.  My wig is dark reddish brown and not what I paid for. The color is what attracted me to it in the first place.  I contacted the seller about the issue. They requested pictures to prove it and said they would send a replacement and pay for the reshipping cost.  Then they turned around and said my only option was to keep the wig and receive a partial refund because the wig was out of stock due to the chinese new year. Even when I offered to pay the difference for a new wig when they get more they just kept pushing the partial refund.  I&#x27;m definitely upset about the customer service!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, first off I would like to say the shipping on this product is really interesting. The estimated arrival date was 8/7/13-8/31/13 which was about 4-6 weeks from when I ordered it. I was so shocked that it would take so long to get here. But it arrived within about 2 and 1/2 weeks. So the shipping is fair. When I opened the package to take out the wig, to my surprise it looks just like the picture! Some may say it came darker or really light but I think its based off the lighting you use in your home. I will say this wig sheds a lot and gets easily tangled, so good maintenance/care and wig detangler is a must. Also, the bangs are kinda long so you must trim them if necessary. Other than that the wig is great! I will definetly be ordering another wig from this company again, just in a darker color and maybe express shipping.</li>
            <li> This seller always has great wigs its a natural color and while a little shiny it is easily taken care of. It looks really natural otherwise and is super cute on!</li>
            <li> I have tons of wigs and this is def a super nice wig for the money. love it, im getting another one in blonde.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite wig from my collection. The color is gorgeous, it looks really natural! The wig cap is a little small but I have a small head so its ok. I like to wear it with a headband and part it to the side.</li>
            <li> I like to wear different wigs for fashion. It&#x27;s nice to be able to change my haircut without getting it cut. The wig is very soft and shiny. It also is light and flows beautifully. I recommend this wig for anyone who&#x27;s looking it have fun with wigs and incorporate it into their fashion.</li>
            <li> i love it this wig, was amaizing and is exatly what the seller said, long hair and much hair you can feel like natural</li>
            <li> Omg this wig is. Amazing I love it im finaly a girl. Thank u so much im very happy that this was cheap ans.  Long. And cute</li>
            <li> Although this took forever to come in the mail, it&#x27;s FABULOUS!! It looks just like the picture, maybe a little more red-ish but I love it!!</li>
            <li> Like another wig I bought from this seller this wig surprised me, it is thick and has a slight wave it it, the color is true to what was pictured, I think given the thickness of this wig It could be possible to put into higher ponytails if desired, but I have not tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig looks realistic with a bit of work, its quite shiny in natural light if worn straight from packaging. I&#x27;d advise when you first take it out of the bag shake it out a bit to let the strands separate a bit, and if that does not cut back the shine to a level you are comfortable with, dust it lightly with a translucent powder. This should cut the shine back to a more real level, and make the wig useable for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> So this is a very cute wig. Its wavy, but i does not have dark highlights at the root as the photo shows, its light brownish all the way thru. It does shed if you comb it, but i just got it, but overall for the price its super cute, i can rock it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many wigs in the past, but this one is by far the best (and ironically, cheapest) I have ever gotten. I paid around $6 for this wig, including shipping, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but when it arrived I was stunned by how beautiful the hair is. The part is just a dot at the top, but you can curl or straighten the hair using heat. I used my straightener on its lowest setting while the hair is wet and after adding a leave-in conditioner, and it instantly smooths away any frizz. I&#x27;ve also set it on flexi-rods, and it turned out beautifully. I&#x27;ve had this wig for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve washed it a couple of times using dish soap and fabric softener, and it doesn&#x27;t really shed at all. You can also wear it up or down...overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this wig.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how much I&#x27;d like this wig - I was afraid it would arrive as a &amp;#34;party wig&amp;#34; - some cheap quality reminiscent of a Halloween store. But I was pleasantly surprised! The color is a rich light auburn, and the length comes down almost to my waist (at 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;). I had to trim the bangs of course, but then it looked perfect! My only qualm at all would be the back of the cap is a bit thin - I feel as if the wig cap netting might peek a bit - so I just wear hats and beanies with my wig. :)</li>
            <li> Looks nice in picture, but it gets tangled real easily and is really hard to comb and untangle. Straight wig would be better</li>
            <li> This is my first wig, and as a balding woman, with little extra income, this is a great product! The wig looks beautiful,a lot like the one in the picture, and in fact looks a lot like real hair to me. It has a snug fit which I love, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s cool, Delivery was fast, fits snug, the color is a dull light brown and not the pretty ambre-ish color like pic, the bangs are nice and thick and contours pretty to my face I did have to trim them slightly, because of the length and how messy it gets with movement it has to be brushed too much and it doesn&#x27;t lay style-ish like the pic so I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfy wearing it all down, but I fishtail braided it and put my fave hat on and it&#x27;s my go to wig I can throw on quick and feel sexy and chic</li>
            <li> I ordered light brown &amp; my wig is an auburn color. I read a review that also got the wrong color. This co. needs to send the color wig they show. I am going to keep it because it is a pain to return it.</li>
            <li> Halloween! But not for every day wear.&lt;br /&gt;The color is nice and the cut is exactly like the one in the picture. The only thing that&#x27;s bad about this wig is that the cap is way to small and that is not that dense.</li>
            <li> Arrival was fair! But the wig is a little small and a bid more lighter than the pic but all together its a pretty good lil gidy up and go product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim with two others I really liked. I was pleasantly surprised when she arrived. Soft, silky, full, and just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Needs a wig tangle conditioner.</li>
            <li> the wig is true to color though i know monitors tend to show color in a number of different spectrums (i.e. lighter darker, colder warmer, more reddish or yellow) so it might be different for you. it is a light brown with a coppery undertone. the wig is soft and feels like real hair, it get tangle somewhat easily due to the very pretty light waves it has but it isn&#x27;t to much of an issue or nusences for me, you may be different though. the bangs are very long and i will of to trim them but i have glass so a good length for other is annoying for me because it goes over/ under my glasses. the wig is a rather snug fit so if you have a larger head or alot of hair you may not find it very comfortable it is nice for me because it allows be to brush it with out have to worry about pulling the wig off when i hit a snag. all and all a great deal for a great price</li>
            <li> It tangles very easy and when it&#x27;s being brushed a lot of hair falls out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend although it was good for one time use.</li>
            <li> This product is not fir for everyday  wear. It&#x27;s too silky, and the advertised wig has dark roots. This wig is a lighter color with an orange tint and not full. The only positve aspect of it is that the bang is exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Out of the box and onto my head in under 5 minutes. Flows beautifully. I&#x27;m in love!  Shipping was perfect too! Much better than expected quality. Can&#x27;t believe the price.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, the color is a little darker than the photo. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it out m unless I wore a hat with it.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying wigs (especially at this price, but I risked it and bought a few) and I&#x27;m so glad that I did! It&#x27;s almost impossible for me to keep my hair long with it being so fine and thin. This was really easy to brush through originally out of the package, and some hair fell out (not much at all, but I was expecting some) Fits perfectly and the color is exactly what they state, a light brown. Feels and looks like real hair. Will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig along with three others--out of the three that have arrived so far, I can confidently say this is the best one. Good shape, bangs pre-cut, and only 3 weeks shipping from HK to US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that this wig is nowhere near the aforementioned light shade of brown--it&#x27;s actually quite dark. I&#x27;m not particularly concerned with that though.</li>
            <li> Feels like real hair. Came earlier than stated. The bangs are pretty long, but I like it. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems not as much hair as I thought it would have. Wig cap included as well! :)</li>
            <li> I like the wig alot. I am just disappointed about the color. I thought it would be black on the scalp and get light brown toward the bottom. Its not very high quality but I think it is worth the 8 dollars spent. Can not brush or comb this wig too hard or the hair will shed. The color isn&#x27;t bad, it is a chestnut brown. I am...... (-_-)</li>
            <li> The wig was to small for my head I did not like I gave it to my niece and she&#x27;s 11 and it fitted her head 😕</li>
            <li> Everyone who said the wig was very long must be imp status or something because this wig was so short (just a couple inches past my shoulders) and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;6\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone said they could part their bangs to make sweeping side bangs but mine were pretty blunt cut to begin with (which I don&#x27;t mind at all) and not that long. I&#x27;m wondering if this is a wig that someone else has already styled a bit and returned after realizing that nothing was working for them. Oh well. Not really worth it to return back to sender so I&#x27;ll keep this guy. That being said, the sides of the bangs end very abruptly. Some people can pull off this blunt edge look, but I definitely cannot. It makes my face look really broad as a consequence. I need face-framing pieces on the sides of my bangs or else I&#x27;ll look like a dull idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap is not huge like other people said, but it&#x27;s probably because I have such long hair. The trick to making this wig cap fit is to gather as much hair onto the CROWN of your head as possible to create a round skull shape. I tried my usual method of placing my hair evenly around my head, but that left empty spaces along the cap. You really need to make your skull as round as possible in order for the wig to fill out nicely. The rounder the head shape, the better the wig will fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are not curls. They are more like waves than anything. Boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is not the light brown as shown in the photo. It&#x27;s somewhat like a silvery-bronze brown. Ashy in some places, brassy in others. I found it very odd. Definitely not the warm brown that is photographed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive: the wig is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;The irony: it tangles like there is no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks to come in but that is expected since it shipped from China. It is made exactly like the pictures shown! It looks so real too! I was a little concerned about it looking cheap because of some negative reviews I read and because it was only $10 but  it looks and feels absolutely real! I plan to get more wigs from this place!</li>
            <li> I had to trim the bangs alot but this one works and is good quality. Prefer to wear with a hat ! Braided to the side(s) is good too I bought a second one and the color was totally different from the first not sure why but now I have to pay for t he return to CHINA, not real impressed with this company</li>
            <li> This wig is not as pictured. But so much better. Amazing curls. I styled this wig and its beautiful. I am a cosmotologist and this wig is a challenge but if you know what you&#x27;re going then its great. The bangs come long but you can cut them or put them to the side. It&#x27;s soft, silky, just amazing. MUST BUY! Who ever left bad reviews are clearly not creative. Will be buying again!! Highly satisfied!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this wig.. so soft and light... looks and feels very real... quality is excellent... can wear with just about anything.. def a everyday look</li>
            <li> Nice thing. For its price quality is very good. I had much more expensive wigs with much worse quality. Color is pleasant. In fact it is very believable color of hair. It looks like real hair. Good product and price is very good.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig and a couple others because I have very short hair right now because I needed to start over with my hair and I haven&#x27;t gotten around to extensions or anything yet. This wig is super cute. The bangs for me were a little too severe but you can play with them easily enough. I like the length of this wig and everything. It looks very natural when it&#x27;s on EXCEPT in certain lighting, then it&#x27;s just a smidge too shiny.</li>
            <li> Well you get what you pay for I like the style of the sig but it gets tangled way too fast I recommend this for Halloween costumes not for everyday wear type.&lt;br /&gt;Came rather late and slow but other than that it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> The quality of this wig is suited for a child to use as dress up.  My granddaughter will enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li> did not like the color at all ... item very small could not really pull it over my head as needed. And as an FYI I do not have a huge had either!. If the color would have been more true to the pic (or darker option) and it would fit better it would actually look cute pinned up... down it looked sure as hell like a wig.</li>
            <li> The wig I got is a medium brown to dark brown color. It isn&#x27;t as thick as I would like, which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if the wig is big enough to hide all my hair. I have shoulder length, thick hair that I struggle to hide under the wig. There&#x27;s always about an inch of hair showing in the back. Does anyone else have this problem or is my head just bigger than average? To hide my natural hair I would have to brush all the hair on the wig to the back, but I want some hair in the front to frame my face, which I can&#x27;t do if I&#x27;m trying to cover my natural hair at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m just wearing the wig to take pictures from the front then it is fine, but if I wear it out, it will be obvious that it is not my natural hair. This means the hair looks natural enough, but I can&#x27;t seem to part the hair in a flattering and natural way.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the wig I got is curly, but the picture shows a wig with wavy hair. The curls aren&#x27;t terrible, but I wanted the wavy look for something more natural.</li>
            <li> Is was cheaply made, and it does not fit if you are going to sell some thing please do a better job.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for! great for the price, but the wig cut doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture. still good for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig is wonderful and can serve my purpose perfectly. For under $7 inculding shipping, I found out this wig is perfect. I love the light brown color and the wig style. My only complain that it&#x27;s a bit shiny and some hair can easily fall, but it still look good for synthetic hair to match human hair. But still, this wig is quite a steal :)</li>
            <li> Looks just like the pic , has a bit of a smell . Haven&#x27;t used it yet but maybe later when I find use for it. Would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> PERFECT! This came BEFORE time! I was nervous &amp; emailed the company &amp; they responded promptly to my emails. Came as color shown in picture. It is a light brown with a red-ish tint, that&#x27;s the best way to describe it. In the light it is a really pretty copper color. A bit shiny but not bad at all! Mine was perfect, no tangles and only 2-3 loose hairs that came out when running my fingers through. Came WITH a free wig cap and a net over the wig to keep in tidy. Has two hooks inside but i have no idea how to hook them to tighten! BUT youtube has a video for everything so after i write this i will head on over and learn how to adjust it. Sounds like a mixed bag when getting these but i am VERY SATISFIED with my order. Not much curl to it but i will rag roll it carefully &amp; know it will look great! I think i will trim the bangs but they did look cute when i pinned them back. Now i have something to put on when my hubby wants me to ride to town with him and i feel a bit lazy! GREAT! I WILL BUY MOORE from this seller! Thank you!</li>
            <li> its a very good product, the size is a litlle small than expected, however can adapt well, and the color is very natural...</li>
            <li> The wig is a very good material/ quality for the price. however when mine arrived it was straight in some parts and slightly curled in random areas.i purchased it for some of my celebrity tutorials on youtube. i would def rec if your looking for something inexpensive that looks decent on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;youtube.com/xprincessjessex</li>
            <li> Weeeeeell. The wig itself is cute. I like the color and the length. The only thing is the bangs are so thin? Idk something about the bangs doesn&#x27;t appeal to me ._. And I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I have a big head or something but it takes me a while to like force it on my head lol</li>
            <li> Ok first off the shipping took a while - which was expected.(5weeks) The color is not as shown in the pictures but it&#x27;s close! The hair tangles way to fast , you&#x27;ll be very lucky if you get a full days wear.I was iffy about this but the reviews seem great. I Have to say this is an awful item.It&#x27;s good for a costume party or something of that sort but not for a sophisticated event(work,dinner etc) Save your self the worries and just go to your local beauty supply store.It&#x27;s a little more pricy but at least you&#x27;ll see what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> It looks a little more shinier and more auburn than in the photo, but other than that, pretty real looking : )&lt;br /&gt;However, the netting is very weak and I&#x27;ve been having trouble trying to make it stay on my head.</li>
            <li> Just not what i expected. I could not return it either so i am stuck with a wig for halloween ... i guess.</li>
            <li> Its feels so soft, and nice. BUT, my complain is the bangs it feels like someone got a bowl and cut them up to the ears. Also it gets tangled and messy after a while and lost those beautiful curls. :( but I liked it so much!</li>
            <li> This wig was alright, but great for the price! I got tons of compliments on it and no one knew it was a wig! My only problem is it tangles very easily and a lot of hair came out when I first took it out of the package, overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> nothing like the picture way to light Almost sand blonde&lt;br /&gt;very fake looking plastic like doll hair&lt;br /&gt;with to much shine</li>
            <li> Not happy with this hair at all very stringy tangles way to easily..very shiny and fake looking I tried the baby powerder trick with no luck I trimmed the fringe still not realistic at all...I guess I will save it for Halloween</li>
            <li> Great quality but light brown is more like dark brown. Nothing like pictured. More close to pic of wig in the box not on the model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect quality! The bad thing about it is that it frizzed up on the second day, and I took well care of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig and wow its amazing! super super soft. doesnt tangle at all compared to a different wig i bought. you dont even have to wear a hat or anything with it. super pretty</li>
            <li> I just got their wig, but the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t worn it yet. I hope it doesn&#x27;t tangle as bad as the other wig I have, (not from the same company) mine came true to the color I expected and it&#x27;s very soft and has a nice sheen, just hope it wears well :-)</li>
            <li> most likely my favorite wig I own</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re dressing up for Halloween. I took pictures in it. It&#x27;s too silky and gets tangled quickly. It&#x27;s worth the price I guess ...</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;wonderful light brown color with reddish undertones&lt;br /&gt;non-itchy, good quality&lt;br /&gt;came with wig cap!&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;tangles easily&lt;br /&gt;thats the only con! this wig is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this wig. It looks nothing like the picture. It isn&#x27;t even a pretty cosplay wig. The hair lines awful, the shipping takes forever, and its way too shiny to pass for real. The cheap price is too good to be true. Please avoid getting this wig. The wigs sold by X&amp;Y Angel are a hundred times better.</li>
            <li> This wig looks like real hair and is very silky with a natural wave! This wig was worth the money!</li>
            <li> This wig is awesome. Looks just like the picture, it&#x27;s beautiful, it&#x27;s curly, it stays together. I highly recommend this to all wig collectors.</li>
            <li> I have worn this wig several times and I love it. I put a hat on it or style it with a headband and it looks super cute!</li>
            <li> I always had long thick hair but recently cut it short and regret it. This wig has been a great substitute! I am now addicted to wigs!</li>
            <li> Fantastic wig. Love the cut and color. Will be perfect for future makeup looks. Don&#x27;t know why people complain about the cut. Bangs were a little long, but nothing a pair of scissors won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> The wig cap attached to this wig is so small. I cannot get the entire wig to fit on my head! Also the band attached to the wig keeps snapping when I try to put it at the end of my neck. So annoying. Is there anyway to fix this??? I cannot wear this wig because it&#x27;s so small. Also it&#x27;s shedding like crazy!</li>
            <li> The reason in which I give this four stars is just due to the fact that it wasn&#x27;t as long as it looked in the photos. As someone who has chemotherapy that tends to make my hair fall out, this was a decent and cheap buy (instead of me paying 5 to 600 dollars in-store). It was easy to clip my hair extensions that I dyed into the piece and my doctors say that it was very beautiful and realistic. In all, I highly recommend it~!</li>
            <li> The wife has long black hair to her butt... she&#x27;s Filipina and it&#x27;s NOT going to be cut.  She was talking about lightening her hair, and since I like it black, I quickly ordered this cheap wig.... but WOW it looks REAL and it looks SEXY!  Now I can have it both ways.</li>
            <li> it took a while longer to get here than the estimated date but it is one of my most worn wigs and one of my favorites. ive had it for a few months and i still looks wonderful!its a bit more reddish than pictured but i actually love that about it.</li>
            <li> Love the wig. Right length right color Just a great wig to wear and have. I would buy another one</li>
            <li> Really fake looking and the ends were pokey and kept stabbing my face.</li>
            <li> The wig s pretty, look a little fake but good with the price&lt;br /&gt;However it s quite sorter than i expected in the picture</li>
            <li> was pretty much what I thought I was ordering and arrived in a timely fashion..i was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig October 28th, December rolled around and I STILL hadn&#x27;t received the wig. I had to contact the seller and explain the situation to them. They actually took time to handle the issue and shipped me new wigs the same day! I received them about a week later! I absolutely love the color and length of the wig, it isn&#x27;t too awful shiny and is a breeze to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Amazing customer service with this seller.&lt;br /&gt;2. Great quality for such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;3. Nice wig cap comes with the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. TOOK FOREVER TO GET HERE. (But, c&#x27;mon- it is shipping from Hong Kong via snail-mail)&lt;br /&gt;2. - Uh, well, that&#x27;s all I can dis about this company and wig.</li>
            <li> this took forever to get here first of all. i put this on and its too darn big. everyone who is complaining about it being too small must have really big heads. and it looks like a wig. not even cute enough for a costume. thank God i didnt spent too much to be upstet.</li>
            <li> This wig is definitely not a light brown nor even a medium brown, it is closer to a dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;Either the manufacturer is color blind or the seller mistakenly packaged the wrong wig into the bag. I am not sure. The bag however does say on it Light brown, which leads me to think the manufacturer is at fault.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a light brown wig, I would suggest searching for a different one. If you really dont care if it is dark or light and just want brown, this is a nice wig, especially for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Great wig! I never thought that the hair fibers would be so great and very realistic. The wig hair is very soft and bouncy like real hair. Im very happy with this wig.</li>
            <li> This wig arrived exactly on it&#x27;s due date, which was super exciting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels just like real hair, very soft, is the right colour, and doesn&#x27;t have too much shine. The only downside is that mine is very thin, and you can just barely see the netting through the top! The size is also very small, so be prepared for that!&lt;br /&gt;Besides for its thinness, it looks gorgeous! Adding a few extensions and no one should notice it&#x27;s a wig at all.</li>
            <li> It tangles very easy, colors great I like the length, it seems to loose a lot of hair. It could use clips to help it stay in place.  All in all it&#x27;s just an ok wig.</li>
            <li> This wig is horrible. Wish I could just return. Never wore it out. Too thin- tracks show. Thin and very (TOO) smooth and has shiny hairs, doesn&#x27;t hold a tight enough grip on my head. Needs tons of Bobby pins for the loose and awkward hairstrands. Definitely regret this one.</li>
            <li> At first i didn&#x27;t like this wig, but after putting on makeup, and wearing nice clothing. It looked AWESOME!! i took some pro pics with it as well. After a while the wig gets a little luscious, and it totally looks like that &amp;#34;woke up from my sleep, but i still look awesome&amp;#34; kind. ahh ha.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig and from all the good and bad reveiws I am kind of wondering what it is going to look like. Some people say the bangs are too short some say they are too long I hope mine will look just like the picture. It may be just amazon messing up the orders.</li>
            <li> When I saw this wig online and really learned all the information about it, I was expecting something long, and sleek. The wig that i got was mid length and it has some what of some layers. It was all over the place and it was not elegant at all. The Bangs were also were shorter than expected. I think that possibly it was not fit for my head size, so it ended up looking a lot more shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> when I received this product it was as beautiful as it looks&lt;br /&gt; in the picture. the hair did began to get nappy, but I&lt;br /&gt; was able to flat iron it and that help. The only problem was the cap&lt;br /&gt;size, but wrap up the hair or braiding it took care of that.&lt;br /&gt;so over-all it is a great product</li>
            <li> i dont have the wig yet, the convention is on friday and i need my wig i really need it</li>
            <li> I bought this and I agree with the other writers--it doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture and you can&#x27;t even find where the damn front is except for the way the cap is made.  I have hand problems so I can&#x27;t fix it and I can&#x27;t lug this thing into a hairdressers to have her cut in the bangs that should have been there in the first place.  There is no delineation in this wig whatsoever--you just look like a shaggy dog.  And it sheds HORRIBLY--I had to take a shower after I combed it just ONCE. The hair is falling out like it&#x27;s diseased.  I bought a lot of wigs at the same time but there was nothing in the package to tell me how to return it, or I would have.  In addition, I would never have knowingly purchased a wig made in CHINA.  I hope the company contacts me--my email again is lynnberk49@yahoo.com.  You need to provide information about how to contact the seller and you should tell in advance if something is made in China.  I am not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I like it but it gets really tangled easy. Also not as curly as the model.</li>
            <li> The color is off from the picture and the bangs are totally different. Its still a nice wig, looks good and is in the same quality of what I was looking for but, still, very different.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed with the color, but after getting several comments from friends, everyone loved it. I am used to more vibrant colors so it was a big change to the normal for me. Everything was good with the wig except for how it hangs. It has a lot of lumps it seems, it doesn&#x27;t sit right on my head. Maybe it is because I have a smaller head, and my previous wigs were made custom. I can&#x27;t be real sure of the reason. I thought maybe the lumpiness was from shipping so I let it hang on the wig stand for a while, but still no luck. One other issue is the hair is starting to fall out after the first brushing, and yes I used a wig comb. My other hasn&#x27;t given me this much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, this wig is worth the price I paid. It is better than those halloween costume wigs and the issues are minor. But bottom line - it doesn&#x27;t fool anyone like my others.</li>
            <li> We occasionally attend theme parties with friends and this wig is a good addition for my wife.  She is pleased with the fit/feel of this wig and recommends it.  It also doubles well for myself when we attend 80s throwback parties as it gives that 80s rockstar look to myself; with the right clothes too of course.</li>
            <li> I got my wig about 7-8 days before the estimated shipping date. I thought the underside would be brown and top blond, i can see where people get this misconception. A little but thin, but can&#x27;t be seen through. Feel like its not quite as long, but cute enough. Left a good impression for any purchases i make in the future. WARNING - DO NOT WASH THIS WIG. I made that mistake, and it lost almost all its shape; By that i mean some hairs want to curl, some want to be straight, and some try to be wavy. It was a mistake on my part, please dont do the same! other than that its beautiful.</li>
            <li> Feels amazzing and great color. Love the fiber it is made out of. Had to cut the bangs to fit. I love the waves. I would def order this again.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> did not look like the picture. wrong color and the bangs were too short. the wig is about two shades darker and had an ashy color.</li>
            <li> I love this wig so much.&lt;br /&gt; it got 4 stars instead of 5 because its not the same color as the picture. The hair i more of a dark brown(color #2) and had little highlights that are a light is brown( color #4).&lt;br /&gt;also the bangs are cut a little bit crooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love this wig thou!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no it not the exact color of the picture but it has the same style and flow as the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i ordered this wig on christmas  and it came in today (Jan 21).&lt;br /&gt;im patient so i didnt mind the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is thin but its a natural thin.&lt;br /&gt;it honetly looks like how Asians hair is, thin but beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;the wig looks natural on.&lt;br /&gt;it fits me perfectly, but my friend tried it on and it didnt fit her, but she had to bun up her hair versus me i dont have much hair because alot of it came out so i shaved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i guess if you have more than above shoulder length hair this may not fit you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the length of the wig is a pictured.&lt;br /&gt;the hair i soft, natural looking, and you cant see the tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i overall love the wig and again the only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars is the color even thou i love the color i know some may want that exact color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will be buying more wig from them.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite wig I have ver owned. Its so realistic and hardly ever sheds. It stays curly and bouncy and it came perfectly wrapped so it wasn&#x27;t tangled.</li>
            <li> EDIT: Wore this on a night out, and it looked incredibly natural! All of my friends had to do a double take and ask me if my hair was longer than they thought. So many double takes because of the length! The only down side was how tight it was. I kept having to run to the bathroom to check it and make sure it wasn&#x27;t pulling up, thank goodness for the bangs. But, wow, was my head sore at the end of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, even if I only get 2 wears out of this, what a great price for this wig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its price, this wig is great- it looks fairly realistic on me, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind wearing it out. I just received it, and the bangs are long, so you will have to cut them if you want them to look like the model pictured, but otherwise they&#x27;re just side-swept bangs.&lt;br /&gt;The color looks darker than pictured, I&#x27;d probably put it around a level 8. The curls look natural, but boy is this wig TIGHT! I have my thin, shoulder-length hair in a wig cap, and it will not fit on my head if I put it in a pony tail first, and even then I&#x27;m still a little worried it will pop off of my head eventually. Right before I put it on, a small glued in chunk of hair fell out, too.&lt;br /&gt;But still, this is miles better than those junky Halloween wigs that you pay $10-20 for and look obviously fake. This looks pretty real!</li>
            <li> Beautiful! It&#x27;s easy to brush, realistic low lights, nice bounce, easy to detangle, nice fit, and arrived within a timely fashion. All around great product!</li>
            <li> Not as red as in the pics, It is a nice brunet color. soft and shiny like freshly styled hair. amazing price and quality, super saver shipping took ten days.</li>
            <li> got this wig for a alice in wonderland costume, but my mom put the wig on and went out the door in it, I would wear this wig on a bad hair day, I didn&#x27;t notice excessive shedding, like  your hair, gotta work with it, its soft, shinny enough,about the same length in the picture. made my mom feel sexy, she said and shes 65.  cool2day,should be cool with me.  if you dont like this wig for ad price and the look,  I ask again r u crazy?</li>
            <li> The hair is nice. It&#x27;s the wrong color the item was canel. Waiting on shipping label. Thanks</li>
            <li> Arrived early.  Packaged very nicely. Love love love my new wig. I wear it everywhere but the gym (lol).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig!&lt;br /&gt; I was looking for something to wear to prevent me from cutting y natural hair as I&#x27;m growing it out. Since it&#x27;s at an awkward stage, I needed something to distract me.&lt;br /&gt; When I received this wig, I was very pleased! This wig is very tangle-resistant compared to any of my other wigs! The colors very natural looking too! The only default I see, ( Which comes with any synthetic wig) was it&#x27;s extremely shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Great, satisfying wig, glad I bought for such price :)</li>
            <li> I will cut the length but very nice wig.</li>
            <li> The hair is awesome, just wished it was thicker as it&#x27;s too thin and get messed up making it too hard or impossible to brush</li>
            <li> Not at all like the picture. .don&#x27;t buy..only for dress up and cosplay..very very very very fake. Couldn&#x27;t even put it on without tangling</li>
            <li> The wig is okay, though very small fitting I find. My hair is not comfortably covered completely any way I&#x27;ve tried so I probably am not going to wear it out, fun for pictures only I guess. It not only is too snug to cover my actual head but the wig doesn&#x27;t cover the cap in the back right either so bunches of cap are exposed.&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, the wig&#x27;s color is listed as light brown - its definitely red/orange-y brown, more red than brown even. So keep that in mind!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is a horrible wig but between the size and color, I&#x27;m disappointed. But what can I complain - I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I simply love my wig. I wear it all the time. I currently own 3 wigs, this one is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the photo. It looks like a wig on. They cut off the top where it looks fake. Save money and get a better wig</li>
            <li> It does come pretty close the way it is shown in the photo and it does look  good and will buy another one later</li>
            <li> this wig came in early, its supper soft, it can get tangly if you live in a very windy place but it was perfect for me and it looks supper cute &amp;#60;3 very little shedding</li>
            <li> Very realistic for a synthetic wig</li>
            <li> Surprising quality for the price, tangles easily, but most synthetic wigs do. Fits comfortably, and lined in a way where with short hair, a wig cap is not totally necessary.</li>
            <li> I didnt like the color nor length i was disappointed . it was a hazel brown not light brown.all wrong</li>
            <li> great hair. looks natural if you play with the style. easy to wash, tangles slightly.  I am still using this wig for events and its been almost a year.</li>
            <li> This is one very beautiful wig. It came in excellent condition too. It&#x27;s long, silky and feels so realistic. Perfect.</li>
            <li> this wig is better than i expected. it looks real, and it feels real. i have nothing to complain about it! its perfect, i was expecting something super shiny like i see in halloween stores but no! i am in loooove! the bangs werent likethe picture but i cute them that way so its okay,  yes my name on here is eduardo but dont let that confuse you i use my bfs account to buy things, im seriously in love with this wig, will purchase more!</li>
            <li> Overall quite pleased with this wig!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft, the colour is as described and very natural looking. The bangs were even as described, which I did not expect from other reviews. A bit shiny in the sun or with camera flash, but it&#x27;s expected with most wigs of this price range and quite fixable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints are these-&lt;br /&gt;-It tangles. It tangles sooo easily, and if you don&#x27;t have much experience with detangling wigs without shedding you might find yourself SOL.&lt;br /&gt;-The wig size is RATHER small, even at it&#x27;s largest unclasped size. I have a slightly large head, with medium/short hair but I generally fit wigs with a bit of tightness. This???? I had to actually ALTER.&lt;br /&gt;-This part was kind of strange.. It caught on the material of the dress I was wearing with it when I tried it on. Kind of staticy, really. I plan on experimenting with StaticGuard, just to see if it will change anything, but I&#x27;ve never had it happen to me before with any of my other wigs.&lt;br /&gt;-For some reason, it&#x27;s a bit thinner than another wig of similar length and price than I purchased from this seller. Not terribly so, but it is worth noting here.&lt;br /&gt;-Aside from the wig cap being too small, it&#x27;s weirdly shaped and a bit lumpy even when not on. Very easy to fix using bobby pins, but still very unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m actually quite pleased with this wig. Despite my rating, I acknowledge that it&#x27;s actually not terrible for it&#x27;s price range.&lt;br /&gt;Just keep these things in mind when buying.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i wanted. It is worth it, if your looking for good quality wig for a lower price!</li>
            <li> l wanted the wig in the picture the length and the curl was wrong and the color was off l wanted that one but the one l got is ok l wouldn&#x27;t trade it back but l wanted the one in the pic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice wig, doesn&#x27;t shed much, and it&#x27;s soft. I had to trim the bangs and the bottom because it was a little too long for me. The cap is adjustable and the hair looks real. People who know me, know it&#x27;s a wig. I do wear it out in public and i haven&#x27;t had anyone ask or point out if I&#x27;m wearing a wig. I pulled it back into a tight half up, half down and the cap doesn&#x27;t show. For the price and quality, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> arrived early and looks exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> I love this wig!! I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on each of my other wigs but this ine is by far my favorite. Its lightweight and tangles less and looks amazing on me! I&#x27;m ordering another today!!</li>
            <li> It came in a neat package and was curled and free of knots upon arrival. The color is lighter than the picture lets on. It is a little shiny, but genuinely passes off as real hair if properly taken care of.</li>
            <li> the wig is beautiful! And I really love the fact that it&#x27;s heat-resistant xD I can style it every way. the bang is kinda long, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great service! I didnt get my wig on the date posted on amazon, but when I informed the seller, they handled it very well. They sent me another one, and I got it after 3 weeks. The delay was probably due to the Haiyan hurricane. They could have sent the second one with expedited shipping, though. Anyway, great wig and service. will buy again:)</li>
            <li> Slightly darker color, but I assume it is the camera light, because the color of the wig is great! It is beautiful and long and brown, and cut very pretty.</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty true to color - a little bit darker than the picture, but not by much. When it&#x27;s new out of the package and/or brushed, it looks pretty much like real hair - I didn&#x27;t have a problem with seeing too much shine or anything like that. It looked more real after I brushed it through with my regular brush - maybe the remnants of styling products/head oils killed any unnatural shine? I LOVE the volume at the crown. Maybe I just watch too much anime or maybe it&#x27;s hair envy because my own hair is very fine and pretty flat at the crown - but I LOVE impossibly bouncy, full hair like this.The long section of the wig hair isn&#x27;t even really equivalent to a thick, full head of natural hair - it&#x27;s the heavy fringe and the crown volume that makes this look like a TON of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem I do have with it is that unlike real hair, it tangles REALLY easily and is tough to brush out. I wore it this past weekend (May 25th) to a Renaissance Faire and while it looked great, within two hours I could feel it starting to feel like giant dreadlocks in its three sections (I had it parted in thirds, 1/3 down my back and the other two over my shoulders in front). It still looked good, but less like natural hair at that point. It also started to look fried at the ends - another casualty of the ease with which the hair tangles and starts to look frazzled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about half an hour to brush out after a day&#x27;s wear in fair weather outdoors, though I was really impressed with how well the hair stayed in the wig and how little of it ended up on my brush, considering I was basically picking apart almost-matted hair at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it braided now and in hanging storage, and I hope the braid helps. I think I might just wear it in the braid next time I wear it anyway - it looks cute, and it would move less (i.e. tangle less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for what I paid, this wig is great.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE it!!! It&#x27;s a really great material, it is the right size, the right color, and the right length! Thank You!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a wig like this! It is so soft and looks very natural, especially for the price.  I got a million compliments when I wore it for my Halloween costume last year.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderfully made wig! Its so soft and so realistic! Ill post picture so you all know how perfect this wig is !!!!&lt;br /&gt;for the price you get more than you pay for a lot more. This seems like a 100 doller wig ONLY DOWN FALL ITS THIN.</li>
            <li> It came REALLY Early!! :O Like...Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I gotta say is, its a little thin and shiny. But WOW. ITS AWSOME</li>
            <li> I love it ...thnksss ;**</li>
            <li> I think this is wonderful value but more of a plaything! Thank you.</li>
            <li> This wig is wonderful and looks great. An affordable price and a wig that is beautiful. I can&#x27;t believe how nice it is.</li>
            <li> The Wig I ordered was nothing like the picture. It was a dark brown and nothing but curls. Don&#x27;t get me wrong... the wig I got was very pretty and it was good quality. But it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> THIS WIG IS WAY SHORTER THAN THE PICTURE ONLY FALLS TO MY SHOULDERS ..NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED VERY DISSAPOINTED AS FAR AS THE LENGHT IS CONCERNED. :(</li>
            <li> Made for a childs head, the color was much darker in real life and the inner netting is costume grade. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> i love the color and the length. a little stringy and thin but no net shows through and looks very real. this is the first wig i have ever bought and was nervous it wouldnt turn out right but was very pleasantly surprised. the only thing keeping me from a 5 star rate was the bangs. they were very short and uneven i was hoping it would be able to be cut and styled but i was unable to do anything but straighten them out.</li>
            <li> nothing like this color and fake looking.  The hair is like a doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Great wig, looks best on small/medium heads</li>
            <li> Ugly wig. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice wig. It looks real it feels real and it&#x27;s not too shiny. I didn&#x27;t even have to cut it. This is the first wig I have ever boughten and I&#x27;m happy with it. Only thing is I didn&#x27;t get a wig cap with it and it is kinda small on my head. The timing was alright. And overall it was okay.</li>
            <li> the wig is not realistic. however, i just wear it to show to people who comes to the house just for fun.  Had some good laughs.  for serious use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Was little too small for my head plus my hair.</li>
            <li> Because of the price I was surprised when I received the wig and it was super soft! It&#x27;s long and curly and I love it. I had a hard time putting on the wig because I didn&#x27;t (and still don&#x27;t, really) know how to put it on but it&#x27;s still really cute. The bangs are long so if I get it on right, I&#x27;ll have to trim them a bit. I&#x27;ve had the wig hanging on a piece of plywood but the curls are still there. :]</li>
            <li> Way way too fake looking wig! Bought it and never wore it since I would be humiliated wearing them outside. Plus, omg it sheds way too much that it scares me!</li>
            <li> The wig itself looked perfect. It looked exactly like the picture, maybe a tiny bit darker, and the length was very accurate as well. I spent about an hour trying it on, cutting the bangs to be straight across instead of side swept like I saw in pictures that I really liked. I did have a few problems with it, however. I didn&#x27;t like how flat the hair was on my head, but the hair was really thick on the bottom, if that makes since. I expected it to be very thick throughout the whole wig, not just on the bottom. It also sheds like crazy. I brushed it out a couple of times because it gets tangled very easily, and now there is hair all over my bathroom floor. I&#x27;ve never owned a wig before, but I&#x27;m sure that most are pretty itchy, and that is very true for this one. I don&#x27;t think that I will be wearing this wig myself because of the thickness issue and the few others that I had, but I definitely do recommend this for a person who wouldn&#x27;t really mind that.</li>
            <li> Fits fine not great, vertical ear-to-ear ripples. The price makes it cheap enough to cut and play with it. Would wear it if i fixed it nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig in light brown but mine arrived a dark brown with auburn highlights.  It is still pretty and for the price, I will not complain.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest paying more than $10 for it though.  Also it is kind of tight if you have a bigger head (like mine, 22\\&quot; for example).  The hair at the back of the wig has some nice loose waves.</li>
            <li> The wig is great quality for the price and fits great. The only thing would be that the hair gets tangled kind of easily but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> while its no high quality wig, its not bad like some of the others are. Shes worn it a few times and likes the look a lot. I think as a result, shes going to let the real hair grow out now.  [Yay ! ]</li>
            <li> It looks pretty much identical to the picture (minus the fact that there is a little bit of excess length in the bangs, which could easily be swept to the side or trimmed to look like the picture). The color is also practically identical, maybe a bit darker. It does have a bit of unrealistic shine to it, but for a $12 synthetic wig, that&#x27;s sort of expected. Also the hair itself is super soft and easy to comb through. Once you get past the initial shedding the first time you brush through, the brush combs through with a lot of ease. Overall, I think it&#x27;s well worth the price and if you really try and play around with it, it could totally pass in public.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great texture and it&#x27;s well made for the price. The only problem is that it is too shiny to look natural. It&#x27;s still definitely cute!</li>
            <li> Looks just like it does in the picture! It is a little thin in the back but that&#x27;s to be expected for a cheap wig. Besides a little thinness, it&#x27;s a perfect wig for your money that&#x27;s super cute and looks real!</li>
            <li> For the price, this was amazingly realistic! Feels soft, quality good, combed easy and no loose hairs came out. I like it! Downfall was it took a long time to be delivered...</li>
            <li> Wig arrived 6 days earlier than expected. In a plastic bag. When i opened the package the contents were a bit slimy. Luckily.the wig was inside another bag and only the hair net got what ever the slime was. I was able to wash net and use the wig fine. Became tangled fairly easy which is my fault for putting it on the baby xp. Its fine though i should&#x27;ve got a color that went to me. For the price I&#x27;m not complaining. Its my first wig. not as long as I thought but it still works. Thought it would have more volume or hair to clip back a bit for work. Hopefully i can figure something out. And mange to detangle it...</li>
            <li> I was so surprise when I got the wig, the color was beautiful, the fit perfect and the look almost natural. Everyone thought I had a real human hair wig. EXTREMLY HAPPY</li>
            <li> Very nice wig looks great on my blow up toy makes her look so real I just love the way it feels</li>
            <li> Looks very fake and the hair is thin.</li>
            <li> Great wig, very soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> This wig looks great, for $10 it&#x27;s pretty good. Obviously for ten dollars the part will be a little weird, the hair will be a little shiney, and it&#x27;s going to tangle a little bit. My advice, you&#x27;ll be fine as long and there is no wind lol I wore this couple times and people thought I changed my hair color. I bought some dry shampoo to take care of the shine, and it was fine. Be gentle with this wig though, I had a knot in it and I pulled it too hard and the fibers frizzed :/ but overall, for this price it think it&#x27;s a fair deal.</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality was better than expected.</li>
            <li> it gets tangled quickly</li>
            <li> good for the price. nice quality of a wig. but has too little hair. delivery quicker than expected. overall great for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved this wig . I love me a synthetic wig.u get what u pay for in general. The cap constructon is like a weave net almost like a holloween wig. It is more  professional looking. It has adjustable straps. The color light brown i got is comparable to a p4/27. I would say the hair is a a low quality synthetic it does somewhat tangle i try not to flip the hair or touch it too much. Over all this is a great costume wig nothing for everyday use. Maybe use it in like a highschool theatre production. The bangs were a good fit on me!!! So basically a holloween quality wig but much more proffesionally constructed.if ur a drag queen order like 3.</li>
            <li> Just perfect!  the color is a little lighter, but it looks great...Awesome fit and the hair is nice and manageable to brush...  Will be buying it again....</li>
            <li> Tracks coming out had to sew them back in</li>
            <li> It looks very fake! Very unhappy!</li>
            <li> This wig is great, the wavy long wig is flattering on anyone, and it is super cute.  would buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome quick shipping, it came about 2 days early, which was awesome! Beautiful wig, great quality, everything came just as it said, and nothing was damaged! I can&#x27;t wait to use it at Anime and Comic conventions for cosplaying (: Thank you so much!&lt;br /&gt;:) Loved it!</li>
            <li> A little darker in color than I was hoping for but otherwise it&#x27;s a nice soft natural looking wig</li>
            <li> I just received my wig today. This is the first wig I have ever bought. I initially started to find interest in getting a wig because I have long hair but sometimes I just need something different. And getting sew-in and extensions is annoying and I never keep them in longer than a week. So that&#x27;s what brought me here.&lt;br /&gt;And I must say IM IN LOVEEEEEEEEE WITH THIS WIG!&lt;br /&gt;It fit perfectly, and framed my face quit flatteringly. The hair quality is excellent for its price. You really can&#x27;t get a nicer, quick hairstyle for any cheaper than this.&lt;br /&gt;It does shed a bit, but honestly that&#x27;s because I kept running my fingers through it like it was my real hair. It you don&#x27;t tamper with it like I do, it won&#x27;t shed at all.&lt;br /&gt;Took about a month to get here. But that&#x27;s to be expected coming from so far and for so cheap. So if you are buying this for a specific occasion, order at least a month before your event.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
            <li> I trimmed the bangs.Nice for a costume.But you can def tell its fake live.May look real in pictures or on video.</li>
            <li> The color and length were great. The loss of hair when brushing, not so great. The hair tangles too easily and when you attempt to brush it out you end up with more hair in the brush than in the wig. This item would be good for a one time use only...</li>
            <li> the bangs looked so cute just wish their was more volume on the wig and bangs expecially to make it look more realistic , but other than that i loved it !</li>
            <li> Love it. Clean , great waves, good color and shine. Good structure to the cut and wave and will wear well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig.&lt;br /&gt;Just right for character cosplays, and pretty realistic for what you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;A little shiny to look REAL, but awesome for the price. I&#x27;ve even used it in a photoshoot and people have loved the pictures.</li>
            <li> My daughter will do some practice styling with this.</li>
            <li> Nice but not for an African American person</li>
            <li> very nice wig! Hair doesn&#x27;t look fake and falls into place well</li>
            <li> The wig arrived later than I wished but it was expected as the shipping details had told me and i&#x27;m very impatient so what do you expect. It looks real, is super soft, and once you brush it out a bit the shedding is kept at a minimal. For those of you who are having trouble with it getting tangled, braid it when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.  Too bad though, I have 10 other wigs and they are lasting me up to and over 2 years.  This one, did not tangle TOO easily at first, but after the 4th use, it was getting to the point of bad tangling, UNABLE to be tamed with brushing, all that did was, tie knots (and I know how to brush wigs).  If you want something to last longer, this is not the wig for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson with buying wigs with bangs because they never turn out right but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I have decided to take the plunge into being a wig head. I had ordered this wig and two others and out of the three this one was not only the least expensive, but lacking in the quality of the other two. it did have a few good points...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: the color on this is lovely. I like the style. the bangs and cut are great. the price! if you want to just get a feel for a wig try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the wig is tiny tiny tiny and construction is poor. NO combs to hold in place. a very thin wig. and &amp;#34;wiggy&amp;#34; but a hat makes it perfect so I can&#x27;t wait for fall and winter to sport cute hats.</li>
            <li> I like the wig, but the color they send me is kind of like a blondish in between ginger color, which looks kid of odd on me because of my tan skin. Even so, most people like how it looks on me.</li>
            <li> Have had this wig for about a week now and have worn it over three times and must say I absolutely love it!  I have felt nothing but sexy when out with this wig on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Only negative things I can think of was that it took a little working with to get the bangs the way I wanted and to keep the lace cap concealed (the cap is black but wig is light brown so it shows through when hair is pulled tight) but once that was done it looked great.  But for 8.99 who honestly expects perfection out of the package?  The adjustment straps don&#x27;t stay real well but a pin or holding the wig tight as you put it on fixes this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can tangle up pretty easily (my husband said some tangle in it made it look even more real though) and clings to some materials, but an easy run through with a brush afterwards and it was back to perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband actually thought it was real human hair!  Pictures taken with the flash on cause it to be really brassy looking but with the flash off it looks as real as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I wish they had a whole array of colors to choose from because I would be buying one in every shade.</li>
            <li> Needed to know what i&#x27;d look like before changing my hair color, so I purchased this wig.  Best color wig I ever bought. It&#x27;s a little stringy which I expected for the price</li>
            <li> It was packaged quite well, a little darker than pictured but fits well and delivered promptly. Didn&#x27;t have any funky smell to it like some other wigs I bought, so this one got used right away. It can get tangled when it&#x27;s windy, but a little finger combing usually sets it right.</li>
            <li> I think my first impression was that the hair looks like its in way better quality than what I actually expected, but it just doesn&#x27;t suit my scalp very well... Beautiful wavy texture tho...and the color is nice, just like in the picture</li>
            <li> Well pic isn&#x27;t what it looks like. Color is more red thank anything. Bangs are not like the pic listed. Vendor has refunded quickly though. Give it a try</li>
            <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for everything!&lt;br /&gt;Great Service, Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Great wig!, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;You can make style&#x27;s with this wig!, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Overall Great Purchase!</li>
            <li> I got the wig sooner than expected, which was great because I was so impatient :)&lt;br /&gt;The wig is simply gorgeous! It looks exactly like the picture, same color and length, except the fringe which is longer. That was not a problem. I bought another one - a dark brown one - so I cut the fringe in the light brown wig and kept the dark one longer (as it was), because it&#x27;s almost the same as my own hair!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these wigs surprised me in a positive way!!! I just can&#x27;t understand the &amp;#34;not so good&amp;#34; reviews, maybe people did not receive the same as I did... but I got two and they&#x27;re both LOVELY. I was thinking that maybe the wigs would look too fake, or ridiculous, or good for halloween... but NO. They look very natural, a bit like when I go to a haidresser but that&#x27;s not bad! When we have our hair styled in a hair salon we look a bit more stylized... that&#x27;s it, it&#x27;s how I look with my wigs!&lt;br /&gt;These are my first wigs. I always wanted to have one but had never bought because I used to find all the wigs I saw very pompous and unnatural. Until I found these ones in Amazon pictures (some others are nice too but these are more what I want from a hairstyle). I&#x27;m glad I decided to try because it&#x27;s GREAT FUN! My husband was skeptical about the idea (well, he didn&#x27;t want me to pierce my ears!!!!!) but he too is completely fond of me wearing my two new looks (with my earrings!) :))&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I can only recommend this wig to girls who like the pictures but are puzzled because of some rewiews. Go ahead the wigs are PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. To Amazon: The dark brown wig was ordered by my sister because my budget was kind of low (haha, too much shopping) so you didn&#x27;t knew that I have two... Should I copy/paste this rewiew to show in both of your products???</li>
            <li> Great wig for the money. Bangs are long and you&#x27;ll have to trim them.</li>
            <li> Just got this wig today! I ordered it a while ago but had it shipped to my house so i didn&#x27;t get it before I went to college. Not the sellers fault, a miscalculation on my part. It came in pretty good time. The color&#x27;s a little lighter than it is in the picture, but I didn&#x27;t mind terribly. The texture is really silky, but it&#x27;s not hard to just brush it out. It&#x27;s pretty obvious it&#x27;s a wig though- compared to more expensive wigs that i&#x27;ve had, this one&#x27;s really noticeable, most likely because A)i it&#x27;s really shiny and B) the part/ bangs go a little too far back. However, I think it is still beautiful and enjoy wearing it for a classy and fun look. I like it overall. There was a little of the shedding that others had mentioned (normal hair does that too) but overall, good quality, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to upload pics to product reviews, so here&#x27;s a link to an image of the wig on my tumblr; hope it helps!&lt;br /&gt;http://xobriabunny.tumblr.com</li>
            <li> the wig is gorgeous and really high quality.  the color of mine is more of a dark brown, but i don&#x27;t mind, as it suits me better.  it looks pretty realistic, it doesn&#x27;t tangle, and it&#x27;s really easy to style, although i don&#x27;t use heat on it. my only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little bit thin, but the tracks don&#x27;t show so i don&#x27;t really mind.  it would looks amazing with a few tracks added for security!!  this wig is comparable to other wigs that i&#x27;ve bought for $30 - $40 dollars, and i&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from this shop.</li>
            <li> The color was a little lighter than I expected, but I did love it. Came with a wig cap and I did not expect it too so that was a perk!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE!!! I was scared the color was going to be to harsh against my skin. It is about a shade lighter than the picture. But I was surprised that it was just FABULOUS!!!! I thought I was the cats meow. Soft, has a natural shine to it, looks and feels like it&#x27;s worth Way more than it is and it&#x27;s just great. Doesn&#x27;t tangle just be advised big dangling earrings can catch hold to the hair and tangle into the hair, but small profile earrings don&#x27;t have any issues. Thus a great buy.</li>
            <li> This wig is definitely worth the money! But, I only gave it 3 stars for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The color is NOT light brown, it is a dark brown, more brunette. It does have a \\&quot;warm\\&quot; hue to itlike the picture, but I would compare it to a level 4G (or 4RG). I don&#x27;t consider the picture light brown to begin with, and it is darker than the pic  anyhow. Also, It is not a natural looking color to me. I am a hairdresser and can always spot color treated hair. If I saw this on someone I might not notice that it is a wig unless I was really checking it out, but I would instantly think that she colored her hair. The one thing that usually&lt;br /&gt;gives a wig away is the uniform color. Hair this long would naturally be lighter at the ends, even if it was colored. But for that type of wig it would be expensive. I wish they had a few colors to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The wig cap itself is too big, and I have a big head! The front and sides fit great, but the back around the occipital bone bunches up a lot when I use the tightening straps. Also, when I attach the straps the\\&quot;headband\\&quot; it creates is too tight. But ultimately it does not show the \\&quot;bagginess\\&quot; , and if you have a lot&lt;br /&gt;of your own long hair to tuck under there is plenty of room.&lt;br /&gt;3. The bangs are cut way to far back on my wig and are very thick.The short pieces fall over the long hair all the way back to behind my ears. If I comb them down like the pic it looks like I have a bowl haircut on top of my long hair. This is probably the one major thing that makes my wig look \\&quot;wiggy\\&quot;. But, if I brush them back and play with it a bit with some spray to hold them it looks much better. Some reviewers said they need to cut the bangs shorter, but mine came short and graze my eyebrows, then get longer as they go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good points&lt;br /&gt;1. If you are looking for a long wig it is very long! Mine falls way below my breasts. But it is much more layered and wavy at the bottom than the pic. (Not a \\&quot;one length\\&quot; look like the pic)&lt;br /&gt;2. It is thick, and it barely shed when I brushed it multiple times. Nothing shows through.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is soft and does not tangle excessively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It arrived in half the shipping time. It came in a soft envelope neatly folded inside of a black net.Girls, this is NOT a wig cap, and is not meant to secure your hair under a wig! You need to get a\\&quot;wig cap\\&quot;. They are flesh colored and the same material as the control top from a pair of pantyhose. It will fit tightly and keep your wig from moving around or slipping back off your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Your wig will perform a 100 times better with one.&lt;br /&gt; I am ultimately glad I got it. I plan on cutting mine into a different style. At least 4 inches off the bottom, and some layers, especially angled around the face to try and blend in the heavy bangs.on mine.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to search through this shippers wigs and see if they carry something lighter that is not platinum blonde. I would order from them again. I think at their prices you have to play a little roulette, but I don&#x27;t think the risk is too much for a $7 bucks!&lt;br /&gt; Some reviewers said they got a light colored wig. Anyone want to trade?</li>
            <li> Wow! This wig is great, nice and soft and really pretty! Totally worth the price. The one I received was a bit shorter than pictured but I don&#x27;t mind at all. It tangles a bit easily but not in an unmanageable way a little combing does the job. All in all it one of my favorites and I own quite a few wigs at a variety of prices.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig that looks good on.  Easy to care for, good looking, good cut, very natural looking.  I really like it</li>
            <li> I got my wig within two weeks. It is the one in the pic. It is nice. Not too thick. The bangs are not as wide as it is in the pic. The pic has the ear to ear type bangs. I suppose it can be cut into that.  I can blend my own hair in with the wig and make it look two-toned with a darker color. I love two-toned or three-toned hair. I can brush the bangs over to the side giving it a layered look too.  The hair is soft but has a shine to it though and the color appears a little darker in the pic.</li>
            <li> I received my order this morning and when I first tried it on, I&#x27;ll be honest: I was a bit skeptical. I thought it didn&#x27;t look right on me at first, but the more I wore it and put on my makeup for the day, it INSTANTLY became one of my favorite wigs. I look so gorgeous in this wig and you will too! I&#x27;ll DEFINITELY be ordering from here again! I&#x27;ll upload a picture when my accessories ship in. Thanks So Much! :)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t ran into any huge tangle issues, and it&#x27;s an adorable wig on.&lt;br /&gt;I did have to let it air out a bit because it had a somewhat weird smell, but other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> The service was quick it did look funni at first but ofc it takes a lil bit to get used to new looks but was amazing had a lot of fun and got alot of compliments!</li>
            <li> This wig is so pretty, with soft waves and a very nice shade of Medium to Lightish brown, with highlights. Its pretty long ,and looks realistic... Has some tangling issues,  but nothing to really worry about.. It doesnt shed much at all either. and stays on my hed nicely without slipping....I would advise anyone, to go ahead and buy this wig. . It looks so natural, and is great to wear every day, or if you are having a bad hair day..</li>
            <li> I ordered another wig from this company and it fit great. So I go this one too... not so great. It didn&#x27;t even fit on my 5 year old well! Do not buy this wig. But other wigs from this company have been great.</li>
            <li> This one was a gift to my daughter. I think she liked it very much. She was the one who found the website and called me.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but my sister liked it more so she took it and it looks great.  It was a fantastic buy and at a great price !</li>
            <li> Bought this wig &amp; dig it! Didn&#x27;t really know what to expect with reading the reviews but it is a very good wig for the price! I actually wear it out! The only thing I&#x27;d have to advise is that the wig is a shade or so darker brown than the picture portrays. But all in all, satisfied :)</li>
            <li> The wig is as expected for the very low price paid. It&#x27;s a fun item to wear as part of a costume but not something you&#x27;d want to wear out during the day.</li>
            <li> Wtf... I bought this wig cuz there was so many good ratings.. I got 3 10$ awesome wigs n this one is a JOKE!!!  It&#x27;s extremely short, too shinny, horrible color on azn light skin tone,horrible cut,etc.</li>
            <li> Well, after waiting quite some time, my wig finally came in. I go and open the package, and looking back at me is the wrong wig entirely! The wig is short and straight with bangs that swoop to the side, VERY small (Barely fits on my head) and dark brown.I would love to return it and possibly get the correct one (Watch me return it and get the same one back), but since it took so long to come in I&#x27;d rather just keep it, and maybe sell it to a friend. I would recommend NOT buying this wig, unless you feel lucky enough where you may actually get the one you payed for.</li>
            <li> Wow looks jst like the picture lenghth and color.Didnt have to do any altering.Fits secure but not too tight and got here ahead of schedule perfectly packaged!Cant say enough good stuff. Ordering another now!!</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing! It looks and feels super real. It&#x27;s the best wig I&#x27;ve bought off of Amazon so far. The only thing is the wig I received is a copper orange color instead of light brown. It doesn&#x27;t bother me though because I love the color.</li>
            <li> I love the color and shape but not the material because break it easily brushing it! and get damage to fast.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s a little bit darker then the picture &amp; I&#x27;ll have to actually have the bangs styled. But it still looks really nice and feels fairly realistic. All in all Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair! The bangs are cut straight across, but they were so long that I still had to cut them. It came with a &#x27;wig cap&#x27; that was actually just a fishnet thing, but I bought a pack of wig caps anyway so it doesn&#x27;t matter. The color and length are exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s incredibly soft, it looks and feels like real hair, and it fits very snug after adjusting the straps on the inside. I played basketball while wearing it and went to Walmart. No one suspected a thing. :)</li>
            <li> never got it since the beginning of the year. my money was stolen and nantreeshop ripped me off and now doesnt exist.</li>
            <li> The wig is great for the price, the color was pretty close the cut was a bit different but that can be changed with a little tweaking. But I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and I enjoy wearing it, keeps me from constantly changing the color of my hair now I just wear my hair and interchange with the few wigs I&#x27;ve boughten.</li>
            <li> So this is the first wig I ever purchased. I think after receiving it, that the image uploaded by the seller, and definitely by other customers is a very accurate representation of what you will receive :) I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but the wig is very pretty! I wore it right out of the &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; (bag rather) and my husband was shocked at how cute it was. After wearing it out for the day to run errands on Sunday, I took it home and found it was pretty tangled. I read some other reviews that mentioned &amp;#34;wig brushes&amp;#34; so I didn&#x27;t try to brush it with my normal brush, but tried with my hands. Still loses a lot of hairs, though. The wig is soft, and the style staid until I ran my hands through it. So anyway, let me just write likes and dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like: Pretty&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Looks fairly real&lt;br /&gt;Seems like good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: No instructions!!&lt;br /&gt;Hair falls out easily when I tried to untangle it with my fingers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be uploading a pic later on.</li>
            <li> The color is very close to the product image, maybe a shade darker. I did not have any problems with it being lighter like others had. It looks natural and doesn&#x27;t feel like a cheap wig, good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, easy to brush, easy to wear. Great feel, and fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Extremely happy with what I received. Better than I expected it would be!</li>
            <li> The wig shipped the same day I ordered it, and it arrived far earlier than expected ^^ it only took about 3 days to reach my doorstep ! The minute I took the wig out, I fell in love with it. The wig looked identical to the photo above , and it&#x27;s texture was soft . The wig itself looked highly realistic ; I bought this wig as a Christmas Present for a friend , and the happiness on her face was priceless. I&#x27;ll defiantly buy wigs from this seller in the future</li>
            <li> Did not take long to get. Came i a neat bubbled package covered in a plastic bag with a cardboard protector( thankful for, delivery people tend to shove and throw my stuff...), with a with balled paper on the inside head piece to prevent any flatness. along with net around it for not tangling  Also came with a nifty fishnet wig cap!  felt just as soft if more so than my own hair.  a little darker in color than the picture, but altogether beautiful and worth it!!!  it gives me so much confidence and strength for anything coming my way!!!!</li>
            <li> at first i thought that its wasnt what i wanted when it came in the  mail , but when i opened up the bag . there it was . perfect , the only critical comment that i really must make is that i do not like the way the bangs are cut , but you can make it work , with a little time with the straight iron ! thank you and keep up the good work .</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this wig and will be buying others... I have a condition that makes me loose my hair so I have to wear wigs and I used to pay high price till I found these and I love them... &amp; Not to mention it camr in almost 2wks early :) LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> shipped fast and as described</li>
            <li> As a 1st time buyer of a wig, I am very satisfied with my purchase. Arrived 2 weeks ahead of date and I look great, natural, and comfortable wearing it. Everyone thinks it is my real hair!</li>
            <li> This wig looks nice, it is darker then it is pictured. It holds up pretty well, doesn&#x27;t shed or get tangled as easily as others.</li>
            <li> I washed it a few times and straightened it. Got very very knotted and frizzy. So i put some oil in it. And it thined right out. But alot of the hair came out also :/</li>
            <li> I got this for casual/classic lolita, and it&#x27;s nearly perfect. The cap is a bit tight, so if you have long hair make sure to pin it down well.</li>
            <li> I bought the wig from TaoBaoPit. It arrived within three weeks, and came with an under-the-wig hair net.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time buying and wearing a wig, and it took me very little time at all to figure it out. The wig comes with an awesome clasp that hooks together at the top of your neck in the back, and it holds everything on quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The wig was light brown, exactly as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on the heavier side, and it still looks amazing on me. I had a field day taking pictures for my Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;It matched the color of my normal hair, which is why I bought it. A new semester is about to start at school, and I fried my hair having too much fun dying it this Summer.&lt;br /&gt;Even my own husband thought that I had simply walked into the bathroom and put in extensions.&lt;br /&gt;Ten minutes, and a hair brush, that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll need for this wig.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t styled it or cut it at all, and I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m ever going to.&lt;br /&gt;This wig is a quick and easy way to have a perfect hair day instantly. I had to adjust it once or twice, but considering that it lasted all day without so much as a single tangle, it was a small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;It felt tight at first, but my head got used to it after an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;I fully plan to use this wig for school, parties, holidays, going out and about, and pretty much just whenever I can.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little lighter in the sun, but nothing too dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you wear clean clothing and are well put together, this hair will blend right in with your appearance and simply give you that extra professional super-tidy air about you.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic. 10/10 would buy from again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> The wig is not accurate as far as the color. I like it, but not what I really wanted at all..</li>
            <li> FOR SEVEN BUCKS!  This wig is gorgeous, soft, flowy!  I have never worn wigs before and sometimes I just want a change up!  This is my first introduction to wig land and I loved it!  I am no wig expert but it looks great I think!  You cant beat the price!  I think if you like wearing wigs for fun then this wig is a great choice!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After brushing hair fell out and end became very frizzy</li>
            <li> This wig sucks. Not at all like the pic. It is just 1 huge clump after wearing it for a few minutes and it looks like it was burned in a spot in the front. Yuck.</li>
            <li> Item arrived ahead of time in new condition.  I understand it came a long way from China.&lt;br /&gt;The add says light brown,  it is more of a medium brown with subtle ting of red.</li>
            <li> At first I was sad about the hair but after I talk to my seller they agreed to help with the hair problem. so I&#x27;m receiving another wig thanks to them I feel better ordering from them again!!!!  they have a great customer service&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> im not use to wig and I am still learning on how to properly wear and care for it but I am very pleased with the product and will buy more as my needs and look wants to change</li>
            <li> The actual quality of the wig is alright, and it&#x27;s an okay thickness and everything, but the wig isn&#x27;t straight in the slightest. I expected it to be a little straighter and curlier at the ends. The color is also a lot darker than what&#x27;s advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it&#x27;s a good wig, I just didn&#x27;t get what I was shown.</li>
            <li> A truly beautiful wig.. its slightly darker Then the picture but still amazing...when I first brushed it little hair came out and the curls stayed for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty wig don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it isn&#x27;t made for all heads it runs very small. it looks real and all but you can see bald spots in certain areas. But hey didn&#x27;t pay much for it, so I didn&#x27;t expect it to be an A+ wig.</li>
            <li> Where is my wig? I&#x27;ve ordered this September 13, and now it is October 16!!! Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> Shipping was amazingly fast for the projected arrival date. It was supposed to get here November 5th at the earliest but it is now Oct 23rd and it has arrived. But on to the product: It is no where near as long as the picture. Everything else is pretty much as pictured except for that. It&#x27;s a bit shiny but as is expected of like a $10 wig so I&#x27;m still very pleased. It&#x27;s really soft and a decent color so I&#x27;m pretty happy overall.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a $50 wig else where.. I almost like this one better. Feels real. Not too thick or thin. Great for every day wear. I bought this wig because of the great reviews. Do not miss out on this deal! I also received it in 3 days. Waaaay sooner then expected!</li>
            <li> I love this wig. This is my first time ever trying on a wig and I have no problems with it. It fits nice and looks natural. When I showed my family they thought I had gotten hair extensions xD They loved it and so do I. There isn&#x27;t much tangling to it and there is no itchy feeling or lopsidedness to it. I bought this wig, &#x27;cause I have short hair and I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it out for over a year with little results. My hair is in that awkward stage where I an&#x27;t do anything with it and it&#x27;s too short to put in a ponytail. It was a nice cheap way to have the hair I&#x27;ve always wanted, instead of spending hundreds of dollars for hair extensions. The shipping was quick &amp; they even come with hair nets that fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> This wig is SOOO THICK, i love it and best part is everyone thinks it&#x27;s my natural hair.. Thanks Cool2day. :)</li>
            <li> I saws this wig and fell all the way in love. I got it and it was nothing like I wanted. The hair was way too light. Almost sand blonde, maybe lighter. And I contacted the seller and had to send five pictures to prove it was wrong. I got a call from the seller who admitted it was wrong then said. \\&quot;Its not our fault. Blame amazon.\\&quot; And I have been told by this seller four times to talk to amazon because its not their fault. Don&#x27;t buy. They will not remedy any of your issues.</li>
            <li> I know it looks long in the picture, but once you put it on, BOY IS IT LONG.  The bangs on mine were all crooked, and the wig tangles a lot.  Not as cute as in the picture here on Amazon, but it can be worked with. I got this for photoshoots, to change up my looks, and it photographed really well, so thats a plus.  But in the summer sun, its obviously fake because it shines like tinsel.  Its a fun wig to have though, so I decided to keep it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig around the end of November and received it a few days after Christmas. I was kinda expecting it though, being shipped from China. The wig however is long and curly and thick. It looked a little shiny but that&#x27;s nothing a little dry shampoo can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this wig! The bangs were a little thick so I had to cut them a bit, but it is a very well constructed, super cute wig! I&#x27;ve worn it on several occasions and have gotten loads of compliments. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how easily it gets tangled, even just sitting on it&#x27;s wig stand. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t last me for more than a dozen wearings, but that&#x27;s still lan amazing deal!</li>
            <li> While this wig was affordable and just fun to have.  It was way too small.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe I have a large head as I am a faily small woman. So that was a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I am sure it will be fine for some.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a pleasant surprise. The wig was purchased as a joke, but when it was recd. we could not believe the hair was/is real, but appeared to be real. The packaging was top quality, too.</li>
            <li> it&amp;#34;s a nice wig for one day use--not an every day wig -i tryed to style the wig and that did not go over so well the hair looks horrible, you cant even add a iron to it--so, yes i learned my lesson.--(fyi////to all the iyawos that needs wigs dont purchase this )</li>
            <li> one of my favorite wigs, natural looking, very beautiful, I look like a totally different person in it . .</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s technically styled and length like the picture, but unfortunately this wig looks extremely fake.  The bangs are way too short.  It&#x27;s extremely shiny and I highly doubt this is actually made of the Kanekalon fiber that they claim it&#x27;s made of.  I have 7 other wigs made of this fiber and the texture, look and weight is nothing like any of my other wigs and for similar prices.  I am just sticking with the X &amp; Y brand since they have never let me down once in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried this wig on, not only was it super shiny and the baby powder trick was hopeless, you could see the wig cap any way you move it.  I even tried looking at it just done, but if I shake my head, the wig cap shows immediately.  So there is no way of styling this at all without wig cap showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my other wigs are light weight like this one, but the wig cap doesn&#x27;t show and I can even style it in a pony tail, pig tails etc with/out pple knowing my wigs are fake and the wig cap never shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if I got the wrong wig or what, but this brand is not a typical Kanekalon wig that I buy.</li>
            <li> The quality of the wig I received was good. The color was off, but that may have been a result of computer screen differences. The color is stated as Light Brown, when it is actually closer to brown. Either way, I&#x27;m still pleased with the wig I received.</li>
            <li> dont buy this. this looks so fake and not anything close to the photo that you see. The color is ok.  The bang is somewhat so weird. I look funny wearing this wig</li>
            <li> The bangs are great, looks shinny-ish and healthy. It&#x27;s actually a pretty good alternative to a hat on those cold days, but if it&#x27;s windy, you&#x27;ll need a bandana or something.</li>
            <li> The color of this wig is true to the description, very shine-y, &amp; good texture.  And it came with a black fishnet wig cap too.  However, the fullness of long hair that seems to be shown in the picture is deceptive.  The bangs are thick, but the rest of the long hair is quite scarce.  Not enough long hair attached to the wig to make it real believable.  However, it looks great in a single side braid with some styling.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a friend of mine who has a hair problem and she like it very much.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s fine if you are going to wear it once.&lt;br /&gt;But can&#x27;t wear it multiple time because hair keeps on falling.&lt;br /&gt;Also when I first received it, it smelled really funny.&lt;br /&gt;But hey. It&#x27;s really cheap. It looks ok when you wear it although anybody can tell it&#x27;s a wig.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it? Yes. If it&#x27;s just onetime use for Halloween or some other special occasion.</li>
            <li> even though most of cheap wigs look odd, this one does not!  my natural hair color is similar to the color of the wig, only shorter.  When I wore the wig, not only I got many compliments but many people thought it was my natural hair, which I guess proves that quality of the wig is pretty pretty good!</li>
            <li> Nice wig, i truly love it! It&#x27;s great for the price but there&#x27;s one problem... i got a wine red wig. I ordered this back in september and it came sooner than i expected. It&#x27;s a bit thin, but it&#x27;s a 7 dollar wig, so no complaints there. It&#x27;s a bit shiny but that&#x27;s nothing you cant fix~ I would, though, buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Will not be wearing.</li>
            <li> Lets put it this way, it is so shiny that it looks very &amp;#34;wiggy&amp;#34;. I suggest spraying a little dry shampoo on it to tone the shine down a little bit. With a little playing around with it, it looks decent, but it really doesn&#x27;t look very natural. I would say if you need a cheap wig for a costume, it is better than most costume wigs. But to try to pass it off as your real hair, it is not going to happen.</li>
            <li> The wig is nice but I was expecting it to match what was on the picture...light brown. Its actually more on the blonde side. Its my first time buying a wig and you can tell its a wig. It&#x27;s ok but if it were the right color just like the model it wouldve been nicer.</li>
            <li> This wig is made of decent quality.  It seems to be fairly thick and covers very well.  I did end up cutting about 5 inches off of the bottom to make it shoulder length.  I did this because the bottom layer did not look real.  It was frizzy and didn&#x27;t look real.  Overall this was a great price on a great wig. I have since bought more!</li>
            <li> l love this wig the color, the texture, and the hair is heat resistant, a lot better the john renau wig and my Amanda wig, This wig doesn&#x27;t get frizzy like other wigs, in any case you can use a steam product for smart hair. I am so happy I found you/</li>
            <li> This is a great costume wig, but if you&#x27;re looking for a daily wearer, or something to wear out, this isn&#x27;t it.  This is an incredible steal for the price, just trim the bangs to fit your face/head, and you&#x27;re all set!  This is a GREAT product for someone considering permanently coloring or perming their hair, but isn&#x27;t certain how it would look on them.  For less than $10, you can potentially save yourself from a costly, long term hair disaster.  The photo in the advertisement isn&#x27;t exactly realistic, so I suggest looking at the customer-provided pictures instead.</li>
            <li> I do Youtube videos with my Cousins... me, being a guy, need to do a small part. I obviously have short hair, this worked. lol&lt;br /&gt;It looks like real Hair too! My cousins though I was someone else at first glance!</li>
            <li> It came when it was expected. My only real complaint is that the bangs are&lt;br /&gt;a little too long so they need trimming. But a wig for $9 is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the wig. Looks nothing like the picture. It looks really brassy and plastic. Like Barbie hair but worse</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--Beautiful red tones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--Too shiny&lt;br /&gt;--Too many gaps where you can see the underlying fabric right through the strands&lt;br /&gt;--Sheds like crazy</li>
            <li> does not look nothing like picture but you get what u pay for huh...</li>
            <li> It says the the wig is supposed to be light brown. It&#x27;s ginger. It&#x27;s still really pretty, and a good wig! But the color is more ginger than the picture.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair, soft and shinny, BUT it is NOT as full as it looks in the picture. It is a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> loved the style, but wig cap was too small, wig slide on head, no combs to keep wig in place, tangles and knots easily</li>
            <li> I love this, and all my friends say it looks natural. I just wish it was a tad lighter, but no problem there!</li>
            <li> ***Warning this company takes a very long time to ship***&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this BEFORE Christmas, It got here today January 23rd.  It was actually early and supposed to be here in February.&lt;br /&gt;I know that the seller specifies this long shipping time but I was thinking that was encase of some sort of screw up not as a general rule.  By last week I was thinking I was going to leave a nasty review. I figured it was going to be cheap and useless by the time it did get here and was kind of sorry I had bought it over a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***The Good News***&lt;br /&gt;THIS WIG IS FANTASTIC, it is light and comfortable, realistic and cute.  It doesn&#x27;t shed, if it tangles it is a simple fix with a light brushing, it&#x27;s wiggy shine is solve with a dusting of cornstarch.  I hated waiting the excessive long time to get this, but now I am sold and am going to purchase another.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product and seller a 5 star rating if only they could figure out how to ship it it in a reasonable amount of time, it sat in China for a month before being flown to the US. They also included a wig cap that was very nice and a little gift aas well.  Great company, great product, lousy shipping time.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this wig, but I was saddened when I got it. It is much thinner than shown. It is still comfortable and soft, just not as thick as I was expecting. It still works nicely, and looks nice on me. It is a bit darker, than shown, but that can be expected. It is also a bit shorter, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I really love the quality of hair! The only sad thing about this is that the colour is not at all like the photo. It&#x27;s more of a light-medium brown; I was hoping it would be more auburn, but it still looks great! The bangs are a bit too long, so I may have to cut them down a bit or try to curl them with a large hair roller to get a bit of a lift. But other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with this product, and if I ever need another wig, I&#x27;ll definitely order from here again!</li>
            <li> I ordered the wig and it came in exactly on time which was nice. The wig has so far shown to be nice quality, but it looks nothing like the color shown in the picture. I was hoping for a much lighter brown like the picture and instead got a normal brown that is much darker than the image shown here. Besides that it&#x27;s a nice wig and has the right amount of waves in it and is the exact length as portrayed in the picture.</li>
            <li> I just received the wig and I&#x27;m very very happy with how it looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;In person the color is one tone (not like the picture where it looks as if with highlights and lowlights)&lt;br /&gt; Quite honestly for having paid $8.00 (AND free shipping) this is amazing! It arrived 2 weeks after placing the order even though  the product receipt said it would take about a month because of free shipping but I was relieved to see it here before that.  I&#x27;m not a big wig shopper but I&#x27;ve seen bad quality wigs ( like costume wigs) that are far more expensive. The hair is very soft and would easily pass for actual hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than the image but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li> Yes, the hair looks very real- but it&#x27;s super thin! I got it for my Anna of Arendale cosplay and it&#x27;s too thin.  When I wore it, the wig cap was visible in the back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still wear it- it is cute when styled right. But thin. Just remember that.</li>
            <li> Not the color that was expected. Dark-medium brown</li>
            <li> A very nice light brown wig for only $5 &amp; free postage ! Looks and feels like a premium wig . Usually most cheap wig are nothing like the photo and turn out to be a frizzy mess of junk after combing . However, this one is a real gem amongst inexpensive wigs . For this price you just can&#x27;t go wrong . Buy it !</li>
            <li> So soft and easy to work with. So pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today and i could say it looks great with considering it&#x27;s price tag. The bad thing is, it easily tangles when i tried combing in my fingers. I&#x27;m new to wig and it&#x27;s actually my first wig , so i&#x27;m not used to it yet.</li>
            <li> Alright - I have to say first, that anybody that whines about this wig is just plain silly! I&#x27;ve seen a few comments on this wig (and other Cool2Day wigs) that they received their order and were disappointed because it didn&#x27;t wear anything like the picture shows..... Um... how long did you mess with and try adjusting the wig? Did you take a pair of scissors to it to try and get it take the perfect shape? Because within about 15 minutes of me getting this wig and a little light trimming of the bangs to get them blunt and straight across, I got this wig to look PRETTY DANG CLOSE to the product picture - and don&#x27;t say &amp;#34;Well I shouldn&#x27;t have to be a hair stylist to make a wig look good&amp;#34; because in all reality, you can totally buy a wig that comes perfect right out of the box that you don&#x27;t have to tweak at all, but you&#x27;re certainly not gonna pay just $10 for it like this one! Check out my customer submitted pic, this wig is AWESOME OPOSSUM! It arrived on the earliest day of the delivery range (from CA to FL in 3 days) and didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;smell funny&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;shed like crazy&amp;#34; or appear &amp;#34;way too long&amp;#34; the way I&#x27;ve seen it described here. If you don&#x27;t have the cash to buy a high-end wig and you have the balls to get a little innovative and take a pair of scissors to a meesly $10 purchase, GET THIS WIG! ^__^</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty good quality, a nice value for the price.  It brushes out nicely and looks natural.  It&#x27;s more of a medium brown than light brown, though. The photo is accurate.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be some kind of costume wig when I got it for less then $10 , then when it showed up to my house ( with a wig cap &amp;a pair of free cute purple socks ) but its a very high quality wig ! I love it and will be coming back!</li>
            <li> 3 stars because it took me half an hour to get it on. And I still didn&#x27;t get it on right. I like the color and the wavy hair but the bangs OMG too long so i had to cut them and now they look a bit better but not much. I like it overall the price was good. It&#x27;s not as long as it looks in the pictures. It&#x27;s not light brown either ifs more light dark brown. It tangled up when I kept adjusting the wig too fit right. It also came with a wig cap. I think I&#x27;d rather spend $100 on a professional wig</li>
            <li> My wig arrived today. The first thing that I noticed was the color. The color is just like it is pictured on the Model  and I was very happy with that. However, the texture is much like doll hair. The wig also looks very shiny and unreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next issue that I had with this wig is that the bang is very uneven. I cannot wear this wig until I cut the bang properly. If I had wanted to cut the bang myself there would have been no need for me to buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not buy this wig again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend and it worked out really well. The colour is nice. Okay I don&#x27;t know what else to write.</li>
            <li> Bought as a  wig for costume....granddaughter had a great time wearing it and will pass it down to her siblings. Arrived quickly and safely. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same color...size is a little small but made it work...not as thick as the picture made it seem</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and it&#x27;s just like the picture. Which may look nice from the side but...uh, front-view...kind of a bowlcut BUT nothing a little adjusting can fix. Again, great quality.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome wig for the price! I bought it to take pictures with. It wasnt tangled,the color matched the photo, it didn&#x27;t shed anymore then i thought it would while brushing, it wasn&#x27;t to shiny,came with a hair net, had a nice clip to hold in place,and wig had excellent body.  i received several compliments! The back is a little thin but for 7 bucks its still amazing deal. I will be buying more! see my posted photos, wig was put on right out of the package no adjusting in anyway.</li>
            <li> The wig is a lighter color the in the pictures, does not come in a box, and did not come with a wig cap like it said. But the wig is good quality so if you don&#x27;t care about the color and stuff then ok have fun.</li>
            <li> not a bad wig, good color, great price.  but I must have a huge head, because the darn thing wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  I got it as part of a costume for a play &amp; it would have been perfect - or would have been if it hadn&#x27;t kept slipping off my head.</li>
            <li> The color of the wig was dead on!The wig however was shorter then I thought it would be and the bangs are side bangs not classic bangs... which I&#x27;m fine with!! I received the wig on time, not late or early... overall I&#x27;m pleased with it.. definitely worth the money but would have regretted if it cost anymore!</li>
            <li> Soft wig, shine easily removed with dry shampoo.  I have a small forehead so I needed to do some trimming on thr bangs. They are more side swept long, but I easily cut them blunt. Red tint to the wig, natural color once shine is removed (google search deshine wig). wig isn&#x27;t too terribly full, but perfect for plays or dummies.  You can&#x27;t really style it too much in an updue without netting underneath showing, but when flat it really does look natural.  Very soft MUCH pbetter quality than any costume wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Cute but I was allergic to the fibers!! If you are sensitive to plastics you may not want to get this wig..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tangle too easy, either! It is very realistic, you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s a wig at all! I am beyond satisfied. Same color as pictured, perfect little curls hold, too! Just perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my friend and she is very happy with it! it made the perfect gift.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it t/b top quality @ $7-8.  It&#x27;s OK tho.  Looks like a wig.  Has great color! Bangs needed a stylist-no biggie.  Smelled like fish-grody (even after washing).  Sheds a lot.  Arrived sooner than expected and in a bubble mailer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend in an attempt to finish a VERY last minute cosplay.  We were short of luck.  Even so, the item got to me very quickly (in just 2-3 days with One-Day Shipping, meaning pay a little extra)!  I really didn&#x27;t expect it to reach me that fast.  As for the quality of the wig, it&#x27;s a bit shiny, but not so much that you can immediately say it&#x27;s fake.  The color is slightly darker than the product&#x27;s picture.  The waves were really nice and the fibers were really soft too.  My only concern was that the wig started to tangle as I took it out of the packaging, but it was really easy to fix with a bit of finger combing.</li>
            <li> The length was impressive.  It was made well and held together, even after numerous uses.  A good value and quality for the price.</li>
            <li> nice but came in the wrong color....i can&#x27;t even wear it. Too cheap to ship back so i just have a completely useless wig</li>
            <li> The color was fine and so was the cut of the wig however I could not even lightly brush it or run my fingers through it [to style] without losing a ton of hair from the wig.</li>
            <li> So it looks nothing like picture.  the top two thirds of wig is dark brown, bottom third is almost reddish brown kind of like ombre.  It looks nice when on,  its straight with straight bangs.  A slight trim to the bangs and looked not terrible.  For the price I say buy it.  With a headband on it doesn&#x27;t look half bad.  Just not as described as color is concerned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. The fringes needed a little cut, but that&#x27;s probably cause I have a short forehead. Good buy indeed.</li>
            <li> The color was correct and so was the length.  However, the wig fits really awkwardly on my head and it sheds a lot.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to be high quality for the price I paid. If I could go back in time, then I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy it.  It&#x27;s a costume wig and not something that can be worn everyday and taken seriously as real hair.</li>
            <li> I got this with very low expectations due to the $6 price tag, but this is actually a pretty good quality wig. It isn&#x27;t shiny, doesn&#x27;t look fake, and it&#x27;s pretty thick as well. My sister thought I cut and dyed my hair when I put it on, ha.</li>
            <li> Thick, well cut.  It is lighter than the picture would indicate but really a pretty wig</li>
            <li> I bought this wig and used it for my Anabelle costume. It was perfect. I did her signature hairstyle (two regular braids) and everyone loved it. I actually have more hair than this wig so I had a tough time putting it on. I wish it had more hair so I could wear it on the daily.</li>
            <li> for the price I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Good wig nice length great quality and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for two different cosplays, Renge from Ouran High School Host Club and Asuna from Sword Art Online. It has a bit too much wave in it but that won&#x27;t take very much to straighten out. The shipping was very fast, arriving almost two weeks before it was predicted to which was a nice surprise. :D The wig holds very true to the picture, arriving styled exactly. The title&#x27;s right, this wig looks and feels very healthy. The only reason it wouldn&#x27;t last long is if you don&#x27;t know how to take care of it properly.</li>
            <li> So I just got this in the mail today, and it&#x27;s probably the best wig I&#x27;ve ever bought. It came with a wig cap, which was good. Doesn&#x27;t matter what gender you are and how long or short your hair is, you&#x27;ll always need one. Apparently, there was no other loop for the strap of the wig so I couldn&#x27;t fit it on right. The fibers were falling out at first, but it shouldn&#x27;t be falling out later. Well, can&#x27;t wait to use this for Halloween or something, then I&#x27;ll see what my friends think of it. ^___^</li>
            <li> It was extremely thin out you can see the your hair under it... DON&#x27;T buy it you will just be disappointed. I gave it one start because I couldn&#x27;t give a 0.</li>
            <li> Looks and fits great!! It gets knotted easy , synthetic hair is not the way to go if your looking for long term hair</li>
            <li> This wig is fabulious and I would will order another one in the future.  This wig is soft and the color is the perfect brown for anyone looking for a natural brown.  I love this wig!!</li>
            <li> This wig is not real hair, but it feels and looks so real.  Have gotten so many compliments when I wear it, most people do not think it is a wig.  LOVE IT !!!</li>
            <li> I received it and no clips on it to make sure stays on your head, I love the color of it it&#x27;s maybe just a little lighter then in pic but not by much.  The hair is a little thinner then my other wig was full at the head so if not comb correctly you can see your regular hair or cap underneath and it is long which is a plus maybe 20 inches plus.  It tangles up but that&#x27;s expected in a wig the only thing is that the plugs come out that are secured to the cap which the wing is put on if you are trying to untangle it with fingers gently but not much, but Ive only wore it once. For the  price it is ok and the shipping takes a little while but it came a couple of days before the delivery date.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a simple long wig for some cosplays and this did the trick! It does tangle a bit at the ends but if you run a brush with detangler on it, that does the trick! It came with a wig cap which was really handy seeing as I lost mine. I love this wig so much! I highly recommend it!</li>
