            <li>The coconut is My wife&#x27;s favorite and I like the hempz triple moisture.</li>

            <li>But if you&#x27;re expecting this one to be thicker or better in texture as in a cream of some sort, it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>Just barely more moisturizing than water.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about this product, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>No drugstore brand lotion is better than Hempz products.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I Love it...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the ingredients are listed somewhere in there</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, great smell, really moisturizing -</li>
            <li>I rotate with the Citrus Blossom, which is also a favorite of mine, yummy citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand of lotion.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a great smell and works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>LOVE this</li>
            <li>Like most women, I have an arsenal of lotions in every scent and consistency.</li>
            <li>Reluctantly, I tried the product and hours later was so impressed with the results I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>I know better now.</li>
            <li>Also this entire line of lotions lasts forever, which is totally awesome.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am buying more.</li>
            <li>This is an okay lotion, I still enjoy their original better and my absolutely favorite from them is the &amp;#34;Hydrosilk&amp;#34; lotion ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li>The original has the most amazing scent...</li>
            <li>This particular version is my favorite as it is the most moisturizing (great for after the pool) and the scent is not too flowery.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, good price, came fast with Prime :)</li>
            <li>This new scent body lotion is great.</li>
            <li>The best lotion I have use in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>But if your skin is dry, this is WONDERFUL regardless of the scent.</li>
            <li>This has been a perfect solution to my itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li>love the light refreshing smell of lotion.  </li>
            <li>Has a great scent and leaves skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizer, has a nice bubblegum smell but its not too present either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The triple moisture is light easy to apply and works into your skin better than most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy, has a beautiful fragrance, last for hours and very light.</li>
            <li>It makes my very dry skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>If Santa could repeat that surprise this Christmas, she would be delighted.&amp;#34; He even advised me to check Amazon, which I did - and was very pleasantly surprised at the great price.</li>
            <li>This has been a great product so far.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin touchably smooth and zero greasiness like most others do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer the original scent better for a man</li>
            <li>Thought I was purchasing the original Hempz lotion but enjoy this too!  </li>
            <li>I put a little on and get it rubbed in real good and put more on.  </li>
            <li>just like their other lotion products, it is great!</li>
            <li>I love Hempz original lotion.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be considerably better than any other lotion, or the original Hempz lotion for that matter, but I&#x27;m not the best judge.</li>
            <li>Both shipments came VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and absorbers very quickly and leaves your skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to many months of my wife&#x27;s happiness (and soft feet).</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I wanted, at a great price, FAST!</li>
            <li>Nice and silky feeling but super sweet smell, like cotton candy.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfectly fine</li>
            <li>I have used for long time and finally found at good price on amazon, very happy!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect for winter dry skin or summer freshly tanned either indoor or outdoor skin.</li>
            <li>this one is a fantastic winter hand creme</li>
            <li>But this just feels kind of yucky really.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product and</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, but need something stronger.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy the scent as well as the way it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a light lotion that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or built up.</li>
            <li>It is paraben -free.</li>
            <li>Actually wakes me up because it smells so great.</li>
            <li>Overall Great moisturizer without leaving an oily/greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this brand for years since I&#x27;ve only heard great things about it.</li>
            <li>a bargain for such a great product</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth all day...</li>
            <li>I got a free sample from my beautician and I was hooked.</li>
            <li>A light airy fragrance with no after effects when absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Such a great deal and</li>
            <li>Light, yet leaves you feeling moisturized without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Love the refreshing scent and the gentle moisturizing effect it has.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smell good.</li>
            <li>If you like normal hempz you will love this!</li>
            <li>Light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Both are amazing, I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this very very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I love their products and this is now my new favorite.</li>
            <li>second fav. smells good not too strong either</li>
            <li>Prefer original or pomegranate.</li>
            <li>I recommend the original</li>
            <li>so I ordered two bottles instead of the original &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; that I had intended.</li>
            <li>Otherwise worth it!</li>
            <li>I love the scent first of all.</li>
            <li>I also like the original</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it &amp; it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Not like the original at all.</li>
            <li>Will stick with the original.</li>
            <li>Love the Hempz line they really know what&#x27;s up!</li>
            <li>I have been using Hempz original lotion</li>
            <li>Thanks, Hempz! :)</li>
            <li>Love this product sooo much!</li>
            <li>My skin gets really dry in the winter months and even though the Hempz original is a great lotion I thought I would try this one out.</li>
            <li>This is great for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>And I live in a dry climate, so this lotion is wonderful, light, and lightly scented so as not to offend, but still calm.</li>
            <li>So you can still perfume away for those special nights (or</li>
            <li>Super moisturizer with fresh scent!</li>
            <li>Very silky and smooth without be greasy!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves the fresh, light scent.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion so much that I bought a 5 pack.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is that it does moisturize well.</li>
            <li>it keeps my face smooth and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Her granddaughter tried it and loved it as well, especially the packaging.</li>
            <li>I wish that it was more infused with aloe, but for the price and availability, I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>Good for the winter season, especially for my lizard like scaly hands.</li>
            <li>the price is not bad on this.  </li>
            <li>super fast delivery, love this product.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to find other products from this same salon in Lexington, KY, as I am more than happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I was in a beauty store over the weekend and planned on purchasing the Hempz, but $25 is a little pricey for lotion for me even if it is good!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this particular kind.</li>
            <li>SO moisturizing and smells so fresh and clean and yummy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering and fades quickly, which I like.</li>
            <li>And, it does penetrate the skin quickly; however, it just didn&#x27;t work for me as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Hempz brand lotion and highly recommend this buy.</li>
            <li>We have been using the original moisturizer, it has a great scent that is not to harsh on my allergies.</li>
            <li>a lotion that claims to be triple strength, this is pretty light.  </li>
            <li>Great price too at Amazon, over 50% less than some stores.</li>
            <li>It moisturizers quickly and leaves a fresh pleasure smell..</li>
            <li>Best lotion ever made don&#x27;t need to look for a Nother brand put it on one time a day and it last all day long</li>
            <li>the smell is mild and soaks into your skin real fast.</li>
            <li>long lasting, perfect.</li>
            <li>I opted for the Prime &amp;#34;two day shipping&amp;#34; and I was quite pleased that the package arrived early Monday afternoon, just as promised!  </li>
            <li>Packed this for my vacation as well, and it was the perfect moisturizer following long days in the Caribbean sun!</li>
            <li>Then I saw that this one is &amp;#34;triple moisture&amp;#34; so I thought it&#x27;d be the best for me since I tend to have dry skin, especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find it for half the price of retail, but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a crisp, clean fragrance with undertones of watermelon and pear.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more oil in this lotion than their older ones but they still absorb pretty well.</li>
            <li>Back had very dry scab spots and they are all gone now awesome</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much healthier, smooth, and the elasticity is even improved using this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but I think it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>Only kind I use.</li>
            <li>Sampled some and found the scent I liked (triple moisture does smell similar</li>
            <li>It smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely give out 5 stars for anything</li>
            <li>Overall a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>Ruined a nice blouse because the oil just didn&#x27;t absorb in properly.</li>
            <li>Wow, so glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I have been able to find that sells it so cheap.</li>
            <li>favorite is vanilla plum, then original and citrus blossom tied for 2nd.&lt;br /&gt;Those are all the same moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Have worked in a tanning salon way too long not to love HEMPZ!</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and live in the desert great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fast absorbed by your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since moved to natural products to combat my dry skin - shea butter, coconut oil, etc, and they&#x27;ve been great.</li>
            <li>I quickly noticed a difference in how soft and smooth my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li>I love HEMP products and now that I can purchase on Amazon for half the price, I am REALLY in love with it.  </li>
            <li>It was very silky, absorbed quickly</li>
            <li>Its a refreshing light to the touch with a clean, slight tropical smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is rather strong at first, but as the day goes on it becomes less potent.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Hempz and Amazon!</li>
            <li>I just recently ordered 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li>I think I like the regular Hempz better.</li>
            <li>The place that I ordered from sent exactly what they said they would.  </li>
            <li>I also love the deals ui get at any store i pay double, but never again!!!</li>
            <li>I love this product, use it daily and like the scent and the non oily feel.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs leaving my skin feel soft and smooth not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I love it and have bought it several times through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fast ship!</li>
            <li>Feels really moisterizing!</li>
            <li>one of the first things listed is alcohol).</li>
            <li>Nice light scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Natural vegan product that is paraben free.</li>
            <li>I like the regular variety of Hempz much better.</li>
            <li>I love Hempz, it&#x27;s the only lotion I use.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Arrival was fast!</li>
            <li>Will be back for more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>and then actually feels like it is drying out the more that I use it.</li>
            <li>The bottle I got was thick without feeling like it clogged pores, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and has been great for nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li>The Hempz lotion INSTANTLY made them feel better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a avid review reader</li>
            <li>Plan to buy more products in the future.</li>
            <li>Hempz Triple Moisture Lotion promises to deliver extra nutrients to the skin through its unique combination of hydrating Yangu oil, anti-aging Apple Fruit extract and rich Cogon Grass extract.  </li>
            <li>Actually I think I like the others better.  </li>
            <li>Overall I still love my Hemptz lotions.</li>
            <li>This has tamed the bumps so much that they&#x27;re almost gone!</li>
            <li>Lotions these days have lots of different chemicals in them that we&#x27;d love to avoid.</li>
            <li>You will be amazed someone carefully took there time to come up with a smell that will knock the top off your lucky lady</li>
            <li>Rub it on after a shower, and my skin is soft all day!!!!</li>
            <li>thats how i feel WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>i love this lotion and with the dry winter we had it i amazing for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Most lotions only provide temporary relief but Hempz makes my skin feel healthy all day long.</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought this lotion because I liked the smell when I tried it in the store, and it made my hands soft too.  </li>
            <li>I am already on my second bottle because I love this so much.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and hydrates your skin like no other.</li>
            <li>Have ordered multiple times as this is the lotion I have found that actually works and like most people, I have many, many bottles of every lotion known to man!!&lt;br /&gt;Did not care for the other Hempz scents</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it keeps my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes well, smells amazing, and is gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>takes to long to soak in and my skin goes not look any better if feels like all I did was rub greece on my face</li>
            <li>I love the feel and scent of this lotion, lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Love this lotion ... very healing and gentle enough for the face!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay, although at 27 I&#x27;m not really trying to wear scents that were popular during my early teen years.</li>
            <li>I love Hempz for dry skin</li>
            <li>It makes your skin extremely soft and goes into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and never makes me feel sticky, just soft.</li>
            <li>This lotion have my skin feeling fresh, non-greasy, and very soft.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion on a whim as a Christmas 2013 gift for my 78 year old, super picky mom (very selective re: lotion aromas and absorption).</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have mature black skin, so maybe this lotion just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>If you scrub dry, you&#x27;ll strip your own natural oils and moisture).</li>
            <li>So for the price I believe some other products I have used provide as good if not better result, for a lower price; hence a better value than Hempz.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because I&#x27;m relatively light skinned living in dry arid climate, which actually makes me tan but dries my skin, and this lotion takes care of any dryness immediately and, for me, it really is not greasy, which is important to me because I can dress or go straight to bed right after putting it on</li>
            <li>I like it so much I ordered a bottle for my daughter.</li>
            <li>We both highly recommend hempz!</li>
            <li>really makes skin softer</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I rated it as 2 stars because the shipping was without delay and was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way to feel like you&#x27;ve applied too much lotion.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is very calming on your skin</li>
            <li>cant really review a lotion that much..</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon then at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Friends visiting my home have commented on how much they like it and where can they get some?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very citrusy but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it so much.</li>
            <li>Their lotions moisturize very well without being greasy</li>
            <li>Very emollient.  </li>
            <li>Unless you leave it at work and you work in a very conservative place.</li>
            <li>My whole family and wife&#x27;s family have all switched to this brand lotion.</li>
            <li>one coat lasts all day and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>SO much cheaper than buying it in the store.  </li>
            <li>I have tried it all and had yet to find a product that really moisturized my skin without giving me a really greasy result.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is considering the high quality!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I savored the trial size as much as I could, but obviously I would run out pretty quick.</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t stop being amazed at how soft my skin is!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been -10 consistently where I live in Minnesota.</li>
            <li>More moisturizing than the other products in the line.</li>
            <li>seriously its that good.</li>
            <li>I love it, i have dry skin, now after using this my skin is so soft and silky, is this my skin???</li>
            <li>Not just for sun worshippers but anybody who wants a very rich, fragrant lotion that smells way more expensive than it is.</li>
            <li>This will be our new, go-to lotion!  </li>
            <li>I love Hempz, but this one is a little watery and doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>sure can&#x27;t buy it in a store for what I paid, saved over half.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but its not super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>With all of that aside my main issue is that this cream contains silicone.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is light but works light a thick crime.</li>
            <li>Smelled super fruity compared to the same bottle bought in the salon, it was a put off.</li>
            <li>and my hands felt soft and smooth instantly.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing without feeling oily, also a lot cheaper than buying from a tanning salon, I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>Or maybe just their skin&#x27;s particular reaction.</li>
            <li>I use it every night after my hot hot showers and it keeps me moisturized well into the next day!</li>
            <li>It is a little strong of a smell at first</li>
            <li>I mean, it initially felt good but after an hour my skin was crying out for more!</li>
            <li>Familiar yet strange</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will be a forever buyer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the asian pear one for months, and I&#x27;m pretty generous using it!</li>
            <li>Luckily, with only a few days left in our last bottle, this product arrived in great condition.  </li>
            <li>It has far to much fragrance and is greasy and want to return it.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, fragrance is not to heavy</li>
            <li>I knew that I would be able to find it on Amazon for much less!  </li>
            <li>The other scents are just fine</li>
            <li>Of course like most hand care products, you need to reapply often especially in this dry, winter weather.</li>
            <li>and I have to squeeze out the lotion without a pump or transfer it to a new bottle.</li>
            <li>Live in Colorado, I need to start ordering gallons of it.</li>
            <li>Wish the company could get a new pump.</li>
            <li>I live in Fl.</li>
            <li>Manufacturer ought to be able to solve this problem, but no reason why you should be inconvenienced and have to dig out the last couple ounces using a spoon or whatever other device is on hand.</li>
            <li>Since using this my skin feels soft and hydrated hours after applying!  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion, unfortunately so does my entire family, lol.</li>
            <li>When I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s very dry, scaly hands (I believe this is caused by the constant washing in school with anti-bacterial soap, in combination with MN winter&#x27;s dry air) - and it worked like magic!  </li>
            <li>I read several reviews before ordering this lotion, so my expectations were very high.  </li>
            <li>Its no where near as moisturizing as the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skins soft.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels soooooo soft.  </li>
            <li>I work with food and money, so I was my hands thoroughly with really hot water all day long and can&#x27;t moisturize unless I&#x27;m on a break.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I saw that this is natural and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>I went so far as to try this on my face</li>
            <li>She really loves this stuff and was running low on it.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose but am getting used to it.</li>
            <li>I searched natural body lotion.</li>
            <li>There almost nothing natural about it.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and no longer cracking.</li>
            <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t pump the last inch or so which is kind of ridiculous and wasteful.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moist, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave that weird sticky residue on your skin!</li>
            <li>Took me about 4 months to get threw my first bottle, with me and my hubby using multiple times daily.</li>
            <li>I just wish they had a different smell other than this rich cotton candy scent.</li>
            <li>I would reccommend for anyone that has dry skin, if your skin is greasy apply a little bit this stuff works :)</li>
            <li>They make your skin feel so soft and really help dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, and this is the only lotion I use that won&#x27;t make me break out and still keeps skin soft!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve often found that I initially like a new lotion, and then don&#x27;t after a month or so - can&#x27;t tell you why.  </li>
            <li>It really does heal your dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my dry hands</li>
            <li>Out of all three of the different Hempz Moisturizers I have tried, this is my favorite as it is the least greasy of all.</li>
            <li>This is replacing the old empty bottle of Curel in my bathroom and even my sons have commented on how much they like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VS Love Spell to me anyway) and found it was at least $10 cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li>The Hempz products that I have used thus far, basically just the moisturizers, have not left me with the feeling that I am wearing a mask of oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li>use this when I get out of the shower and it makes me feel extra soft.</li>
            <li>It smells identical to victoria secret love spell..</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; normally have to stick with bland lotions.</li>
            <li>My hands and body retained their moisture much longer than other products I used.</li>
            <li>This stuff is thick and rich.</li>
            <li>cause I live in Nevada and we have perpetually dry weather and have to lotion often.</li>
            <li>It seems a little greasy when you first put it on</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend any person purchase this product and stop wasting their money on other lotions, body butters, etc.</li>
            <li>I got this because I have really dry hands and wanted something natural.  </li>
            <li>Big minus - lotion is &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; which makes it very light and thin.  </li>

            <li> Just picked it up at a mall beauty salon (paying about $20 for it) and thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, but 2/3rds of the way through the bottle</li>
            <li> The pump does not work effectively.</li>
            <li> Omg this stuff is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and feel.</li>
            <li> ok, its a good product, but</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on very lightly, while still moisturizing better than any others I&#x27;ve tried, and has a very nice scent as well (reminds me of Juicy).</li>
            <li> Smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Goes on nicely.</li>

            <li> This is the cure right here!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came super quickly and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I never thought that Hempz could make a better lotion than the original one, but this one is even better!!</li>

            <li> What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> The best part, it is a water-based moisturizer and does not leave a greasy film on your skin like other oil-based lotions, especially in hot, humid weather!  </li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> and I immediately fell in love with the smell and texture.</li>

            <li> Love the way it feels too.</li>
            <li> Soaks in nicely and leaves skin smooth, not sticky.</li>

            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> The coconut is My wife&#x27;s favorite and I like the hempz triple moisture.</li>

            <li> its such a great feeling!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> overall Hempz products are great!  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re expecting this one to be thicker or better in texture as in a cream of some sort, it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> Just barely more moisturizing than water.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this product, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> No drugstore brand lotion is better than Hempz products.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I Love it...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the ingredients are listed somewhere in there</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, great smell, really moisturizing -</li>
            <li> I rotate with the Citrus Blossom, which is also a favorite of mine, yummy citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand of lotion.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has a great smell and works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> LOVE this</li>
            <li> Like most women, I have an arsenal of lotions in every scent and consistency.</li>
            <li> Reluctantly, I tried the product and hours later was so impressed with the results I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> I know better now.</li>
            <li> Also this entire line of lotions lasts forever, which is totally awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am buying more.</li>
            <li> This is an okay lotion, I still enjoy their original better and my absolutely favorite from them is the &amp;#34;Hydrosilk&amp;#34; lotion ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> The original has the most amazing scent...</li>
            <li> This particular version is my favorite as it is the most moisturizing (great for after the pool) and the scent is not too flowery.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, good price, came fast with Prime :)</li>
            <li> This new scent body lotion is great.</li>
            <li> The best lotion I have use in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> But if your skin is dry, this is WONDERFUL regardless of the scent.</li>
            <li> This has been a perfect solution to my itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> love the light refreshing smell of lotion.  </li>
            <li> Has a great scent and leaves skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer, has a nice bubblegum smell but its not too present either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The triple moisture is light easy to apply and works into your skin better than most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy, has a beautiful fragrance, last for hours and very light.</li>
            <li> It makes my very dry skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> If Santa could repeat that surprise this Christmas, she would be delighted.&amp;#34; He even advised me to check Amazon, which I did - and was very pleasantly surprised at the great price.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product so far.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin touchably smooth and zero greasiness like most others do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the original scent better for a man</li>
            <li> Thought I was purchasing the original Hempz lotion but enjoy this too!  </li>
            <li> I put a little on and get it rubbed in real good and put more on.  </li>
            <li> just like their other lotion products, it is great!</li>
            <li> I love Hempz original lotion.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be considerably better than any other lotion, or the original Hempz lotion for that matter, but I&#x27;m not the best judge.</li>
            <li> Both shipments came VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and absorbers very quickly and leaves your skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to many months of my wife&#x27;s happiness (and soft feet).</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted, at a great price, FAST!</li>
            <li> Nice and silky feeling but super sweet smell, like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfectly fine</li>
            <li> I have used for long time and finally found at good price on amazon, very happy!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect for winter dry skin or summer freshly tanned either indoor or outdoor skin.</li>
            <li> this one is a fantastic winter hand creme</li>
            <li> But this just feels kind of yucky really.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product and</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, but need something stronger.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy the scent as well as the way it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a light lotion that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or built up.</li>
            <li> It is paraben -free.</li>
            <li> Actually wakes me up because it smells so great.</li>
            <li> Overall Great moisturizer without leaving an oily/greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this brand for years since I&#x27;ve only heard great things about it.</li>
            <li> a bargain for such a great product</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth all day...</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from my beautician and I was hooked.</li>
            <li> A light airy fragrance with no after effects when absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Such a great deal and</li>
            <li> Light, yet leaves you feeling moisturized without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Love the refreshing scent and the gentle moisturizing effect it has.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smell good.</li>
            <li> If you like normal hempz you will love this!</li>
            <li> Light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Both are amazing, I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this very very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I love their products and this is now my new favorite.</li>
            <li> second fav. smells good not too strong either</li>
            <li> Prefer original or pomegranate.</li>
            <li> I recommend the original</li>
            <li> so I ordered two bottles instead of the original &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; that I had intended.</li>
            <li> Otherwise worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the scent first of all.</li>
            <li> I also like the original</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it &amp; it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Not like the original at all.</li>
            <li> Will stick with the original.</li>
            <li> Love the Hempz line they really know what&#x27;s up!</li>
            <li> I have been using Hempz original lotion</li>
            <li> Thanks, Hempz! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product sooo much!</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry in the winter months and even though the Hempz original is a great lotion I thought I would try this one out.</li>
            <li> This is great for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> And I live in a dry climate, so this lotion is wonderful, light, and lightly scented so as not to offend, but still calm.</li>
            <li> So you can still perfume away for those special nights (or</li>
            <li> Super moisturizer with fresh scent!</li>
            <li> Very silky and smooth without be greasy!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the fresh, light scent.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion so much that I bought a 5 pack.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is that it does moisturize well.</li>
            <li> it keeps my face smooth and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Her granddaughter tried it and loved it as well, especially the packaging.</li>
            <li> I wish that it was more infused with aloe, but for the price and availability, I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li> Good for the winter season, especially for my lizard like scaly hands.</li>
            <li> the price is not bad on this.  </li>
            <li> super fast delivery, love this product.</li>
            <li> I am hoping to find other products from this same salon in Lexington, KY, as I am more than happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I was in a beauty store over the weekend and planned on purchasing the Hempz, but $25 is a little pricey for lotion for me even if it is good!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this particular kind.</li>
            <li> SO moisturizing and smells so fresh and clean and yummy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering and fades quickly, which I like.</li>
            <li> And, it does penetrate the skin quickly; however, it just didn&#x27;t work for me as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Hempz brand lotion and highly recommend this buy.</li>
            <li> We have been using the original moisturizer, it has a great scent that is not to harsh on my allergies.</li>
            <li> a lotion that claims to be triple strength, this is pretty light.  </li>
            <li> Great price too at Amazon, over 50% less than some stores.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers quickly and leaves a fresh pleasure smell..</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever made don&#x27;t need to look for a Nother brand put it on one time a day and it last all day long</li>
            <li> the smell is mild and soaks into your skin real fast.</li>
            <li> long lasting, perfect.</li>
            <li> I opted for the Prime &amp;#34;two day shipping&amp;#34; and I was quite pleased that the package arrived early Monday afternoon, just as promised!  </li>
            <li> Packed this for my vacation as well, and it was the perfect moisturizer following long days in the Caribbean sun!</li>
            <li> Then I saw that this one is &amp;#34;triple moisture&amp;#34; so I thought it&#x27;d be the best for me since I tend to have dry skin, especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find it for half the price of retail, but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a crisp, clean fragrance with undertones of watermelon and pear.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s more oil in this lotion than their older ones but they still absorb pretty well.</li>
            <li> Back had very dry scab spots and they are all gone now awesome</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much healthier, smooth, and the elasticity is even improved using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but I think it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> Only kind I use.</li>
            <li> Sampled some and found the scent I liked (triple moisture does smell similar</li>
            <li> It smells fresh.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely give out 5 stars for anything</li>
            <li> Overall a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Ruined a nice blouse because the oil just didn&#x27;t absorb in properly.</li>
            <li> Wow, so glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I have been able to find that sells it so cheap.</li>
            <li> favorite is vanilla plum, then original and citrus blossom tied for 2nd.&lt;br /&gt;Those are all the same moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Have worked in a tanning salon way too long not to love HEMPZ!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and live in the desert great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fast absorbed by your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since moved to natural products to combat my dry skin - shea butter, coconut oil, etc, and they&#x27;ve been great.</li>
            <li> I quickly noticed a difference in how soft and smooth my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li> I love HEMP products and now that I can purchase on Amazon for half the price, I am REALLY in love with it.  </li>
            <li> It was very silky, absorbed quickly</li>
            <li> Its a refreshing light to the touch with a clean, slight tropical smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is rather strong at first, but as the day goes on it becomes less potent.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Hempz and Amazon!</li>
            <li> I just recently ordered 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li> I think I like the regular Hempz better.</li>
            <li> The place that I ordered from sent exactly what they said they would.  </li>
            <li> I also love the deals ui get at any store i pay double, but never again!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, use it daily and like the scent and the non oily feel.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs leaving my skin feel soft and smooth not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I love it and have bought it several times through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fast ship!</li>
            <li> Feels really moisterizing!</li>
            <li> one of the first things listed is alcohol).</li>
            <li> Nice light scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Natural vegan product that is paraben free.</li>
            <li> I like the regular variety of Hempz much better.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz, it&#x27;s the only lotion I use.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Arrival was fast!</li>
            <li> Will be back for more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> and then actually feels like it is drying out the more that I use it.</li>
            <li> The bottle I got was thick without feeling like it clogged pores, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and has been great for nourishing my skin.</li>
            <li> The Hempz lotion INSTANTLY made them feel better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a avid review reader</li>
            <li> Plan to buy more products in the future.</li>
            <li> Hempz Triple Moisture Lotion promises to deliver extra nutrients to the skin through its unique combination of hydrating Yangu oil, anti-aging Apple Fruit extract and rich Cogon Grass extract.  </li>
            <li> Actually I think I like the others better.  </li>
            <li> Overall I still love my Hemptz lotions.</li>
            <li> This has tamed the bumps so much that they&#x27;re almost gone!</li>
            <li> Lotions these days have lots of different chemicals in them that we&#x27;d love to avoid.</li>
            <li> You will be amazed someone carefully took there time to come up with a smell that will knock the top off your lucky lady</li>
            <li> Rub it on after a shower, and my skin is soft all day!!!!</li>
            <li> thats how i feel WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> i love this lotion and with the dry winter we had it i amazing for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Most lotions only provide temporary relief but Hempz makes my skin feel healthy all day long.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought this lotion because I liked the smell when I tried it in the store, and it made my hands soft too.  </li>
            <li> I am already on my second bottle because I love this so much.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and hydrates your skin like no other.</li>
            <li> Have ordered multiple times as this is the lotion I have found that actually works and like most people, I have many, many bottles of every lotion known to man!!&lt;br /&gt;Did not care for the other Hempz scents</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it keeps my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well, smells amazing, and is gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> takes to long to soak in and my skin goes not look any better if feels like all I did was rub greece on my face</li>
            <li> I love the feel and scent of this lotion, lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Love this lotion ... very healing and gentle enough for the face!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay, although at 27 I&#x27;m not really trying to wear scents that were popular during my early teen years.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz for dry skin</li>
            <li> It makes your skin extremely soft and goes into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and never makes me feel sticky, just soft.</li>
            <li> This lotion have my skin feeling fresh, non-greasy, and very soft.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion on a whim as a Christmas 2013 gift for my 78 year old, super picky mom (very selective re: lotion aromas and absorption).</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have mature black skin, so maybe this lotion just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> If you scrub dry, you&#x27;ll strip your own natural oils and moisture).</li>
            <li> So for the price I believe some other products I have used provide as good if not better result, for a lower price; hence a better value than Hempz.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because I&#x27;m relatively light skinned living in dry arid climate, which actually makes me tan but dries my skin, and this lotion takes care of any dryness immediately and, for me, it really is not greasy, which is important to me because I can dress or go straight to bed right after putting it on</li>
            <li> I like it so much I ordered a bottle for my daughter.</li>
            <li> We both highly recommend hempz!</li>
            <li> really makes skin softer</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I rated it as 2 stars because the shipping was without delay and was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to feel like you&#x27;ve applied too much lotion.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is very calming on your skin</li>
            <li> cant really review a lotion that much..</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon then at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Friends visiting my home have commented on how much they like it and where can they get some?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very citrusy but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it so much.</li>
            <li> Their lotions moisturize very well without being greasy</li>
            <li> Very emollient.  </li>
            <li> Unless you leave it at work and you work in a very conservative place.</li>
            <li> My whole family and wife&#x27;s family have all switched to this brand lotion.</li>
            <li> one coat lasts all day and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> SO much cheaper than buying it in the store.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it all and had yet to find a product that really moisturized my skin without giving me a really greasy result.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is considering the high quality!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I savored the trial size as much as I could, but obviously I would run out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t stop being amazed at how soft my skin is!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been -10 consistently where I live in Minnesota.</li>
            <li> More moisturizing than the other products in the line.</li>
            <li> seriously its that good.</li>
            <li> I love it, i have dry skin, now after using this my skin is so soft and silky, is this my skin???</li>
            <li> Not just for sun worshippers but anybody who wants a very rich, fragrant lotion that smells way more expensive than it is.</li>
            <li> This will be our new, go-to lotion!  </li>
            <li> I love Hempz, but this one is a little watery and doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> sure can&#x27;t buy it in a store for what I paid, saved over half.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but its not super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> With all of that aside my main issue is that this cream contains silicone.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is light but works light a thick crime.</li>
            <li> Smelled super fruity compared to the same bottle bought in the salon, it was a put off.</li>
            <li> and my hands felt soft and smooth instantly.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing without feeling oily, also a lot cheaper than buying from a tanning salon, I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Or maybe just their skin&#x27;s particular reaction.</li>
            <li> I use it every night after my hot hot showers and it keeps me moisturized well into the next day!</li>
            <li> It is a little strong of a smell at first</li>
            <li> I mean, it initially felt good but after an hour my skin was crying out for more!</li>
            <li> Familiar yet strange</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will be a forever buyer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the asian pear one for months, and I&#x27;m pretty generous using it!</li>
            <li> Luckily, with only a few days left in our last bottle, this product arrived in great condition.  </li>
            <li> It has far to much fragrance and is greasy and want to return it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, fragrance is not to heavy</li>
            <li> I knew that I would be able to find it on Amazon for much less!  </li>
            <li> The other scents are just fine</li>
            <li> Of course like most hand care products, you need to reapply often especially in this dry, winter weather.</li>
            <li> and I have to squeeze out the lotion without a pump or transfer it to a new bottle.</li>
            <li> Live in Colorado, I need to start ordering gallons of it.</li>
            <li> Wish the company could get a new pump.</li>
            <li> I live in Fl.</li>
            <li> Manufacturer ought to be able to solve this problem, but no reason why you should be inconvenienced and have to dig out the last couple ounces using a spoon or whatever other device is on hand.</li>
            <li> Since using this my skin feels soft and hydrated hours after applying!  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, unfortunately so does my entire family, lol.</li>
            <li> When I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s very dry, scaly hands (I believe this is caused by the constant washing in school with anti-bacterial soap, in combination with MN winter&#x27;s dry air) - and it worked like magic!  </li>
            <li> I read several reviews before ordering this lotion, so my expectations were very high.  </li>
            <li> Its no where near as moisturizing as the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skins soft.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels soooooo soft.  </li>
            <li> I work with food and money, so I was my hands thoroughly with really hot water all day long and can&#x27;t moisturize unless I&#x27;m on a break.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I saw that this is natural and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> I went so far as to try this on my face</li>
            <li> She really loves this stuff and was running low on it.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose but am getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I searched natural body lotion.</li>
            <li> There almost nothing natural about it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and no longer cracking.</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t pump the last inch or so which is kind of ridiculous and wasteful.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave that weird sticky residue on your skin!</li>
            <li> Took me about 4 months to get threw my first bottle, with me and my hubby using multiple times daily.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had a different smell other than this rich cotton candy scent.</li>
            <li> I would reccommend for anyone that has dry skin, if your skin is greasy apply a little bit this stuff works :)</li>
            <li> They make your skin feel so soft and really help dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, and this is the only lotion I use that won&#x27;t make me break out and still keeps skin soft!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often found that I initially like a new lotion, and then don&#x27;t after a month or so - can&#x27;t tell you why.  </li>
            <li> It really does heal your dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my dry hands</li>
            <li> Out of all three of the different Hempz Moisturizers I have tried, this is my favorite as it is the least greasy of all.</li>
            <li> This is replacing the old empty bottle of Curel in my bathroom and even my sons have commented on how much they like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VS Love Spell to me anyway) and found it was at least $10 cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The Hempz products that I have used thus far, basically just the moisturizers, have not left me with the feeling that I am wearing a mask of oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li> use this when I get out of the shower and it makes me feel extra soft.</li>
            <li> It smells identical to victoria secret love spell..</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; normally have to stick with bland lotions.</li>
            <li> My hands and body retained their moisture much longer than other products I used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and rich.</li>
            <li> cause I live in Nevada and we have perpetually dry weather and have to lotion often.</li>
            <li> It seems a little greasy when you first put it on</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend any person purchase this product and stop wasting their money on other lotions, body butters, etc.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have really dry hands and wanted something natural.  </li>
            <li> Big minus - lotion is &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; which makes it very light and thin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using  Hempz original for the past year and a half or so.</li>
            <li> I may try other scents in the future just because I&#x27;m curious, but I find this one similar if not better than the original version.  </li>
            <li> Not sure which ingredient is responsible, but now I am left taking Benadryl and soaking in an oatmeal bath.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really strong and it makes my hands feel a little dirty if I put it on more than one time, which is what I usually do with lotion.  </li>
            <li> The next morning my skin was dry and while not ashy, there were noticeable signs of dryness (roughness and tiny lines) on my thighs and legs.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself is nice and thick but the smell is unbelievably yummy!!</li>
            <li> However, the smell didn&#x27;t last very long as some of the reviewers had stated.  </li>
            <li> Dish sanitizer used to constantly come in contact with my hands at work, causing them to be dry ALL the time.</li>
            <li> I also found the smell off-putting as it was really strong and fake smelling.</li>
            <li> I live in a small, rural community</li>
            <li> I am definitely a die hard user of this particular product.</li>
            <li> but it soaks in after a few minutes and leaves my scaly, lizard-like hands silky soft.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at a friends house &amp; ordered it not 5 minutes later (ordered on Saturday evening, post office is closed</li>
            <li> I use this lotion after a long day in the sun.</li>
            <li> product not only took away the pain, but it also removed the rough callouses from my hands in under a week</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t linger too long though.</li>
            <li> I will continue purchasing this lotion for as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> I will buy it as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> It stays on and keeps skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> It has helped my dry skin through the Winter.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and often, lotions burn.  </li>
            <li> I have horribly dry skin all over in the Winter months.</li>
            <li> My husband has alligator dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin and this freezing winter weather is not helping.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry hands and dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> and my skin gets so dry.  </li>
            <li> I have really, really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really dry skin at all, just thought I&#x27;d try it..</li>
            <li> My body went from being incredibly dry to hydrated.</li>
            <li> I would say for the ones who ended up with dryer skin and other such things, it was probably just the bottles you got (possibly watered down, etc.)</li>
            <li> I found it to be very expensive at the salon I use, as well as most others.  </li>
            <li> secret but a more subtle version.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compare this lotion to any other lotion I have used in the past, it is absolutely my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got for my mother in law because she is on a lot of medications for a chronic disease and has very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Thick and keeps me soft all day long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin lotion that soaks in super-quickly, leaving behind only a strong fruity fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is a very thin consistency but absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Just need a little but, and it last me for about 3 months</li>
            <li> I live in AZ and there is some serious dryness happening here.</li>
            <li> I used a tanning bed a few weeks prior to vacation</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time as expected</li>
            <li> The scent is very comparable to Lovespell by Victoria&#x27;s Secret</li>
            <li> I had the green lotion of theirs, asian pear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not as moisturizing as I expected.</li>
            <li> This makes it less dry for a while.</li>
            <li> Live in Houston and in the winter we lose some of our humidity with the cold front, keeps my hands looking and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> With a lot of other moisturizers I got the feeling that my pores were being blocked.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other type of lotion and now with this newer version of the Hempz lotion</li>
            <li> My biggest concerns about putting other stuff on and feeling like Edward scissor hands because I didn&#x27;t want to touch anything with my greasy hands days are over.</li>
            <li> I had seen other hemp lotions, but went with this</li>
            <li> I kept the product due to the fact</li>
            <li> will be repurchasing this and other lotions from Hempz.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found this product actually dried out my skin rather than moisturized (not surprised as when I looked at the ingredients</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy like a lot of other lotions.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like other lotions do sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this lotion five stars because my husband (who works in construction and has very rough skin) and I have used it for over two months now</li>
            <li> So dry all year round.</li>
            <li> Light texture, keeps me moisturized, and smells halfway decent, unlike some of the other Hempz that smell awful.</li>
            <li> I have those stupid red bumps on the back of my arms and overall really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have to go hunt it down when I want to use it.</li>
            <li> The bottle says pure herbal extracts but that&#x27;s added to a bunch of other crap like dimethicone, which is a widely used silicone that actually dries your skin out.  </li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon for less</li>
            <li> but I tend to like less scent.</li>
            <li> And I gotta tell as a black woman to never having to worry about being &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; ever again..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price that retailers charge for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually half the price it costs in stores.</li>
            <li> I have these all over my house in Colorado as the air here is so dry, it is hard to keep your hands or face moisturized.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shower and apply directly to dry skin, its not so bad, but for ultimate effectiveness, apply immediately after toweling off(pat dry, don&#x27;t scrub dry by the way.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could take this to work but its a little inappropriate for my work place.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has a really bad problem with dry skin, and this has been the only lotion that actually works for his hands.</li>
            <li> The scent is similar to Victoria&#x27;s Secret &amp;#34;Love Spell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Would like a heavy - duty version for wintertime.</li>
            <li> So I just keep it by the sink and use it as an everyday lotion till its gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the need for the heavy scent.</li>
            <li> use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My dried winter skin loves it and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Half the price on Amazon.com than the massage store in town!</li>
            <li> Not as thick as their other scents.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve found other lotions that can help, but all are thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer I have been using for the past few years.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin for me!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this big bottle for boyfriend, who suffers from very dry skin</li>
            <li> This lotion is creamy and does not burn or hurt when applied, even when my skin is cracked and raw.  </li>
            <li> Its almost impossible to put too much on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I usually put lotion on after my shower and an hour or so</li>
            <li> Smells unbelievable</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what the &amp;#34;Triple Moisture&amp;#34; is all about</li>
            <li> But then, I found the lotion to be ineffective for my skin during the winter months when it&#x27;s drier than usual.  </li>
            <li> I noticed I was getting a weird skin condition on the back of my arms.</li>
            <li> The smell is hard to describe, almost like an apple-sweet tart smell.  </li>
            <li> How hard it is to at least not put dyes in you lotion?</li>
            <li> if I just got a bad batch or what, but I will not waste the money again to find out.</li>
            <li> The name sucks but who cares?</li>
            <li> Texture is too thick for the dispenser.</li>
            <li> Also, with other moisturizers, some quite expensive, I would start to sweat immediately after application.  </li>
            <li> (I have a minor head cold so</li>
            <li> It has been a must have this cold dry winter.</li>
            <li> a little thinner formula than expected, slightly disappointed by this.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that the pump broke after about 2 weeks :(</li>
            <li> lotion was not sealed and was all over box waste of money I threw it away!!!</li>
            <li> it the &amp;#34;real product&amp;#34;...just at a much less expensive price!  </li>
            <li> Someone asked me if I was wearing the Victory Secret perfume when I used this.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived with shrink wrapped, thin plastic around the bottle, just like from the manufacturer (I have seen shipments in the salons, and I am assuming that these are from the manufacturer as well...), and</li>
            <li> but the pump was broken off when I received it.</li>
            <li> The tip of the dispenser was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> After a little bit, it&#x27;s impossible to pump the cream out.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed in the quality of hemp and amount with other &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; ??</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this because I was looking forward to using this product further.</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive, bc</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost difficult</li>
            <li> I have weird skin, where it gets bumpy when I use lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells like fake chemicals…because that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li> This downright STINKS.  </li>
            <li> I realize that&#x27;s my bad.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I hate getting into the bed feeling sticky from the lotion I put on after the shower, and this one absorbs so well and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> but I also don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> Totally HATE it.</li>
            <li> The point is my hands are in god awful shape.</li>
            <li> It is horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this lotion. I know that Hempz has a good reputation but I have never used their products until now. This lotion is soft and has a wonderful smell. I like it so much I ordered a bottle for my daughter.</li>
            <li> If you like normal hempz you will love this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion on a whim as a Christmas 2013 gift for my 78 year old, super picky mom (very selective re: lotion aromas and absorption). Just picked it up at a mall beauty salon (paying about $20 for it) and thought it smelled nice. I didn&#x27;t give it a second thought following the holidays, until my dad sent me an e-mail yesterday. A quote: &amp;#34;Your mother has just been lamenting that she&#x27;s run out of the Hempz Triple Moisture Herbal Whipped Body Creme... She loves it - never had anything like it. If Santa could repeat that surprise this Christmas, she would be delighted.&amp;#34; He even advised me to check Amazon, which I did - and was very pleasantly surprised at the great price. Thanks, Hempz and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth very light and smells great</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The scent is similar to Victoria&#x27;s Secret &amp;#34;Love Spell&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not overpowering and fades quickly, which I like. It seems a little greasy when you first put it on but it soaks in after a few minutes and leaves my scaly, lizard-like hands silky soft. I use it before bed and once or twice throughout the day.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the drugstore brands again.</li>
            <li> Great smell and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> i liked it ok, i like the original better!</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion! Preserves your tan if you have one. Smells like love spell from Victoria secret but a more subtle version. I just love it ... Also great in vanilla plum but triple moisture is great for winter. I love cause I live in Nevada and we have perpetually dry weather and have to lotion often.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this lotion because I liked the smell when I tried it in the store, and it made my hands soft too.  When I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s very dry, scaly hands (I believe this is caused by the constant washing in school with anti-bacterial soap, in combination with MN winter&#x27;s dry air) - and it worked like magic!  We&#x27;ve tried everything but nothing seems to soften her hands but this worked and the result was immediate.  This will be our new, go-to lotion!  It is not greasy at all and absorbs immediately.  The smell is hard to describe, almost like an apple-sweet tart smell.  Not perfumey at all.  Very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. I would certainly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I prefer the original scent better for a man</li>
            <li> This product is more a lotion than a cream. Has a very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend who can never find this lotion anywhere in California, so since I&#x27;m not going back to Colorado for a while, I ordered this for her. It came in mint condition, not leakage, no scratches, so I am happy with it. (P.S the blue one is the best) the monster is for size reference.</li>
            <li> Thought I was purchasing the original Hempz lotion but enjoy this too!  The original has the most amazing scent...this one is a fantastic winter hand creme</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!! Only kind I use.</li>
            <li> love this very very moisturizing</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! I&#x27;ve used the Hempz orig. lotion for years and love that as well. But this stuff is amazing for the skin. The scent is very nice also, but I do like the orig. scent a bit more and wish they would make that more like this stuff. Someone asked me if I was wearing the Victory Secret perfume when I used this. I&#x27;ve never smelled that scent, so couldn&#x27;t tell you if it was just her opinion or what. That might give you an idea of this scent? But if your skin is dry, this is WONDERFUL regardless of the scent.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have really dry hands and wanted something natural.  This stuff is just okay.  The smell is really strong and it makes my hands feel a little dirty if I put it on more than one time, which is what I usually do with lotion.  I put a little on and get it rubbed in real good and put more on.  But this just feels kind of yucky really.  With all of that aside my main issue is that this cream contains silicone.  The bottle says pure herbal extracts but that&#x27;s added to a bunch of other crap like dimethicone, which is a widely used silicone that actually dries your skin out.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as their other scents. Kinda thinner and watery like Lubriderm; smells to me like bubble gum. Prefer original or pomegranate.</li>
            <li> My with love this body cream</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, but 2/3rds of the way through the bottle the pump stopped working. Texture is too thick for the dispenser. Manufacturer ought to be able to solve this problem, but no reason why you should be inconvenienced and have to dig out the last couple ounces using a spoon or whatever other device is on hand. Come on, Hempz, you should have picked up on this problem by now.</li>
            <li> This is lotion is some of the best and the price is amazing...sure can&#x27;t buy it in a store for what I paid, saved over half. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have these all over my house in Colorado as the air here is so dry, it is hard to keep your hands or face moisturized. Out of all three of the different Hempz Moisturizers I have tried, this is my favorite as it is the least greasy of all. I use this on my face and hand constantly. I would recommend any of the Hempz Moisturizer, but this is my very favorite.</li>
            <li> The cream is excellent, but the bottle that it comes in is not constructed well.  After a little bit, it&#x27;s impossible to pump the cream out.  You have to open the bottle and start shaking the lotion out.  This is my second bottle and I am having the same problem.  The pump does not work effectively.</li>
            <li> The best lotion on todays market</li>
            <li> Omg this stuff is the absolute best! Not only has it help improve my stretch marks, which I was only using it for daily moisture in mind, but it has improved my over all skin health! Took me about 4 months to get threw my first bottle, with me and my hubby using multiple times daily. We both highly recommend hempz! We have been using the original moisturizer, it has a great scent that is not to harsh on my allergies.</li>
            <li> really makes skin softer</li>
            <li> Love this lotion ... very healing and gentle enough for the face!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I love Hempz, but this one is a little watery and doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly. I recommend the original</li>
            <li> More moisturizing than the other products in the line. Soaks in and pleasant scent! Would buy again. Would like a heavy - duty version for wintertime.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this lotion and I love it! I use it all over when I get out of the shower. She was buying at the place where she goes to the tanning bed.  I found it on Amazon for less so I bought 3 bottles; 2 for her and 1 for me. Then I used it on my husband&#x27;s back for itching. He said it worked better than the Cetaphil that he has been using for years so we decided to order more for us. I just recently ordered 4 more bottles. Both shipments came VERY quickly. I knew I would like the lotion and I am completely satisfied with with the shipping time.</li>
            <li> just like their other lotion products, it is great!</li>
            <li> second fav. smells good not too strong either</li>
            <li> OMG This lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> BEST SMELLING LOTION I HAVE EVER PURCHASED! I always get a plethora of compliments when I wear this and it feels so good after the shower/tanning bed!! It really works.</li>
            <li> Hempz Triple Moisturizer is a wonderful body cream.  It has helped my dry skin through the Winter.  The one thing I would like the manufacturer to change would be the pump which stops working when there is still 1-2 inches left on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Very silky and smooth without be greasy!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and this is the lowest price around!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and often, lotions burn.  This lotion is creamy and does not burn or hurt when applied, even when my skin is cracked and raw.  I love this!</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry skin all over in the Winter months. I have tried multiple brands of lotions to help with this, however, nothing seemed to help. I decided to try out this moisturizer and it works great! Rub it on after a shower, and my skin is soft all day!!!! No more dry skin for me!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is good.  Nice fragrance and feel. However the product is whipped.  So for the price I believe some other products I have used provide as good if not better result, for a lower price; hence a better value than Hempz.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well without making my skin greasy or break out. My boyfriend loves the fresh, light scent. What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the Hempz lotion.This is the first time I have tried this particular kind. I like it ok, its a good product, but I think I like the regular Hempz better.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz for dry skin</li>
            <li> The Hempz Triple Moisturizer is awesome!  It really makes my skin soft and smooth.  The scent is amazing!  The best part, it is a water-based moisturizer and does not leave a greasy film on your skin like other oil-based lotions, especially in hot, humid weather!  With a lot of other moisturizers I got the feeling that my pores were being blocked.  The Hempz products that I have used thus far, basically just the moisturizers, have not left me with the feeling that I am wearing a mask of oil on my skin.  Also, with other moisturizers, some quite expensive, I would start to sweat immediately after application.  This has not happened with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was introduced to this product while tanning. I found it to be very expensive at the salon I use, as well as most others.  I knew that I would be able to find it on Amazon for much less!  The place that I ordered from sent exactly what they said they would.  The bottle arrived with shrink wrapped, thin plastic around the bottle, just like from the manufacturer (I have seen shipments in the salons, and I am assuming that these are from the manufacturer as well...), and it the &amp;#34;real product&amp;#34;...just at a much less expensive price!  I opted for the Prime &amp;#34;two day shipping&amp;#34; and I was quite pleased that the package arrived early Monday afternoon, just as promised!  I am hoping to find other products from this same salon in Lexington, KY, as I am more than happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love it!! What more can I say?</li>
            <li> but the pump was broken off when I received it.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me a trial size from a local spa and I immediately fell in love with the smell and texture. I savored the trial size as much as I could, but obviously I would run out pretty quick. I ordered this with the same expectations regarding the smell (which is to die for in the trial size), but when I received this size the smell wasn&#x27;t the same AT ALL. It&#x27;s almost like a smell of body odor and not at all appealing. I am very disappointed with this because I was looking forward to using this product further. I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a bad batch or what, but I will not waste the money again to find out. I rated it as 2 stars because the shipping was without delay and was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is nice,fragrant and feels great. The problem I have with 2 of these ordered is the spout does not work or turn to release product. The reason I am only giving 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I like the Hempz products but not to fond of the smell on this one.  My husband likes it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at a friends house &amp; ordered it not 5 minutes later (ordered on Saturday evening, post office is closed Sundays, Monday was a holiday, and arrived on Wednesday). I have very sensitive skin &amp; normally have to stick with bland lotions. This lotion goes on very lightly, while still moisturizing better than any others I&#x27;ve tried, and has a very nice scent as well (reminds me of Juicy). There&#x27;s no way to feel like you&#x27;ve applied too much lotion. Can&#x27;t wait to try more Hempz products!</li>
            <li> Its no where near as moisturizing as the reviews I read. (This is just a personal experience) My husband has alligator dry skin in the winter and I purchased this (after reading the reviews) hoping it would help. It works ok, but its not super moisturizing. Smells fantastic, but need something stronger. So I just keep it by the sink and use it as an everyday lotion till its gone. I wont repurchase it.</li>
            <li> AWESOME......great product smells REALLY NICE.  I buy and re-buy!!!</li>
            <li> Have purchased over and over again! Best lotion on the market. Highly recommend and will be a forever buyer. Hempz!!!! It goes on smooth and hydrates your skin like no other.</li>
            <li> Luxuriant lotion and moisturises quite well.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It feels like silk! The smell is wonderful as well. My skin feels great after using this.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion and with the dry winter we had it i amazing for dry skin. I also love the deals ui get at any store i pay double, but never again!!!</li>
            <li> The absolute best lotion around.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great. No oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I will use.  I hope they never take it off the market.  Great moisturizer, not greasy, great scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing and incredible, it&#x27;s everything I was hoping it&#x27;d be. It works great and rubs on evenly and keeps your skin feeling moisterized and not to mention the incredible smell I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have. I love it I&#x27;ll always buy this brand.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this stuff and I use it all the time. I wish I could take this to work but its a little inappropriate for my work place.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion so much that I bought a 5 pack. My review of that reflects my opinion on this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this lotion, it&#x27;s moisturizing, smells refreshing, doesn&#x27;t break me out and the ingredients are wonderful. However, the pump needs to be reworked. Even before reaching 1/2 a bottle, each pump stops working, refuses to suck up lotion and I have to squeeze out the lotion without a pump or transfer it to a new bottle.</li>
            <li> This lotion is light but works light a thick crime. It moisturizers quickly and leaves a fresh pleasure smell.. My hands and body retained their moisture much longer than other products I used.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin and this freezing winter weather is not helping.  This lotion is amazing!  I usually put lotion on after my shower and an hour or so later I feel like I can watch my skin shrivel up. Since using this my skin feels soft and hydrated hours after applying!  Smells nice.  Isn&#x27;t greasy or gloppy.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This has been a great product so far.  I thoroughly enjoy the scent as well as the way it leaves my skin.  I don&#x27;t use any other type of lotion and now with this newer version of the Hempz lotion I don&#x27;t plan on it.  I may try other scents in the future just because I&#x27;m curious, but I find this one similar if not better than the original version.  If you want to use a great lotion purchase this!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry, cracked heels.  Works wonders on dry hands and dry winter skin.  Smells great.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> Live in Colorado, I need to start ordering gallons of it. So dry all year round. This is the perfect for winter dry skin or summer freshly tanned either indoor or outdoor skin. It is a must in my beauty regime daily.</li>
            <li> super yummy smelling &amp; a good moisturizer to boot!! (imagine that!!! both in one??)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and works great on my psoriasis</li>
            <li> Nice product pleased! I have very dry skin and live in the desert great product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this product, use it daily and like the scent and the non oily feel.  The pump doesn&#x27;t pump the last inch or so which is kind of ridiculous and wasteful.  Wish the company could get a new pump.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this lotion and it is GREAT.  It makes your skin extremely soft and goes into your skin quickly.  Not sticky like some lotions.</li>
            <li> Smelled super fruity compared to the same bottle bought in the salon, it was a put off.</li>
            <li> love the light refreshing smell of lotion.  will buy again... I like the way it softens my skin... I have gotten compliments from others on the smell of lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a light lotion that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or built up. The scent of this is intoxicating. Love it!</li>
            <li> THE BEST LOTION EVER; THANK YOU HEMPZ FOR MAKING THIS ONE. I WIL DEF BUY MORE OF THIS PRODUCT. MY HANDS FEEL SO MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li> I thought all lotions were greasy, until i tried this stuff. Its almost impossible to put too much on. It coats evenly, doesn&#x27;t smell overwhelming, and it WORKS. My biggest concerns about putting other stuff on and feeling like Edward scissor hands because I didn&#x27;t want to touch anything with my greasy hands days are over. Steering wheels, cell screens and door knobs everywhere are rejoicing. seriously its that good. As for the price, Ulta is selling this for $25, so i think this a great deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this product, which is the newest one by Hempz. It is paraben -free. The smell of grapefruit/peach is so fruity that it gave me a headache. The only good thing about this product is that it does moisturize well. I don&#x27;t understand the need for the heavy scent. Then, to add insult to injury, the smell still lingers after several handwashes..Yuck!!</li>
            <li> It works great after showering and my skin doesnt feel itchy from drying and during sweat when i workout.  Doesnt feel oily and i LOVE the smell...its like a refreshing smell.  Doesnt feel oily at all.  Actually wakes me up because it smells so great. Will purchase again when I am getting low.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. And I got it in record shipping time. It&#x27;s the best in my opinion in the Hempz line up of creams</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Smells great and feels great. It absorbs leaving my skin feel soft and smooth not greasy at all. I have used for long time and finally found at good price on amazon, very happy!</li>
            <li> One of my favs!!!  Smells unbelievable</li>
            <li> Best product in the entire universe!</li>
            <li> So delightful! It is very calming on your skin and you just feel hydrated. I use this lotion after a long day in the sun. It is a little strong of a smell at first but then it weakens.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. I love it and have bought it several times through Amazon. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer out there. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I am already on my second bottle because I love this so much. It feels so great and does wonders for your skin. I had seen other hemp lotions, but went with this and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, it smells amazing and it works? cant really review a lotion that much.. good price, a  lot cheaper than in the stores</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, unfortunately so does my entire family, lol. I have to go hunt it down when I want to use it. Goes on nicely. Not greasy feeling. Leaves my skins soft. Much cheaper on Amazon then at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer, has a nice bubblegum smell but its not too present either.&lt;br /&gt;I use this when I get out of the shower and it makes me feel extra soft. Not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner, but the top was broken off and some of the lotion had leaked out! I kept the product due to the fact i had another bottle of the same product and will use the pump from it.</li>
            <li> Love it, fash shipping, smells and feels great</li>
            <li> I love all of the Hempz lotions, and this one is delightful.  Love the smell and it keeps my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> This is an okay lotion, I still enjoy their original better and my absolutely favorite from them is the &amp;#34;Hydrosilk&amp;#34; lotion ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> Fast ship! Item as described!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product I received is definitely authentic. I was in a beauty store over the weekend and planned on purchasing the Hempz, but $25 is a little pricey for lotion for me even if it is good! Sampled some and found the scent I liked (triple moisture does smell similar VS Love Spell to me anyway) and found it was at least $10 cheaper on Amazon! Received today and it was sealed...looks, smells, and feels great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; (white) Hempz, and tried this one just for a change... it&#x27;s so much silkier and smells AMAZING!!  A MUST.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer , have used the original also.  Love all Hempz products.  Great scents, very light, and especially on Amazon, the best prices.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love Hempz lotion and this one is awesome too!  They make your skin feel so soft and really help dry skin.  This one smells fruity with peach and grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li> I used a sample at a Hairdresser&#x27;s place of business. It was very silky, absorbed quickly and my hands felt soft and smooth instantly. Of course like most hand care products, you need to reapply often especially in this dry, winter weather. I live in a small, rural community so I needed to find an on-line source. I compared prices and was pleased with the price on Amazon so I ordered two bottles instead of the original &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; that I had intended. Friends visiting my home have commented on how much they like it and where can they get some?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Hempz lotion. Light texture, keeps me moisturized, and smells halfway decent, unlike some of the other Hempz that smell awful.</li>
            <li> This is my all time faveorite lotion it is soooooo perfect it deeply morsturizes without and oily feel and smells awesome even for the guys!!!!</li>
            <li> I live in Fl. and my skin gets so dry.  With Hempz it makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> excellent product would buy again</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion with a great smell. It smells fresh. It has been a must have this cold dry winter. It really does heal your dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Lotion smells really good! Feels really moisterizing! The pump on mine is broke though. It doesn&#x27;t pump correctly for some reason. Otherwise worth it!</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell! Light, clean scent. Love the way it feels too. Soaks in nicely and leaves skin smooth, not sticky. Huge fan of hempz! Great price too at Amazon, over 50% less than some stores. Will continue to purchase this lotion.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife and she loves it, cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li> I love the scent first of all. It&#x27;s very citrusy but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I like how this lotion isn&#x27;t greasy at all and I feel like I could apply layers on layers and never feel gross.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely made my skin softer and helped keep the dryness away this winter season.&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing this and other lotions from Hempz.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare this lotion to any other lotion I have used in the past, it is absolutely my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive, bc I use it so much. I hate getting into the bed feeling sticky from the lotion I put on after the shower, and this one absorbs so well and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. My skin looks so much healthier, smooth, and the elasticity is even improved using this product. Definitely a keeper. I just wish they had a different smell other than this rich cotton candy scent.</li>
            <li> I found this product actually dried out my skin rather than moisturized (not surprised as when I looked at the ingredients one of the first things listed is alcohol). I&#x27;ve since moved to natural products to combat my dry skin - shea butter, coconut oil, etc, and they&#x27;ve been great. I also found the smell off-putting as it was really strong and fake smelling.</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase this after reading reviews here... it did not disappoint! I used a tanning bed a few weeks prior to vacation and this worked great both after tanning and after showering. I quickly noticed a difference in how soft and smooth my skin looked and felt. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave a sticky residue, but leaves my skin feeling hydrated. Packed this for my vacation as well, and it was the perfect moisturizer following long days in the Caribbean sun! The smell is light and amazing. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cream, very light and non-perfumish. It&#x27;s light, but I think it moisturizes very well. I have gotten several bottles of this over time.  I also like the original</li>
            <li> Nice light scent that is not overwhelming. Overall Great moisturizer without leaving an oily/greasy residue. Natural vegan product that is paraben free. However, it does have phenoxyethanol listed as an ingredient.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, good price, came fast with Prime :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hempz brand for years. Their lotions moisturize very well without being greasy and I don&#x27;t have to reapply for the rest of the day.  This particular version is my favorite as it is the most moisturizing (great for after the pool) and the scent is not too flowery. The other scents are just fine but I tend to like less scent.</li>
            <li> Its a great price and awesome product.</li>
            <li> Meh. I like the regular variety of Hempz much better. This is supposed to be triple moisture, but I found that it isn&#x27;t even close to being as good as the Original Hempz.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Absorbs into the skin easily and lasts all day!  Great scent too.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz, it&#x27;s the only lotion I use.  This is great for extremely dry skin.  I got for my mother in law because she is on a lot of medications for a chronic disease and has very dry skin.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Very emollient.  I keep it by my bed and apply it to my feet each night.</li>
            <li> Best smelling hempz yet. You will be amazed someone carefully took there time to come up with a smell that will knock the top off your lucky lady</li>
            <li> Moisturizing without being greasy and it has a pleasant light scent. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Unless you leave it at work and you work in a very conservative place.</li>
            <li> The best lotion I have use in a very long time.  Love, love, love the scent!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the fact that its&#x27; not greasy and keeps my skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful! Makes my skin touchably smooth and zero greasiness like most others do.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a crisp, clean fragrance with undertones of watermelon and pear. (I have a minor head cold so don&#x27;t take my word set in stone if you&#x27;re iffy on the aroma.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just take my advice and buy this stuff NOW! You won&#x27;t regret it &amp; it&#x27;s worth every penny! This is replacing the old empty bottle of Curel in my bathroom and even my sons have commented on how much they like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more soon to make sure I never run out. ;)</li>
            <li> This is sooooo great.  Your skin feels soooooo soft.  I think it is the best ever.  You should try it</li>
            <li> I goto the gym a lot and destroyed my hands from the bars there.&lt;br /&gt;This product not only took away the pain, but it also removed the rough callouses from my hands in under a week</li>
            <li> Luv this!! Hemp is by.far the best lotion out there!</li>
            <li> it always arrives on time and it&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer. incredibly hydrating and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing without feeling oily, also a lot cheaper than buying from a tanning salon, I will definitely purchase this again. It smells good too!</li>
            <li> I love Hempz original lotion.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell nice and is waaaayyyyy to lightweight.  Not like the original at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this moisturizer!  It is not greasy, has a beautiful fragrance, last for hours and very light.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, fragrance is not to heavy and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> the price is not bad on this.  Live in Houston and in the winter we lose some of our humidity with the cold front, keeps my hands looking and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This lotion fits the climate we have. It is non greasy and absorbers very quickly and leaves your skin feeling hydrated. I highly recommend this product. It was delivered on time as expected</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used! It keeps my skin moist, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave that weird sticky residue on your skin! I am definitely a die hard user of this particular product.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and aroma of this lotion. Arrival was fast!</li>
            <li> This is a must have in my household. This product goes on easy, absorbs quickly, and smell wonderful. I gave this as part of my Christmas gifts to all the women in my family.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best lotion I have ever purchased and you can&#x27;t beat the price. It smells like heaven in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used up one bottle myself and not on my second, So Great stuff</li>
            <li> great stuff and 10 bucks cheaper than the store</li>
            <li> Super moisturizer with fresh scent!</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this!!!  Great product and a great price.  Will be back for more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> The original smell better- and although the Hempz moisturizers start out working great, it seems like my skin gets used to it and then actually feels like it is drying out the more that I use it.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well, smells amazing, and is gentle enough for my sensitive skin. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger all day, which I like. It also doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the newest lotion from HEMPZ. I love their products and this is now my new favorite. Definitely worth it. It keeps your skin so soft and smells wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Love the refreshing scent and the gentle moisturizing effect it has.</li>
            <li> It smells identical to victoria secret love spell.. but the formula is a tad on the greasy side.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is vanilla plum, then original and citrus blossom tied for 2nd.&lt;br /&gt;Those are all the same moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Just didn&#x27;t like the formula.. and the scent isn&#x27;t my fave.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, my favorite Hempz lotion scent.  Buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! My boyfriend has a really bad problem with dry skin, and this has been the only lotion that actually works for his hands. The bottle I got was thick without feeling like it clogged pores, wasn&#x27;t greasy, and has been great for nourishing my skin. Better than anything I&#x27;ve used as well. I would say for the ones who ended up with dryer skin and other such things, it was probably just the bottles you got (possibly watered down, etc.) Or maybe just their skin&#x27;s particular reaction. I have had zero problems with mine and can&#x27;t give it more praise.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I work with food and money, so I was my hands thoroughly with really hot water all day long and can&#x27;t moisturize unless I&#x27;m on a break. In the winter they swell, crack and bleed. At home I&#x27;m the only one who does dishes. The point is my hands are in god awful shape. The Hempz lotion INSTANTLY made them feel better. They looked better. The cracking stopped. It&#x27;s almost magical.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve found other lotions that can help, but all are thick and greasy. They wouldn&#x27;t absorb all the way, ever. This stuff: maybe a minute and it&#x27;s all in and done. I don&#x27;t open the bathroom door with a towel because my hands are too greasy to do it.&lt;br /&gt;AND... It smells like tropical punch. Doesn&#x27;t linger too long though. So you can still perfume away for those special nights (or every day, I don&#x27;t judge).&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product, and the first lotion I have ever truly loved!</li>
            <li> Mmm mmm. Smells so good. Feels great, not greasy. Love it!</li>
            <li> Product was on time and great moisturizer</li>
            <li> I read several reviews before ordering this lotion, so my expectations were very high.  It does have a nice smell and consistency.  However, the smell didn&#x27;t last very long as some of the reviewers had stated.  And, it does penetrate the skin quickly; however, it just didn&#x27;t work for me as a moisturizer.  I used the lotion at night after showering and going to bed.  The next morning my skin was dry and while not ashy, there were noticeable signs of dryness (roughness and tiny lines) on my thighs and legs.  To be fair, I have mature black skin, so maybe this lotion just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Sorry, but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft. Love this. I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> What an EXCELLENT and good smelling product!</li>
            <li> Hempz is always a great buy, but none of them moisturize as well as this one. Dish sanitizer used to constantly come in contact with my hands at work, causing them to be dry ALL the time. Even got a rash from it once. This is the cure right here!!!</li>
            <li> Could not handle the smell enough to use this. Will stick with the original.</li>
            <li> The triple moisture is light easy to apply and works into your skin better than most moisturizers.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This lotion have my skin feeling fresh, non-greasy, and very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this brand for years since I&#x27;ve only heard great things about it. Then I saw that this one is &amp;#34;triple moisture&amp;#34; so I thought it&#x27;d be the best for me since I tend to have dry skin, especially during the winter.  I don&#x27;t love it but I also don&#x27;t hate it. It&#x27;s certainly not as moisturizing as I expected. The scent is very comparable to Lovespell by Victoria&#x27;s Secret so it&#x27;s okay, although at 27 I&#x27;m not really trying to wear scents that were popular during my early teen years. It&#x27;s almost difficult it wear a perfume the day I use this since the scent can be somewhat overpowering. I was happy to find it for half the price of retail, but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion to leave my skin soft,and non greasy.whether it is a triple moisturizer compared to regular hempz,I don&#x27;t know.Good product</li>
            <li> Love the Hempz line they really know what&#x27;s up! All the smells are juicy and yummy I loved the coconut watermelon one this summer! Triple moister is great but did break out my arms!!</li>
            <li> This is 19 dollars cheaper than a beauty brands store!!!&lt;br /&gt;Such a bargain for such a great product</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you give it a try. I rarely give out 5 stars for anything and I&#x27;m a avid review reader and I try to review everything I buy on here. My whole family and wife&#x27;s family have all switched to this brand lotion. The coconut is My wife&#x27;s favorite and I like the hempz triple moisture.</li>
            <li> It has far to much fragrance and is greasy and want to return it.</li>
            <li> fabulous scent and great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! It smells amazing and it works so well...one coat lasts all day and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job. my only complaint is that the pump broke after about 2 weeks :(</li>
            <li> lotion was not sealed and was all over box waste of money I threw it away!!!</li>
            <li> smells great and i love its silky feeling and this size is perfect</li>
            <li> Great product, works much better than many lotions you can buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I can use it because I am celiac,  Plan to buy more products in the future.</li>
            <li> Have worked in a tanning salon way too long not to love HEMPZ! Thick and keeps me soft all day long!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and this scent, have already re-ordered.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this lotion until I tried it. This stuff is thick and rich. My dried winter skin loves it and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> I have really, really dry skin. This makes it less dry for a while. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be considerably better than any other lotion, or the original Hempz lotion for that matter, but I&#x27;m not the best judge. Smells nice, not to strong, doesn&#x27;t feel overly oily. Overall a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> Ok..  more watering that I like</li>
            <li> I have never worn a lotion where I have had so many people tell me how good I smelled. The lotion itself is nice and thick but the smell is unbelievably yummy!! I have had to buy several bottles at a time just to ensure I dont run out and to share with friends and family! I will continue purchasing this lotion for as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hempz original lotion and it&#x27;s great!! When I seen Hempz was making a triple moisturizing lotion I was excited!! My skin gets really dry in the winter months and even though the Hempz original is a great lotion I thought I would try this one out. I&#x27;m soo glad I did!! I never thought that Hempz could make a better lotion than the original one, but this one is even better!! The smell of this lotion is awesome and can be used for men or women!! Thank you again Hempz for continually to make the BEST lotion on the planet!!!</li>
            <li> Nice light scent and great moisturizer. I love all the Hempz lotions. I do find this one comparable to the regular Hempz lotion so I&#x27;m not sure what the &amp;#34;Triple Moisture&amp;#34; is all about but I will buy this product again. I am some what of a lotion junkie and Hempz is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Water based moisturizer and the oil can come off onto silk clothing or sheer material. Was disappointed in the quality of hemp and amount with other &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; ?? Effects. Ruined a nice blouse because the oil just didn&#x27;t absorb in properly. Wish they would create an aloe based lotion with hemp and grape seed.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. Best lotion out there.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. I have weird skin, where it gets bumpy when I use lotion. I saw that this is natural and decided to buy it. It didn&#x27;t make my skin irritated, greasy, bumpy... nothing; plus its smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smell good. Just need a little but, and it last me for about 3 months</li>
            <li> I live in AZ and there is some serious dryness happening here. This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Love the scent, so tropical and yummy!</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I had hoped but smells great!</li>
            <li> Great,,clean smelling.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and the price is great.  Will be ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> Does anyone else notice it smells like Victoria Secrets&#x27; &amp;#34;Love Spell&amp;#34; a bit? Sooo not complaining! Its so light and pleasant! I use it every night after my hot hot showers and it keeps me moisturized well into the next day! And I gotta tell as a black woman to never having to worry about being &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; ever again..its such a great feeling! Thanks, Hempz! :) x</li>
            <li> I used this pleasantly fragrant lotion on my legs and arms, then broke out within 24 hours!  Not sure which ingredient is responsible, but now I am left taking Benadryl and soaking in an oatmeal bath.  I have never had an allergic reaction to anything topical before...troubling!</li>
            <li> Love this product sooo much! smells yummy!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Arrived within specified  time frame</li>
            <li> Hempz Triple Moisture Lotion promises to deliver extra nutrients to the skin through its unique combination of hydrating Yangu oil, anti-aging Apple Fruit extract and rich Cogon Grass extract.  Heck, I&#x27;ve never even seen Cogongrass before in skincare, and my hasty Google search reveals only that it&#x27;s an invasive species in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a lotion that claims to be triple strength, this is pretty light.  It&#x27;s a thin lotion that soaks in super-quickly, leaving behind only a strong fruity fragrance.  On the plus side, hooray!  You aren&#x27;t left feeling greasy.  But then, I found the lotion to be ineffective for my skin during the winter months when it&#x27;s drier than usual.  I mean, it initially felt good but after an hour my skin was crying out for more!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been searching for this product locally with no luck.  Luckily, with only a few days left in our last bottle, this product arrived in great condition.  I am looking forward to many months of my wife&#x27;s happiness (and soft feet).</li>
            <li> Nothing different than the regular Hemptz lotions.  Actually I think I like the others better.  This one says extra moisture, when in fact it wasn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t have really dry skin at all, just thought I&#x27;d try it.. overall Hempz products are great!  But if you&#x27;re expecting this one to be thicker or better in texture as in a cream of some sort, it&#x27;s not.  Its regular. Overall I still love my Hemptz lotions.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d good condition.  Pluses are beautiful color and pleasant fragrance.  Big minus - lotion is &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; which makes it very light and thin.  Just barely more moisturizing than water.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is incredible!!!! Non-greasy, lightweight and has a really nice scent. I have those stupid red bumps on the back of my arms and overall really sensitive skin. This has tamed the bumps so much that they&#x27;re almost gone! My skin is smooth all day... even my husband noticed a difference in the way I feel. I went so far as to try this on my face (I break out to EVERYTHING).... it keeps my face smooth and fresh all day. I cannot say enough about this product, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter use it as a moisturizer. I use it after shaving. We all love it! I will buy it as long as they keep making it. Its a refreshing light to the touch with a clean, slight tropical smell.</li>
            <li> No drugstore brand lotion is better than Hempz products. And it lasts foreverrrrrr because of the big bottle. Not just for sun worshippers but anybody who wants a very rich, fragrant lotion that smells way more expensive than it is. I go to spas all the time and it smells equal to $$$$ top-of-the-line, exclusive spa brands used at the Ritz or Four Seasons. The name sucks but who cares? Anyway, I knocked off one star because the pump broke after my sis used it one time. Amazon did give us a credit immediately.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever made don&#x27;t need to look for a Nother brand put it on one time a day and it last all day long it&#x27;s perfectly fine</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. It stays on and keeps skin moisturized all day long. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> a little thinner formula than expected, slightly disappointed by this. smells great. great price.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from my beautician and I was hooked. I got this big bottle for boyfriend, who suffers from very dry skin and I have to say he loves it! and so do I! it is pleasantly scented and not greasy at all. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> everyone in the house loves it</li>
            <li> A really nice skin care product. A light airy fragrance with no after effects when absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Then my wife tried it (big mistake) because I have to buy her one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps Her granddaughter tried it and loved it as well, especially the packaging.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer yet , and I am always trying all the best moisturizing products I can find. My all time favorite.</li>
            <li> Half the price on Amazon.com than the massage store in town! I love this lotion!! And I live in a dry climate, so this lotion is wonderful, light, and lightly scented so as not to offend, but still calm.</li>
            <li> Thank God Amazon has this product for cheaper! I got this for my friend and she absolutely loved it! She really loves this stuff and was running low on it.</li>
            <li> Lotion is very nice. Not too fond of fragrance. I have a sensitive nose but am getting used to it. Works very well on my dry hands</li>
            <li> This new scent body lotion is great. I bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. The smell is really nice and fruity. There&#x27;s more oil in this lotion than their older ones but they still absorb pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is just absolutely amazing lotion!!! I Love it... No Greasy build up and just amazing!! My husband can&#x27;t stop being amazed at how soft my skin is!!! I will be ordering more soon!!!</li>
            <li> takes to long to soak in and my skin goes not look any better if feels like all I did was rub greece on my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle Landry</li>
            <li> Smells like fake chemicals…because that&#x27;s what it is. I searched natural body lotion. This is one of the things that came up. I realize that&#x27;s my bad. The Amazon search isn&#x27;t perfect and I&#x27;m sure the ingredients are listed somewhere in there but I didn&#x27;t see it. There almost nothing natural about it. I don&#x27;t like it at all. How hard it is to at least not put dyes in you lotion? Hemp oil is great. Just don&#x27;t dye it blue.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Hempz brand lotion and highly recommend this buy. Made from hemp seed oil, it&#x27;s a GREAT choice! Lotions these days have lots of different chemicals in them that we&#x27;d love to avoid. This lotion has a good scent to it, not so strong.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, great smell, really moisturizing - Everyone loves it!</li>
            <li> Have ordered multiple times as this is the lotion I have found that actually works and like most people, I have many, many bottles of every lotion known to man!!&lt;br /&gt;Did not care for the other Hempz scents and I have them all, but this one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy like a lot of other lotions. It smells amazing and it&#x27;s half the price that retailers charge for it. It also doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like other lotions do sometimes.</li>
            <li> Great lotion at a great price.</li>
            <li> Familiar yet strange fragrance - don&#x27;t know what it is, but I like it.  .  It takes a moment to absorb in, so try an give yourself about 30 between shower/application and dressing, otherwise your clothes stick to you.  If you don&#x27;t shower and apply directly to dry skin, its not so bad, but for ultimate effectiveness, apply immediately after toweling off(pat dry, don&#x27;t scrub dry by the way.  If you scrub dry, you&#x27;ll strip your own natural oils and moisture). I wish that it was more infused with aloe, but for the price and availability, I can&#x27;t really complain.  I rotate with the Citrus Blossom, which is also a favorite of mine, yummy citrus scent.  Make me happy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer smells heavenly.  It is a very thin consistency but absorbs into the skin quickly.  It is not as hydrating as thicker lotions I have, but it is nice for during the day.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Has a great scent and leaves skin feeling very soft.  Great for massaging and foot rubs.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of lotion.  it smells great and it&#x27;s not greasy. It&#x27;s very fast absorbed by your skin</li>
            <li> SO much cheaper than buying it in the store.  Quick shipping and good quality.  I love HEMP products and now that I can purchase on Amazon for half the price, I am REALLY in love with it.  This lotion has a great smell and works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product unisex smells great feels great on the skin lasts all day I would reccommend for anyone that has dry skin, if your skin is greasy apply a little bit this stuff works :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this lotion five stars because my husband (who works in construction and has very rough skin) and I have used it for over two months now and it&#x27;s still a great moisturizer without being greasy.  I&#x27;ve often found that I initially like a new lotion, and then don&#x27;t after a month or so - can&#x27;t tell you why.  I love this stuff because I&#x27;m relatively light skinned living in dry arid climate, which actually makes me tan but dries my skin, and this lotion takes care of any dryness immediately and, for me, it really is not greasy, which is important to me because I can dress or go straight to bed right after putting it on and it doesn&#x27;t leave stains.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and scent of this lotion, lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Great Scent and Great Moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve been using  Hempz original for the past year and a half or so. Was running low so went to look for it again and also found the Triple moisture brand. Decided to purchase it and I&#x27;m glad I did. Does a great job of getting rid of the flakes, keeps the skin soft, and smells great! This is now my go to moisturizer, my wife loves it as well. 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Great product! Really good for dry skin and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> super fast delivery, love this product. the smell is mild and soaks into your skin real fast. i would purchase this triple moisture lotion again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love it, i have dry skin, now after using this my skin is so soft and silky, is this my skin??? thats how i feel WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came super quickly and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Wow, so glad I purchased this product. Like most women, I have an arsenal of lotions in every scent and consistency. I have tried it all and had yet to find a product that really moisturized my skin without giving me a really greasy result. My hands were cracking from dryness when a salon owner gave me a sample packet of this product insisting I try it. Reluctantly, I tried the product and hours later was so impressed with the results I purchased this product. My body went from being incredibly dry to hydrated. My skin is so soft and no longer cracking. I have used this product for weeks now, applying on my entire body after I shower. I would highly recommend any person purchase this product and stop wasting their money on other lotions, body butters, etc. I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is considering the high quality!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. Amazon is the only place I have been able to find that sells it so cheap. It&#x27;s usually half the price it costs in stores. It makes my very dry skin feel wonderful. It absorbs quickly and never makes me feel sticky, just soft. The smell is nice too. It really is the best. I also love that it&#x27;s vegan!</li>
            <li> Cheapness prevailed.  I wanted the hemp but not the price, so I chose this lower priced option. Waste of money. The triple moisture is additional water, whipped with the oils and emulsified.  I&#x27;ll give it two stars because it&#x27;s just what it says, albeit misleading, not a lie.  I know better now.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted, at a great price, FAST! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop putting this on lol. I had the green lotion of theirs, asian pear I believe, loved it but wanted to keep one lotion bottle at work so I got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is ADDICTING, I am semi-obsessed. Fruity/flowery and I am NOT a fragrance person, so I consider it an accomplishment that it exceeded my picky standards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing, leaves my hands feeling like a baby&#x27;s butt. As they say. Also this entire line of lotions lasts forever, which is totally awesome. I&#x27;ve had the asian pear one for months, and I&#x27;m pretty generous using it! Both are amazing, I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forewarning: Put this on your legs and you might feel yourself up. Lol! :p</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful and smells great!!</li>
            <li> The tip of the dispenser was broken when I received it. It still works though. The lotion smells wonderful and is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I keep reordering this. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The original HEMPZ smelled incredible.  This downright STINKS.  It is horrible.  WHY did they change the scent?  Totally HATE it.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Very light, great scent, long lasting, perfect.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and this is priced way below what Ulta sells it for. Such a great deal and this is one of the best moisturizers around! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Back had very dry scab spots and they are all gone now awesome</li>
            <li> Perfect face lotion. Light, yet leaves you feeling moisturized without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  My skin is sensitive, and this is the only lotion I use that won&#x27;t make me break out and still keeps skin soft!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Best moisturizer and protection ever.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer I have been using for the past few years. I noticed I was getting a weird skin condition on the back of my arms. Sort of like a scattered rash. I began to apply this daily on it and it went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I shower and apply it after my body feels sooo Moisturized. Even friends and family that have let use it all say its amazing!! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Smells so good! Good for the winter season, especially for my lizard like scaly hands.</li>
            <li> My skin stays moist all day and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice and silky feeling but super sweet smell, like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. It&#x27;s been -10 consistently where I live in Minnesota. This has been a perfect solution to my itchy dry skin. Most lotions only provide temporary relief but Hempz makes my skin feel healthy all day long. The smell is unbelievably wonderful. I am buying more.</li>
            <li> The scent is rather strong at first, but as the day goes on it becomes less potent. Totally hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my favorite!!! SO moisturizing and smells so fresh and clean and yummy. I&#x27;ve bought hempz lotions over and over again.</li>
            <li> the smell of this makes me cringe.</li>
