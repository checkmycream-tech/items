            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>I Love it !</li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful even though it doesn&#x27;t look anything like the original&#x27;s E.T. bottle.</li>
            <li>So I bought it - comes in a nice leather pouch</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>love love love it</li>
            <li>LOVE....</li>
            <li>The packaging with the leather pouch is appealing.</li>
            <li>The Fragrance of Leather sounded interesting</li>
            <li>this is definitely a heavy winter fragrance, it would be awesome to wear it in the summer.</li>
            <li>The bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li>original  Angel..</li>
            <li>I am gaga over the original, otherwise I&#x27;d be super bummed with this.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best smell i love alien</li>
            <li>so I purchased it right away.  </li>
            <li>The juice inside is the perfect blend of classic Alien with a slightly salty, suede-like touch that tempers the sweet jasmine and modulates the ambery drydown in more of a savory direction - all in all &amp;#</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the original Alien, so when I seen there were some variations available</li>
            <li>Item is shipped exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I will be back to buy more.  </li>
            <li>after showering y can smell&lt;br /&gt;The leather but also the Parfum&lt;br /&gt;It smells better and last longer&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>The bottom of the bottle forms a silver star which reminded me of Angel, and there&#x27;s a little leather nametag on the bottle which is super cute.  </li>
            <li>Milder than the original Alien, which many would prefer.</li>
            <li>- the bottle is really neat too.</li>
            <li>I was really expecting to like it.  </li>
            <li>Love this one because of the musky leather touch,  the regular Alien not add much this one is way better</li>
            <li>The leather is very subtle; I have to think about it to really notice it, but it is a great scent nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>however, the fragrance is just ok and on me it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>Other perfumes like &amp;#34;out of this world&amp;#34; are made with chemicals and whale fat but not this stuff each bottle is filled with freshly squeezed extra terrestrials ...</li>
            <li>I wanted it to remind me of opening a brand new leather purse or walking into a leather store in the mall.  </li>
            <li>I love Alien.</li>
            <li>I love jasmine, amber and musk - basically of what Alien is composed.</li>
            <li>34;butching-up&amp;#34; Alien in a definitely more unisex direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one bottle should last you your lifetime, one spray will last all day very strong be careful.</li>
            <li>The jasmine is so natural, but a tad feminine, but the woody ambroxan-tinged musky drydown is quite unisex.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got a beard and am quite masculine in appearance</li>
            <li>TO COME TO THERE SENCES AND PUT IT BACK TO A REASONABLE PRICE</li>
            <li>added, I wondered if i could be the solution to my wearing of Alien in a more public setting.</li>
            <li>Smells waaaayyy too close to the original Alien...</li>
            <li>you, it&#x27;s still quite powerful - only a couple of small spritzes to the chest is required to last all day.</li>
            <li>Smells like alien but a little less sweet and a little more musty w a hint of leather.</li>

            <li> However, all I smell is the original Alien with the menthol turned down a tad.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY PROBLEM IT DOUBLED IN PRICE FOR THE SAME SMALL SIZE</li>
            <li> - so wearing it has always been a bit of an issue for me, so I typically wear it around the house only or while doing yard work - hardly a reason to wear fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, as soon as I read about this flanker with a natural leather note</li>
            <li> Receive lots of compliments and very curious people ask what it is.</li>
            <li> a nice variation on the Alien theme, a little less on the floral and a little heavier on the dark base notes.  </li>
            <li> Brownie points for me and cost less than the mall....</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure the diffrence in the this to regular alien</li>
            <li> a little  sharper  than  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed, though, because I REALLY wanted to smell some leather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also made out of 100% alien creatures and intergalactic space travelers..  </li>
            <li> No more information needed!</li>
            <li> ILL WAIT FOR THE SELLER THAT IS SELLING NOW</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this one.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance. Definitely smells of leather and somewhat of a wood fire. Receive lots of compliments and very curious people ask what it is. one bottle should last you your lifetime, one spray will last all day very strong be careful. this is definitely a heavy winter fragrance, it would be awesome to wear it in the summer.</li>
            <li> a nice variation on the Alien theme, a little less on the floral and a little heavier on the dark base notes.  Milder than the original Alien, which many would prefer.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, she loved it!! Brownie points for me and cost less than the mall.... PLUS I didn&#x27;t have to go to the Mall!</li>
            <li> Love this one because of the musky leather touch,  the regular Alien not add much this one is way better</li>
            <li> Love!  Smells  a little  sharper  than  original  Angel..good  buy!</li>
            <li> This perfume is absolutely breathtaking ! I receive compliments all the time. Then comes the question, what is the name of your perfume?  Not sharing that !  Item is shipped exactly as described. I will be back to buy more.  I Love it !</li>
            <li> I love Alien. I love jasmine, amber and musk - basically of what Alien is composed. The jasmine is so natural, but a tad feminine, but the woody ambroxan-tinged musky drydown is quite unisex.  Now I&#x27;m a guy - and I&#x27;ve got a beard and am quite masculine in appearance - so wearing it has always been a bit of an issue for me, so I typically wear it around the house only or while doing yard work - hardly a reason to wear fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, as soon as I read about this flanker with a natural leather note added, I wondered if i could be the solution to my wearing of Alien in a more public setting. So I bought it - comes in a nice leather pouch - the bottle is really neat too. The juice inside is the perfect blend of classic Alien with a slightly salty, suede-like touch that tempers the sweet jasmine and modulates the ambery drydown in more of a savory direction - all in all &amp;#34;butching-up&amp;#34; Alien in a definitely more unisex direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, it&#x27;s still quite powerful - only a couple of small spritzes to the chest is required to last all day. This is quite the overlooked gem - give it a try!</li>
            <li> I was asked about this perfume when I wore it.  The leather is very subtle; I have to think about it to really notice it, but it is a great scent nonetheless.  The bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she says she gets lots of compliments for it!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best smell i love alien i&#x27;m not sure the diffrence in the this to regular alien i love them both.i wish the bottles were bigger i just could swim in it,love love love it THE ONLY PROBLEM IT DOUBLED IN PRICE FOR THE SAME SMALL SIZE I GUESS ILL WAIT FOR THE SELLER THAT IS SELLING NOW TO COME TO THERE SENCES AND PUT IT BACK TO A REASONABLE PRICE</li>
            <li> This was a chance buy what a gift&lt;br /&gt;This smells so good wears for two&lt;br /&gt;Days after showering y can smell&lt;br /&gt;The leather but also the Parfum&lt;br /&gt;It smells better and last longer&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping will buy again</li>
            <li> LOVE....LOVE.....LOVE! No more information needed! The packaging with the leather pouch is appealing. The smell is over the top amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is great. It&#x27;s also made out of 100% alien creatures and intergalactic space travelers..  Other perfumes like &amp;#34;out of this world&amp;#34; are made with chemicals and whale fat but not this stuff each bottle is filled with freshly squeezed extra terrestrials ...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the original Alien, so when I seen there were some variations available I just had to try one. The Fragrance of Leather sounded interesting so I purchased it right away.  The bottle is beautiful even though it doesn&#x27;t look anything like the original&#x27;s E.T. bottle. The bottom of the bottle forms a silver star which reminded me of Angel, and there&#x27;s a little leather nametag on the bottle which is super cute.  I was a little disappointed, though, because I REALLY wanted to smell some leather. I wanted it to remind me of opening a brand new leather purse or walking into a leather store in the mall.  However, all I smell is the original Alien with the menthol turned down a tad. Good thing I am gaga over the original, otherwise I&#x27;d be super bummed with this.</li>
            <li> Smells like alien but a little less sweet and a little more musty w a hint of leather. Lasted over 6 hours w just 3 sprays. Great price!</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this one. Smells waaaayyy too close to the original Alien... Doesn&#x27;t smell of leather at all. Will be giving away as a gift 😕</li>
            <li> with all the raves for this parfume I was really expecting to like it.  however, the fragrance is just ok and on me it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of complements when I wear it.</li>
