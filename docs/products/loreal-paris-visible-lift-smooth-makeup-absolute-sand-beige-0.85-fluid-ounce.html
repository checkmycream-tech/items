            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product forever..Great price</li>
            <li> Love this makeup.  It has medium coverage but doesn&#x27;t ever look caky on your skin. It wears all day and doesn&#x27;t  settle into wrinkles. For me, the sand beige matches perfectly. I rated it only 4 stars because the brush, which I hoped would be useful but is pretty much useless. I just crank the makeup through the brush and apply it with my finger tips.</li>
            <li> Perfect foundation, Easy aplication.</li>
            <li> This makeup is beautiful &amp; so easy to apply. I have always used expensive makeup like Lanc√¥me, but this is just lovely &amp; soooo less pricey. I use it niw everyday!!  Love it.

            <li> LOreal Make up is great for &amp;#34;older women&amp;#34; skin. It is not an expensive product for us to use to still look good there are so many vendors pushing &amp;#34;expensive products for baby boomer make-up. The product came in on time and cannot help but rate this product a 5  thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this make up!! Have been using Loreal sand beige for years! Loreal has made 2 different products that I truly loved one was a makeup compact with sponge and they discontinued it. Then I found this one used it for a couple of years and now it&#x27;s discontinued again I can&#x27;t find it anywhere except my favourite place to buy stuff I can&#x27;t find in my stores AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Had to get this base on Amazon because it is impossible to find in the stores right now- I certainly hope they are not discontinuing this! The brush fell apart right as the product was running out- and I wish I could get to those last few drops at the end of the bottle, but great product.</li>
            <li> omg thanks to amazon i just recently start using L&#x27;Oreal switch from mac and i bought first my L&#x27;Oreal paris visible lift smooth makeup from walgreens than i went back to same walgreens there say oh there discontinued carry that product i check every place no one had it thanks to amazon i have it now .....&amp;#60;3</li>

            <li> The makeup is very moisturizing and has adequate coverage.  The color is fine, but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the brush.  I still need to use my fingers or a sponge, so what&#x27; she point of the brush?</li>
            <li> Love this makeup! It&#x27;s my favorite and they stopped selling it at the stores so am extremely exciting to see you sell it here, thank you!! :)</li>

            <li> Oh my GOD, this is perfect. It goes on so nice and it last. My face glows. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  Especially like the convenience of the brush.  Have gotten used to how the makeup comes through the brush after you turn the top.  The first few times I had enough makeup coming through for more than one application.&lt;br /&gt;I have a real concern with the brush, as much as I like it. You cannot wash it but are advised to dry wipe it clean.  Bacteria is a problem on makeup brushes and you should regularly clean your brushes with soap and water.  I have written L&#x27;Oreal about my concern and will update this review when I get a reply.  In the meantime, I am using a baby wipe to clean the brush, allowing it to dry thoroughly before replacing the cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked L&#x27;Oreal make-up but this one is just a tad disappointing.  I guess I expected too much.  Will use it but not sure if I&#x27;m going to buy again.  I am 53 years old, caucasian with combination (mostly oily) sking with the lines started to settle in :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> Loved this Makeup it does not make my face oily !!!!!!! I bought one for my mom as well and she completely fell in love with it also!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it when my friend told me that this was the best &amp;#34;low-priced&amp;#34; makeup on the market. After buying it, I am a believer. It provides full coverage with a great applicator. I would recommend not turning it too much, because you&#x27;ll waste the product. It also gives your skin this &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; look which is just fabulous! I love this stuff.</li>
