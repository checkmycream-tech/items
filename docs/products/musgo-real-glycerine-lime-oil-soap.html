    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was mildly impressed with this one.  </li>
            <li>, I think you&#x27;ll agree that this is excellent prep for safety razor shaving and even multi-blade shaving.</li>
            <li>Excellent PRE-shave soap!</li>
            <li>For those days I&#x27;m out for the perfect shave!</li>
            <li>One of the best glycerine soaps I&#x27;ve ever had....</li>
            <li>Perfect as a pre shave soap.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for him for Christmas and it makes a great stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li>Wonderful soap which I use as a pre-shave.  </li>
            <li>I always say if you want to be the best, learn from the best.</li>
            <li>If two World Championships don&#x27;t qualify you as one of the best, I don&#x27;</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I find I can get a good shave using Musgo alone (heresy, I know!).  </li>
            <li>This is great for pre-shave cleaning.</li>
            <li>Does a great job preparing your face for a shave.</li>

            <li>Great pre-shave product.  </li>
            <li>Great soap,came to me ahead of scheduled time.</li>
            <li>This is great soap for your Face or body.</li>
            <li>This is a very popular pre-shave soap, but it did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really good.</li>
            <li>Make shaving smoother and smells good.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be a good soap to shave with using my DE Razor but not the case.</li>
            <li>I like the soap for what it is and smells good.</li>
            <li>Which I did not return, because it is really good.</li>
            <li>The lime scent is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Great lather and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing, wonderful fresh citrus scent, along with a refreshing tingle.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling soap for the bath.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>Glycerine  soap is a nice soap for washing your face.</li>
            <li>However, I would have really liked to have received the lime soap.</li>
            <li>Not to strong and will prep your face for a good shave.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best pre shave prep soap I have come across.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s preformance as a pre-shave prep is pretty good, but not as good as say proraso or even mychelle.      </li>
            <li>Great Product, very fast delivery</li>
            <li>First off, this soap has a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>The soap creates a gliding effect when shaving, resulting in a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The product description states that this product is \\&quot;ideal for sensitive skin\\&quot;; I must disagree with that statement.</li>
            <li>Beyond love it....</li>
            <li>Really love this pre-shave soap.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had read many forum posts, posts on Reddit, and even read \\&quot;Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving\\&quot; book.</li>
            <li>It was mostly unanimous in voicing that the MRGLO soap is one of the top pre-shave soaps.</li>
            <li>I love the soap I received,  but I did not get what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Lots of clean lather and a nice scent.</li>
            <li>great fragrance, lathers well, leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>The soap is very moisturizing and prepares the beard for a good close shave.  </li>
            <li>The smell is appealing &amp; leaves me feeling clean &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, large soap bar should last quite a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and it has a terrific smell and great lather.</li>
            <li>I find it humorous that so many of these men rave about all the money they&#x27;re saving because they no longer buy the lad test and greatest car trudge while at the same time they&#x27;re shelling out hundreds and sometimes even thousands of dollar so wet shaving products</li>
            <li>The bottom line is don&#x27;t purchase this for DE Shaving because you think it will soften your beard because it will not do any more than a hot shower.</li>
            <li>Have that this is good for general face washing.</li>
            <li>I ordered Lime soap, and instead received the original.</li>
            <li>The scent is somewhat pleasant on one day, and then smells like pine-sol the next day.  </li>
            <li>Seems from the size of the puck it will last up to a year, maybe even longer with good storage.</li>
            <li>As such, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>This does not produce the lather necessary for a good shave in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Aside from a great fresh smell, it lubricates unbelievably and helps my DE safety razor glide so much better.</li>
            <li>I rotate this with Lucky Tiger Face wash.  </li>
            <li>However, there are several people who love it, so your experience may be much better than mine.</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice, light, elegant lime scent (which I&#x27;d love more of), in a big, thick soap puck.  </li>
            <li>It really dried my face out and the smell isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find that this really does soften and protect my face and beard in my preparation for a delightful wet shave.</li>
            <li>This stuff will last longer but the cream is more readily available in drugstores.</li>
            <li>Caution to those who have sensitive skin and need a more moisturizer soap.</li>
            <li>Some rinse it off before lathering, I put it on right after the shower, and then generate my lather, and leave the Musgo on when I apply the lather, which I work in well with the brush to rehydrate.</li>
            <li>sown with an equally huge marketing machine trying t make everyone think they need every new!</li>
            <li>I use it before every shave, right after my hot shower.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and husband enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li>However, in recent years it&#x27;s become a huge industry of I!</li>
            <li>bar of Dial glycerin soap has more aroma and about the same lather.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time in my Edwin Jagger DE razor with an Astra blade and AOS Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Suddenly people are spending big bucks on a plethora OD razors and silver badger tipped brushes, nor to mention special bowls, stands, and every kind of paraphernalia under the sun.</li>
            <li>The large sized bar lasts for quite a while..</li>
            <li>Essentially glycerin soaps make such great pre-shaves because they deliver hot water and glycerin and a touch of oil to your beard just prior to lathering.  </li>
            <li>Basically this soap is fine but any time you take a shower your facial hair will soften and if not then nothing is going to do the</li>
            <li>This soap is unusual in that it really softens your wiskers before shaving.</li>
            <li>You will really notice a difference of the quality of your shave.</li>
            <li>This product is as described, a real glycerine lime oil soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be interesting to see how this got to be so widely recommended.  </li>
            <li>The Musgo Real Glycerine Lime Oil Soap (MRGLO) has been my go-</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t produce much lather themselves, and thus not much hair loft, which is one of the key effects of a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>I bought this after it was highly recommended in the book &amp;#34;Gourmet Shaving&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Smells ok, heavily lime scented</li>
            <li>Too many days using this in a row makes my skin somewhat raw.  </li>
            <li>&quot;; those that can tolerate it will probably find it to be a great pre-shave treatment, but for those with sensitive skin, I&#x27;d advise to be wary.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, either.</li>
            <li>&gt; the two do very much the same job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use a small amount on a wash rag and wash your face before shaving(Then using your regular shaving soap shave) with it and the razor will glide across your face and the razor will cut through your wishkers like a knife through warm butter.</li>
            <li>Considering the cost and how long a bar (or puck) of this soap will last, I think it will cut right in as being one of the regular use products that make wet shaving worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Leaves you clean and refreshed, plus it won&#x27;t dry your skin, just the opposite.</li>
            <li>Decided to buy a puck and try it myself, and wow, I can see why they rave about it.</li>
            <li>My skin seemed far to sensitive for this product, so your mileage may vary with this product.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth a shot, but personally I won&#x27;t be running back anytime soon.</li>
            <li>a soap, it does dry your skin a little between passes.&lt;br /&gt;-Besides being more efficient than Proraso psc&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li>my face super slick for my shave.&lt;br /&gt;-First time</li>
            <li>I have found using this soap and allowing to remain on your face for at least a couple of minutes prior to shaving can significantly improve your shave.</li>
            <li>Yes, I know you should shower first and let the steam soften your beard; but if you are like me with a fairly heavy beard and like to shower after your shave..this is your product.</li>

            <li> AND EXPENSIVE, product under the sun in order to give themselves the low cistern shave they were originally attracted to.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but totally fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few soaps I&#x27;ve used that actually clear out my pores after using.  </li>
            <li> The nooks written on wet shaving must be subsidized by all these different companies to make people think they must have all these things.</li>
            <li> They both cost roughly the same approx $10.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the face either.</li>
            <li> The lime is natural but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side but fantastic as a pre-shave soap.  </li>
            <li> Wet shaving is supposed to be a money saver.</li>
            <li> to ever since I started wet shaving.</li>

            <li> This is great for pre-shave cleaning.</li>
            <li> Redditors on r/Wicked_edge are always raving about this stuff. They call it \\&quot;MRGLO\\&quot;. Decided to buy a puck and try it myself, and wow, I can see why they rave about it. Just rubbing this over your face and splashing off the excess soap pre-shave gave me one of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. Seems from the size of the puck it will last up to a year, maybe even longer with good storage. Definitely recommend this for your shaving repertoire.</li>
            <li> I was mildly impressed with this one.  The scent is somewhat pleasant on one day, and then smells like pine-sol the next day.  It&#x27;s preformance as a pre-shave prep is pretty good, but not as good as say proraso or even mychelle.      For the price, it&#x27;s worth a shot, but personally I won&#x27;t be running back anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. While I am in the shower, I lather up and put this on. Once I am out and shaving, this as a base for my shaving cream makes for extremely smooth, irritation free shaving.</li>
            <li> I have found using this soap and allowing to remain on your face for at least a couple of minutes prior to shaving can significantly improve your shave. Yes, I know you should shower first and let the steam soften your beard; but if you are like me with a fairly heavy beard and like to shower after your shave..this is your product. The large sized bar lasts for quite a while.. give it try, I think you&#x27;ll agree that this is excellent prep for safety razor shaving and even multi-blade shaving.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best pre shave prep soap I have come across. Aside from a great fresh smell, it lubricates unbelievably and helps my DE safety razor glide so much better. Excellent product, large soap bar should last quite a while. I&#x27;ve seen it for as low as $ 6.25 on a wetshaving site.</li>
            <li> This product does noticeably improve my shave, however I find that it also irritates my skin. After leaving on for a small amount of time, my face begins to burn. I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, either. That&#x27;s just my reaction, though, so 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This soap is unusual in that it really softens your wiskers before shaving. Use a small amount on a wash rag and wash your face before shaving(Then using your regular shaving soap shave) with it and the razor will glide across your face and the razor will cut through your wishkers like a knife through warm butter. You will really notice a difference of the quality of your shave. Excellent PRE-shave soap!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good. Smells ok, heavily lime scented but it works. I noticed closer shaves after I started using it.</li>
            <li> First off, this soap has a great fragrance. As a preshave soap, it lubricates well and has a lasting slick feel. The product description states that this product is \\&quot;ideal for sensitive skin\\&quot;; I must disagree with that statement. Although I&#x27;m not allergic to lime/lime oil, it did cause me some irritation.  I would recommend that those with sensitive skin try a small amount on a small area to assure that they do not have a bad reaction. I imagine that this product is \\&quot;hit or miss\\&quot;; those that can tolerate it will probably find it to be a great pre-shave treatment, but for those with sensitive skin, I&#x27;d advise to be wary.</li>
            <li> I keep Musgo in one of those rubber shaving cups with a second brush, and touch up between 2nd and 3rd passes. For those days I&#x27;m out for the perfect shave!</li>
            <li> Does a great job preparing your face for a shave. Lots of clean lather and a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I use this soap as an all purpose face cleanser, shampoo and pre-shave conditioner. It works well as all three.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;Very anemic lather and, almost, no Lime aroma.&lt;br /&gt;A bar of Dial glycerin soap has more aroma and about the same lather.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this soap for months. I&#x27;ve used it before and it has a terrific smell and great lather.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving is supposed to be a money saver. However, in recent years it&#x27;s become a huge industry of I! sown with an equally huge marketing machine trying t make everyone think they need every new! AND EXPENSIVE, product under the sun in order to give themselves the low cistern shave they were originally attracted to. Suddenly people are spending big bucks on a plethora OD razors and silver badger tipped brushes, nor to mention special bowls, stands, and every kind of paraphernalia under the sun. The nooks written on wet shaving must be subsidized by all these different companies to make people think they must have all these things. I find it humorous that so many of these men rave about all the money they&#x27;re saving because they no longer buy the lad test and greatest car trudge while at the same time they&#x27;re shelling out hundreds and sometimes even thousands of dollar so wet shaving products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find that this really does soften and protect my face and beard in my preparation for a delightful wet shave. Considering the cost and how long a bar (or puck) of this soap will last, I think it will cut right in as being one of the regular use products that make wet shaving worthwhile. Try it for yourself and see if you agree.</li>
            <li> Beyond love it....great fragrance, lathers well, leaves skin soft.  It is expensive, but totally fantastic.  The lime is natural but not overwhelming.  One of the best glycerine soaps I&#x27;ve ever had....Curious about the other scents.</li>
            <li> This product is as described, a real glycerine lime oil soap. It was shipped and received in a timely manner from &amp;#34;from portugal with love&amp;#34;. But from my personal experience...this product is not for me as the smell and feel of the soap are not to my liking. My skin seemed far to sensitive for this product, so your mileage may vary with this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing, wonderful fresh citrus scent, along with a refreshing tingle. Perfect as a pre shave soap. Leaves you clean and refreshed, plus it won&#x27;t dry your skin, just the opposite. I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I rotate this with Lucky Tiger Face wash.  Hydrating and non-drying.  Gentle enough for daily use.  Good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is now a staple part of my fiance&#x27;s shaving routine. He recently took up shaving with a safety razor. The fragrance is great. I purchased it for him for Christmas and it makes a great stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> Yes, this is THAT pre-shaving soap that everyone&#x27;s talking about.  It&#x27;d be interesting to see how this got to be so widely recommended.  It&#x27;s got a nice, light, elegant lime scent (which I&#x27;d love more of), in a big, thick soap puck.  Essentially glycerin soaps make such great pre-shaves because they deliver hot water and glycerin and a touch of oil to your beard just prior to lathering.  They don&#x27;t produce much lather themselves, and thus not much hair loft, which is one of the key effects of a good lather.  Nonetheless, I find I can get a good shave using Musgo alone (heresy, I know!).  Some rinse it off before lathering, I put it on right after the shower, and then generate my lather, and leave the Musgo on when I apply the lather, which I work in well with the brush to rehydrate.</li>
            <li> Great pre-shave product.  Softens the beard.  This is not to be used as a lather for shaving, it&#x27;s a pre-shave.  As such, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling soap for the bath. Lathers well and husband enjoys it very much. Was chosen as a surprise gift.</li>
            <li> Really love this pre-shave soap. Great lather and easy on the skin. Has a nice smell to it. Not to strong and will prep your face for a good shave. I like that and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the face either. Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time in my Edwin Jagger DE razor with an Astra blade and AOS Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Left my face super slick for my shave.&lt;br /&gt;-First time I ever got a bbs shave with an Astra blade.&lt;br /&gt;-Compared to Proraso pre-shave cream it doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied between passes to keep slick.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Being a soap, it does dry your skin a little between passes.&lt;br /&gt;-Besides being more efficient than Proraso psc&lt;br /&gt; the two do very much the same job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s a toss up between the two.  They both cost roughly the same approx $10.  This stuff will last longer but the cream is more readily available in drugstores.</li>
            <li> Great soap,came to me ahead of scheduled time. Make shaving smoother and smells good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap which I use as a pre-shave.  The lime scent is very refreshing.  The soap is very moisturizing and prepares the beard for a good close shave.  Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> No, I&#x27;m not getting any kick-back from Jack! I&#x27;ve actually read several books on wet-shaving. I always say if you want to be the best, learn from the best. If two World Championships don&#x27;t qualify you as one of the best, I don&#x27; know what does.</li>
            <li> I bought this after it was highly recommended in the book &amp;#34;Gourmet Shaving&amp;#34;.  Too many days using this in a row makes my skin somewhat raw.  Caution to those who have sensitive skin and need a more moisturizer soap.</li>
            <li> This is a very popular pre-shave soap, but it did not work for me.  It really dried my face out and the smell isn&#x27;t great.  However, there are several people who love it, so your experience may be much better than mine.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few soaps I&#x27;ve used that actually clear out my pores after using.  It&#x27;s clean-smelling, and has never caused any irritation or dryness when using. It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side but fantastic as a pre-shave soap.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The Musgo Real Glycerine Lime Oil Soap (MRGLO) has been my go-to ever since I started wet shaving. I had read many forum posts, posts on Reddit, and even read \\&quot;Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving\\&quot; book. It was mostly unanimous in voicing that the MRGLO soap is one of the top pre-shave soaps. I use it before every shave, right after my hot shower. The soap creates a gliding effect when shaving, resulting in a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Glycerine  soap is a nice soap for washing your face. Thought it would be a good soap to shave with using my DE Razor but not the case. This does not produce the lather necessary for a good shave in my opinion. I like the soap for what it is and smells good. Basically this soap is fine but any time you take a shower your facial hair will soften and if not then nothing is going to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;  The bottom line is don&#x27;t purchase this for DE Shaving because you think it will soften your beard because it will not do any more than a hot shower. I would not recommend DE shaving with this either. This is great soap for your Face or body. I use it as a Facial soap in my bathroom that is it...</li>
            <li> Great Product, very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Have that this is good for general face washing. But, use prior to every shave to improve the feel. The smell is appealing &amp; leaves me feeling clean &amp; refreshed. Will have to try Musgo&#x27;s body soap next.</li>
            <li> I love the soap I received,  but I did not get what I ordered. I ordered Lime soap, and instead received the original. Which I did not return, because it is really good. However, I would have really liked to have received the lime soap.</li>
            <li> I like this soap on my beard as a pre shave. Letting it sit for a few minutes really softens my whiskers before my shave.</li>
