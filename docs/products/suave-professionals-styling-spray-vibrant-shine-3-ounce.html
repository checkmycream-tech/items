            <li>It smells great too, not offensive at all.  </li>
            <li>Does not smell great, but does add shine.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to see it on Amazon</li>
            <li>And smells wonderful and your hair will be nice and shiney all day</li>
            <li>This product is non-greasy, smells great, gave me noticebly shinier hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>cannot believe it for the nice price!</li>
            <li>It gives a nice shine to my hair!</li>
            <li>it was really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is good.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake the bottle before you spray!  </li>
            <li>I just love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this !</li>
            <li>after curling; spraying; fixing my hair; etc; this is my final touch it smells awesome and shines beautifully.</li>
            <li>this suave; under $3.00 is THE absolute best shine for hair.</li>
            <li>but all aside it did what it was supposed to and smelled nice.</li>
            <li>, the brush will distribute a nice amount to the rest of your hair.</li>
            <li>I found the added scent to be fairly light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair with a nice shine not a greasy look, like most products.</li>
            <li>I ended up with a greasy helmet on the top of my head</li>
            <li>Be sure to shake it up before use.</li>
            <li>problem is most people don&#x27;t need shining products if their hair is healthy.  </li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>There were no directions on the bottle, so I wasn&#x27;t sure whether to apply before or after drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice light scent-</li>
            <li>I mostly used it for the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works for healthy hair, but for my damaged hair it made no difference.</li>
            <li>Love....</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years, and for my hair it is the best thing I have used.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light, pleasant, and almost non-existent to me and it dries instantly so it doesn&#x27;t linger or over-power.  </li>
            <li>Just 2 sprays works fine.</li>
            <li>think this spray is fine.</li>
            <li>Two things worth mentioning about this spray:  1) Be sure to shake the bottle before applying.</li>
            <li>I bought the miracle 7 shine spray recently and, for the $$, wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>Like everyone notes, shake bottle, then hold 6 - 8 inches from hair and lightly mist all over.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and floral, not offensive at all, and it evaporates as soon as you put it on your hair</li>
            <li>Overall very very nice.</li>
            <li>I found it at my supermarket for under $3, and I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a staple in my morning routine, right up there with showering and brushing my teeth!</li>
            <li>For how cheap this stuff is, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>two or three quick spritz&#x27;s does it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blow my mind with how amazing my hair looks with it on, but it does add extra shine and smoothness.</li>
            <li>I have a male friend who also uses this product to keep his hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li>I really like the clean smell and the shine it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>I thought the scent was heavy yet pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this on dry hair and it gives a nice, healthy shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also contains mica which I assume makes up the shiny, pretty particles that are suspended in the liquid after shaking.  </li>
            <li>The very first ingredient is alcohol which means the product contains more alcohol than any other component.  </li>
            <li>I am growing my hair out and this product keeps the ends feeling so nice that I can wait a little longer between hair cuts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not meant to spray on your roots, it&#x27;s only meant for a few light sprays about six inches from your head and it will make your hair look amazingly shiny in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li>The whole line of Suave volumizing products are going in the trash.</li>
            <li>Alcohol is very dulling and drying to hair.  </li>
            <li>really adds a lot of sparkle to my silver hair.  </li>
            <li>This really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Dont add too much and avoid your scalp...</li>
            <li>I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>For the amount I paid, I think this spray is decent.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and at the same time not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Its a clean, decent scent and doesnt linger long.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it makes hair look oily and limp (all shine sprays do, I&#x27;ve found), but if you re-blowdry or straighten the too saturated strands, they&#x27;re usually fine.</li>
            <li>I used this product as directed (6 inches from hair, just a spritz or two since I don&#x27;t have super dry, frizzy or ethnic hair.  </li>
            <li>When I took the cap off and took a big sniff, I could really smell the alcohol, but I didn&#x27;t get too much of that when I sprayed the product on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Most of the suave professional products are pretty good, but this one is horrible!  </li>
            <li>Love this product, it adds shine to my dull hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I just sprayed it in my hands and then put it in my hair instead of spraying directly.</li>
            <li>I applied more product the next few times and still no shine.  </li>
            <li>I finally washed my hair with dish detergent and it is ALMOST back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I already have smooth but thick hair</li>
            <li>I love how this Shine Styling Spray leaves a subtle shine on your hair!</li>
            <li>I buy the exact same spray at Walmart for less than three dollars.  </li>

            <li> (I have long hair) that I couldn&#x27;t wash out after almost a week of shampooing daily.  </li>
            <li> A little makes your hair feel soft, a lot makes your hair feel oily.  </li>
            <li> My hair style is never complete without it.</li>
            <li> gave it several tries.  </li>
            <li> Spray it on damp hair and blow dry and/or add  a couple of sprays to dry hair.</li>
            <li> it made my hair shiny (dry on my ends)</li>
            <li> and after I applied the shine spray to my dry hair, I noticed a difference in the amount of shine.  </li>
            <li> SUAVE VIBRANT SHINE is a spray that contains some silicones, which are common in beauty products to provide lubrication and shine.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything different, there was no shine, not even a little sparkle from the mica flakes in the liquid.</li>
            <li> Mine can be dull because it is processed with color and heated almost daily with various styling tools.  </li>
            <li> I will spend the few extra bucks for frizz-ease...</li>
            <li> I have hair of average thickness that can be a little frizzy in various weather conditions.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> I have no idea what that other reviewer is talking about.</li>
            <li> other stuff</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, but nothing else works as well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have mentioned, shake before using.</li>
            <li> I apply it to already dry hair and can see a difference in the amount of shine- which in the end makes your hair look a little healthier.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is processed and dull (thus prompting you to look for a product that adds shine), an alcohol-based product may be the last thing you want to put on it!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the other reviewer is talking about.  </li>
            <li> a few spritz on the ends and brush through</li>
            <li> I am afraid Vibrant Shine by Suave has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I find what smell there is to be subtle and certainly not</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have used expensive shine sprays and still come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to add some shine to my perm-damaged hair so it wouldn&#x27;t look so dull and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I think this is the cheaper version to Sebastian Trilliant Thermal Protection &amp; Shimmer Complex.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores, my one, &amp;#34;go to store&amp;#34; stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> It smells even worse than the volumizing suave mousse</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Suave would sell such crap.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I got no added shine.  </li>
            <li> Maybe hair can have weird smell chemistry the way skin/perfume does, because I keep seeing people complain about the smell on Suave products -- and I&#x27;ve never had issues with odor.</li>
            <li> my hair is colored and it just makes it sparkle, not in a bad way</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s bad!</li>
            <li> OMG, this is the worst smelling stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, which I didn&#x27;t realize until I&#x27;d already sprayed it onto my hair.</li>
            <li> Everyone made a comment that the smell was terrible - I disagree.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product!! I don&#x27;t know what product everyone is using that causes their hair to become greasy.  It&#x27;s not meant to spray on your roots, it&#x27;s only meant for a few light sprays about six inches from your head and it will make your hair look amazingly shiny in the sunlight.  It smells great too, not offensive at all.  I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what that other reviewer is talking about. The smell is very light, pleasant, and almost non-existent to me and it dries instantly so it doesn&#x27;t linger or over-power.  I apply it to already dry hair and can see a difference in the amount of shine- which in the end makes your hair look a little healthier.  I am not a fan of Suave products AT ALL but for some reason I gave this a try and I do like it. Make sure you shake the bottle before you spray!  If you spray too much at the roots it can make you look oily, so just spray the rest of the hair and a little goes a long way. Just 2 sprays works fine. For how cheap this stuff is, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have hair of average thickness that can be a little frizzy in various weather conditions.  I used this product as directed (6 inches from hair, just a spritz or two since I don&#x27;t have super dry, frizzy or ethnic hair.  I ended up with a greasy helmet on the top of my head (I have long hair) that I couldn&#x27;t wash out after almost a week of shampooing daily.  I finally washed my hair with dish detergent and it is ALMOST back to normal.  Most of the suave professional products are pretty good, but this one is horrible!  I will spend the few extra bucks for frizz-ease...this one is going in the garbage!</li>
            <li> Does not smell great, but does add shine. Be sure to shake it up before use. Spray it on damp hair and blow dry and/or add  a couple of sprays to dry hair. I think this is the cheaper version to Sebastian Trilliant Thermal Protection &amp; Shimmer Complex. This is not intended to be hairspray, but a thermal protection spray.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this shine spray a chance after I ran out of my regular spray. OMG, this is the worst smelling stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, which I didn&#x27;t realize until I&#x27;d already sprayed it onto my hair. It smells even worse than the volumizing suave mousse and that&#x27;s bad! It&#x27;s like burnt chemicals and flowers. And it doesn&#x27;t even work! It was like spraying water on my hair, ruining the big waves I just made! I can&#x27;t believe Suave would sell such crap. I had to wash my hair immediately. The whole line of Suave volumizing products are going in the trash. BEWARE! You get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful! My hair style is never complete without it. It brings my hair to life. my hair is colored and it just makes it sparkle, not in a bad way but it makes the color come to life!!! I just love this!</li>
            <li> SUAVE VIBRANT SHINE is a spray that contains some silicones, which are common in beauty products to provide lubrication and shine.  It also contains mica which I assume makes up the shiny, pretty particles that are suspended in the liquid after shaking.  I found it at my supermarket for under $3, and I was excited to try it.  What a disappointment!  I didn&#x27;t check the ingredients until I got home.  The very first ingredient is alcohol which means the product contains more alcohol than any other component.  Alcohol&#x27;s effect on hair is well-known, and that effect is not to increase shine.  Alcohol is very dulling and drying to hair.  Oh well.  Maybe the alcohol is just the conduit for the silicones and mica?  I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it several tries.  When I took the cap off and took a big sniff, I could really smell the alcohol, but I didn&#x27;t get too much of that when I sprayed the product on my hair.  I found the added scent to be fairly light and pleasant.  Unfortunately, I got no added shine.  I applied more product the next few times and still no shine.  The rest went in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is most people don&#x27;t need shining products if their hair is healthy.  Mine can be dull because it is processed with color and heated almost daily with various styling tools.  If your hair is processed and dull (thus prompting you to look for a product that adds shine), an alcohol-based product may be the last thing you want to put on it!</li>
            <li> this suave; under $3.00 is THE absolute best shine for hair. after curling; spraying; fixing my hair; etc; this is my final touch it smells awesome and shines beautifully. cannot believe it for the nice price!</li>
            <li> Love this product, it adds shine to my dull hair. It&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores, my one, &amp;#34;go to store&amp;#34; stopped carrying it. I was so happy to see it on Amazon</li>
            <li> One if the best shine sprays. I got it a lot cheaper at walmart though. I have used expensive shine sprays and still come back to this one. I&#x27;m not a big fan of suaves other stuff but this stuff is awesome. Give it a try</li>
            <li> love this product. really adds a lot of sparkle to my silver hair.  a little goes a long way..two or three quick spritz&#x27;s does it. it&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s a discontinued product. I&#x27;ve found nothing that compares to it.</li>
            <li> yeah it was really good. it made my hair shiny (dry on my ends) but all aside it did what it was supposed to and smelled nice.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the other reviewer is talking about.  This stuff has a perfume smell, but it smells nothing like burnt cigarettes, as they said.  I thought the scent was heavy yet pleasant.  There were no directions on the bottle, so I wasn&#x27;t sure whether to apply before or after drying my hair.  I already have smooth but thick hair and after I applied the shine spray to my dry hair, I noticed a difference in the amount of shine.  The spray dries instantly which I like, but I feel like if I applied too much my hair became a bit limp.  For the amount I paid, I think this spray is decent.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaper than others like it. Don&#x27;t let this fool you! I buy the exact same spray at Walmart for less than three dollars.  That being said, this is a great product! It makes my hair feel silky and soft. I am growing my hair out and this product keeps the ends feeling so nice that I can wait a little longer between hair cuts.  I have a male friend who also uses this product to keep his hair feeling nice. It works on all lengths and types of hair.  Two things worth mentioning about this spray:  1) Be sure to shake the bottle before applying. This really does make a difference.  2) A little makes your hair feel soft, a lot makes your hair feel oily.  I love this product! It&#x27;s a staple in my morning routine, right up there with showering and brushing my teeth!</li>
            <li> I love this ! It gives a nice shine to my hair!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair with a nice shine not a greasy look, like most products. And smells wonderful and your hair will be nice and shiney all day</li>
            <li> Great product! I want more!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the miracle 7 shine spray recently and, for the $$, wasn&#x27;t happy. It was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Saw this Suave Shine Spray at Walmart for under $3. I like the SHINE it truly does provide! Like everyone notes, shake bottle, then hold 6 - 8 inches from hair and lightly mist all over. I&#x27;ve only used this on dry hair and it gives a nice, healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good. Its a clean, decent scent and doesnt linger long. Very good shine spray/gloss!</li>
            <li> Everyone made a comment that the smell was terrible - I disagree. Its a nice light scent- nothing over powering. Def makes your hair shiny, esp after blowdrying with all that heat! Dont add too much and avoid your scalp...it can get oily. a few spritz on the ends and brush through, the brush will distribute a nice amount to the rest of your hair. very nice product!</li>
            <li> I love how this Shine Styling Spray leaves a subtle shine on your hair! Very pretty and at the same time not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to add some shine to my perm-damaged hair so it wouldn&#x27;t look so dull and frizzy. I mostly used it for the ends of my hair. When I used it too close to the root it made my hair look greasy. I didn&#x27;t notice anything different, there was no shine, not even a little sparkle from the mica flakes in the liquid. Maybe it works for healthy hair, but for my damaged hair it made no difference. The smell is light and floral, not offensive at all, and it evaporates as soon as you put it on your hair so there&#x27;s no lingering scent.</li>
            <li> Love.... just stock pile now.</li>
            <li> I am afraid Vibrant Shine by Suave has been discontinued. I have used it for several years, and for my hair it is the best thing I have used. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally as I once could. I really like the clean smell and the shine it gives my hair. I have tried other products, but nothing else works as well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe hair can have weird smell chemistry the way skin/perfume does, because I keep seeing people complain about the smell on Suave products -- and I&#x27;ve never had issues with odor. I find what smell there is to be subtle and certainly not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this spray is fine. It doesn&#x27;t blow my mind with how amazing my hair looks with it on, but it does add extra shine and smoothness. Like other reviewers have mentioned, shake before using. If you use too much it makes hair look oily and limp (all shine sprays do, I&#x27;ve found), but if you re-blowdry or straighten the too saturated strands, they&#x27;re usually fine.</li>
            <li> Overall very very nice. This product is non-greasy, smells great, gave me noticebly shinier hair. I really recommend this. I just sprayed it in my hands and then put it in my hair instead of spraying directly.</li>
