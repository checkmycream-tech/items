            <li>The colors are so bright!</li>
            <li>I had the thought of mixing colors which is great for someone who has the time to do so.  </li>
            <li>great colors and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great buy</li>

            <li>the color pigment is great though.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice palette.  </li>
            <li>I must say I am more impressed with this one than with BH&#x27;s lipstick palette.</li>
            <li>, this is a great product just to get a feel of what looks good with your skin and so on.</li>
            <li>LOVING IT!</li>
            <li>today I was very pleased the colors go on great</li>
            <li>This set does have a lot of colors but will they all look good with your skin tone or complexion?  </li>
            <li>lipstick pan measures almost 1\\&quot; in diameter which is a good size.  </li>
            <li>Good variety of colors.</li>
            <li>And for that, I think this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth, they&#x27;re beautiful colors too!</li>
            <li>I would have loved to see a mirror on this palette</li>
            <li>pros: Lots of colors for a good price.  </li>
            <li>They also mix fairly well for custom colors.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this pallette.</li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful, lip glosses are creamy and apply easily.</li>
            <li>and they all look lovely!</li>
            <li>I love Coastal Scents!</li>
            <li>This palette has some amazing shades of lipstick.</li>
            <li>Nice range of colors and</li>
            <li>its a nice color</li>
            <li>its easy to mix and anyone can use this!</li>
            <li>(Although I LOVE BH eyeshadows!)&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>but thats even better.</li>
            <li>I love using this palette.  </li>
            <li>and I love to take this with me when I am doing photoshoots.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price...not good for people who want lasting lip color</li>
            <li>It contains mostly lipsticks though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use way more often than others</li>
            <li>So many to choose from.</li>
            <li>With a bit of mixing and matching I can pull out a color to go with any outfit and any occasion :)</li>
            <li>I really do love this palette.</li>
            <li>And are more lip gloss.</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely and I carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re the type who likes to experiment or keep things fresh/new, I&#x27;d highly advise you to buy this! :P</li>
            <li>The color are really pretty, they have a lot of color and good staying power..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 5 of the colors so far and all of them have looked great, even the ones that I was hesitant of.</li>
            <li>so much choice and looks good on too.  </li>
            <li>I have been having fun combining colors to make my own custom shades.  </li>
            <li>beautifull colors, easy to apply, no irritaton</li>
            <li>Besides that, it is great so far, I would recommend it to every one who wants a bunch of great lasting colors for a really good price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with a brush or even a finger.</li>
            <li>Unless you would look good with bright red/hot pink lipstick I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Coastal Scents</li>
            <li>You literally can come up with different shades by mixing some of these together which is REALLY great.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, she seemed to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It was great, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>They feel nice and smooth on the lip, and seem to have reasonable staying power.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered this Coastal Scents 32 Lip Color Palette and received a 15pc brush set instead.</li>
            <li>Excited to use it.</li>
            <li>Fun palette make your color!</li>
            <li>Love the colours very vibrant</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are creamy and glide on smoothly and the colors are vibrant and believable.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay with me because I really bought this to sample colors, not expecting durability.</li>
            <li>Colors are true to picture.</li>
            <li>The colors last and quality is as good as Mac.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone interested in trying lip glosses!</li>
            <li>My only critique is, a mirror would be nice.  </li>
            <li>I will have alot of fun with these.</li>
            <li>Completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Such a nice playground for a girly girl like myself.</li>
            <li>yet they don&#x27;t appear too heavy , or waxy, just a very nice gloss.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday and mixing and matching!</li>
            <li>on the far left top row) They can also be blended to get a whole new color to compliment your own skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I do love ... just not enough.</li>
            <li>, this palette is a real find for any lipstick wearer!  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>i still love this pallete, but only use it when im goping out at night</li>
            <li>but it does the trick for a simple and cute lip.</li>
            <li>Overall an ok buy would recommend to a beginner.</li>
            <li>However, some of the ones I wouldn&#x27;t wear alone look really good when mixed with others, which leaves only one or two</li>
            <li>A nice selection of colors and fun to play around with, but the tints don&#x27;t last long, like an hour or so in my experience.</li>
            <li>the colors are more fo0r bold lipstick not for everyday looks.</li>
            <li>I do wish that a brush or two had been included, and maybe a small mirror, but other than that, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but there are times where I would really like that glossy shine</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love the colors they stay on for a long time!!!!</li>
            <li>I have endless makeup brushes and surely didn&#x27;t need another set.</li>
            <li>She said the quality was decent and appreciated the variety of colors.</li>
            <li>It goes on well and the colors are vibrant</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re new to lipgloss</li>
            <li>I have purchased 4 of these palettes so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that there are people out there who want to use bright orange lip color, possibly for a photo shoot or something, but for everyday wearing, several of them are impractical.  </li>
            <li>Professional packaging.</li>
            <li>However, it has a lot of weird colors that I can&#x27;t imagine look good on anybody.  </li>
            <li>Lots of colors doesn&#x27;t mean a thing to me any more.  </li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean and it is a hassle to have the item sent back ESP since I receive my orders through a skybox.</li>
            <li>Some are very thick while others are way more liquidy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I feel happy about this buy, especially when buying single lipsticks can be so expensive!</li>
            <li>(Especially the pale pink/coral one right next to the white.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> (Especially the pale pink/coral one right next to the white.</li>
            <li> While the brushes were nice, it was not what I ordered and I was completely upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> The ones I have tried have been long lasting as well...</li>
            <li> I think thats a long time for lip gloss with how often I drink water.</li>
            <li> it stays on for a long time if you don&#x27;t eat anything.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> They are not an all day wear, may have to reapply and don&#x27;t mix well with other glosses.</li>
            <li> For the price I dont mind leaving it behind and purchasing a new one.</li>
            <li> , that is the only negative I found.</li>
            <li> If I dont stay to complete the photoshoot I always leave this lip palette behind at the shoot.</li>
            <li> so I knew this product wouldn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this, as we all know how horrible sticky, cheap lip glosses can be, but I was pleasantly surprised by this</li>
            <li> but probably wont repurchase, the lasting power is not good at all.</li>
            <li> Or you&#x27;ll be messy.</li>
            <li> I am usually a lipstick girl</li>
            <li> With 32 colors it&#x27;s so hard for me to choose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of them at least once</li>
            <li> A total inconvenience and disappointment.</li>
            <li> at least 5 hours.</li>
            <li> but i received the 66 colors in which the size of every color is very small</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong some colors in this set...</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with 32 colors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also annoying that there&#x27;s no mirror.</li>

            <li> Lots of colors doesn&#x27;t mean a thing to me any more.  This set does have a lot of colors but will they all look good with your skin tone or complexion?  I had the thought of mixing colors which is great for someone who has the time to do so.  Unless you would look good with bright red/hot pink lipstick I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong some colors in this set... I do love ... just not enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette a couple of weeks ago after purchasing the BH cosmetics 64 color lip palette. I must say I am more impressed with this one than with BH&#x27;s lipstick palette. (Although I LOVE BH eyeshadows!)&lt;br /&gt;Each lipstick pan measures almost 1\\&quot; in diameter which is a good size.  The lipsticks are creamy and glide on smoothly and the colors are vibrant and believable. I&#x27;ve tried all of them at least once and they all look lovely! (Especially the pale pink/coral one right next to the white. on the far left top row) They can also be blended to get a whole new color to compliment your own skin tones.  I use a standard lipstick brush to apply them. My only critique is, a mirror would be nice.  Other than that, this palette is a real find for any lipstick wearer!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good variety of colors. Bigger than I thought but thats even better. I will have alot of fun with these. ;-)</li>
            <li> I love using this palette.  However, it has a lot of weird colors that I can&#x27;t imagine look good on anybody.  It&#x27;s also annoying that there&#x27;s no mirror.</li>
            <li> the colors are more fo0r bold lipstick not for everyday looks. i still love this pallete, but only use it when im goping out at night</li>
            <li> beautifull colors, easy to apply, no irritaton</li>
            <li> I am a MUA and I love to take this with me when I am doing photoshoots. If I dont stay to complete the photoshoot I always leave this lip palette behind at the shoot. For the price I dont mind leaving it behind and purchasing a new one. I have purchased 4 of these palettes so far.</li>
            <li> great colors and they mix awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price...not good for people who want lasting lip color but it does the trick for a simple and cute lip.</li>
            <li> A nice selection of colors and fun to play around with, but the tints don&#x27;t last long, like an hour or so in my experience. That&#x27;s okay with me because I really bought this to sample colors, not expecting durability. And for that, I think this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Came packaged well. Colors are true to picture. They are not an all day wear, may have to reapply and don&#x27;t mix well with other glosses. Overall an ok buy would recommend to a beginner.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this Coastal Scents 32 Lip Color Palette and received a 15pc brush set instead. While the brushes were nice, it was not what I ordered and I was completely upset and disappointed. I live in the Caribbean and it is a hassle to have the item sent back ESP since I receive my orders through a skybox. A total inconvenience and disappointment. I have endless makeup brushes and surely didn&#x27;t need another set. Unsure if I will ever purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright! They go on smooth, they&#x27;re beautiful colors too! I was super excited to get this. I bought it for use with a halloween costume, but it&#x27;s made a great addition to my makeup collection!</li>
            <li> yo esperaba este producto con ancias pero cuando llego me decepciono porque se ve que tiene muy poco producto y el estuche no pesa nada .desperdicio de dinero y el envio eso si muy rapido bueno por lo menos los colores pintan bien</li>
            <li> I read several reviews before I decided to purchase. Completely worth it. Every color is as shown. Wonderful inexpensive buy.</li>
            <li> This is a lipstick and lipgloss combination palette. It contains mostly lipsticks though. You literally can come up with different shades by mixing some of these together which is REALLY great. I like the concept of having a palette versus lipstick tubes because i don&#x27;t do the same look every day and buying multiple lipstick tubes would end up costing a lot. So if you&#x27;re the type who likes to experiment or keep things fresh/new, I&#x27;d highly advise you to buy this! :P</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Coastal Scents so I knew this product wouldn&#x27;t let me down. I am usually a lipstick girl but there are times where I would really like that glossy shine so I decided to order this. I&#x27;ve tried 5 of the colors so far and all of them have looked great, even the ones that I was hesitant of. There are obviously colors I&#x27;ll use way more often than others but if you&#x27;re new to lipgloss like I was, this is a great product just to get a feel of what looks good with your skin and so on. The consistencies differ a bit though. Some are very thick while others are way more liquidy. The ones I have tried have been long lasting as well...at least 5 hours. I think thats a long time for lip gloss with how often I drink water. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great buy and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone interested in trying lip glosses!</li>
            <li> its easy to mix and anyone can use this! Love the colours very vibrant you should consider putting in a mirror though.</li>
            <li> My daughter does make up and loves this color palette!  It goes on well and the colors are vibrant</li>
            <li> I love Coastal Scents! This palette has some amazing shades of lipstick. So many to choose from. It&#x27;s a thin case and can easily fit in my bag. *****</li>
            <li> Love the colors they stay on for a long time!!!! The texture is beautiful!!!!! Is all my lipsticks in one easy portable platte!!!!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I would have loved to see a mirror on this palette, that is the only negative I found. Besides that, it is great so far, I would recommend it to every one who wants a bunch of great lasting colors for a really good price. Such a nice playground for a girly girl like myself. LOVING IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, she seemed to enjoy it. She said the quality was decent and appreciated the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday and mixing and matching! I use mine for everything including lip liner.. This is a must have for every ones collection!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice palette.  The color are really pretty, they have a lot of color and good staying power..yet they don&#x27;t appear too heavy , or waxy, just a very nice gloss.</li>
            <li> i order this one but i received the 66 colors in which the size of every color is very small</li>
            <li> It was great, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Nice range of colors and it stays on for a long time if you don&#x27;t eat anything. With a bit of mixing and matching I can pull out a color to go with any outfit and any occasion :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item...so much choice and looks good on too.  Easy to use with a brush or even a finger.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today I was very pleased the colors go on great I will recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I really do love this palette. With 32 colors it&#x27;s so hard for me to choose. I have been having fun combining colors to make my own custom shades.  Colors are beautiful, lip glosses are creamy and apply easily. I do wish that a brush or two had been included, and maybe a small mirror, but other than that, I am very happy with this purchase. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Colors are pigmented! And are more lip gloss. Excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this, as we all know how horrible sticky, cheap lip glosses can be, but I was pleasantly surprised by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: Lots of colors for a good price.  They feel nice and smooth on the lip, and seem to have reasonable staying power.  They also mix fairly well for custom colors.  The palette feels sturdy enough to hold up under all the use it will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: Not all the colors are useable.  It&#x27;s possible that there are people out there who want to use bright orange lip color, possibly for a photo shoot or something, but for everyday wearing, several of them are impractical.  However, some of the ones I wouldn&#x27;t wear alone look really good when mixed with others, which leaves only one or two that I will probably never use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel happy about this buy, especially when buying single lipsticks can be so expensive!</li>
            <li> Low quality. Mostly sheer lip glosses with barely enough color to notice differences.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with 32 colors.&lt;br /&gt;I fix m uh face then hold the palette upto my chin and pick a color accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is great, you need to set it. Or you&#x27;ll be messy. Fast shipping. Professional packaging.</li>
            <li> Fun palette make your color!</li>
            <li> Good for the price but probably wont repurchase, the lasting power is not good at all. the color pigment is great though.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this pallette. The colors are lovely and I carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li> Excellent kit. The colors are highly pigmented. The colors last and quality is as good as Mac.</li>
            <li> its a nice color but it will not last hours.  Ii is almost like a lip gloss with color.</li>
