            <li>The lotion seems fine</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for  years and it smooth the skin</li>
            <li>It is so nice to find a reasonable price online.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, last all day.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this available and I will always check Amazon for my purchases</li>
            <li>Smells so good and keeps my hands and legs soft</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t arrive in its original packaging.  </li>
            <li>When giving it as a gift, I want the item in its original cellophane wrapped box.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered a gift set containing this lotion and found that I liked it better than the perfume itself.</li>
            <li>packed well, came quickly.</li>
            <li>Since I started wearing it years ago - I have always gotten such FANTASTIC and constant compliments on HOW GOOD I SMELL!</li>
            <li>(may be my changing body chemistry), but this lotion smells sweet, rich and luxurious and is very long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Hope you all enjoy it as much as I am.</li>
            <li>I cannot find anything better than Red Door Lotion..if you are looking for something with a clean smell &amp; feel, this is it.</li>
            <li>I hoped it would smell as good on me as it did that gal in the grocery store the other day.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my hands - arms - legs - it just soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling so SMOOTH AND so SOFT!!</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and leaves my skin soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick service.</li>
            <li>I bought this after falling in Love with the Red Door perfume and wondered if it would smell as GREAT - if it would LAST - and especially if it would leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>She loved it and her little boy even thanked me for giving Mommy a pretty &amp;#34;smell.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have been using this fragrance for over 25 years and still love the smell every time I open up the bottle or tube.</li>
            <li>I consistently get compliments \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li>The lotion is always the first to be used up.  </li>
            <li>If you like Red Door fragrance you will love this body lotion.</li>
            <li>Red Door is my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>Love Red Door!</li>
            <li>To find the lotion at such a great savings makes me smile widely.</li>
            <li>This is really a good price this is so much more expensive in Department stores.</li>
            <li>There is a certain perfume-type of smell, almost like the &amp;#34;Avon&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>I was pleased it came in such a timely manner as I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic!</li>
            <li>The scent is lighter than the cologne and the lotion itself is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li>on how much they like the cologne.  </li>
            <li>I get more compliments when I wear this lotion by itself than with any other fragrances I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Some say it is for older women, I disagree.</li>
            <li>I love Red Door... and applying lotion before a mist of perfume helps the scent lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>The Red Door spray just doesn&#x27;t smell right to me anymore</li>
            <li>the first time from a different supplier</li>
            <li>Smelled like old, staled perfume.</li>
            <li>There was absolutely no red door smell in the product, evidently old on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>Men are always asking me and they even take out a piece of paper and write it down so they could buy it for their significant other.</li>

            <li> I have seen this lotion at Marshalls and TJ Maxx for a similar price but inevitably the bottle /tube is open and people have been using the lotion..and touching it with GROSS DIRTY hands..</li>
            <li> Lightweight and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The tube dispenser is easy to use without lotion getting stuck in the wrong end.</li>
            <li> so hard to find anymore without paying way too much.</li>
            <li> The lotion is pricey and not for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells like a dry floral..not too sweet..not too spicy.</li>
            <li> FAVORITE SCENT, NOTHING BAD TO SAY.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes along way.  </li>
            <li> Some of the perfumed lotions that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past are too heavy or too thick.</li>
            <li> I touched the wrong star.</li>
            <li> I have on some \\&quot;other\\&quot; EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE  perfumes.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This lotion exceeds me expectation. Some of the perfumed lotions that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past are too heavy or too thick. This lotion is perfect. Goes on easily and leaves my skin soft and fragrant. The tube dispenser is easy to use without lotion getting stuck in the wrong end. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for  years and it smooth the skin</li>
            <li> I got Red Door lotion for a graduation gift from a family member back in 1993.  I had never tried any before &amp; just love the scent!!  I always get compliments whenever I wear it.  Can&#x27;t find another fragrance that compliments me like Red Door lotion.  Don&#x27;t like the perfume....just the lotion, it seems to last longer</li>
            <li> I get more nice compliments ever wher I go.  It&#x27;s nice to be noticed every where. I use to just have the perfum,this  seems to erally make the scent last longer.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and delivered as promised</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent. I&#x27;ve been wearing this one for years and get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for over 25 years and still love the smell every time I open up the bottle or tube. I consistently get compliments \\&quot;Oh, you smell so, so good what are you wearing.\\&quot;  That&#x27;s enough for me to hear.  I am always looking to buy this stuff because it is addicting to me and I love it dearly. I have been told that it is an oriental fragrance and I do tend to lean towards orientals.  I do also love Michael Kors because it smells like gardenia which I also love. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I am.</li>
            <li> This is the most feminine body lotion that I&#x27;ve worn for over 20 years \\&quot;that&#x27;s how good it is\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s best layered with RD Powder &amp; Eau De Toilet Spray.  I constantly get comments on how good RD smells!</li>
            <li> Returned. Smelled like old, staled perfume.</li>
            <li> a very good product !!!</li>
            <li> The lotion seems fine but it didn&#x27;t arrive in its original packaging.  When giving it as a gift, I want the item in its original cellophane wrapped box.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome perfume for women. Some say it is for older women, I disagree. It is for any age. I always get compliments and people stop me and ask what I am wearing. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love Red Door... and applying lotion before a mist of perfume helps the scent lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Received as promised.  Will order from this seller agai.</li>
            <li> Red Door is my signature fragrance.  The lotion is pricey and not for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Recipient was very pleased....packed well, came quickly.</li>
            <li> This lotion is runny, not too pleased with it.  Would have been better had it been thicker and not run out everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and I was so happy to finally be able to buy this lotion. I am allergic to perfume bur scented lotion works. I feel Beautiful whem Im wearing this!</li>
            <li> Good price for this product. The scent is lighter than the cologne and the lotion itself is very moisturizing. I wish I could find Red Door in a bath powder and bath gel or oil.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion for my Mom for a gift.  She loves all the Red Door products.  This lotion is her favorite!  Thanks for the quick service.</li>
            <li> great love it buy it.</li>
            <li> I touched the wrong star. I was very pleased with the purchase. My wife loves the fragrance. The rating should be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The body lotion stays on all day, is not too strong, and receive many compliments about the aroma.  Do use red door perfume, ocassionally, but prefer just using the body lotion.</li>
            <li> What matters here is that the wife LOVES it and it makes her happy!  And it price was very good compared to department stores.</li>
            <li> very good - can&#x27;t believe I got it so cheap</li>
            <li> I love this on my wife.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and Item as described.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a gift set containing this lotion and found that I liked it better than the perfume itself. Smells like a dry floral..not too sweet..not too spicy. I have seen this lotion at Marshalls and TJ Maxx for a similar price but inevitably the bottle /tube is open and people have been using the lotion..and touching it with GROSS DIRTY hands..this lotion came taped at the top and sealed..AWESOME!!! It&#x27;s a classic!</li>
            <li> This lotion is fabulous!  I get more compliments when I wear this lotion by itself than with any other fragrances I&#x27;ve tried.  The Red Door spray just doesn&#x27;t smell right to me anymore (may be my changing body chemistry), but this lotion smells sweet, rich and luxurious and is very long-lasting.  The price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift.  This has a really nice scent.  The lotion is always the first to be used up.  It is so nice to find a reasonable price online.</li>
            <li> I have used this body lotion for years - my grandchildren know when I have been in the room so I am always happy to find it at a good price&#x27;</li>
            <li> This scent is beautiful.  Not over powering at all.  A little bit goes along way.  Wonderful to put on after a nice showe or bath.</li>
            <li> If you like Red Door fragrance you will love this body lotion. Lightweight and long lasting. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have given my reviews here on Amazon re: Red Door Eau De Parfume and how Fantastic it smells! Since I started wearing it years ago - I have always gotten such FANTASTIC and constant compliments on HOW GOOD I SMELL! I decided that since I get so many compliments on how good I smell that I would always wear this Perfume and not waste my money on anything else...(though I have on some \\&quot;other\\&quot; EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE  perfumes.  When I have worn \\&quot;other\\&quot; perfumes I noticed that I didn&#x27;t get the constant compliments...so why bother? For example - when shopping or when I used to work at a Country Club people ALWAYS asked me WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?!! Men are always asking me and they even take out a piece of paper and write it down so they could buy it for their significant other. My mother has now been buying and wearing Red Door because my father would always tell me how good I smell and would ask me what was I wearing! So now I get to the review of this RED DOOR BODY LOTION. I bought this after falling in Love with the Red Door perfume and wondered if it would smell as GREAT - if it would LAST - and especially if it would leave a greasy feeling. I am in LOVE with this Lotion too for all it&#x27;s great attributes. It does SMELL GREAT! It does LAST! And it is NOT GREASY!!! YEAH....When I put it on my hands - arms - legs - it just soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling so SMOOTH AND so SOFT!! And the smell is so beautiful!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Lotion! And once again - why bother buying anything else?</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product...the first time from a different supplier and I loved it.  This one doesn&#x27;t appear to be Red Door but a knock-off.  Will not use this supplier again.</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream .. Smells so good and keeps my hands and legs soft</li>
            <li> Red Door is my favorite perfume and I love the lotion along with the bath gel and the cologne.  Everyone&lt;br /&gt;comments on how much they like the cologne.  I have used it for many, many years and will purchase it&lt;br /&gt;again</li>
            <li> This is just okay. I hoped it would smell as good on me as it did that gal in the grocery store the other day. She smelled like she just stepped out of the shower and I told her so. She said she was wearing &amp;#34;Red Door&amp;#34; so I ordered this hoping it&#x27;s the same one she wore. But if it is then it just doesn&#x27;t smell as good on me. You can also tell from smelling it in the tube before putting it on. There is a certain perfume-type of smell, almost like the &amp;#34;Avon&amp;#34; smell. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> FAVORITE SCENT, NOTHING BAD TO SAY. ALL MEN LOVE IT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SEXY SCENT TO AROUSE YOUR HUBBY, LOL LOL YEAH!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Red Door for about 26 years, my only choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my best friend&#x27;s birthday. It&#x27;s her favorite and she loved it! I was pleased it came in such a timely manner as I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. so hard to find anymore without paying way too much. Works well with Red Door shower gel. Not too strong of a scent. Just the right amount of floral &amp; sex appeal I think!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, everyone compliments me on how nice I smell. Love Red Door! This is really a good price this is so much more expensive in Department stores.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no red door smell in the product, evidently old on the shelf.  Amazon promply refunded my money.</li>
            <li> I love it.  My daughter asked what I was wearing, so I got it for her for her birthday.  She loved it and her little boy even thanked me for giving Mommy a pretty &amp;#34;smell.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very happy to find this fine product at an affordable price.  It is a superior product from a well known cosmetic manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I cannot find anything better than Red Door Lotion..if you are looking for something with a clean smell &amp; feel, this is it.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, last all day.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Red Door is the choice scent for me! To find the lotion at such a great savings makes me smile widely. Thank you for making this available and I will always check Amazon for my purchases</li>
            <li> My friend loved the gift</li>
            <li> wonderful. smells and feels so good.</li>
