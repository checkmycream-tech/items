            <li>and I really loved it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair gorgeous time after time.</li>
            <li>Fair</li>
            <li>If you want a lot of volume adding a good non-sticky  root lifter (ie &amp;#34;Alternna 48</li>
            <li>Great for people with very fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li>This product is so great for my hair:)</li>
            <li>packaging and price for the amount of product is great, but I think I&#x27;ll try something else for more volume.</li>

            <li>love alterna!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so thought something to add body would be great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly nothing like the hemp thickening compound, which was awesome.  </li>
            <li>This works for fine hair not sticky light perfect</li>
            <li>In addition, the smell of the product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>- this is light weight - great</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>gives your hair nice volume.</li>
            <li>it add so much volume and feels great!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell how effective this is, but it appears to just keep my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li>and she was thrilled with the results</li>
            <li>and she had nice volume.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest about this review.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good in fine hair, but I think I&#x27;m most sold on the wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>What I got was hair that looks as thick as it does on its *best* days, but without all the work I have to spend getting it to be its best.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use &amp; gives my hair a feeling of volume.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and have tried products galore!</li>
            <li>I had experienced severe hair loss over a period of six months; losing a large portion of my volume.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Did I get better results?</li>
            <li>I do think it makes my hair look and feel fuller and the style lasts for more than one day.  </li>
            <li>but I love the way my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better product that volume plumps my hair as well as Alterna Bamboo. ...</li>
            <li>My mistake, however I still love this product.  </li>
            <li>So glad I could find it here.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product...</li>
            <li>It dulled it more than I would like.  </li>
            <li>the product magic?  </li>
            <li>My hair also appears more shiny and bouncy than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luck Lovy&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li>I am using 4 pumps and that is more than it</li>
            <li>Another thing I noticed with this product is that I can get away with not washing my hair for 4 days without it looking greasy!!! :-)</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the volume I get.</li>
            <li>I use it with Alterna Bamboo Volume 48 and Sexy Hair Spray Clay  </li>
            <li>If you are searching for a product that does what it claims, and is healthy for the hair....</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>This works well to give my hair more body, and also to help style it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>The Was ok</li>
            <li>never never I order this product again ok</li>
            <li>and they work better than this one.</li>
            <li>Sure wish I could find  Cristophe  spray tonic.</li>
            <li>When I asked my hairdresser whether I can see the effect already after one usage (because I thought you need more long-term care), she said of course.</li>
            <li>If you want a great volume, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Great for fine straight hair, adds volume and styling is a breeze.</li>
            <li>Will fine something else that works better and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all and nothing works until this line of hair product also very good is Carol Daughter same ingredient.</li>
            <li>more airy &amp; light foamy</li>
            <li>Works great leave hair feeling natural.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, smells delicious and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, which is important to me because I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>As I am, like many of us are, very cost-conscious, I decided it best to leave her a generous tip and see if the product she recommended was available online for the same or a better price</li>
            <li>If you can relate, I strongly urge you to get this.  </li>
            <li>and I have really fine hair and use about 6 pumps, rub it in my hands and distribute in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Luckily there&#x27;s an argan oil spray in my arsenal for that. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>In my quest for a product to add volume to my hair after my favorite one was discontinued, I opted for this after reading the many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my permed hair smooth &amp; silky with lots of volume.  </li>
            <li>WOW - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE all these products.  </li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy and stays smooth.</li>
            <li>The brand is great overall</li>
            <li>It works well to smooth out hair</li>
            <li>It smells like men&#x27;s cheap cologne</li>
            <li>Left my hair very oily but it smells so good!!</li>
            <li>I am a &#x27;top shelf&#x27; hair product junkie, and I&#x27;ll consider paying a lot to get the right stuff for my hair.</li>
            <li>Results were worth the effort!</li>
            <li>I hope this never goes off the market--it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The Biotherm has a very pleasing scent, but so far I have not found it to be very effective for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special with this one.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair (and a lot of it), and this seems to do the trick for a good blow out.</li>
            <li>This was important for me to understand going in because I tend to be of the philosophy that if a little is good, a LOT will be that much better.  </li>
            <li>thought it wise to buy an entire line, looking to add fullness/body/volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair looks much healthier and is more manageable during styling.  </li>
            <li>but if I keep my expectations reasonable, it sorta was magic.  </li>
            <li>and I get 5 to 6 high end products that I would never buy on my own with trying them first.  </li>
            <li>I used various amounts to test it to make sure it wasnt just &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Didnt see the magical &amp;#34;strand expand&amp;#34;  at all.  </li>
            <li>This product is super.</li>
            <li>I got a sample from my hairdresser, and was at first a bit apprehensive, as I know hairdressers recommend whatever they used, but since it was a free sample I decided to give it a try- using the shampoo, conditionar and plumping strand expand product.</li>
            <li>Really helps my baby fine hair look full and have shine.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair thicker and much healthier!!</li>
            <li>I would then be on e-bay willing to pay just about anything for it!</li>
            <li>For the price, it didn&#x27;t really thicken my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and had the same pleasant (though not subtle if you are scent-sensitive) smell that I remembered.</li>
            <li>; not too VOLUMIZING yet feels very good for your hair gives a moderate amount of overall fullness.</li>
            <li>I have tried many good products like Redken or Matrix, or Loreal Professional (or purely organic brands), but nothing works and shows such immediate effects as this one.</li>
            <li>Still trying to decide if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li>Pricey but absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve tried every thickening shampoo, conditioner and styling product on the planet and have had varying degrees of success with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have baby-fine hair and most products cannot be used anywhere near the root of my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this product as good as the other reviews.</li>
            <li>Nope, no VOLUME, which is, after all, what this stuff is supposed to do, right?  </li>
            <li>I recommend if you too have very fine hair, especially if yours, like mine, tends to be a bit wavy and unruly.</li>
            <li>It will bring your smile back:)</li>
            <li>Used for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to buy them all, I suggest purchase the Volume Plumping Strand Expand as your first purchase.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and customer service was great!Thank you!</li>
            <li>First time trying this product.  </li>
            <li>I used this a couple of times &amp; thought it was pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think it works!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands and even different types.</li>
            <li>This product gave me a lot of volume that stayed all day in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the most ineffective product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>If I could give this an even higher rating, I would.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the Strand Expand lotion when I got a sample of it in a Beauty Brands order.  </li>
            <li>In fact everyone that&#x27;s seen it wants one!</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much volume my hair got!</li>
            <li>It used to be much thicker, but I, like fine wine, have aged!! :-)  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that I was able to control my urge to use lots of product and used very small amounts (about the size of a pea for my head area, then I added another pea sized dollop and worked it through the ends of my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li>Full and natural  I sent it to a friend</li>
            <li>This product, used all alone on clean towel dried hair, created so much volume, I feel like I actually have a nice head of hair!</li>
            <li>Definitely not something I would buy again to use on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>You only want to use one or two pumps - a little goes a very long way toward smoothing the outermost cuticle of the hair and taming flyaways and getting a much more satisfactory blow-dry.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to volumize a bit, but the thing I am most pleased about is what it doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li>Has a nice cleam smell and a little bit goes along way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light (I apply it all over my hair- from roots to ends, smells good, gives the hair bounce and you need very little amount to have an effect so the bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how fabulous this product is for me.  </li>
            <li>I actually really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Just a caution - don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Follow the package directions regarding how much to use.</li>
            <li>I really cannot say if I like the performance of this product or not.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any difference using this product.</li>
            <li>I received my much anticipated purchase today.</li>
            <li>It really worked.</li>
            <li>So far I think it is only ok.</li>
            <li>It absolutely helps with my fine straight long hair.</li>
            <li>Better than other styling products.  </li>
            <li>The hold and volume last the day (with some hairspray), and second day hair is almost better than the first.</li>
            <li>I have used other Alterna products &amp; this rates among the top.</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair on the top of my head due to thyroid issues.  </li>
            <li>Smells fabulous and lasts long.</li>
            <li>After reading most of the reviews I decided that using a very small amount of the product was likely key to getting good results.  </li>
            <li>Really nice non-greasy product for long hair that tends to get dry on the ends.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Yet my hair had over twice the volume it normally has.</li>
            <li>I make sure to apply it from root all the way to end on damp (but not dripping hair), blowdry with a round brush, and voila.</li>
            <li>I use three pumps normally.</li>
            <li>and it was good, but not great.</li>
            <li>I have thick, but very fine hair that does nothing but lay straight.  </li>
            <li>I have super thin, fine, straight hair that I have always described as &amp;#34;the</li>
            <li>i notice how fuller and smooth my hair is ,depending on the length of you hair you may need to use more or less because you want fuller hair without weighing it down this is a 5 star hair product!</li>
            <li>Very soft after the hair finishes drying.</li>
            <li>My hair is probably normal as far as thickness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I need to apply more</li>
            <li>This product will WOW you!  </li>
            <li>I was made aware of this product when my stylist used it after my cut and color at my last appointment.</li>
            <li>it gives my fine hair structure and slight hold.</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of volumizing products over the years and this is the only one that has given me consistent volume throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use--just pump a little of it into your hand, then massage into hair from roots to tips.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very thin and this is a remarkable product for volume.  </li>
            <li>By the end of the day my hair is pretty much flat.  </li>
            <li>and so far it does what it says.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far from volumizing.</li>
            <li>It adds a lot of fullness but remains soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with the volume starting with the roots.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and shiny with lots of body that doesn&#x27;t fade.  </li>
            <li>I tried this one instead - but as far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>Like so many of the other reviewers, I have baby fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe all the women who rated this highly don&#x27;t have fine, limp, short hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this product for volume and lift it gives my roots when I blow dry upside down.  </li>
            <li>so I used a little too much the first time, about a nickel to a quarter amount.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hairs, but a very full head of them, and I still have crazy flyaways whether I air/blow dry.</li>
            <li>High expectations, no, only hope.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine thin hair and this product really lives up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>It adds so much volume to my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>I will give it a few more tries before I give up on it.</li>
            <li>It comes out in such a small amount with just one pump that I tried 3 the first time and found that was too much!</li>
            <li>if you have fine hair like me, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use a light hand when applying it and keep your expectations in check; if you are expecting for a cream to give you somebody else&#x27;s thick fabulous hair (as part of me always hopes/expects) you will be disappointed, but if you want your hair to look *</li>
            <li>.it lifts me up and never lets me down ;)</li>
            <li>Thick, full, no dry ends and no heavy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine, thin hair and have been searching for a product that would give it some natural volume for years now.</li>
            <li>On the contrary, I found that it tends to weigh my hair down and, no, I didn&#x27;t apply a large amount of it.</li>
            <li>I used Alterna for the first time a few days ago, and trust me..</li>
            <li>This product was a little more than I usually spend</li>
            <li>It just made my hair feel heavy and did not do a thing positive for it.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine and thin</li>
            <li>If you have fine, thin hair like me that won&#x27;t hold a style, I would definitely recommend this.</li>

            <li> This is a really good product</li>
            <li> and I really loved it.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair gorgeous time after time.</li>
            <li> Fair</li>
            <li> If you want a lot of volume adding a good non-sticky  root lifter (ie &amp;#34;Alternna 48</li>
            <li> Great for people with very fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> This product is so great for my hair:)</li>
            <li> packaging and price for the amount of product is great, but I think I&#x27;ll try something else for more volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>

            <li> love alterna!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so thought something to add body would be great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly nothing like the hemp thickening compound, which was awesome.  </li>
            <li> This works for fine hair not sticky light perfect</li>
            <li> In addition, the smell of the product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> - this is light weight - great</li>
            <li> I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> gives your hair nice volume.</li>
            <li> it add so much volume and feels great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell how effective this is, but it appears to just keep my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> and she was thrilled with the results</li>
            <li> and she had nice volume.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest about this review.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good in fine hair, but I think I&#x27;m most sold on the wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li> What I got was hair that looks as thick as it does on its *best* days, but without all the work I have to spend getting it to be its best.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use &amp; gives my hair a feeling of volume.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have tried products galore!</li>
            <li> I had experienced severe hair loss over a period of six months; losing a large portion of my volume.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Did I get better results?</li>
            <li> I do think it makes my hair look and feel fuller and the style lasts for more than one day.  </li>
            <li> but I love the way my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better product that volume plumps my hair as well as Alterna Bamboo. ...</li>
            <li> My mistake, however I still love this product.  </li>
            <li> So glad I could find it here.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product...</li>
            <li> It dulled it more than I would like.  </li>
            <li> the product magic?  </li>
            <li> My hair also appears more shiny and bouncy than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luck Lovy&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> I am using 4 pumps and that is more than it</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed with this product is that I can get away with not washing my hair for 4 days without it looking greasy!!! :-)</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the volume I get.</li>
            <li> I use it with Alterna Bamboo Volume 48 and Sexy Hair Spray Clay  </li>
            <li> If you are searching for a product that does what it claims, and is healthy for the hair....</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This works well to give my hair more body, and also to help style it.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> The Was ok</li>
            <li> never never I order this product again ok</li>
            <li> and they work better than this one.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I could find  Cristophe  spray tonic.</li>
            <li> When I asked my hairdresser whether I can see the effect already after one usage (because I thought you need more long-term care), she said of course.</li>
            <li> If you want a great volume, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for fine straight hair, adds volume and styling is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Will fine something else that works better and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and nothing works until this line of hair product also very good is Carol Daughter same ingredient.</li>
            <li> more airy &amp; light foamy</li>
            <li> Works great leave hair feeling natural.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, smells delicious and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, which is important to me because I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> As I am, like many of us are, very cost-conscious, I decided it best to leave her a generous tip and see if the product she recommended was available online for the same or a better price</li>
            <li> If you can relate, I strongly urge you to get this.  </li>
            <li> and I have really fine hair and use about 6 pumps, rub it in my hands and distribute in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Luckily there&#x27;s an argan oil spray in my arsenal for that. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> In my quest for a product to add volume to my hair after my favorite one was discontinued, I opted for this after reading the many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my permed hair smooth &amp; silky with lots of volume.  </li>
            <li> WOW - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE all these products.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy and stays smooth.</li>
            <li> The brand is great overall</li>
            <li> It works well to smooth out hair</li>
            <li> It smells like men&#x27;s cheap cologne</li>
            <li> Left my hair very oily but it smells so good!!</li>
            <li> I am a &#x27;top shelf&#x27; hair product junkie, and I&#x27;ll consider paying a lot to get the right stuff for my hair.</li>
            <li> Results were worth the effort!</li>
            <li> I hope this never goes off the market--it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The Biotherm has a very pleasing scent, but so far I have not found it to be very effective for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special with this one.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair (and a lot of it), and this seems to do the trick for a good blow out.</li>
            <li> This was important for me to understand going in because I tend to be of the philosophy that if a little is good, a LOT will be that much better.  </li>
            <li> thought it wise to buy an entire line, looking to add fullness/body/volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> Hair looks much healthier and is more manageable during styling.  </li>
            <li> but if I keep my expectations reasonable, it sorta was magic.  </li>
            <li> and I get 5 to 6 high end products that I would never buy on my own with trying them first.  </li>
            <li> I used various amounts to test it to make sure it wasnt just &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Didnt see the magical &amp;#34;strand expand&amp;#34;  at all.  </li>
            <li> This product is super.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from my hairdresser, and was at first a bit apprehensive, as I know hairdressers recommend whatever they used, but since it was a free sample I decided to give it a try- using the shampoo, conditionar and plumping strand expand product.</li>
            <li> Really helps my baby fine hair look full and have shine.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair thicker and much healthier!!</li>
            <li> I would then be on e-bay willing to pay just about anything for it!</li>
            <li> For the price, it didn&#x27;t really thicken my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and had the same pleasant (though not subtle if you are scent-sensitive) smell that I remembered.</li>
            <li> ; not too VOLUMIZING yet feels very good for your hair gives a moderate amount of overall fullness.</li>
            <li> I have tried many good products like Redken or Matrix, or Loreal Professional (or purely organic brands), but nothing works and shows such immediate effects as this one.</li>
            <li> Still trying to decide if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li> Pricey but absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every thickening shampoo, conditioner and styling product on the planet and have had varying degrees of success with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine hair and most products cannot be used anywhere near the root of my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this product as good as the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Nope, no VOLUME, which is, after all, what this stuff is supposed to do, right?  </li>
            <li> I recommend if you too have very fine hair, especially if yours, like mine, tends to be a bit wavy and unruly.</li>
            <li> It will bring your smile back:)</li>
            <li> Used for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to buy them all, I suggest purchase the Volume Plumping Strand Expand as your first purchase.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and customer service was great!Thank you!</li>
            <li> First time trying this product.  </li>
            <li> I used this a couple of times &amp; thought it was pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really think it works!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brands and even different types.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a lot of volume that stayed all day in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the most ineffective product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> If I could give this an even higher rating, I would.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the Strand Expand lotion when I got a sample of it in a Beauty Brands order.  </li>
            <li> In fact everyone that&#x27;s seen it wants one!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much volume my hair got!</li>
            <li> It used to be much thicker, but I, like fine wine, have aged!! :-)  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that I was able to control my urge to use lots of product and used very small amounts (about the size of a pea for my head area, then I added another pea sized dollop and worked it through the ends of my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li> Full and natural  I sent it to a friend</li>
            <li> This product, used all alone on clean towel dried hair, created so much volume, I feel like I actually have a nice head of hair!</li>
            <li> Definitely not something I would buy again to use on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> You only want to use one or two pumps - a little goes a very long way toward smoothing the outermost cuticle of the hair and taming flyaways and getting a much more satisfactory blow-dry.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to volumize a bit, but the thing I am most pleased about is what it doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> Has a nice cleam smell and a little bit goes along way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light (I apply it all over my hair- from roots to ends, smells good, gives the hair bounce and you need very little amount to have an effect so the bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how fabulous this product is for me.  </li>
            <li> I actually really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Just a caution - don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Follow the package directions regarding how much to use.</li>
            <li> I really cannot say if I like the performance of this product or not.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any difference using this product.</li>
            <li> I received my much anticipated purchase today.</li>
            <li> It really worked.</li>
            <li> So far I think it is only ok.</li>
            <li> It absolutely helps with my fine straight long hair.</li>
            <li> Better than other styling products.  </li>
            <li> The hold and volume last the day (with some hairspray), and second day hair is almost better than the first.</li>
            <li> I have used other Alterna products &amp; this rates among the top.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair on the top of my head due to thyroid issues.  </li>
            <li> Smells fabulous and lasts long.</li>
            <li> After reading most of the reviews I decided that using a very small amount of the product was likely key to getting good results.  </li>
            <li> Really nice non-greasy product for long hair that tends to get dry on the ends.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yet my hair had over twice the volume it normally has.</li>
            <li> I make sure to apply it from root all the way to end on damp (but not dripping hair), blowdry with a round brush, and voila.</li>
            <li> I use three pumps normally.</li>
            <li> and it was good, but not great.</li>
            <li> I have thick, but very fine hair that does nothing but lay straight.  </li>
            <li> I have super thin, fine, straight hair that I have always described as &amp;#34;the</li>
            <li> i notice how fuller and smooth my hair is ,depending on the length of you hair you may need to use more or less because you want fuller hair without weighing it down this is a 5 star hair product!</li>
            <li> Very soft after the hair finishes drying.</li>
            <li> My hair is probably normal as far as thickness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I need to apply more</li>
            <li> This product will WOW you!  </li>
            <li> I was made aware of this product when my stylist used it after my cut and color at my last appointment.</li>
            <li> it gives my fine hair structure and slight hold.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of volumizing products over the years and this is the only one that has given me consistent volume throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use--just pump a little of it into your hand, then massage into hair from roots to tips.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very thin and this is a remarkable product for volume.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the day my hair is pretty much flat.  </li>
            <li> and so far it does what it says.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far from volumizing.</li>
            <li> It adds a lot of fullness but remains soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li> Really helps with the volume starting with the roots.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and shiny with lots of body that doesn&#x27;t fade.  </li>
            <li> I tried this one instead - but as far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> Like so many of the other reviewers, I have baby fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe all the women who rated this highly don&#x27;t have fine, limp, short hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this product for volume and lift it gives my roots when I blow dry upside down.  </li>
            <li> so I used a little too much the first time, about a nickel to a quarter amount.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hairs, but a very full head of them, and I still have crazy flyaways whether I air/blow dry.</li>
            <li> High expectations, no, only hope.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine thin hair and this product really lives up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> It adds so much volume to my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li> I will give it a few more tries before I give up on it.</li>
            <li> It comes out in such a small amount with just one pump that I tried 3 the first time and found that was too much!</li>
            <li> if you have fine hair like me, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use a light hand when applying it and keep your expectations in check; if you are expecting for a cream to give you somebody else&#x27;s thick fabulous hair (as part of me always hopes/expects) you will be disappointed, but if you want your hair to look *</li>
            <li> .it lifts me up and never lets me down ;)</li>
            <li> Thick, full, no dry ends and no heavy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine, thin hair and have been searching for a product that would give it some natural volume for years now.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, I found that it tends to weigh my hair down and, no, I didn&#x27;t apply a large amount of it.</li>
            <li> I used Alterna for the first time a few days ago, and trust me..</li>
            <li> This product was a little more than I usually spend</li>
            <li> It just made my hair feel heavy and did not do a thing positive for it.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine and thin</li>
            <li> If you have fine, thin hair like me that won&#x27;t hold a style, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> My hair has been looking a little thin lately, so I decided to give this stuff a chance after being impressed by some other Alterna products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day I used this, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t need to adjust or correct my pony tail during the day; I have thin and soft hair, so I&#x27;m used to constantly correcting my hairstyle throughout the day because pony tail holders and clips will just slide out my hair</li>
            <li> And my hair is not thin, they are rather dense, but long and heavy, so they tend to get volume-less.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my L&#x27;Oreal volume mousse with a better quality product; (one free of all the crap that they put in products that destroy our hair color, texture and manageability)</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Alterna hair products i buy alot of them and none seem to fail me,This Bamboo Volume Plumping Strand works wonders for my hair especially with the humid weather</li>
            <li> I have short thick very stright hair.  </li>
            <li> A few small pump give your hair a bit more fullness and body, without being as heavy as (say) the Bamboo Mousse products.</li>
            <li> I never buy expensive hair products but got a free sample of this.  </li>
            <li> A few dabs of the lotion at the roots adds body that lasts all day, and my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my very thin fine hair thicker and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and other in the Bamboo line.</li>
            <li> ;  In addidion my hair is also color processed and quite dry.</li>
            <li> and then when you blow dry your hair</li>
            <li> I use the bamboo dry kendi oil after I blow dry</li>
            <li> then the rest then blow dry.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m always skeptical of products that claim to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; strands, Alterna Bamboo Volume products have worked for my fine, straight, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> overall, it leaves my hair looking weighed down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit hesitant to try this, especially since several previous reviewers mentioned it weighed their hair down.  </li>
            <li> Not only did the Recovery Shampoo &amp; Conditioner make my hair like seaweed it and was it a total waste of $69, customer service was literally non existent!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mostly, it does what it says without being heavy or sticky, although the effect is pretty subtle.</li>
            <li> I put a little in as soon as I&#x27;ve toweled the hair dry, and then can either blow dry my hair of just put it where I want it and let it dry in that position.  </li>
            <li> This product helps to add texture and volume to thin, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Finally I found what I need for my curly hair - doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky or heavy</li>
            <li> - only prob is that it took me a few times to master the amount.  </li>
            <li> Well, let me put it this way, my hair didn&#x27;t come out looking like Cindy Crawford&#x27;s thick, lush bouncy mane...</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> even tried just using this item in conjunction with the shampoo, leaving out the other two.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I was expecting it to be another dud, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> i add about 5 pumps in my hand while hair is wet and start from roots down and after styling my hair</li>
            <li> It was a little heavy feeling so the next time I used a dime size.</li>
            <li> Had high expectations for this product and was disappointed when it sadly failed to perform any better than a store bought product.</li>
            <li> This is the only product which tames my thick hair during the summer.  </li>
            <li> - it does not weigh my hair down or make it appear greasy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if I expected too much, chose the wrong product, or if it&#x27;s just my hair, but this entire line was a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, half of the product had leaked all over the plastic bag it was in.</li>
            <li> Use a little bit and makes hair shine as well as a little boost in volume.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use a little, and you should you a little.</li>
            <li> I combed through my hair and then blow dried.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit on the heavy side, so</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that heavy product feel.  </li>
            <li> Then I blow try my hair with a round brush and set with Velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t give my hair any control or volume - I must be missing something.</li>
            <li> I usually squirt 2-3 pumps into my fingers and rub in my roots and then pull down to the tips of my hair.</li>
            <li> If I could give less than one star, I would!</li>
            <li> blow dried with my usual dryer brush and even used a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I got a small ,85 oz sample in a the Allure beauty box I receive each month</li>
            <li> I usually look the product up and read the reviews before I try it</li>
            <li> Then just blow-dry and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> I use a small tab.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and wanted something other than mousse or spray to give me some volume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are less expensive</li>
            <li> I keep at least 6 bottles in reserve in case it should be discontinued by the company.  </li>
            <li> but I was desperate to find something that would give me volume and not go flat after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> Other products leave my hair feeling stiff and dirty, not this one.  </li>
            <li> it even smells worse.  </li>
            <li> and this makes a dramatic difference in the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an obsessive fan of Alterna&#x27;s hemp thickening product for years and was seriously bummed when they inexplicably stopped making it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> I can say I HATE the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> worst part of being me.&amp;#34</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Keeps my permed hair smooth &amp; silky with lots of volume.  It smells great, too!  I use it after every shampoo!</li>
            <li> My hair was very thin and this is a remarkable product for volume.  Love it</li>
            <li> Still trying to decide if it is worth the money. I guess I need to try not using it for a few days to see if it makes that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Best hair product for controlling fine hair.  Just excellent.</li>
            <li> Did this do what it said it was going to? Sort of. Did it do it enough to satisfy me? No.&lt;br /&gt;Will I ever buy it again? No.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it wise to buy an entire line, looking to add fullness/body/volume to my hair. I wanted the shampoo, conditioner, mousse and volumizer. I thought it a good idea to use them all together.&lt;br /&gt;Did they perform to expectation? No.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried just using this item in conjunction with the shampoo, leaving out the other two. Did I get better results? No.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I expected too much, chose the wrong product, or if it&#x27;s just my hair, but this entire line was a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> This product helps to add texture and volume to thin, straight hair.  In addition, the smell of the product is amazing.  Hair looks much healthier and is more manageable during styling.  I would definitely recommend this product and other in the Bamboo line.</li>
            <li> it does make a difference on the thickness of your hair.  I do think it makes my hair look and feel fuller and the style lasts for more than one day.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> Great product. The first day I used this, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t need to adjust or correct my pony tail during the day; I have thin and soft hair, so I&#x27;m used to constantly correcting my hairstyle throughout the day because pony tail holders and clips will just slide out my hair (braids will also come undone). Now everything stays in place because my hair is noticeably thicker.</li>
            <li> Had high expectations for this product and was disappointed when it sadly failed to perform any better than a store bought product. Definitely not something I would buy again to use on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time today.  I am thrilled.  Like so many of the other reviewers, I have baby fine and thin hair.  This product, used all alone on clean towel dried hair, created so much volume, I feel like I actually have a nice head of hair!</li>
            <li> Save your money and time</li>
            <li> WOW - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE all these products.  My hair is bouncy, shiny (no fly-aways), and looks fuller.  I think this is the BEST hair product I have used in years!!!  I used all 3; shampoo, condition and Bamboo Volume Plumping strand for fuller hair, and I used the fuller pumping strand alone..............it is wonderful!!!!  I don&#x27;t know what the one star user did but I love the way my hair looks and feels.  My hair is probably normal as far as thickness.  It used to be much thicker, but I, like fine wine, have aged!! :-)  I do have blond color with highlights and wavy hair. Now, I have luxurious, big, bouncy curls and waves. I love my hair!!  I can&#x27;t say enough about how fabulous this product is for me.  If you don&#x27;t want to buy them all, I suggest purchase the Volume Plumping Strand Expand as your first purchase.  (I received all the products as a sample at a luxury spa.)</li>
            <li> This is the only product which tames my thick hair during the summer.  My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy and stays smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair has been looking a little thin lately, so I decided to give this stuff a chance after being impressed by some other Alterna products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly, it does what it says without being heavy or sticky, although the effect is pretty subtle. A few small pump give your hair a bit more fullness and body, without being as heavy as (say) the Bamboo Mousse products. The scent is also pleasant without being overpowering. For me, I like it - especially in the summer when I tend to have shorter, simpler hairstyles. Still, if you expect miracles, then you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product</li>
            <li> I used Alterna for the first time a few days ago, and trust me..I was skeptical.  These &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; products never seem to work. Well, this one did.  Concentrated on my roots, and then whatever was left I combed through my hair and then blow dried.  I had voluminous roots like never before, and it lasted through to the next day.  It is a bit on the heavy side, so if you have fine hair like me, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Better than other styling products.  Use a little bit and makes hair shine as well as a little boost in volume.</li>
            <li> Just great! gives your hair nice volume. Spend the money and repair your hair! This stuff is wonderful! Fast delivery and customer service was great!Thank you!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better product that volume plumps my hair as well as Alterna Bamboo. ...and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> best i have ever used,</li>
            <li> I have baby fine thin hair and this product really lives up to it&#x27;s name. Pricey but absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> I got a small ,85 oz sample in a the Allure beauty box I receive each month (It&#x27;s $15 a month and I get 5 to 6 high end products that I would never buy on my own with trying them first.  So I recommend BeautyBar.com - Sample Society - with Allure).  I usually look the product up and read the reviews before I try it but this time I didn&#x27;t.  My mistake, however I still love this product.  I have color treated hair and its on the fine/thin side so I used a little too much the first time, about a nickel to a quarter amount. Yet my hair had over twice the volume it normally has. It was a little heavy feeling so the next time I used a dime size. I felt like it wasn&#x27;t enough but I didn&#x27;t use anymore and it was perfect. Thick, full, no dry ends and no heavy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and will be buying it from now on!&lt;br /&gt;I also received the Bamboo 48 - HOUR sustainable Volume Spray in this box. I used it before I tried the Plumping Strand and it was good, but not great. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Nothing special with this one.</li>
            <li> Hair salon where I go to used to carry this product and I really loved it.  They no longer carry the product, so I went online to see if I could find it.  So glad I could find it here.  Great for people with very fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my L&#x27;Oreal volume mousse with a better quality product; (one free of all the crap that they put in products that destroy our hair color, texture and manageability) I am so glad I found this product...I love it!.</li>
            <li> For the price, it didn&#x27;t really thicken my fine hair.  It dulled it more than I would like.  I probably won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product.  I have thin hair and wanted something other than mousse or spray to give me some volume.  It comes out in such a small amount with just one pump that I tried 3 the first time and found that was too much! So with just a pump or two I expect this product will last for quite a while.  My hair definitely feels thicker when I use it.</li>
            <li> Great product line for hair that needs to be fuller.  It doesn&#x27;t have that heavy product feel.  The shampoo and rinse out conditioner are wonderful too.</li>
            <li> Finally I found what I need for my curly hair - doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky or heavy - this is light weight - great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like fruity, feminine scents in my hair products and this definitely has a unisex scent.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very oily but it smells so good!!</li>
            <li> nothing has changed about this Alterna volume formula for several years I have used it. It makes my hair gorgeous time after time. Smells fabulous and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this several times now from Amazon and it&#x27;s one hair product I will stick with. It makes my very thin fine hair thicker and easier to manage. Just a caution - don&#x27;t use too much. Follow the package directions regarding how much to use.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion - only prob is that it took me a few times to master the amount.  Results were worth the effort!</li>
            <li> This product is so great for my hair:) it add so much volume and feels great!</li>
            <li> Great service and product is as designed</li>
            <li> I have super thin, fine, straight hair that I have always described as &amp;#34;the worst part of being me.&amp;#34;  In addidion my hair is also color processed and quite dry. I think I&#x27;ve tried every thickening shampoo, conditioner and styling product on the planet and have had varying degrees of success with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit hesitant to try this, especially since several previous reviewers mentioned it weighed their hair down.  After reading most of the reviews I decided that using a very small amount of the product was likely key to getting good results.  This was important for me to understand going in because I tend to be of the philosophy that if a little is good, a LOT will be that much better.  I am pleased to say that I was able to control my urge to use lots of product and used very small amounts (about the size of a pea for my head area, then I added another pea sized dollop and worked it through the ends of my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the product magic?  Well, let me put it this way, my hair didn&#x27;t come out looking like Cindy Crawford&#x27;s thick, lush bouncy mane...but if I keep my expectations reasonable, it sorta was magic.  What I got was hair that looks as thick as it does on its *best* days, but without all the work I have to spend getting it to be its best.  My hair also appears more shiny and bouncy than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re considering this stuff go for it!  Just be sure to use a light hand when applying it and keep your expectations in check; if you are expecting for a cream to give you somebody else&#x27;s thick fabulous hair (as part of me always hopes/expects) you will be disappointed, but if you want your hair to look *its* best this stuff might well do the trick.  I have no doubt that this product will become a bathroom shelf staple</li>
            <li> Does make my hair fuller</li>
            <li> First time trying this product.  The brand is great overall and so far it does what it says.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m impressed by this product.. It works well to smooth out hair but it&#x27;s far from volumizing. On the contrary, I found that it tends to weigh my hair down and, no, I didn&#x27;t apply a large amount of it.</li>
            <li> High expectations, no, only hope.  I have straight fine hair.  I used this a couple of times &amp; thought it was pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, it leaves my hair looking weighed down.  I used various amounts to test it to make sure it wasnt just &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Didnt see the magical &amp;#34;strand expand&amp;#34;  at all.  Would not buy again, so my search continues.  I think its best I just stick&lt;br /&gt;to more airy &amp; light foamy products.&lt;br /&gt;Still a fan of Aveda Phomollient….it lifts me up and never lets me down ;)&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck Lovy&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> I really cannot say if I like the performance of this product or not.  I have had it for about two months and I have really fine hair and use about 6 pumps, rub it in my hands and distribute in my hair.  I dont think it works that great.  By the end of the day my hair is pretty much flat.  I can say I HATE the smell of this product.  It smells like men&#x27;s cheap cologne and then when you blow dry your hair it even smells worse.  I will not repurchase this item.  Will fine something else that works better and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  Makes my hair thicker and much healthier!! I use the bamboo dry kendi oil after I blow dry and I love how they work together!!  I love all the Alterna products!!</li>
            <li> Adds volumn without being sticky or flaking.  Has a nice cleam smell and a little bit goes along way.  Really helps my baby fine hair look full and have shine.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, perfect delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this product as good as the other reviews. I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I need to apply more and I plan to write the company to find out why. I am using 4 pumps and that is more than it hows. So far I think it is only ok.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling filmy.</li>
            <li> I am a &#x27;top shelf&#x27; hair product junkie, and I&#x27;ll consider paying a lot to get the right stuff for my hair. I have long, fine hair (and a lot of it), and this seems to do the trick for a good blow out. It adds a lot of fullness but remains soft and shiny. I make sure to apply it from root all the way to end on damp (but not dripping hair), blowdry with a round brush, and voila. The hold and volume last the day (with some hairspray), and second day hair is almost better than the first. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This does the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I had used the hemp thickening compound almost religiously prior to trying this product. I can&#x27;t tell how effective this is, but it appears to just keep my hair moisturized. I have very fine hairs, but a very full head of them, and I still have crazy flyaways whether I air/blow dry. Luckily there&#x27;s an argan oil spray in my arsenal for that. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and price for the amount of product is great, but I think I&#x27;ll try something else for more volume.</li>
            <li> I really think it works! It&#x27;s really light (I apply it all over my hair- from roots to ends, smells good, gives the hair bounce and you need very little amount to have an effect so the bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Really nice non-greasy product for long hair that tends to get dry on the ends. Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good in fine hair, but I think I&#x27;m most sold on the wonderful fragrance.  It smells great.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have tried products galore! This product is simply AWESOME and FANTASTIC!!!! ! Hair fullness lasts all day. Another thing I noticed with this product is that I can get away with not washing my hair for 4 days without it looking greasy!!! :-) Simply put - IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  I actually put some of this with the bamboo mouse and rub my hands together then apply to my hair.  I love the volume I get.</li>
            <li> I have used other Alterna products &amp; this rates among the top. Very easy to use &amp; gives my hair a feeling of volume.</li>
            <li> Works great leave hair feeling natural.  No product residue.</li>
            <li> Love this product for volume and lift it gives my roots when I blow dry upside down.  I use it with Alterna Bamboo Volume 48 and Sexy Hair Spray Clay  and I look like I have a LOT OF HAIR.  I love the combo!</li>
            <li> This product is super. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, smells delicious and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, which is important to me because I have very fine hair. It adds volume, body, shine and manageability, while also protecting the color of your hair.</li>
            <li> This product will WOW you!  If you are searching for a product that does what it claims, and is healthy for the hair....look no further.  I had experienced severe hair loss over a period of six months; losing a large portion of my volume.  If you can relate, I strongly urge you to get this.  It will bring your smile back:)</li>
            <li> Great for fine straight hair, adds volume and styling is a breeze. I use their shampoo and conditioner too. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have short thick very stright hair.  I use about 7 pumps into my palm then work it into the roots then the rest then blow dry. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  I have thick, but very fine hair that does nothing but lay straight.  This is the only product I have found that will give me some volume without feeling like I have put gunk in my hair.  Other products leave my hair feeling stiff and dirty, not this one.  I love it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> In my quest for a product to add volume to my hair after my favorite one was discontinued, I opted for this after reading the many positive reviews.  The Biotherm has a very pleasing scent, but so far I have not found it to be very effective for my needs.  I will give it a few more tries before I give up on it.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and this works to make my hair look. Full and natural  I sent it to a friend and she was thrilled with the results</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine, thin hair and have been searching for a product that would give it some natural volume for years now. I have tried so many brands and even different types. I have even tried a combination of several products and still nothing worked. I was browsing the internet and came across a blog that talked about this product. The girl in the blog had hair similar to mine and she had nice volume. This product was a little more than I usually spend but I was desperate to find something that would give me volume and not go flat after a couple hours. When I first got it, I was expecting it to be another dud, but I was wrong. This product gave me a lot of volume that stayed all day in the hot, humid weather. I usually squirt 2-3 pumps into my fingers and rub in my roots and then pull down to the tips of my hair. Then I blow try my hair with a round brush and set with Velcro rollers. I am so glad that my search for a great volumizing product is over! If you have fine, thin hair like me that won&#x27;t hold a style, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was made aware of this product when my stylist used it after my cut and color at my last appointment. As I am, like many of us are, very cost-conscious, I decided it best to leave her a generous tip and see if the product she recommended was available online for the same or a better price and it just so happenened it was. It arrived quickly and had the same pleasant (though not subtle if you are scent-sensitive) smell that I remembered. You only want to use one or two pumps - a little goes a very long way toward smoothing the outermost cuticle of the hair and taming flyaways and getting a much more satisfactory blow-dry.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to volumize a bit, but the thing I am most pleased about is what it doesn&#x27;t do - it does not weigh my hair down or make it appear greasy. I have baby-fine hair and most products cannot be used anywhere near the root of my hair but this one has not been a problem. I recommend if you too have very fine hair, especially if yours, like mine, tends to be a bit wavy and unruly.</li>
            <li> I use this strand expand lotion when I want to make an updo. it gives my fine hair structure and slight hold. And definitely volume. No fly-aways and my hair stays in place.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Alterna hair products i buy alot of them and none seem to fail me,This Bamboo Volume Plumping Strand works wonders for my hair especially with the humid weather i add about 5 pumps in my hand while hair is wet and start from roots down and after styling my hair i notice how fuller and smooth my hair is ,depending on the length of you hair you may need to use more or less because you want fuller hair without weighing it down this is a 5 star hair product!</li>
            <li> This product changed my life.  It adds so much volume to my fine thin hair.  Helps me control and keep the volume throughout the day.  I keep at least 6 bottles in reserve in case it should be discontinued by the company.  I would then be on e-bay willing to pay just about anything for it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any difference using this product. It does not do everything it is advertised as doing. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Fair; not too VOLUMIZING yet feels very good for your hair gives a moderate amount of overall fullness. If you want a lot of volume adding a good non-sticky  root lifter (ie &amp;#34;Alternna 48 hour&amp;#34;)would give you the best look</li>
            <li> one of the best hair products for fine hair</li>
            <li> Really helps with the volume starting with the roots.  Blow drying after you apply it helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this and use it with the Alterna volumizing shampoo and conditioner. It absolutely helps with my fine straight long hair. The instructions say to use a little, and you should you a little. I use three pumps normally. The second time I used it, I used 6. This was too much and left my hair greased after I dried it. A little goes a long way. The instructions were not lying.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m always skeptical of products that claim to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; strands, Alterna Bamboo Volume products have worked for my fine, straight, thin hair.  A few dabs of the lotion at the roots adds body that lasts all day, and my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the most ineffective product I have ever used.  It does NOTHING.  I followed the directions! blow dried with my usual dryer brush and even used a curling iron.  Nope, no VOLUME, which is, after all, what this stuff is supposed to do, right?  Maybe all the women who rated this highly don&#x27;t have fine, limp, short hair.  I&#x27;m talking baby hair here, ladies.  Hope I find something that works soon, as the product I was using has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> If I could give this an even higher rating, I would.  I first tried the Strand Expand lotion when I got a sample of it in a Beauty Brands order.  After just one use, I was hooked.  The lotion smells divine, and the scent lasts--even after I got home from a smoky barbecue place, my hair still smelled great!!!  This product is so easy to use--just pump a little of it into your hand, then massage into hair from roots to tips.  Then just blow-dry and style as usual.  I have tried tons of volumizing products over the years and this is the only one that has given me consistent volume throughout the day.  It leaves my hair so soft and shiny with lots of body that doesn&#x27;t fade.  I hope this never goes off the market--it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Definitely a go to product when you want to &amp;#34;plump it up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an obsessive fan of Alterna&#x27;s hemp thickening product for years and was seriously bummed when they inexplicably stopped making it. I tried this one instead - but as far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t do a thing. It&#x27;s certainly nothing like the hemp thickening compound, which was awesome.  This one doesn&#x27;t give my hair any control or volume - I must be missing something.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use a small tab. I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This works well to give my hair more body, and also to help style it.  I put a little in as soon as I&#x27;ve toweled the hair dry, and then can either blow dry my hair of just put it where I want it and let it dry in that position.  Very soft after the hair finishes drying.</li>
            <li> I was happy with Alterna Thickening Compound and could no longer find it and I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sticky and does not do the same job.  I will not order it again.  Why do companies stop making&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what people like and want to continue to buy?  It happens so often.</li>
            <li> I received my much anticipated purchase today. Unfortunately, half of the product had leaked all over the plastic bag it was in. Boo.</li>
            <li> I never buy expensive hair products but got a free sample of this.  After trying it, I have never used anything else.  I have very fine thin hair and this makes a dramatic difference in the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair on the top of my head due to thyroid issues.  I did like the smell of the product, but it didn&#x27;t thicken at all for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know who this would work for, just does not work for me.  I have fine hair, so thought something to add body would be great.  It just made my hair feel heavy and did not do a thing positive for it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. This is my second time purchasing it. The smell is amazing!!</li>
            <li> It does plump up my hair but it also dries it out</li>
            <li> It made my hair oily.</li>
            <li> The Was ok but I never buy this produce again or recommender  never never I order this product again ok</li>
            <li> I have to be honest about this review. Not only did the Recovery Shampoo &amp; Conditioner make my hair like seaweed it and was it a total waste of $69, customer service was literally non existent! I wrote them 4 emails regarding returning it and they did not have the decency of answering even ONE of them! I would never, ever buy anything from these people again! If I could give less than one star, I would!</li>
            <li> Good product but works best on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I love it! In fact everyone that&#x27;s seen it wants one!</li>
            <li> perfect for straight hair!</li>
            <li> This works for fine hair not sticky light perfect I have tried them all and nothing works until this line of hair product also very good is Carol Daughter same ingredient.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine and thin and when I couldn&#x27;t find  Cristophe Volumizing spray tonic any longer I tried this. Total waste of money!  I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are less expensive and they work better than this one. Sure wish I could find  Cristophe  spray tonic. It really worked.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and as described. Great product.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from my hairdresser, and was at first a bit apprehensive, as I know hairdressers recommend whatever they used, but since it was a free sample I decided to give it a try- using the shampoo, conditionar and plumping strand expand product. OMG! I cannot believe how much volume my hair got! And my hair is not thin, they are rather dense, but long and heavy, so they tend to get volume-less. If you want a great volume, I highly recommend this product. I have tried many good products like Redken or Matrix, or Loreal Professional (or purely organic brands), but nothing works and shows such immediate effects as this one. I have a sample for Alterna Shine and Caviar too, so after trying those two I will decide which one works best and buy that one! When I asked my hairdresser whether I can see the effect already after one usage (because I thought you need more long-term care), she said of course. I did not believe but here I have a proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also sample for Kendi Oil and it works great too (it is a bit greasy, so you have to use only a tiny bit and on your ends). love alterna!</li>
