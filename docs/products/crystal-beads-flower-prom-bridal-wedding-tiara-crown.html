            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Really nice quality.  </li>
            <li>This kind of tiara does not sit on the head without pins, and/or a veil and combs attached.</li>
            <li>I liked how the tiara looked on the head</li>
            <li>It is quite gorgeous; very sparkly, beautiful, and feminine.  </li>
            <li>I love the design, it&#x27;s very elegant.  </li>
            <li>The metal is very easily bendable.</li>
            <li>Just as nice as the ones $100 more at the bridal shops.</li>
            <li>Good quality materials and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  </li>
            <li>The floral detail is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this tiara.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>really in love w my tiara</li>
            <li>For this price, of course it&#x27;s cheap metal!</li>
            <li>this is everything i wanted and more.</li>
            <li>glad i chose it for my wedding &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It will be eye catching and beautiful for anyone&#x27;s big day.</li>
            <li>I collect tiaras and was really surprised at just how beautiful this one was., given the price.</li>
            <li>Looks more than what&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also easily breakable.  </li>
            <li>Looked just as nice if not nicer than ones priced 100&#x27;s of dollars higher.</li>
            <li>when the light hits it it shines</li>
            <li>I wore a traditional veil during the ceremony and switched to this gorgeous tiara for the reception</li>
            <li>a plus since it was quite big for my head but was easily bent a bit to sit better.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and would only stay on with the help of many, many bobby pins.</li>
            <li>Thks &#x3D;) is more than w i expected</li>
            <li>Good bcos easy to mold it to my daughter&#x27;s small baby head</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the right size for me.</li>
            <li>(although i got the street number wrong - i queried about what i can do about it from Amazon and Venus Jewelry and they replied quickly and clearly)  in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely feel like royalty for a day.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not really supposed to be worn more than once</li>
            <li>I actually found the light bending metal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size and you can&#x27;t miss it, but it&#x27;s certainly not too big.</li>
            <li>As long as one handles it with care, it should be fine.  </li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s a wedding tiara, or in my case, it goes on display and only comes out for fun.</li>
            <li>- I was instantly launched into princess mode and ready to celebrate!</li>
            <li>It is a bit flimsy feeling (as I had read in previous reviews), but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap; the metal is just thinner compared to others.  </li>
            <li>I actually expected it to be a little smaller, and was delighted at how substantial it is.</li>
            <li>i was able to find a necklace/earring set at deb for $15 and the flower in the middle of the necklace matched the little flower in the middle of the tiara.</li>
            <li>The details are much nicer than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>I had to be very careful when I had it on her and had to really watch on her every movement since she&#x27;s only 11 months old during the photoshoot time.</li>

            <li> ALSO, this is my second review, the other one was never posted, no reason was given.</li>
            <li> Not too big but not too small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy solid metal, it can be twisted in your hands.</li>
            <li> The metal is too soft it bends in unnecessary places..</li>
            <li> Did not arrive when it said it would either, which was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> However, it is very difficult to get to get it to stay on my head, even with bobbie pins, so I&#x27;ll rate it a 3 out of 5.</li>
            <li> but bad bcos</li>

            <li> The product is very attractive and the price is right.  However, it is very difficult to get to get it to stay on my head, even with bobbie pins, so I&#x27;ll rate it a 3 out of 5.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked me to buy this for her wedding.  The details are much nicer than I expected for the price.  The floral detail is lovely.  Just as nice as the ones $100 more at the bridal shops.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. Very flimsy and would only stay on with the help of many, many bobby pins.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this tiara.  It is quite gorgeous; very sparkly, beautiful, and feminine.  It is a bit flimsy feeling (as I had read in previous reviews), but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap; the metal is just thinner compared to others.  As long as one handles it with care, it should be fine.

            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! I put them on my daughter for a photoshoot session and they turned out flawless! Very happy with the glitterness and the price.  The metal is very easily bendable. Good bcos easy to mold it to my daughter&#x27;s small baby head but bad bcos it&#x27;s also easily breakable.  I had to be very careful when I had it on her and had to really watch on her every movement since she&#x27;s only 11 months old during the photoshoot time. I didnt want her to fall and hurt herself on that metal and I also didnt want the tiara to break.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous tiara at a great price!</li>
            <li> In 1-2 weeks i got the shipment to the correct address (although i got the street number wrong - i queried about what i can do about it from Amazon and Venus Jewelry and they replied quickly and clearly)  in perfect shape. After checking the contents i found it to be in perfect shape and precisely what i ordered. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product.  Daughter wore it a 16th birthday party!  Very nice!  Medium sized.  Doesn&#x27;t have the combs at end but the holes.</li>
            <li> Purchased this piece to wear at my wedding reception and I loved the way it completed my look!  Good quality materials and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  I wore a traditional veil during the ceremony and switched to this gorgeous tiara for the reception - I was instantly launched into princess mode and ready to celebrate!</li>
            <li> Had looked at a lot of places for the perfect tiara for my wedding and this was it. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li> really in love w my tiara Thks &#x3D;) is more than w i expected</li>
            <li> This was beautiful and served it&#x27;s purpose...  was bent and flimsy, but beautiful.  Did not arrive when it said it would either, which was disappointing.  ALSO, this is my second review, the other one was never posted, no reason was given.</li>
            <li> Not too big but not too small it&#x27;s the right size for me. It has a place for the bobby pins on the ends. when the light hits it it shines</li>
            <li> Wore for my wedding day.  Looked just as nice if not nicer than ones priced 100&#x27;s of dollars higher.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality.  My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I collect tiaras and was really surprised at just how beautiful this one was., given the price. I love the design, it&#x27;s very elegant.  I actually expected it to be a little smaller, and was delighted at how substantial it is. It&#x27;s a good size and you can&#x27;t miss it, but it&#x27;s certainly not too big. For this price, of course it&#x27;s cheap metal! What people are reviewing is that it bends. It&#x27;s not a heavy solid metal, it can be twisted in your hands. But it&#x27;s not really supposed to be worn more than once if it&#x27;s a wedding tiara, or in my case, it goes on display and only comes out for fun. I actually found the light bending metal a plus since it was quite big for my head but was easily bent a bit to sit better. NOTE: This kind of tiara does not sit on the head without pins, and/or a veil and combs attached. It must be attached to your head. If you don&#x27;t want to bother, get a comb tiara or headband. This one, is absolutely beautiful! The sparkle and the delicate flower blooms the rhinestones and beads make, is so pretty. It will be eye catching and beautiful for anyone&#x27;s big day.</li>
            <li> this is everything i wanted and more. i was able to find a necklace/earring set at deb for $15 and the flower in the middle of the necklace matched the little flower in the middle of the tiara. i definitely feel like a princess in this tiara! glad i chose it for my wedding &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! Looks more than what&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> The metal is too soft it bends in unnecessary places.. I liked how the tiara looked on the head just wished for a stronger metal</li>
