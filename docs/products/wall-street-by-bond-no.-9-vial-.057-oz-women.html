            <li> When it dies down on the skin, it really does smell like a wet dog.</li>
            <li> Last for a long time.</li>
            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> cologne will add to your \\&quot;little black book\\&quot; in a hurry</li>
            <li> son wears it everyday and he draws all the ladies attention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s price is not justified for the scent, at least not for a knuckle dragger like me</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> Candidly, I am incredibly disappointed with this purchase in that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long at all.</li>
            <li> Usually lasts at least 10 hours for me.</li>
            <li> It smells like metal mixed with wet dog and that doesn&#x27;t do the awful smell justice.</li>
            <li> Game changer.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product was not a great choice for me.</li>
            <li> and i was skeptical</li>
            <li> I could tell this wasn&#x27;t a fake because I understand there&#x27;s some risk out there when purchasing online.</li>
            <li> How sad :(</li>
            <li> Truly awful.</li>

            <li> I must say I bought this on a whim because i stumbled upon a 5 star review and i was skeptical but i figured i could return it. BUT NOT GONNA HAPPEN! At first the scent was a little strong for my taste then is settle into something amazing, my girl spent the night on my chest, and begged me not to move, hahaha! My new favorite cologne, and I own many. Worth the price, if you love to smell great.</li>

            <li> This is the real Bond No. 9 I bought from the store in New York, but much cheaper. I love the store because you get to try many different scents, but if you know which scent you would like to purhcase, Amazon gives you great deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal and smells great.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is not original,it was a gift for my husband... cheap ends up expensive, and he was absolutely right. How sad :(</li>
            <li> Smells great. ..my. son wears it everyday and he draws all the ladies attention. .The best iv smelled in a long time</li>
            <li> Smells real good,everyone wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing,will purchase it again,great buy for the price,love it,wear this all the time</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cologne to buy for my own use for a long while, and I really liked the smell of Bond No. 9 Wall Street for Men.  I had a chance to talk to a person at a local department store about the product.  I was told that I wouldn&#x27;t need to use much and the scent would stay with me the whole day.  Candidly, I am incredibly disappointed with this purchase in that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long at all.</li>
            <li> Stripper recommended this cologne to me.  It&#x27;s price is not justified for the scent, at least not for a knuckle dragger like me</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. Came very quickly.  Absolutely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My roomate gave me a sample bottle of this and I had to have it. I believe it was my first &amp;#34;High end&amp;#34; cologne. Game changer. No more cheap stuff for me. Pretty much Bond 9 or Creed, or if it&#x27;s a Parfum from another company, I will check it out. I get compliments!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved the cologne. Great gift!</li>
            <li> Love it! I get plenty of compliments on this one</li>
            <li> smells elegant and gorgeous. the smell doesn&#x27;t last long and so I go spray some more lol. wonderful. great package too.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this fragrance and have worn it for about 3 years now. Finding it on Amazon was amazing due to the amount that I was able to save.</li>
            <li> I had the complete opposite reaction. I found this scent so offensive, I couldn&#x27;t wash it off quickly enough. It smells like metal mixed with wet dog and that doesn&#x27;t do the awful smell justice. Truly awful. If I could give it 0 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> Bond never had this scent.  It is complicated and sophisticated.  Not for every guy.  It is for you gents who are trying to make a statement that you are a step beyond the norm.</li>
            <li> Bought about 7 years ago and finally used it all up so I was glad I could find this on here since the prices have gone up a lot since then. It&#x27;s a unique scent that won&#x27;t work on everyone. Your best bet with a lot of Bond No 9 fragrances is to test them in a store and buy them online. Usually lasts at least 10 hours for me. I could tell this wasn&#x27;t a fake because I understand there&#x27;s some risk out there when purchasing online.</li>
            <li> Get your smell good on with Wall Street Bond No. 9!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell of the product was not a great choice for me. When it dies down on the skin, it really does smell like a wet dog.</li>
            <li> Great for all day all night, and twice on Saturday best best best best best best the very best scent</li>
            <li> My son loves it!!!! We&#x27;re all team Bond now!!! I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more bond no 9 from here!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, love it!!!!!  People are always asking what fragrance am I wearing.  After washing your clothes, the scent still remains.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE - YOU&#x27;LL BE BETTER PAYING A LITTLE MORE FOR IT THE STORE</li>
            <li> A steal for the price.. this was 100% authentic and I&#x27;d smelled it before.. it&#x27;s basically a Creed ripoff (as are ALL of Bond no 9&#x27;s colognes), but it is still great.</li>
