            <li> I like this color, it is exactly what I expected.  It stays on for awhile and I like the &amp;#34;lightness&amp;#34; of this product, not a heavy feeling lipstick.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This lipstick has no staying power.  Also, it is lighter in color than shown.  It is definitely not a full-coverage lipstick.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the quality of this lipstick, it was even better than I had expected! You can use it for every occasion. I highly recommend it!</li>

            <li> I took it as gift to others but ended up using for myself. Good one with reasonable price compared to other sites</li>
            <li> First this color is GORGEOUS. Second revlon lip stick has no taste, and it does not smudge. I can even wear it without a lipliner</li>
            <li> At long last I have found the PERFECT red brown lipstick!! No purple or pink in it! The color is such that I can put it on for a dark look or blot it for a mellower lighter look! Very cool! It is very moisturizing and stays on better than other lipsticks I have tried! I will definitely be buying this color again!! Yay! Finally!</li>

            <li> The # is the same as they used to sell in the store (and been discontinued) .... But the color isn&#x27;t the same..</li>
