            <li>and it&#x27;s really soft and nice</li>
            <li>Yea it was nice and pretty when I first got it &amp; the  first week</li>
            <li>So far so good the hair came fast no shedding</li>
            <li>It is full and did not shed much (all hair will shed some).  </li>
            <li>It is very manageable, shiny, is quick to curl and holds curls for days.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>I must say that the is pretty, but it tangles and sheds a lot.</li>
            <li>but there is some definite shedding more than I would like</li>
            <li>First time buying anything from Amazon</li>
            <li>This is my first use of Malaysian hair.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend you to use this hair :-)</li>
            <li>The Hair is so Pretty</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know much about hair</li>
            <li>It was what I was expecting thanks</li>
            <li>so much I will be ordering some Brazilian hair</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m ready for this hair to come out.</li>
            <li>Also the hair does not hold curls very well</li>
            <li>even full looks old after one week smells like an old barber shop</li>
            <li>If only want it for a special occasion</li>
            <li>I love how soft and how the wave pattern stays in hair (while dry)...</li>
            <li>so I dunno if virgin hair is dyed normally</li>
            <li>Ive had alot of bad experience with online hair and this is great still on first installation!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m taking it out on new years eve.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but this hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and has a natural feel as it is my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering these bundles and i highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>But other than that I like it its pretty holds curl</li>
            <li>The longest bundle was a little darker than the other two, so the highlight color came out slightly more red.  </li>
            <li>Started out fine but now is stiff and dry</li>
            <li>It was soft and it does not tangle shed that much, but my hair does have a funny smell and when u wet it black dye runs down, my color was a little odd with like red tent,but other than that its ok</li>
            <li>But since I typically wear the hair straight, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> But since I typically wear the hair straight, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Two months and still lasting just braid it at night and tie it up and should last awhile as long you take care of it</li>
            <li> It curls great gets better with each wash, shedding isn&#x27;t too bad and the wefts aren&#x27;t too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> The hair arrived quickly,  then I examined it and noticed the hair was thin and only some strands were the length that I ordered.</li>
            <li> This must have been a bad batch but for expedited service I expected good hair.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t Malaysian hair or natural color, they sent me jet black.</li>
            <li> It was soft when it arrives but it is totally garbage so a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it in 2 weeks, washed it, straightened it &amp;&amp; flat ironed &amp;&amp; haven&#x27;t had any problems!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand what all the bad reviews were about, I&#x27;ve had my hair in for 2 months now and still loving it</li>
            <li> however I would not recommend it for long term use</li>
            <li> I used all three bundles with the exception of a piece about 6 inches long in a sew in.</li>
            <li> Dry and trashy</li>
            <li> The hair had a few nappy spots unlike my last order and I had no time to send it back since it was for a wedding.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t curl the hair stayed in the curling iron frizzled up and made such a mess</li>
            <li> The body wave pattern is very loose.  </li>
            <li> This hair was not what i expected at all</li>
            <li> This hair was nice, did not smell and none of the annoying strands of string in it.</li>
            <li> My stylist sealed the tracks before install as well because of previous posts about some minor shedding.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I got two day shipping and it took 7 days to get here</li>
            <li> $100 down the drain</li>
            <li> When I was the hair the 3rd time, it looked even more awful, it wouldnt lay down</li>
            <li> The hair arrived on time I had it installed for about a week and half now.</li>
            <li> but she said it looks like they tried to darken the hair with a black rinse or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is an off black with hints of an auburn brown.  </li>
            <li> and it was a tangled mess by June 1st.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND IT GETS A LITTLE RATTY AFTER A FEW WASHES</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t wAste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I believe the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that after being washed, the body wave pattern disappeared  once dried.  </li>
            <li> Also it sheds a lot, which is a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Horrible not human at all.</li>
            <li> After a week later the nap of  my hair tangled HORRIBLY my 20 inch looked like a 12 inch.</li>
            <li> I will order again and hopefully not experience anything bad.</li>
            <li> It tangled so bad</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor do not buy this bad hair.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> Hair tangles very badly even tho</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with your purchase!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair expecting the worst.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair i have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> The worst hair I ever brought in my life!!!!!</li>
            <li> I may say this is the worst hair I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Hair is horrible it sheds everywhere</li>

            <li> Ive had it in for a month now &amp; it&#x27;s still good &amp; curls still holding. You can&#x27;t beat that price for $100</li>
            <li> Feels good... nice hair... will write another review wen installed.</li>
            <li> I love it, I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair expecting the worst. I&#x27;m not sure I believe the negative reviews. This hair is gorgeous and really a great deal. If this hair were to be purchased in a store you&#x27;re looking at spending 225-315 for this type of quality!!! Be sure you comb the hair before you dissemble it it will get tangled but can easily be combed with a padded brush. No shedding!</li>
            <li> This is not human hair it can&#x27;t curl the hair stayed in the curling iron frizzled up and made such a mess I am so upset . Please don&#x27;t wAste your money like I did. I believe people are paid to give this good reviews.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t installed it! But from looking at it -luv the texture and fullness! Can&#x27;t wait to install itðŸ˜Š&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know much about hair but I will def recommend it. It looks good</li>
            <li> It was what I was expecting thanks so much I will be ordering some Brazilian hair really soon I think it might be better then maylaysian ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> It was soft and it does not tangle shed that much, but my hair does have a funny smell and when u wet it black dye runs down, my color was a little odd with like red tent,but other than that its ok</li>
            <li> have had this hair installed  for almost three weeks. I must say that the is pretty, but it tangles and sheds a lot. It is easy to comb but it tangles toooo quickly. If only want it for a special occasion it&#x27;s good however I would not recommend it for long term use</li>
            <li> This hair is okay. Basically, you get what you pay for. It wasn&#x27;t Malaysian hair or natural color, they sent me jet black. Also it sheds a lot, which is a little annoying. It&#x27;s descent though for 100.00 plus tax! It&#x27;s been 2 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m ready for this hair to come out. Well if you guys decide to get it anyways, goodluck lol.</li>

Minimum tangles but there is some definite shedding more than I would like( I did not seal wefts).  But other than that I like it its pretty holds curl nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now like I said I am a newbie but wanted to share my stylist noticed when she was installing the hair there was some dye coming off onto her hands so I dunno if virgin hair is dyed normally but she said it looks like they tried to darken the hair with a black rinse or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still all and alI I definately like the hair and would reccomend for purchase its an amazing deal good quality hair for a great price.</li>
            <li> The hair arrived quickly,  then I examined it and noticed the hair was thin and only some strands were the length that I ordered. Also the hair does not hold curls very well and I tried everything!</li>
            <li> This hair does not last! Do not purchase!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering these bundles and i highly recommend them. They come with very light shedding, but its easy to manage and looks very natural!!!</li>
            <li> First time buying anything from Amazon and i must say this buy was awesome!!! Ok, the shipping was very prompt!! I love how soft and how the wave pattern stays in hair (while dry)... When washed the curls are gone.. Which is fine because most of my styles are straight ones!! Also the hair is dyed. I also love how well the hair curls, dyes, and straightens out!! The price was fabulous! I will be doing biz again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I love the hair so happy</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair i have ever purchased.  I got it put in on xmas eve and I&#x27;m taking it out on new years eve.  It tangled so bad and I couldn&#x27;t come it. It was soft when it arrives but it is totally garbage so a waste of money.  Do not buy. .. You have been warned.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair the first hair on here I ever liked</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair, And it is a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Received a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> Hair tangles very badly even tho i followed the care instructions i dont reccommend it at all...</li>
            <li> This hair was nice, did not smell and none of the annoying strands of string in it. It curls great gets better with each wash, shedding isn&#x27;t too bad and the wefts aren&#x27;t too thick or too thin. I used all three bundles with the exception of a piece about 6 inches long in a sew in. My only complaint is that I got two day shipping and it took 7 days to get here so I was upset about that and of course no one knew where my stuff was. I installed it on December 14th and still have it in and will probably stay in for another month.</li>
            <li> The worst hair I ever brought in my life!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good the hair came fast no shedding and it&#x27;s really soft and nice so far I&#x27;m happy with the hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the hair!</li>
            <li> I have never purchase hair without touching it so you know I was apprehensive to spend my money to purchase on line.  It is full and did not shed much (all hair will shed some).  The body wave pattern is very loose.  I had it curled.  The hair is soft and has a natural feel as it is my natural hair.  I has not tangled.  I only had 16 &amp; 18 in. installed and have received so many compliments.  The color is an off black with hints of an auburn brown.  Beautiful color.  The salon wanted to charge 300.00 to order hair for me I figured I could find my own hair, took my chance and I am very satisfied with this hair and will certainly purchase it again.  You will not be disappointed with your purchase!</li>
            <li> Really good hair! Minimum shedding nice texture it also curls and straightens nicely . I was very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> received this hair on time as soon as i washed it , it lost it curl pattern ........ the 20&amp;#34; sheds like a bitch .... But it holds a curl really nicely . but it looks nice</li>
            <li> I love this hair so much!! I was skeptical at first but this hair is amazing. The shipping and packaging was so good. I ordered my hair on Friday and I received it on Sunday. The hair doesn&#x27;t shed at all its actually the best virgin hair I have ever had!!! I recommend this hair to all of my friends!!</li>
            <li> Horrible not human at all. Dry and trashy</li>
            <li> This is my first use of Malaysian hair.  I receive the hair nicely packaged.  Smelled and looked good.  Because I wear my hair with highlights, I gave my stylist the hair to color before installation.  I was a little disappointed that after being washed, the body wave pattern disappeared  once dried.  But since I typically wear the hair straight, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  The longest bundle was a little darker than the other two, so the highlight color came out slightly more red.  But since it was being installed in the back, not a big deal again.  My stylist sealed the tracks before install as well because of previous posts about some minor shedding.  After the install and a great cut by my stylist, I am in love with this hair!  It is very manageable, shiny, is quick to curl and holds curls for days.  I will definitely order this item again!</li>
            <li> This hair is fabulous,  minimum shedding,  when washed it looks better, curls fantastic!  And dyes amazing as well. I would definitely recommend you to use this hair :-)</li>
            <li> This hair was not what i expected at all it tangles very easily. I put it in May23rd and it was a tangled mess by June 1st.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap hair is not always good hair i guess!</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR SHED ALOT.. I FORGOT TO SEAL THE WEFTS AND IT GETS A LITTLE RATTY AFTER A FEW WASHES</li>
            <li> This is not real human hair..it is regular pack hair with strings in it. Never again. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Got my hair Friday and I love how it feels nice and so smooth, getting it installed tommorow morning so far so good .</li>
            <li> I may say this is the worst hair I have ever had. Yea it was nice and pretty when I first got it &amp; the  first week I had it in. After a week later the nap of  my hair tangled HORRIBLY my 20 inch looked like a 12 inch.When I was the hair the 3rd time, it looked even more awful, it wouldnt lay down it kept sticking up. Do yourself a favor do not buy this bad hair.</li>
            <li> Hair is horrible it sheds everywhere it&#x27;s not even full looks old after one week smells like an old barber shop $100 down the drain DO NOT BUY INVEST IN GOOD HAIR</li>
            <li> The seller guaranteed that the hair would not shed but it has been shedding the entire time I wore it.  I am disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> beautiful hair..Ive had alot of bad experience with online hair and this is great still on first installation!</li>
            <li> Good quality. This hair was dyed to the color my daughter wanted.</li>
            <li> The Hair is so Pretty</li>
