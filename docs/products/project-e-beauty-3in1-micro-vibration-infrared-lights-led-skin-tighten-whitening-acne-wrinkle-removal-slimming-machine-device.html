            <li>this is a great intro, and a great great tool for lifting and tightening the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After talking to Hong Kong, they were happy to mail me out correct USA plug in, but this took</li>
            <li>IT FEELS GREAT .JUST</li>

            <li>My results have been amazing!</li>
            <li>Result has been good.</li>
            <li>For the time it did work, results were good and noticeable.</li>
            <li>For the more comfortable usage that works best.</li>
            <li>I am sure those who say it doesn&#x27;t work is because they don&#x27;t know that unless you get to 39 degrees of heat you are doing NOTHING!  </li>
            <li>I had a problem with my first unit and they replaced it with no problem &amp; had excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>I have been using this machine 20 minutes on each side of my face almost every day for 3 weeks and the results have been amazing</li>
            <li>In addition - the company that I purchased this from has been amazing to work with.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Project E Beauty was for my mom, she liked it</li>
            <li>This unit worked great and we both saw an immediate difference after first use.  </li>
            <li>Works great and was very affordable as well.!</li>
            <li>I need to buy some ultrasonic gel to get better result.</li>
            <li>Bought this product for my wife and safe loves it.</li>
            <li>are getting a lot better.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>would like it much better if it was cordless and able to use it while watching tv or in bed.....</li>
            <li>Works fine for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li>It is fantastic that these inexpensive machines are for sale.  </li>
            <li>Please let me know if anyone else experienced similar results.</li>
            <li>my own eyes and there really is a diminishing of the &amp;#34;sagginess&amp;#34; of my lower jaw area.</li>
            <li>I love this handheld skin tightening unit and really think that it&#x27;s making a difference!</li>
            <li>, my cheeks are much slimmer and the jaws look much better .</li>
            <li>Happiness changed into Sadness all of a sudden .</li>
            <li>Today the 15 tj of July is the very first time I used this product and is dosn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>will get you the results very quickly and burn the most fat cells overall.  </li>
            <li>This products is amazing, in one month I can see big improvement on my hands skin and crow feet</li>
            <li>OK, I have had professional Thermage.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase for theose who are shopping savvy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good handheld rf facial</li>
            <li>I started using it right away.  </li>
            <li>This is not that; however, it really works and I believe it has beneficial effects!</li>
            <li>It could be stronger in my opinion that is relase higher frequency and get hotter.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend working with them!!</li>
            <li>it does not get hot enough,i have done this at the spa,and it gets really hot,it has to get hot to work.</li>
            <li>After using it twice I have notices that two fairly large skin depressions with irregular pattern have occurred in the temple regions of the forehead, in both sides.</li>
            <li>i took this to my friend who is a professional and does radio frequency with a machines worth thousands of dollars (it does cavitation and microcurrent also which this one doesn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s not the point now).  </li>
            <li>really think twice about purchasing this product I recommend you not to..</li>
            <li>Very dissapoint .</li>
            <li>do not include the duplex e and a detailled instructive&lt;br /&gt;Was a fast deliveration.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And the price itÂ´s high.</li>
            <li>Then, you use the gel and keep rotating the device in small areas pointing the thermometer at the skin now and then to make sure you are between a minimum of 39 and a maximum of 42 degrees of heat.</li>
            <li>This is the second unit and a replacement for the first one that was defective.  </li>
            <li>A 5 year old must have written it in China.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old woman with no wrinkles or lines .</li>
            <li>Provided you use it once it&#x27;s hot , and leave it on long enough in each area , you can really see and feel a difference on the face .</li>
            <li>then massager begins to work intermittently and then quits working completely after about 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>BUT after just 2 weeks of use it completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li>You can do the problem area as much as you want but slow and precise</li>
            <li>The only trick to it is that you have to keep it on the specific area of your face until it really gets hot , if you move it constantly on your face , it wont work.  </li>
            <li>did noting for my skin and there were no instructions as to how long to use it and how much the device should be moved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other machines cost $300+, but this machine does the same exact thing for only a third of the price.  </li>
            <li>I just tried the device on my neck, I had a sore neck, due to wrong sleeping position, after using it for 15 minutes, the soreness was greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>I give this product 4 star because it does not get hot enough other than that</li>
            <li>I was sad to see it go and not be able to use it longer to see what the real results would be from long term use.  </li>
            <li>First, you need to buy a radio frequency thermometer (I bought the same one she uses at Home Depot for less than $50.00).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They appear as flat scars with thinner skin compared with the rest of the forehead skin.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that you can&#x27;t keep moving the device back and forth, you have to stop in each area for about 20 sec or until you feel the heat, than you move to the next spot.</li>
            <li> Place item on problem area and hold firmly there for five seconds or until you cannot take the burn anymore; then move one inch away to the next adjacent area until the problem area is completely worked.  </li>
            <li> I can see definite results with a few uses on my stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li> Its not what i expected.</li>
            <li> At first it arrived with wrong plug for USA.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said it broke</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve just been to busy to try and the first time it doesn&#x27;t work so disappointed in this companies</li>
            <li> Item is slightly uncomfortable on high with the massager activated but slow five second placement holds will aleviate the burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> the ionic/ultrasound gel is not needed due to the alternative of plain baby oil as the cheapest alternative.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> im not satisfied but this product..</li>
            <li> and the hadle was broken when i receivednit</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a week of use, it started having power issues (just sounded like the motor was dying) and we returned it when it  would no longer even power on.  </li>
            <li> The worst English I ever read.</li>
            <li> Sadly , I bought this item</li>
            <li> I am totally bummed and for some reason I can&#x27;t return absolutely crazy the worst service ever cause</li>
            <li> Professionals also use radio frequency thermometers with their expensive machines!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of the article itÂ´s really bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product.</li>

            <li> At first it arrived with wrong plug for USA. After talking to Hong Kong, they were happy to mail me out correct USA plug in, but this took 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It finally arrived, and the machine is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This technology is called Monopolar Radio Frequency, and is thought to penetrate up to 20mm depth in the skin, so to target muscles and tone, tighten, and lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does this by heating up the skin to approx 100 degrees, which means it gets hot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A noticeable tightening and toning effect is seem after just 10 minutes of this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have more expensive machines that have multiple heads, so so you can use this technology on various body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a great intro, and a great great tool for lifting and tightening the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy!</li>
            <li> IT FEELS GREAT .JUST STARTED USING IT DAILY AND ITS A ROYAL MESSAGE HAS 3 SPEEDS ON VIBRATION  FOR DEEPER PENETRATION.ITS A ROYAL MESSAGE</li>
            <li> This Project E Beauty Hand Held...&lt;br /&gt;Project E Beauty was for my mom, she liked it so I guess that&#x27;s all that matters</li>
            <li> im not satisfied but this product..and the hadle was broken when i receivednit</li>
            <li> This unit worked great and we both saw an immediate difference after first use.  Unfortunately after a week of use, it started having power issues (just sounded like the motor was dying) and we returned it when it  would no longer even power on.  If you need an immediate fix and are only going to use it once or twice thenI would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this and got one use out of it. I went to use it a second time and it just would not start up.  I am returning it tomorrow. Very disappointed in the product. The instructions are a joke. The worst English I ever read. A 5 year old must have written it in China. We need to buy American.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> i took this to my friend who is a professional and does radio frequency with a machines worth thousands of dollars (it does cavitation and microcurrent also which this one doesn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s not the point now).  Just because she is my friend, she explained how to use it properly. First, you need to buy a radio frequency thermometer (I bought the same one she uses at Home Depot for less than $50.00). Then, you use the gel and keep rotating the device in small areas pointing the thermometer at the skin now and then to make sure you are between a minimum of 39 and a maximum of 42 degrees of heat. I am sure those who say it doesn&#x27;t work is because they don&#x27;t know that unless you get to 39 degrees of heat you are doing NOTHING!  Professionals also use radio frequency thermometers with their expensive machines!  My results have been amazing! It is fantastic that these inexpensive machines are for sale.  I don&#x27;t know others but this one does work!  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this device in a while now. Result has been good.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old woman with no wrinkles or lines . The reason I bought this machine is that I have fat cheeks and some saggy skin on my jaws on both sides of my chin. I have been using this machine 20 minutes on each side of my face almost every day for 3 weeks and the results have been amazing , my cheeks are much slimmer and the jaws look much better . The only trick to it is that you have to keep it on the specific area of your face until it really gets hot , if you move it constantly on your face , it wont work.  I give this product 4 star because it does not get hot enough other than that ,I definitely recommend this product for fatness but I have no idea about wrinkles.</li>
            <li> OK, I have had professional Thermage.  This is not that; however, it really works and I believe it has beneficial effects! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I just tried the device on my neck, I had a sore neck, due to wrong sleeping position, after using it for 15 minutes, the soreness was greatly reduced. I need to buy some ultrasonic gel to get better result.</li>
            <li> Today the 15 tj of July is the very first time I used this product and is dosn&#x27;t work I am totally bummed and for some reason I can&#x27;t return absolutely crazy the worst service ever cause this was $100 and I&#x27;ve just been to busy to try and the first time it doesn&#x27;t work so disappointed in this companies return policy really think twice about purchasing this product I recommend you not to..</li>
            <li> It takes a while to heat up and when I turn it on after plugging it in , it does not turn &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and I have to take the plug connection in and out of the device for it to actually turn on ?!  Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product . Provided you use it once it&#x27;s hot , and leave it on long enough in each area , you can really see and feel a difference on the face .</li>
            <li> This product helps to reduce fat deposits in my face and tighten. It could be stronger in my opinion that is relase higher frequency and get hotter. But it has made a difference in my face resulting in compliments like &amp;#34; your face looks good.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s good for me!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for over a month, warms my skin, that is it. Recommended by friends - don&#x27;t see any difference on them either.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife and safe loves it. Works great on her skin. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good handheld rf facial</li>
            <li> After using it twice I have notices that two fairly large skin depressions with irregular pattern have occurred in the temple regions of the forehead, in both sides. They appear as flat scars with thinner skin compared with the rest of the forehead skin. Please let me know if anyone else experienced similar results.</li>
            <li> did noting for my skin and there were no instructions as to how long to use it and how much the device should be moved.</li>
            <li> Sadly , I bought this item and I was very happy at the beginning . But , 3 days , after I started using , the Vibration mode stoped working suddenly . I tried everything in the manual but didn&#x27;t work . Happiness changed into Sadness all of a sudden . Very dissapoint .</li>
            <li> The articule just worked for 8 days and then it just stop working.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the article itÂ´s really bad. And the price itÂ´s high.</li>
            <li> My product was different and with a different cost.&lt;br /&gt;It do not include the duplex e and a detailled instructive&lt;br /&gt;Was a fast deliveration.&lt;br /&gt;I dont have the time to send it back.</li>
            <li> I can see definite results with a few uses on my stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li> I love this handheld skin tightening unit and really think that it&#x27;s making a difference! I used it for several weeks and took &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; photo&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;trust&amp;#34; my own eyes and there really is a diminishing of the &amp;#34;sagginess&amp;#34; of my lower jaw area. In addition - the company that I purchased this from has been amazing to work with. I had a problem with my first unit and they replaced it with no problem &amp; had excellent customer service. I would highly recommend working with them!!</li>
            <li> Totally different than the ad.</li>
            <li> I only tried it  once.</li>
            <li> The vibrator is a disaster. Only use the RF</li>
            <li> it does not get hot enough,i have done this at the spa,and it gets really hot,it has to get hot to work.</li>
            <li> Works great and was very affordable as well.!</li>
            <li> This products is amazing, in one month I can see big improvement on my hands skin and crow feet are getting a lot better. I recomend it. the only thing is that you can&#x27;t keep moving the device back and forth, you have to stop in each area for about 20 sec or until you feel the heat, than you move to the next spot.</li>
            <li> This is the second unit and a replacement for the first one that was defective.  Works fine for about 3 weeks then massager begins to work intermittently and then quits working completely after about 5 weeks.  For the time it did work, results were good and noticeable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this about a month ago.  I started using it right away.  The reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 is because I believe it MAY help.  Its no miracle worker I can tell you that.  BUT after just 2 weeks of use it completely stopped working.  I was sad to see it go and not be able to use it longer to see what the real results would be from long term use.  Other reviews said it broke but I thought...it had to be a fluke.  WRONG...believe the reviews!</li>
            <li> I did not get any company name or address enclosed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be working ok but I did not realize that you have to be plugged into an outlet&lt;br /&gt;to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;I would like it much better if it was cordless and able to use it while watching tv or in bed.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual is very simple in it&#x27;s wording. I suspect it was made in china and translated&lt;br /&gt;by someone who does not know the english language well.</li>
            <li> The item works as advertised.  the ionic/ultrasound gel is not needed due to the alternative of plain baby oil as the cheapest alternative.  Item is slightly uncomfortable on high with the massager activated but slow five second placement holds will aleviate the burning sensation.  results are instantaneous this way.  For the more comfortable usage that works best. DO NOT rotate or move the device over the skin as seen in youtube videos, etc.  Place item on problem area and hold firmly there for five seconds or until you cannot take the burn anymore; then move one inch away to the next adjacent area until the problem area is completely worked.  You can do the problem area as much as you want but slow and precise will get you the results very quickly and burn the most fat cells overall.  It even works on stomach thighs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other machines cost $300+, but this machine does the same exact thing for only a third of the price.  you can contact me personally if you want proof at the &#x27;megabirmil&#x27; email on the &#x27;yahoo&#x27; website.  Well worth the purchase for theose who are shopping savvy.</li>
            <li> Its not what i expected.</li>
            <li> Stopped working in a short time.</li>
