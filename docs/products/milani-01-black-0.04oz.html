            <li>its perfect kohl n i was searching for this type</li>
            <li>so it works out perfectly for</li>
            <li>Perfectly sharpened every time.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and is a very good quality liner.</li>
            <li>Good job Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love it !! :)</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>The color--its intensity, its drama--is amazing.  </li>
            <li>look nice</li>
            <li>I own the Stila, Sephora and a couple of drugstore brands/generics.</li>
            <li>I think people who like the way liquid liner looks but who aren&#x27;t comfortable with using the brush most liquid liners come with would especially enjoy this</li>
            <li>The best so far.</li>
            <li>very fine line and looks like a liquid.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, it goes on smoother and richer than any eye pencil I own (even better than 24/7 UD)</li>
            <li>Love, love love, goes on very easy</li>
            <li>As soon as I got this product out the top of the eyeliner fell off.</li>
            <li>On of my favorite eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner since 2007.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks/</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I could find it on here.</li>
            <li>I love the Milani eyeliner...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>To solve this, I would recommend what I mentioned above--put the eyeliner in the freezer for about 10 minutes to better solidify the product and then remove the cap (or sharpen if that&#x27;s the case).</li>
            <li>Love this eye pencil.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to create the thickness of the line you want, and easy to blend or wipe off if you make a mistake.  </li>
            <li>The delivery service was good on this item, but I really don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also easy to remove at night with makeup remover or water.  </li>
            <li>And its easy to take off.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays on.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on so creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>The application is smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regarding the 1 star review by Roxy, I also experienced the problem of the tip breaking off after removing the cap with this brand of eyeliner (but in a different color).  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to finally find such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It goes on super smoothly.  </li>
            <li>But honesty compells me to say that this is an excellent eyeliner in that it goes on smooth and silky, without tugging at delicate eyelid skin.  </li>
            <li>but if you have a good sharpener its not a big deal.</li>
            <li>True to its description</li>
            <li>but every time i need to sharp it ...still i m happy with this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, easy to apply and manage, easy to smudge if you&#x27;re going for that smoky eye look and really dark in color.</li>
            <li>The pencil is way too soft, and the liner smears easily.</li>
            <li>Seems like a higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Living in a really hot, really humid place, I didn&#x27;t hope to ever find a pencil that wouldn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>It lasts me for 12 hours straight.</li>
            <li>i really like it but</li>
            <li>its finish very soon.....</li>
            <li>even i dont use it too much</li>
            <li>although it is competitive with most of the other mainstream liners and some would not find the price an issue at all) I would reccommend this liner.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Its creamy and not hard to apply.</li>
            <li>and I am saying this after trying every single brand you could think of, from drugstore varieties to the super premium brands.</li>
            <li>it is very soft when you use it and it has to be sharpened often which is a pain</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because the product is very soft, which contributes to its silky application.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on all day and can smear during hot weather.  </li>
            <li>Creamy dark black, super easy to apply and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>gives you the deep intense color of a gel or liquid liner</li>
            <li>I have ordered three so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to go over the line repeatedly to give me a true black color; one sweep is all it takes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner and have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>Normally I would not have purchased this eyeliner because of the price (store prices are about the same as Amazon&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>The color (black) is very dark, very matte, and very bold.  </li>
            <li>.. stays in the water line without running all over and stays a nice deep black if you set with black shadow.</li>
            <li>I will never use another black pencil as long as these are available.  </li>
            <li>The colour is super glossy black which only adds to the appeal.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed , I was really looking forward to a great eye liner.</li>

            <li> I really like this eyeliner and have been using it for a long time.It stays on all day and is a very good quality liner.I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> As soon as I got this product out the top of the eyeliner fell off. Not sure if it was because of the rough shipping conditions or it&#x27;s just a cheap or fake Milani product. Very disappointed , I was really looking forward to a great eye liner. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest anyone to buy.</li>
            <li> On of my favorite eyeliners. It&#x27;s smooth, easy to apply and manage, easy to smudge if you&#x27;re going for that smoky eye look and really dark in color.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Creamy dark black, super easy to apply and lasts all day.  Seems like a higher quality.  Of course, the are discontinuing.</li>
            <li> Within 30 minutes of application, the eyeliner began smudging EVERYWHERE. Really difficult to remove completely, even with the use of makeup remover.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner since 2007. I love the way it looks/smudges/works.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always sold out at the CVS I go to, so I&#x27;m glad I could find it on here.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t want competition when I go to buy this eyeliner on Amazon.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, and it&#x27;s also more expensive there.  But honesty compells me to say that this is an excellent eyeliner in that it goes on smooth and silky, without tugging at delicate eyelid skin.  The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on all day and can smear during hot weather.  That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s probably the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used . . . shhhh!</li>
            <li> I love the Milani eyeliner... I was so glad to finally find such a wonderful product. very fine line and looks like a liquid.</li>
            <li> Love, love love, goes on very easy</li>
            <li> its perfect kohl n i was searching for this type o kohl it dont smudge n look nice i really like it but its finish very soon.....i dont know y even i dont use it too much but every time i need to sharp it ...still i m happy with this</li>
            <li> When I open the package it is already not what I expected because it is not the one that was shown on the given item picture.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. It is the only one I use for the inside of my eye. It goes on smoothly and stays on.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on so creamy and smooth. I love it. Everybody has been fussing over the Urban Decay (they do have a bigger selection of colors) eyeliner, but the Milani works just as well at less than half the price. I only wear black eyeliner so it works out perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharpening was my only issue with this. I tried a billion sharpeners and it wouldn&#x27;t sharpen evenly. I own the Stila, Sephora and a couple of drugstore brands/generics. Nothing worked. I got the Milani one and that still didn&#x27;t work. I went to Sephora and tried it with the Urban Decay one...didn&#x27;t work! It doesn&#x27;t sharpen the Urban Decay liners evenly. I was told to try the Nars one. BINGO!! Perfectly sharpened every time. Another plus: the Nars sharpener is only $4 or $6...can&#x27;t remember. But if you get this product, get the Nars sharpener too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also changed the name of this product. It&#x27;s no longer Liquif&#x27;eye. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;liquid eyeliner like&amp;#34; pencil or something like that. But it&#x27;s the same thing. Love this!</li>
            <li> gives you the deep intense color of a gel or liquid liner an the control of a pencil.. lasts all day.. stays where you put it doesnt rub off on your lid.. stays in the water line without running all over and stays a nice deep black if you set with black shadow. it is very soft when you use it and it has to be sharpened often which is a pain but if you have a good sharpener its not a big deal. This is the only pencil liner ill use! Love it !! :)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, it goes on smoother and richer than any eye pencil I own (even better than 24/7 UD) but I was a little disappointed that it could not be used on my waterline or tightlining.  Unfortunately the product is so oily that it seems to shed into the eye and tear duct, making me feel like I have powder in my eyes.  I would still fully recommend this item, but just keep that in mind!</li>
            <li> The delivery service was good on this item, but I really don&#x27;t like it.  The pencil is way too soft, and the liner smears easily. I was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Normally I would not have purchased this eyeliner because of the price (store prices are about the same as Amazon&#x27;s).  However, when it was part of a 75% off clearance, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.  True to its description, it&#x27;s a  pencil eyeliner that has the consistency of a liquid liner.  It goes on super smoothly.  The color (black) is very dark, very matte, and very bold.  I don&#x27;t have to go over the line repeatedly to give me a true black color; one sweep is all it takes.  It&#x27;s also very easy to create the thickness of the line you want, and easy to blend or wipe off if you make a mistake.  This product lasts all day with no smudging but it&#x27;s also easy to remove at night with makeup remover or water.  Also, when you need to sharpen it, it would help to put the pencil in the freezer for about 10 minutes to harden and then use a sharpener; otherwise sharpening could get messy and you may risk losing some of the product in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I do consider this a little pricey (although it is competitive with most of the other mainstream liners and some would not find the price an issue at all) I would reccommend this liner.  The color--its intensity, its drama--is amazing.  The application is smooth.  The staying power is lasting.  And its easy to take off.  I think people who like the way liquid liner looks but who aren&#x27;t comfortable with using the brush most liquid liners come with would especially enjoy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the 1 star review by Roxy, I also experienced the problem of the tip breaking off after removing the cap with this brand of eyeliner (but in a different color).  I think it&#x27;s because the product is very soft, which contributes to its silky application.  To solve this, I would recommend what I mentioned above--put the eyeliner in the freezer for about 10 minutes to better solidify the product and then remove the cap (or sharpen if that&#x27;s the case).</li>
            <li> Love this eye pencil. Its creamy and not hard to apply. I love it. I have ordered three so far. The best so far.</li>
