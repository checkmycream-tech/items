    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The lotion felt wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li>Rather because I&#x27;m not so impressed I&#x27;m going to buy</li>
            <li>Jergens has some of the best lotions, and this is another great product.</li>
            <li>Great to have on vacation.</li>
            <li>If you like to have a great tan, and keep it.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it seemed to &amp;</li>
            <li>but it is good lotion.</li>
            <li>Jergens lotions have always worked good for me.</li>
            <li>good --&lt;br /&gt;absorbs</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the comments about being a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This lotion does seem to be doing a good job of extending my tan.</li>
            <li>The cream works best on the legs and they feel smooth for hours after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>One tip, make sure to wash your hands after applying it to your body!</li>
            <li>While I note it does have some self-tanning chemicals in it, this is just as effective as a skin moisturizer after coming out of the sun.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>To each her own, I guess.</li>
            <li>At night it would be nice, though.</li>
            <li>It does not feel greasy and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>At my age, that just causes more wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Ok, this isn&#x27;t tanning lotion, but a lotion that is supposed to extend your tan.</li>
            <li>But I am not so sure it did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is ok.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering like most.</li>
            <li>Like most products of this sort</li>
            <li>But I am looking forward to trying it out more this summer and updating this review accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is okay,</li>
            <li>To my mind, this will be perfect for my winter-parched white legs once they acquire a sun-kissed glow when the weather warms up a bit</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and love cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>I think it did help extend my tan a bit, but it wasn&#x27;t anything super amazing.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is a good size and easy to use, and the after using it for a while I like to think it is really helping extend my tan.</li>
            <li>It is creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It smells like a tanning lotion would and is easily applied.</li>
            <li>The tan extender comes in a bottle with a pump that makes it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>pump makes it easy to dispense</li>
            <li>but it smells so strong</li>
            <li>fragrance is very light and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>But I will say that this is a pleasant smelling product, that leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a light, not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>This is nice as I really don&#x27;t want anything that&#x27;s going to overpower or clash with the fragrances I wear.</li>
            <li>Overall a great quality product.</li>
            <li>so so&lt;br /&gt;smell is light but lingers longer than I would like</li>
            <li>If you exfoliate first, they look tan, not orange, and look pretty good.</li>
            <li>#34;sink in&amp;#34; quite quickly, leaving my skin soft, cooled and smelling good.</li>
            <li>just for summertime, the emoillents in this also make it great for dry, winter skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference with this lotion right away!  </li>
            <li>The lotion helps moisturize, which is important while tanning, and the smell is decent or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and pleasant with light floral notes anchored by warm, nutty coconut aromas.</li>
            <li>my own experience, I have complete confidence in Jergens tanning products.</li>
            <li>The Tan does have a nice natural tone to it, so I support the product.  </li>
            <li>The mild fragrance is fruity with cocoa butter notes.  </li>
            <li>It feels greasy on application but quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think that this does anything to extend your tan beyond keeping your skin moist and, therefore, able to better show off your fading tan and then add a little bit of the coloring that appears in the tanning lotion products for a bit more pop.</li>
            <li>Jergens is a decent enough lotion, but this tan extender isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>it last is an amazing one.</li>
            <li>After the second day of use, my sunburn had faded to a nice tan.</li>
            <li>For that alone it is worth considering if you are trying to prolong a tan, whether it be from the sun, a tanning bed or sunless tanner.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does much more than other moisturizers to extend my tan, however, I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This is very highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The Jergins Natural, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I like Jergens lotions - and this is not the first of their tanning products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it three stars for now and update the review at a later time after I&#x27;ve had more experience testing it out.</li>
            <li>Overall it is an okay lotion.</li>
            <li>and it gives my partner a healthy glow mid winter in a state where everyone is pretty pasty</li>
            <li>and I like not having to fumble with popping the top open.</li>
            <li>After I got smart, I used plastic gloves to put it on to keep it off my hands.  </li>
            <li>It is quite thicker than lotions I have used previously, but with skin being exposed to sun, the extra creaminess is welcome.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it does nor</li>
            <li>This lotion is moderately viscous and has a light tan color.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions carefully.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tell if that made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why this tan extender looks so promising.</li>
            <li>think what this is really doing is just moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also after a few days you will notice a nice glow on your skin and not orange like some tan creams.</li>
            <li>It smells nice to me and feels good on my legs (the only place I&#x27;m fake tanning).</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed the lotion easily and there was a slight smell</li>
            <li>This stuff smells and feels like many other Jergens products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen these lotions in salons before but the high cost was very off putting.  </li>
            <li>IF I have used an instant tanner for a special occasion</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a nice, thick lotion (albeit a bit smelly) that certainly made a difference in the feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell how effective it really is.</li>
            <li>I use a high SPF lotion in the summer to prevent that but still would like that glow that comes along with being outside.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does this help hydrate dry, rough skin and make it feel great, but it also helps to extend the life of your tan, or so they say.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is thicker and a little greasier than most of my body creams.  </li>
            <li>This early in the season, I haven&#x27;t got much of a tan to extend....</li>
            <li>We live in Hawaii and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement or extension of our tan.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my first trial of it (after a weekend in Vegas) didn&#x27;t offer too much of an extra tan to use it on!</li>
            <li>appreciate the Natural Glow Tan line since we live in Minnesota</li>
            <li>I also found the scent faint but pleasant.</li>
            <li>one is left to assume that the incorporation of certain chemicals are at play here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty decent moisturizer and because it has a bit of color - it does help extend even an instant tan product for several days.  </li>
            <li>but whether or not that would have occured naturally, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I got the Natural Glow Tan Extender to see how it worked.  </li>
            <li>so I will probably switch completely.</li>
            <li>I peeled just as fast from our recent trip to DR.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after and I have not had any reactions to it.</li>
            <li>not though as my tans usually don&#x27;t fade very quickly to begin with.</li>
            <li>We have the entire set from pre-wash to extender and this seems to be the least worthwhile.</li>
            <li>A little price, however worth it.</li>
            <li>Jergins Natural Glow Tan Extender seems to help extend not only my tan from the sun, but also from the sunless tanner I used.</li>
            <li>As a tan extending lotion product it is fairly difficult to truly gauge just how effective this product is at prolonging the life of your sunkissed glow.</li>
            <li>formula contains effective ingredients to lock in moisture to slow shedding of the dead cells of the outermost layer of the skin, extending the effects of natural or chemical tanning.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is a little thicker than a typical lotion and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised after using tanning mousse that my skin felt unpleasantly dry.  </li>
            <li>For a long time the only tan I received was from Jergens Natural Glow Sunless Tanning products.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it was extending my tan or if my tan was just slowly fading away like normal.</li>
            <li>I read a few other reviews and many other people can talk about the ingredients and the value of this product.</li>
            <li>But it is definitely a thick, hydrating lotion that keeps dry skin at bay, leaving your skin smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Where I live right now, though, you&#x27;d be getting frostbite (still) if you tried to tan outdoors in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is, as others have said, very thick and has a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t quite pass the grade as an everyday type lotion it certainly will get a lot of use while on vacation and camping trips.</li>

            <li> I read a few other reviews and many other people can talk about the ingredients and the value of this product.</li>

            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t quite pass the grade as an everyday type lotion it certainly will get a lot of use while on vacation and camping trips.</li>
            <li> how it long it made my tan last.</li>
            <li> The directions say to wait until your skin is dry before getting dressed and that takes several minutes after you finish rubbing it in thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> This is reasonably priced and really does seem to work to make my &#x27;fake&#x27; from a bottle tan last a few days longer.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think the odor was as bad as another reviewer did, but it definitely could smell better.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying this lotion to my arms and legs, but I see minimal effect.</li>
            <li> for the product itself, it is highly fragrant, and a little thick.</li>

            <li> It tells you to wash your hands and let the area you applied the lotion dry before putting on clothes so it must have a little bit of pigment in it to extend the tan.</li>
            <li> For a moment, I will stop and reflect that receiving this product to review made me realize that these subtle self-tanning lotions have actually been mainstream for a long time now...</li>
            <li> The Jergens Natural Glow Tan Extender is a thick, emoillent lotion that hydrates your skin and delays the sloughing off of dead skin cells.</li>

            <li> The lotion is thick and will require a bit of effort to get it incorporated properly into your skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go out of my way to tan.  At my age, that just causes more wrinkles.  My arms and face are the only two areas I have exposed while out hiking, and they need protection.  This stuff smells and feels like many other Jergens products.  While I note it does have some self-tanning chemicals in it, this is just as effective as a skin moisturizer after coming out of the sun.  It dries fast and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion. It is creamy and easy to apply. It has a light, not overpowering scent. Not sure if it actually extends a tan but it is good lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried this moisturizer after a few days of sun. My skin was slightly red from not being protected by sunscreen. The lotion felt wonderful on my skin. It is quite thicker than lotions I have used previously, but with skin being exposed to sun, the extra creaminess is welcome.  The smell is pleasant and it seemed to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; quite quickly, leaving my skin soft, cooled and smelling good. After the second day of use, my sunburn had faded to a nice tan. Whether or not the lotion extended my tan, I&#x27;m not really sure how to tell. I&#x27;m still tan now, after a week... but whether or not that would have occured naturally, I don&#x27;t know. But I will say that this is a pleasant smelling product, that leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Jergens lotions have always worked good for me. Not only does this help hydrate dry, rough skin and make it feel great, but it also helps to extend the life of your tan, or so they say. I can&#x27;t really tell if it does nor not though as my tans usually don&#x27;t fade very quickly to begin with. Every little bit helps though, so I&#x27;m giving it the benefit of the doubt here. Considering I&#x27;ve never gotten a bad product from Jergens, I have no reason to doubt the validity of their claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very light and fades quickly. This is nice as I really don&#x27;t want anything that&#x27;s going to overpower or clash with the fragrances I wear.</li>
            <li> My skin gets so dry at the end of a long Minnesota winter that it is difficult for anything to keep my skin from shedding a lot.  And that shedding of dead skin cells is what makes your tan go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a very thick moisturizing lotion that takes a while to soak into your skin.  The directions say to wait until your skin is dry before getting dressed and that takes several minutes after you finish rubbing it in thoroughly.  Even then it is a little bit tacky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think the odor was as bad as another reviewer did, but it definitely could smell better.</li>
            <li> Ok, this isn&#x27;t tanning lotion, but a lotion that is supposed to extend your tan. So actually determining if it works is subjective. Did the tan last longer? No way to tell. I read a few other reviews and many other people can talk about the ingredients and the value of this product. It smells like a tanning lotion would and is easily applied.</li>
            <li> I am white white white but hate to get &#x27;real&#x27; suntans. I use a high SPF lotion in the summer to prevent that but still would like that glow that comes along with being outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose a tanning lotion often during the warmer months. I will exfoliate before applying. I was hoping that this would add a way to help on the &#x27;back end&#x27;. But I am not so sure it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice, thick lotion (albeit a bit smelly) that certainly made a difference in the feel of my skin. I remain unconvinced that it extended my tan in any way. However, I might be addicted to the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Great to have on vacation. If you like to have a great tan, and keep it. This is the product you need. The Jergins Natural, goes on smoothly. The scent is ok. Not overpowering like most. A little goes a long way. Overall a great quality product.</li>
            <li> The three stars are not because I&#x27;m disapointed in this product.  Rather because I&#x27;m not so impressed I&#x27;m going to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good --&lt;br /&gt;absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;nice thick lotion that goes on with ease&lt;br /&gt;does not leave hands greasy&lt;br /&gt;nice creamy color (not orange) therefor does not stain hands or clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The so so&lt;br /&gt;smell is light but lingers longer than I would like</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the comments about being a good moisturizer. It may moisturize&lt;br /&gt;and extend the tan but it smells so strong I can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is moderately viscous and has a light tan color.  The mild fragrance is fruity with cocoa butter notes.  It does not feel greasy after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula contains effective ingredients to lock in moisture to slow shedding of the dead cells of the outermost layer of the skin, extending the effects of natural or chemical tanning.  It also contains dihydroxyacetone, which is used as a chemical tanner, and the colorant caramel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Water, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, Zea mays (corn) starch, dimethicone, petrolatum, mineral oil, ethylhexyl isononanoate, ceteareth-20, dihydroxyacetone, phenyl trimethicone, steareth-2, Theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance, stearic acid, octyldodecyl myristate, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, methylparaben, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, isohexadecane, dimethiconol, BHT, ethylparaben, polysorbate 60, citric acid, chlorphenesin, erythrulose, caramel.</li>
            <li> Jergens knew what they were doing when they made this product.  It&#x27;s a pretty decent moisturizer and because it has a bit of color - it does help extend even an instant tan product for several days.  Like most products of this sort, you have to wait a few minutes after applying before putting on clothing as it is quite greasy at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I choose this to use regularly, no.  But, I can see it&#x27;s use IF I have used an instant tanner for a special occasion and I wanted that tan to last a few days longer.</li>
            <li> Jergins Natural Glow Tan Extender seems to help extend not only my tan from the sun, but also from the sunless tanner I used. The lotion helps moisturize, which is important while tanning, and the smell is decent or overwhelming. The pump bottle is a good size and easy to use, and the after using it for a while I like to think it is really helping extend my tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion does seem to be doing a good job of extending my tan. It is slightly tinted and a very thick and greasy lotion that keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day. One tip, make sure to wash your hands after applying it to your body!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a lotion like this before - a tan extender.  I&#x27;ve seen these lotions in salons before but the high cost was very off putting.  This is reasonably priced and really does seem to work to make my &#x27;fake&#x27; from a bottle tan last a few days longer.  It smells nice to me and feels good on my legs (the only place I&#x27;m fake tanning).</li>
            <li> This product works.  A little price, however worth it.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with this lotion right away!  After spring break, you just HAVE to keep that glow going, and this works!  Make sure you follow the directions carefully.  I am very pleased with my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  This is very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The Jergens Natural Glow Tan Extender is a thick, emoillent lotion that hydrates your skin and delays the sloughing off of dead skin cells. For that alone it is worth considering if you are trying to prolong a tan, whether it be from the sun, a tanning bed or sunless tanner.&lt;br /&gt;This has a small amount of self tanner listed as one of the ingredients but I can&#x27;t tell if that made much of a difference. But it is definitely a thick, hydrating lotion that keeps dry skin at bay, leaving your skin smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Not just for summertime, the emoillents in this also make it great for dry, winter skin.</li>
            <li> I got the Natural Glow Tan Extender to see how it worked.  I&#x27;ve never used a similar product so I really do not have anything to compare it to.  I can say this though, the lotion moisturized my skin and after getting a tan during Spring Break, my tan has stayed in the two weeks since I returned.  The tan extender comes in a bottle with a pump that makes it easy to apply.  The lotion is a little thicker than a typical lotion and goes on easily.  My skin absorbed the lotion easily and there was a slight smell but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This early in the season, I haven&#x27;t got much of a tan to extend.... this is one of those products that is like a BB cream for the face, in that it acts as a moisturizer as well as adding a bit of natural-looking color to your skin. As a moisturizer it&#x27;s not too thick, not greasy or heavy as other reviewers have said. I also found the scent faint but pleasant. To each her own, I guess. I can imagine it would have to  be used daily in order to maintain any sort of color protection, and of course it does not have any sunscreen in it so it should probably not be used as a morning moisturizer. At night it would be nice, though.</li>
            <li> In order for this to extend your tan you have to apply it every day. You can use this each day in place of your regular lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel like it had a slight sunless tanner scent. You also have to wash your hands after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically like a lotion withe just a smidge of sunless tanner in it. I think it did help extend my tan a bit, but it wasn&#x27;t anything super amazing.</li>
            <li> Jergens has some of the best lotions, and this is another great product. I found the cream pleasing to the touch and it rubs in the skin well. Also after a few days you will notice a nice glow on your skin and not orange like some tan creams. The cream works best on the legs and they feel smooth for hours after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> As a tan extending lotion product it is fairly difficult to truly gauge just how effective this product is at prolonging the life of your sunkissed glow. Product packaging states that it utilizes &#x27;fade-fighting technology&#x27; to delay the disappearance of skin color so without offering any further specifics or details one is left to assume that the incorporation of certain chemicals are at play here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a skin lotion I&#x27;d rate it as mostly average. The lotion is thick and will require a bit of effort to get it incorporated properly into your skin. The fragrance is subtle and pleasant with light floral notes anchored by warm, nutty coconut aromas. While it doesn&#x27;t quite pass the grade as an everyday type lotion it certainly will get a lot of use while on vacation and camping trips.</li>
            <li> I like Jergens lotions - and this is not the first of their tanning products that I have tried. This one is less of a tan-creator and is instead intended to extend your tan. Unfortunately, my first trial of it (after a weekend in Vegas) didn&#x27;t offer too much of an extra tan to use it on! But I am looking forward to trying it out more this summer and updating this review accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a cold spring in Chicago so far, so any Vegas color seems to have vanished along with its warmth!</li>
            <li> For a moment, I will stop and reflect that receiving this product to review made me realize that these subtle self-tanning lotions have actually been mainstream for a long time now...that may explain why we are now seeing products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that this does anything to extend your tan beyond keeping your skin moist and, therefore, able to better show off your fading tan and then add a little bit of the coloring that appears in the tanning lotion products for a bit more pop. That being said it does work well at helping you look like you just came back from vacation for a while longer.</li>
            <li> Our family managed to soak up a few rays of sun during our spring break trip to Alabama. I&#x27;ve tried applying this lotion to my arms and legs, but I see minimal effect. It&#x27;s hard to tell how effective it really is. I&#x27;ll give it three stars for now and update the review at a later time after I&#x27;ve had more experience testing it out.</li>
            <li> It is okay, I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it was extending my tan or if my tan was just slowly fading away like normal. It didn&#x27;t feel like it lasted anymore longer than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things to consider, there is no sunscreen in this product. Also, you can not use this product on your face. It tells you to wash your hands and let the area you applied the lotion dry before putting on clothes so it must have a little bit of pigment in it to extend the tan. Although I couldn&#x27;t notice it myself. Overall it is an okay lotion.</li>
            <li> For a long time the only tan I received was from Jergens Natural Glow Sunless Tanning products. If you exfoliate first, they look tan, not orange, and look pretty good. I do, however, like to get a slight tan on my legs. That&#x27;s the holy grail if you want to wear anything like a skirt or shorts and not announce you&#x27;re a member of the pasty white club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that I could actually get a slight tan on my legs and make it last is an amazing one. That&#x27;s why this tan extender looks so promising. Where I live right now, though, you&#x27;d be getting frostbite (still) if you tried to tan outdoors in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is, as others have said, very thick and has a greasy feel. To my mind, this will be perfect for my winter-parched white legs once they acquire a sun-kissed glow when the weather warms up a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my own experience, I have complete confidence in Jergens tanning products. I will report back when I use this to let you know how it long it made my tan last.</li>
            <li> We have the entire set from pre-wash to extender and this seems to be the least worthwhile. It is hard to tell if it extended the tan at all and feel the least organic in a trio of obviously not organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We appreciate the Natural Glow Tan line since we live in Minnesota and it gives my partner a healthy glow mid winter in a state where everyone is pretty pasty come February.  The Tan does have a nice natural tone to it, so I support the product.  We just couldn&#x27;t tell if this product actually extends its life. It seems a little gimmicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it is highly fragrant, and a little thick. It feels greasy on application but quickly goes away. I guess it&#x27;s less offensive than it is gimmicky.</li>
            <li> I was surprised after using tanning mousse that my skin felt unpleasantly dry.  I have been in tanning beds that did not have the effect of drying my skin. This moisturizer helps dry skin a lot.  This moisturizer is thicker and a little greasier than most of my body creams.  After I got smart, I used plastic gloves to put it on to keep it off my hands.  It takes a while to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what this is really doing is just moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lot less expensive than the moisturizers I usually buy for tan extenders so I will probably switch completely.</li>
            <li> Jergens is a decent enough lotion, but this tan extender isn&#x27;t great. We live in Hawaii and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement or extension of our tan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does much more than other moisturizers to extend my tan, however, I love the smell. With that said, it does stain and needs to dry before you get dressed, so I suspect it dyes your skin rather than &amp;#34;extends&amp;#34; your tan because you are moisturizing. I do not think it made any difference compared to other moisturizers I have used. I peeled just as fast from our recent trip to DR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump makes it easy to dispense and I like not having to fumble with popping the top open. It does not feel greasy and absorbs nicely. I love the smell of it and love cocoa butter. The fragrance is not overpowering. My skin feels soft after and I have not had any reactions to it. You also don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
