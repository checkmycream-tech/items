            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to give makeup blending sponges a try for quite some time now after seeing all the hype about them in my favorite fashion magazines.</li>
            <li>I love the way my cream concealer just blends in my skin when I pat the blend</li>
            <li>I love these blending sponges.</li>
            <li>This blending sponge is better than any beauty sponge I have ever used including the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these sponges.</li>
            <li>Everything about this products screams elegant and fancy.</li>
            <li>I am in love with them-&#x27;</li>
            <li>I like it better then</li>
            <li>I would buy these again as they are much better quality than what I have bought in the store.</li>
            <li>And I tried the new set out today and it blended my foundation and concealer out beautifully.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with a really nice finish and they are so worth it!</li>
            <li>really works great and washes easily.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and help to apply my makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li>normally use a foundation brush and get great coverage.</li>
            <li>You can use a dry one for powders, a translucent setting powder is perfect!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless great product and the end result that you get from blending is very natural.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.  </li>

            <li>Not bad at all!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and durable as well.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>EASY cleaning.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes the makeup application a  smooth process.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the new Deluxe pro fan brush, which I use in almost every FINISHING situation.</li>
            <li>I recently reviewed the original 8 piece set from Be You, Beautifully also giving it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>They are latex free, which is really important to me.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I have never been comfortable using a foundation brush</li>
            <li>These sponges are fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li>I have been using a sponge to apply my liquid foundation for a few years now, and this one is great!</li>
            <li>Works great, and it is so functional that now it is the only &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; I carry with me in my cosmetic bag!</li>
            <li>I work all over the world but currently primarily Manhattan NYC.</li>
            <li>The sponge is soft and gives a good coverage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s expanding still, so far so good 😊</li>
            <li>Much easier to clean and love the feel of this beauty sponger more that the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what the name says, works great, I have tried numerous products but most don&#x27;t blend without leaving streaks...</li>
            <li>Super oft and easy to use</li>
            <li>I was excited.  </li>
            <li>The weird shaped one is amazing for my foundation (the indention is perfect to blend your jawline and nose).</li>
            <li>I clean them with baby shampoo and then spray a mix of water and tea tree oil on them before air drying.</li>
            <li>I clean these every time i clean my brushes.</li>
            <li>I liked about the original set was &amp;#34;the attention to detail&amp;#34; and with the new Kabuki Crystal set I am totally ready to handle any face shape any tricky skin coverage issues, and I feel that the two sets compliment each other flawlessly.</li>
            <li>These feel like you are doing something special for yourself.  </li>
            <li>This feels so amazing, soft and velvety.</li>
            <li>The Crystal Kabuki set offers me that amazing diversity.</li>
            <li>Nice soft makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li>Also, I feel refreshed putting my make up on because I use cool water to expand my sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did it blends very well</li>
            <li>These work amazingly well  and are super soft.</li>
            <li>I love my new Blend Me!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I have been spending so much money on the original beautyblender!</li>
            <li>really well and quite easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The 4 different options to work with eye application (or for the creative artist that subs one for concealer application) are perfect for all the smokey eyes and simple daily ideas I love to try out.</li>
            <li>I love this high quality sponges.</li>
            <li>I love this product and i will highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Great quality, I have used the larger one 15 times now, cleaning it every couple times, and it&#x27;s still like new.</li>
            <li>The little one is great for around the eyes or even for blending eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I like that they are latex free and are incredibly gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>They made my make up go on smooth and didn&#x27;t soak up too much make up.</li>
            <li>It was worth a shot</li>
            <li>To me that&#x27;s super important when you&#x27;re dealing with foundations in particular.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>First off, they come in their own little pouch that has a magnetic closure so you can be sure that they don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li>I had to take a star away, as I think I would prefer these to be a lighter color so that when I wash it, I can be 100% certain I&#x27;ve gotten it clean.</li>
            <li>Having the right tools saves time and this set will not disapoint.</li>
            <li>Back to the Kabuki Set:  I am so so excited to now be reviewing my new favorite Crystal Kabuki Brush set!</li>
            <li>I would send any artist or young teen learning tricks to her videos for amazing tips!</li>
            <li>The material is very soft, but strong.</li>
            <li>It took me a few weeks to figure out how these fit into my routine, but now I&#x27;m so glad I have them!</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very easy to get the makeup out of the pad completely, and I honestly like the coverage I get with just using my fingers better.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to try one of these product, i am so grateful i was able to finally get my hands on one of them ot use, thank you very much</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that you receive two different shapes in the sponges.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more of these and referring them to my friends.</li>
            <li>I actually like this one better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal because I use this Better Than Beauty Blender to push the concealer into my skin ( not rubbing) 4 stars for quality and 3 stars for price ;)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to build to the coverage you want, rather than trying to take away once it&#x27;s already on your face!</li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love all the different shapes included for any purpose you can come up with...</li>
            <li>If you have the original 8 piece add this one to complete your brush concert!</li>
            <li>I love make up sponges of all kinds and these are no different.</li>
            <li>First time using this type of product.</li>
            <li>They make life just a little bit more easy.</li>
            <li>Flat top, detail, pointed, angled...</li>
            <li>I prefer to use my sponge dry as I have found that it works better for me.  </li>
            <li>It is great wet or dry.</li>
            <li>These little sponges are so nice for application and blending.</li>
            <li>The professional make up tutorials by Allison, who I hear was trained at a very highly rated school in LA, was informative and fun to the MAX.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, with proper care these can last for months!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you get a set for yourself!</li>
            <li>These do not and applies your foundation really evenly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  and my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>They are high quality!</li>
            <li>I really like these sponges -</li>
            <li>Very durable.  </li>
            <li>I really like this blending sponge.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well blending my makeup.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came with two tear drop sponges instead of the other because they are better for the under eye area.</li>
            <li>The original Beauty Blender grows by about 50% when properly dampened, and so did this one!</li>
            <li>I can tell this will last longer than the Original Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>I was  becoming very curious as to what the hype was all about.</li>
            <li>Beauty Blender is a pretty good product but not really easy to blend because the material is a bit harder.</li>
            <li>Need a little more finishing powder?</li>
            <li>These blending sponges are soft and blend out my foundation very evenly.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like these sponges.</li>
            <li>because so much of my professional practice as a cosmotologyist is about diversity I come across so many different shapes and sizes with different things I want to emphasize.</li>
            <li>I love this product and they last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>These sponges apply makeup, concealer, and even primer evenly and without absorbing too much of the actual product!</li>
            <li>They are very soft and apply foundation evenly.</li>
            <li>&gt; The sponge is made of a dense, high quality foam that is soft of skin.</li>
            <li>VERY professional.</li>
            <li>Said the blender was very soft.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li>#1 Professional 8 Piece Makeup Brush Set w/ Designer case...Check it out!</li>
            <li>and like I said before they don&#x27;t fall apart so your not constantly having to use a new one!!</li>
            <li>I used a brush before, which I felt tugged at the sensitive eye are.</li>
            <li>Has been durable so far.  </li>
            <li>It is a soft sponge.</li>
            <li>She said the sponges were so soft that they felt like pillows on her face.</li>
            <li>When my daughter saw me using this, she yelled out loud &amp;#34;I Want One, Too.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Soft and well made makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>and they are very versatile for different parts of your face.</li>
            <li>I have been working professionally in the beauty industry for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>They last so much longer</li>
            <li>I would buy few more for back up.</li>
            <li>I have had some in the past that after one use I threw out because the quality was horrible, so I am thrilled about finding an awesome sponge.</li>
            <li>These are super soft and tight sponges.</li>
            <li>I bought the new ones because my 16 year old daughter made the mistake of ordering different ones</li>
            <li>In the past I have always used the cheap wedge sponges to apply my concealer.</li>
            <li>This new set utterly completes me as an equipped artist for any situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next thing that I really like about the set is that you get three different size sponges!  </li>
            <li>While initially I was skeptical as to the claims, this sponge set is exceptional.</li>
            <li>I use them wet or dry and they really help with blending.  </li>
            <li>These absorb a little, but not too much.</li>
            <li>A little too much couture needing smoothing?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anyone else who is debating on them or curious!!</li>

            <li> I love the way my cream concealer just blends in my skin when I pat the blend</li>
            <li> I love these blending sponges.</li>
            <li> This blending sponge is better than any beauty sponge I have ever used including the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these sponges.</li>
            <li> Everything about this products screams elegant and fancy.</li>
            <li> I am in love with them-&#x27;</li>
            <li> I like it better then</li>
            <li> I would buy these again as they are much better quality than what I have bought in the store.</li>
            <li> And I tried the new set out today and it blended my foundation and concealer out beautifully.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with a really nice finish and they are so worth it!</li>

            <li> Easy to use and makes the makeup application a  smooth process.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the new Deluxe pro fan brush, which I use in almost every FINISHING situation.</li>
            <li> I recently reviewed the original 8 piece set from Be You, Beautifully also giving it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> They are latex free, which is really important to me.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use and easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I have never been comfortable using a foundation brush</li>
            <li> These sponges are fantastic.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> I have been using a sponge to apply my liquid foundation for a few years now, and this one is great!</li>
            <li> Works great, and it is so functional that now it is the only &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; I carry with me in my cosmetic bag!</li>
            <li> I work all over the world but currently primarily Manhattan NYC.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft and gives a good coverage.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expanding still, so far so good 😊</li>
            <li> Much easier to clean and love the feel of this beauty sponger more that the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what the name says, works great, I have tried numerous products but most don&#x27;t blend without leaving streaks...</li>
            <li> Super oft and easy to use</li>
            <li> I was excited.  </li>
            <li> The weird shaped one is amazing for my foundation (the indention is perfect to blend your jawline and nose).</li>
            <li> I clean them with baby shampoo and then spray a mix of water and tea tree oil on them before air drying.</li>
            <li> I clean these every time i clean my brushes.</li>
            <li> I liked about the original set was &amp;#34;the attention to detail&amp;#34; and with the new Kabuki Crystal set I am totally ready to handle any face shape any tricky skin coverage issues, and I feel that the two sets compliment each other flawlessly.</li>
            <li> These feel like you are doing something special for yourself.  </li>
            <li> This feels so amazing, soft and velvety.</li>
            <li> The Crystal Kabuki set offers me that amazing diversity.</li>
            <li> Nice soft makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li> Also, I feel refreshed putting my make up on because I use cool water to expand my sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did it blends very well</li>
            <li> These work amazingly well  and are super soft.</li>
            <li> I love my new Blend Me!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have been spending so much money on the original beautyblender!</li>
            <li> really well and quite easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The 4 different options to work with eye application (or for the creative artist that subs one for concealer application) are perfect for all the smokey eyes and simple daily ideas I love to try out.</li>
            <li> I love this high quality sponges.</li>
            <li> I love this product and i will highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great quality, I have used the larger one 15 times now, cleaning it every couple times, and it&#x27;s still like new.</li>
            <li> The little one is great for around the eyes or even for blending eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I like that they are latex free and are incredibly gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> They made my make up go on smooth and didn&#x27;t soak up too much make up.</li>
            <li> It was worth a shot</li>
            <li> To me that&#x27;s super important when you&#x27;re dealing with foundations in particular.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.  </li>
            <li> First off, they come in their own little pouch that has a magnetic closure so you can be sure that they don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li> I had to take a star away, as I think I would prefer these to be a lighter color so that when I wash it, I can be 100% certain I&#x27;ve gotten it clean.</li>
            <li> Having the right tools saves time and this set will not disapoint.</li>
            <li> Back to the Kabuki Set:  I am so so excited to now be reviewing my new favorite Crystal Kabuki Brush set!</li>
            <li> I would send any artist or young teen learning tricks to her videos for amazing tips!</li>
            <li> The material is very soft, but strong.</li>
            <li> It took me a few weeks to figure out how these fit into my routine, but now I&#x27;m so glad I have them!</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very easy to get the makeup out of the pad completely, and I honestly like the coverage I get with just using my fingers better.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try one of these product, i am so grateful i was able to finally get my hands on one of them ot use, thank you very much</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that you receive two different shapes in the sponges.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more of these and referring them to my friends.</li>
            <li> I actually like this one better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal because I use this Better Than Beauty Blender to push the concealer into my skin ( not rubbing) 4 stars for quality and 3 stars for price ;)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to build to the coverage you want, rather than trying to take away once it&#x27;s already on your face!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love all the different shapes included for any purpose you can come up with...</li>
            <li> If you have the original 8 piece add this one to complete your brush concert!</li>
            <li> I love make up sponges of all kinds and these are no different.</li>
            <li> First time using this type of product.</li>
            <li> They make life just a little bit more easy.</li>
            <li> Flat top, detail, pointed, angled...</li>
            <li> I prefer to use my sponge dry as I have found that it works better for me.  </li>
            <li> It is great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> These little sponges are so nice for application and blending.</li>
            <li> The professional make up tutorials by Allison, who I hear was trained at a very highly rated school in LA, was informative and fun to the MAX.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, with proper care these can last for months!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you get a set for yourself!</li>
            <li> These do not and applies your foundation really evenly.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  and my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> They are high quality!</li>
            <li> I really like these sponges -</li>
            <li> Very durable.  </li>
            <li> I really like this blending sponge.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well blending my makeup.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came with two tear drop sponges instead of the other because they are better for the under eye area.</li>
            <li> The original Beauty Blender grows by about 50% when properly dampened, and so did this one!</li>
            <li> I can tell this will last longer than the Original Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> I was  becoming very curious as to what the hype was all about.</li>
            <li> Beauty Blender is a pretty good product but not really easy to blend because the material is a bit harder.</li>
            <li> Need a little more finishing powder?</li>
            <li> These blending sponges are soft and blend out my foundation very evenly.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like these sponges.</li>
            <li> because so much of my professional practice as a cosmotologyist is about diversity I come across so many different shapes and sizes with different things I want to emphasize.</li>
            <li> I love this product and they last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> These sponges apply makeup, concealer, and even primer evenly and without absorbing too much of the actual product!</li>
            <li> They are very soft and apply foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> &gt; The sponge is made of a dense, high quality foam that is soft of skin.</li>
            <li> VERY professional.</li>
            <li> Said the blender was very soft.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li> #1 Professional 8 Piece Makeup Brush Set w/ Designer case...Check it out!</li>
            <li> and like I said before they don&#x27;t fall apart so your not constantly having to use a new one!!</li>
            <li> I used a brush before, which I felt tugged at the sensitive eye are.</li>
            <li> Has been durable so far.  </li>
            <li> It is a soft sponge.</li>
            <li> She said the sponges were so soft that they felt like pillows on her face.</li>
            <li> When my daughter saw me using this, she yelled out loud &amp;#34;I Want One, Too.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Soft and well made makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> and they are very versatile for different parts of your face.</li>
            <li> I have been working professionally in the beauty industry for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> They last so much longer</li>
            <li> I would buy few more for back up.</li>
            <li> I have had some in the past that after one use I threw out because the quality was horrible, so I am thrilled about finding an awesome sponge.</li>
            <li> These are super soft and tight sponges.</li>
            <li> I bought the new ones because my 16 year old daughter made the mistake of ordering different ones</li>
            <li> In the past I have always used the cheap wedge sponges to apply my concealer.</li>
            <li> This new set utterly completes me as an equipped artist for any situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next thing that I really like about the set is that you get three different size sponges!  </li>
            <li> While initially I was skeptical as to the claims, this sponge set is exceptional.</li>
            <li> I use them wet or dry and they really help with blending.  </li>
            <li> These absorb a little, but not too much.</li>
            <li> A little too much couture needing smoothing?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to anyone else who is debating on them or curious!!</li>
            <li> My friend once had a sponge applicator and warned me that they were too stiff for her liking, however after trying these I am definitely recommending this brand to her because they were not stiff by any means!!</li>
            <li> Once you wet it, it will double in size.</li>
            <li> I use the smaller one for cream contour, wet, and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I like that you can wash and dry them out for reuse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using beauty blender (another brand) for long time and love the quality but beauty blender is very expensive.</li>
            <li> at least worth a try, you get two for less than one of those pink name brand ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have dark spots) and to get a smoother finish on my tinted moisturizer especially.  </li>
            <li> but I do plan on going back to my previous brand before I ordered this.</li>
            <li> me blenders wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Using a bouncing motion is key, and start with a little foundation...</li>
            <li> They definitely apply foundation with maximum coverage and with little ease.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve immediately known it&#x27;s not at all comparable when I wet the sponge</li>
            <li> I have used other types of sponges to put my foundation on</li>
            <li> Read on for my thoughts on other parts of the BYB collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used them a few times already - I use them dry since I don&#x27;t wear liquid makeup</li>
            <li> use maybe half the makeup I did before.</li>
            <li> But there was another black blender she tried and it was horrible).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like that they are black so after washing you know when they have been thoroughly cleansed.</li>
            <li> and so I used those little triangle sponges, but they absorb south product.</li>
            <li> I have had them for a few months now.</li>
            <li> No more makeup on my fingers and everything is on evenly.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with the first set I purchased.</li>
            <li> My wife loses it when she runs out of these...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and I&#x27;ve purchased less expensive versions of the Beauty Blender before</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Which was always very irritating.</li>
            <li> Like I said I must&#x27;ve gotten a bad one.</li>
            <li> You and your bridal clients, actors, models, and family will not be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am loving this sponge set!  I have used them a few times already - I use them dry since I don&#x27;t wear liquid makeup and they worked beautifully!  They are latex free, which is really important to me.  They were packaged beautifully too.  These feel like you are doing something special for yourself.  I highly recommend you get a set for yourself!</li>
            <li> I love these!!! The material is very soft, but strong. Blends all of my makeup perfectly. Shipped very fast.  I love this product and will be ordering more when needed.</li>
            <li> Great quality, I have used the larger one 15 times now, cleaning it every couple times, and it&#x27;s still like new. Works just as well as the much more expensive ones. Perfect!</li>
            <li> These are just alright. It&#x27;s not very easy to get the makeup out of the pad completely, and I honestly like the coverage I get with just using my fingers better. It was worth a shot but I probably won&#x27;t be buying anymore after I finish using these.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Once you wet it, it will double in size. It&#x27;s easy to use and fits perfectly in my hand. Works better than applying with my brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this high quality sponges. They make my makeup application flawless. They are easy to use and easier to clean. I love this product and i will highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!!! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I made this purchase! I used to use brushes to apply my liquid foundation, but after using these blending sponges I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back. They are so well made, and blend my concealer and foundation better than I have ever seen. I absolutely love that you receive two different shapes in the sponges. My friend once had a sponge applicator and warned me that they were too stiff for her liking, however after trying these I am definitely recommending this brand to her because they were not stiff by any means!! I love my new Blend Me! sponge set, and I can&#x27;t wait to tell all my friends about it!</li>
            <li> These blending sponges are soft and blend out my foundation very evenly.  I prefer to use my sponge dry as I have found that it works better for me.  Nevertheless great product and the end result that you get from blending is very natural.</li>
            <li> These are super soft and tight sponges. They wash well and haven&#x27;t shown any signs of wear after several uses and washes.  I&#x27;m very impressed with these!</li>
            <li> These sponges are The Best makeup sponges I have ever used. Most sponges soak up all of your foundation. These do not and applies your foundation really evenly. The pointed end works great to dab on under eye concealer. I used a brush before, which I felt tugged at the sensitive eye are. The brush went in the trash! Will definitely be ordering more of these and referring them to my friends. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Super oft and easy to use</li>
            <li> This make-up blender worked okay but I do plan on going back to my previous brand before I ordered this.</li>
            <li> interesting shape. worked well. I like using them</li>
            <li> Got for a gift was amazed</li>
            <li> These are amazing-best makeup sponges I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Love this item!! I hope they restock it soon. Compared to the beauty blender gasp I actually like this one better. I do wish it came with two tear drop sponges instead of the other because they are better for the under eye area. Please restock these!!</li>
            <li> Cheaper price than the beauty blend but it works the same.</li>
            <li> The blending sponge works much better than the brush when applying foundation. Love it!</li>
            <li> Nice soft makeup sponge.  Has been durable so far.  Seems to work well to blend in my CC cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this a two star review for the fact that I ordered the product and only received one sponge out of the two.</li>
            <li> Applies make up very smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> This blender works great! Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I love the results I have with these blending sponges! The little one is great for around the eyes or even for blending eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I love these.  They do make applying my makeup easier and smoother.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  and my girlfriend loves it. She says it works just like the beauty blender but for a way better deal!!</li>
            <li> good quality and easy to use</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I USE IT DAILY! AND NOT OVERPRICED GREAT QUALITY IVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER 3 MONTHS AND NO TEARS ON IT AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Works very well. It is a soft sponge. It blends makeup into your skin without the added pressure required by some products. It does not pull on skin when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing in face and does wonders with my foundation</li>
            <li> Just a great pair of makeup sponges and  very fast delivery.  Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay. I thought they would feel spongier by the way people were saying it evenly spreads. Feels like any dupe that I could&#x27;ve gotten for a cheaper price. Next time I&#x27;ll just spend the extra $5 and get another beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Blending Sponges and the case they came in! The case has a magnetic closure and mesh bottom to allow the sponges to breath. They are high quality! You won&#x27;t be disappointed, I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges!! They are perfect for applying foundation, tinted moisturizer, or BB cream. My make-up looks great after applying. So glad I discovered these!</li>
            <li> So far I really like these sponges. They are very soft and apply foundation evenly. And I like that you get two.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these sponges. To start, the packaging is beautiful. She said the sponges were so soft that they felt like pillows on her face. The lifetime warranty just makes this a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> These little sponges are so nice for application and blending. You get two different sizes. They wash nicely with baby shampoo. These sponges are easier to use than your fingers. They make life just a little bit more easy. Your makeup will look flawless.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all! I&#x27;ve been using beauty blender (another brand) for long time and love the quality but beauty blender is very expensive. I compared both products and I think this  Better Than Beauty Blender is a pretty good product but not really easy to blend because the material is a bit harder. It&#x27;s not a big deal because I use this Better Than Beauty Blender to push the concealer into my skin ( not rubbing) 4 stars for quality and 3 stars for price ;)</li>
            <li> It took me a few weeks to figure out how these fit into my routine, but now I&#x27;m so glad I have them! I have never been comfortable using a foundation brush and so I used those little triangle sponges, but they absorb south product. These absorb a little, but not too much. And it&#x27;s nice you can wash them.</li>
            <li> really works great and washes easily. I would buy few more for back up.</li>
            <li> These sponges do a great job at blending. Easy to use and durable as well.&lt;br /&gt;As others stated nice packaging too.</li>
            <li> I really like these sponges - I use them wet or dry and they really help with blending.  Great value for the product.</li>
            <li> Perfect product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> This blender is amazing! Granted, I have never tried the &#x27;name brand&#x27; one, but this thing is awesome!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use a foundation brush and get great coverage. This blender is WAY better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very natural-looking, very easy to accomplish. I&#x27;m so glad there are two in the package......&lt;br /&gt;just enough so you can use everything....concealer, foundation, facial highlighting pen, contouring, etc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and I&#x27;ve purchased less expensive versions of the Beauty Blender before and I&#x27;ve immediately known it&#x27;s not at all comparable when I wet the sponge and it doesn&#x27;t swell... The original Beauty Blender grows by about 50% when properly dampened, and so did this one! To me that&#x27;s super important when you&#x27;re dealing with foundations in particular. I use a lot of fuller coverage HD foundations when I work weddings and special occasions, and the damp blender gives you a flawless look even up close! The moisture keeps the foundation from soaking up into the sponge and allows for an even, beautiful coverage! Using a bouncing motion is key, and start with a little foundation... it&#x27;s much easier to build to the coverage you want, rather than trying to take away once it&#x27;s already on your face! I use the smaller one for cream contour, wet, and it works like a charm! You can use a dry one for powders, a translucent setting powder is perfect! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Beauty blender is truely the best way for applying your make up. I love the products by this brand as they dedicate to make the best quality beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack of beauty blender is really nice. The sponge is soft and gives a good coverage. It should be used damp for best coverage. It comes in a very good packing. This is one of the very good beauty blenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> UPDATED&lt;br /&gt;First off,  let me say I have never used a blender sponge. Wow, what a difference! I have used both of the blenders. This feels so amazing, soft and velvety. The weird shaped one is amazing for my foundation (the indention is perfect to blend your jawline and nose). The tear drop one I use for my concealer  and my powder.&lt;br /&gt;I use maybe half the makeup I did before. Also, I feel refreshed putting my make up on because I use cool water to expand my sponge.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and the box was a perfect fit for the sponges which are also in a plastic bag inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!  Love it!  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s at least worth a try, you get two for less than one of those pink name brand ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I have just ordered another set. My blenders are still working perfectly, they are still in great shape and aren&#x27;t even stained. I have had them for a few months now. I clean them with baby shampoo and then spray a mix of water and tea tree oil on them before air drying. I bought the new ones because my 16 year old daughter made the mistake of ordering different ones (she wanted to stop using her foundation brush which is streaky. But there was another black blender she tried and it was horrible).&lt;br /&gt; This product is amazing, with proper care these can last for months!!!</li>
            <li> When my daughter saw me using this, she yelled out loud &amp;#34;I Want One, Too.&amp;#34;  Good news is ...it comes with TWO.  Great~</li>
            <li> These sponges are fantastic. They definitely apply foundation with maximum coverage and with little ease.  I like that you can wash and dry them out for reuse.  I&#x27; bought additional sets for stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try one of these product, i am so grateful i was able to finally get my hands on one of them ot use, thank you very much</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used blending sponges before and am not too high-maintenance in the beauty department, but I like using these to blend concealer (I have dark spots) and to get a smoother finish on my tinted moisturizer especially.  I did try blending my mineral foundation with them, too, and they worked well.  They are a nice addition to my brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  just started buying my collection of makeup and tools in order to start learning how to contour.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying makeup evenly and having more natural results. Also perfect tool for contouring and blending.  Soft and well made makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to give makeup blending sponges a try for quite some time now after seeing all the hype about them in my favorite fashion magazines. It turns out it wasn&#x27;t just hype, these sponges really do a wonderful job of providing flawless, natural coverage. I use it for applying concealer, foundation and highlighter!&lt;br /&gt; The sponge is made of a dense, high quality foam that is soft of skin. The sponge cleans out easily and is holding up nicely</li>
            <li> Great set of blending sponges. I like that they are latex free and are incredibly gentle on your skin. These work amazingly well  and are super soft. Everyone should have a set of these blending sponges in their makeup case.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what the name says, works great, I have tried numerous products but most don&#x27;t blend without leaving streaks... This product leaves no streaks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Very durable.  Worth the price.  I have purchased cheaper brands and you could tell.  No comparison to these.  Deliver on time from vendor.</li>
            <li> Works great and glad that I am able to save money and reuse these. I clean these every time i clean my brushes.</li>
            <li> Great. Does exactly as advertised. Just as good as the Beauty Blender. A Must!</li>
            <li> Works great, very nice quality</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try it but I&#x27;ve never actually bought one and I&#x27;m so glad I did it blends very well and it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> I was see this product for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;These are great blenders and they are very versatile for different parts of your face. They are very squishy but they apply liquids and creams evenly and gives a flawless finish. They are easy to clean and are great for travel. I love the way my cream concealer just blends in my skin when I pat the blend me blenders wet or dry. Here are some pictures of me using them.</li>
            <li> I love them, my foundation looks flawless</li>
            <li> Love this sponge set!  I had been wanting to purchase some and when given the opportunity to try these out I was excited.  First off, they come in their own little pouch that has a magnetic closure so you can be sure that they don&#x27;t fall out.  Next thing that I really like about the set is that you get three different size sponges!  Good quality!</li>
            <li> I love these blending sponges. Totally changed the way I put my make up on! I have heard others using the blending sponge but never tried. I have used other types of sponges to put my foundation on but they would never spread evenly and always left lines. This blending sponge is soft and applies my foundations flawlessly! No more makeup on my fingers and everything is on evenly. Will be getting more to give to my family and friends their own blending sponge.</li>
            <li> It works so well! And it&#x27;s at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great blending sponge! I have been using a sponge to apply my liquid foundation for a few years now, and this one is great! Applies evenly and leaves almost an airbrushed look!</li>
            <li> Works great, and it is so functional that now it is the only &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; I carry with me in my cosmetic bag!</li>
            <li> Very Nice, Lightweight and easy to handle!</li>
            <li> I really like this blending sponge.  It blends in my MAC foundation perfectly. Easy to use and makes the makeup application a  smooth process. Great find.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges!  I&#x27;ve been using them to apply my foundation as well as blend and they work great!</li>
            <li> Great product and value.</li>
            <li> Where do i start? i got this product delivered in just TWO days! it has changed my life and the way i put my make up on. It leaves me with a really nice finish and they are so worth it! Thank you for this amazing product</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exactly as described. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I seldom write product reviews, but for this product I had to. This blending sponge is better than any beauty sponge I have ever used including the beauty blender. I can not describe just how great this product is at blending foundation. It is great wet or dry. It blends and is perfect for contouring highlighting and I even use it with my setting powders. I love this product and they last for a very long time. Try it out. They are a must for any makeup lover.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have been spending so much money on the original beautyblender! This product is identical is shape and quality! I hope they come out with a mini version too. I&#x27;m really glad I came across this product! Its going to save me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> While initially I was skeptical as to the claims, this sponge set is exceptional. Cover(s) and Blend(s) really well and quite easy to clean. Having the right tools saves time and this set will not disapoint.</li>
            <li> These sponges apply makeup, concealer, and even primer evenly and without absorbing too much of the actual product! I also like that they are black so after washing you know when they have been thoroughly cleansed.</li>
            <li> I was really happy to see that they sent me a replacement set! I was so disappointed with the first set I purchased. Like I said I must&#x27;ve gotten a bad one. And I tried the new set out today and it blended my foundation and concealer out beautifully. I washed it as well an it&#x27;s expanding still, so far so good 😊</li>
            <li> Blending sponge highlights: Value. Versatility. EASY cleaning. Gorgeous presentation. GREAT for travel. VERY professional. A must HAVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;The shape of these sponges is so perfect for the contour of any face and I love the pointed shape providing GREAT accessibility! Read on for my thoughts on other parts of the BYB collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Name Is Breanna. I have been working professionally in the beauty industry for over 15 years. I work all over the world but currently primarily Manhattan NYC. I recently reviewed the original 8 piece set from Be You, Beautifully also giving it a 5 star rating. #1 Professional 8 Piece Makeup Brush Set w/ Designer case...Check it out! Also, if you haven&#x27;t been the the Be You Beautifully dot Com website I strongly recommend a visit there! It was like hanging out with pros and girlfriends at the same time with their family owned approach! The professional make up tutorials by Allison, who I hear was trained at a very highly rated school in LA, was informative and fun to the MAX. I would send any artist or young teen learning tricks to her videos for amazing tips! Back to the Kabuki Set:  I am so so excited to now be reviewing my new favorite Crystal Kabuki Brush set! I have to start out by saying: Value. Value. VALUE!!! What a price point, what an incredible bang for my bucks! This new set utterly completes me as an equipped artist for any situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about the original set was &amp;#34;the attention to detail&amp;#34; and with the new Kabuki Crystal set I am totally ready to handle any face shape any tricky skin coverage issues, and I feel that the two sets compliment each other flawlessly. I LOVE the new Deluxe pro fan brush, which I use in almost every FINISHING situation. Powder excess under eyes? Deluxe Pro Fan. A little too much couture needing smoothing? Deluxe Pro Fan. Need a little more finishing powder? Deluxe Pro Fan! It is awesome! I love all the different shapes included for any purpose you can come up with... Flat top, detail, pointed, angled... because so much of my professional practice as a cosmotologyist is about diversity I come across so many different shapes and sizes with different things I want to emphasize. The Crystal Kabuki set offers me that amazing diversity. The 4 different options to work with eye application (or for the creative artist that subs one for concealer application) are perfect for all the smokey eyes and simple daily ideas I love to try out. If you have the original 8 piece add this one to complete your brush concert! If you don&#x27;t have either get started today! And buy them all!!! You and your bridal clients, actors, models, and family will not be disappointed! The sponges are incredible and you MUST add them to your collection!</li>
            <li> Perfect Coverage, Beauty Blender Sponges&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how beautifully Beauty Blender Sponges work on my skin! I have a blotchy skin tone and I get excellent coverage with Beauty Blend. I absolutely love these sponges. They&#x27;re the best blending sponges I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. She loved it! Said the blender was very soft. Very good dupe of Sephora&#x27;s Beauty Blender and cheaper too!</li>
            <li> Everything about this products screams elegant and fancy. It worked very well blending my makeup. This was very easy to wash. I have had some in the past that after one use I threw out because the quality was horrible, so I am thrilled about finding an awesome sponge. NOTE: Item was purchased through a promotional discount.</li>
            <li> These blenders are so cool! They are super soft and help to apply my makeup perfectly. I am in love with them-&#x27;</li>
            <li> They are alright, but still do the job.</li>
            <li> I had been seeing these beauty blenders for awhile now in several different places. I was  becoming very curious as to what the hype was all about. So I finally decided to find out for myself. Now I see why and wished I would have purchased them sooner. They&#x27;re great!!  They don&#x27;t Crack or crumble away when applying foundation to your face. Which was always very irritating. I&#x27;m no longer irratated when applying foundation. They allow you to apply your makeup much more evenly and smooth!! Plus, a huge bonus is the money you save by using these!!  They last so much longer and like I said before they don&#x27;t fall apart so your not constantly having to use a new one!! I highly recommend these to anyone else who is debating on them or curious!!</li>
            <li> I received a discount code and told to give my unbiased opinion. I love make up sponges of all kinds and these are no different. They made my make up go on smooth and didn&#x27;t soak up too much make up. I will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> I love this better than the original Beauty Blender!! Much easier to clean and love the feel of this beauty sponger more that the Beauty Blender. I can tell this will last longer than the Original Beauty Blender. I will never buy that one again! I am stuck on this Blend Me! Beautifully beauty sponge!!</li>
            <li> help a lot when is time to put make up and blend it and for the price I received  this product is awesome</li>
            <li> Love this Blend me blender! Blends foundation absolutely beautifully.. I like it better then my beauty blender for-sure!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. Very nice. I&#x27;ve never used one before in my 10+ years of using foundation, and I can now see the benefits of a blending sponge. I had to take a star away, as I think I would prefer these to be a lighter color so that when I wash it, I can be 100% certain I&#x27;ve gotten it clean.</li>
            <li> My wife loses it when she runs out of these...</li>
            <li> I love this!! This is the best beauty blender EVER!!! I have a latex allergy and these dont irritate me at all! My makeup looks flawless.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always used the cheap wedge sponges to apply my concealer. After using these I couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference they made! They work great and smooth my concealer WAY better! Great product!</li>
            <li> This blender is amazing!!! It feels nice ok my skin and blends beautifully.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> First time using this type of product. Very pleased with results.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  Very easy to use and clean.  I would buy these again as they are much better quality than what I have bought in the store.</li>
