    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great coverage!</li>
            <li>Excellent foundation at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and the Bourjous 1,2,3 perfect Foundation (which I also reviewed).</li>
            <li>I will say though, if you&#x27;re very fair this might not suit you.</li>
            <li>The color range is great and it smells so good!</li>
            <li>This is a great formula.  </li>
            <li>and it is still a great foundation.</li>
            <li>makes my skin look great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I am loving this foundation!</li>
            <li>but this is a pleasant surprise to have a foundation that smells like fruits.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is a good gel foundation, It feels good on the face.</li>
            <li>the best light to median coverage foundation</li>
            <li>looks really nice and is a nice color match for fair porcelain skin!</li>
            <li>Matches my skin tone perfectly and has such flawless coverage for me!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Super good!</li>
            <li>This foundation is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing foundation.</li>
            <li>The seal was intact, however it looked liked</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most amazing finish on my skin.</li>
            <li>does more damage than good, even with a fine milled pressed powder blotted onto the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li>Amazing foundation for such a great price!</li>
            <li>i have very light, dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>Better than most high-end foundations.</li>
            <li>I just wish it were available in the US!</li>
            <li>so what has worn off may look better on myself than one who has more discoloration to cover.  </li>
            <li>make sure you set with a powder.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it leaves me almost dewy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking to more hydrating foundations from now on.</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful though, is so easy to apply, and I can tell is extremely gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am relieved that it was busted, though, because I was able to notice how strong this foundation smells.</li>
            <li>this foundation is really good on dry skin, the coverage is buildable can be applied very lightly and looks really nice, dewy.</li>
            <li>it could have easily been tampered with.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After an hour of wear, this foundation settles into my pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>While it has a pleasant scent, I have extremely sensitive skin and wouldn&#x27;t have bought this</li>
            <li>I love Bourjois in general and have heard so many amazing reviews of this foundation that I decided to order and try it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with any wrinkles (fine or otherwise), anyone with larger pores, or anyone with combination skin./&gt;Trying to touch it up does more damage than good, even with a fine milled pressed powder blotted onto the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li>Light coverage</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this foundation.  </li>
            <li>which is too light for me</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide on and hide as much as I&#x27;d like but it does feel nice on.</li>
            <li>but honestly it doesn&#x27;t smell like much to me.</li>
            <li>I got the lightest color and while I do have a light skin tone</li>
            <li>It just perfectly fit in the summer.</li>
            <li>Very worth $13.  </li>
            <li>This foundation is very nice, and I would re-purchase it, but through a different place.</li>
            <li>Overall a good light foundation for combination skin in summer.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>I was recently on the search for good drugstore foundations.</li>
            <li>I have yet to use it extensively, but the few times I have used it, it has blended in very nicely and felt great on my parched skin.</li>
            <li>Not that I particularly WANT a fruity smelling foundation, but I just thought it was worth mentioning because so many people seem to mention its scent.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>it seemed like a really nice smooth consistency, kind of creamy without being thick, and lightweight and smooth with seemingly decent coverage.</li>
            <li>This foundation is slightly darker and more warm toned than that shade.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Trying to blend too much also creates more of a problem with streaking and the streaking becomes heavier and more noticeable, creating an even more uneven result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I preferred how this foundation made my skin look compared to the &amp;#34;1,2,3.&amp;#34; It definitely did give a nice glow.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not the amazon seller&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a beautiful natural finish and truly flatters, even on my dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Without the right setting techniques, I would say this foundation lasts 6-8 hours without wearing off.  </li>
            <li>It has a VERY strong fruity and floral scent that isn&#x27;t obvious when you first pump it out.  </li>
            <li>It looks amazing on the skin, and hides dry patches.</li>
            <li>By hour 3 it is completely separated and has fully pooled into my pores and fine lines and slid every which way.</li>
            <li>I have seen this mentioned by many beauty bloggers and finally decided to order it and give it a shot, because I seem to struggle with finding the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; foundation.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this because it was sold through the Amazon Marketplace, through a seller named &amp;#34;Passion for Perfumes&amp;#34; not the first place I&#x27;d plan to buy a foundation from.</li>
            <li>It claims to have extracts of various fruits (pomegranates, apricots, melon, apple, lychee, goji berries) to bring a glow to the skin and also help treat it (as the name healthy mix serum suggests).</li>
            <li>and it works very well!</li>
            <li>When I first received it I noticed it wasn&#x27;t sealed or anything which was kind of a let down.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t accentuate the dry patches on my skin, it&#x27;s very comfortable to wear and doesn&#x27;t make me feel</li>
            <li>It has light coverage, looks like skin, and the 51 ivory is not crazy pink like most american drugstore foundations.</li>
            <li>had I known it was so strongly scented (not just with fruits, but actual fragrance).</li>
            <li>Wears well, looks beautiful on the skin, medium-light coverage, very lightweight, has a fruity scent, too dark for me (NARS Gobi), relatively long wearing</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with any wrinkles (fine or otherwise), anyone with larger pores, or anyone with combination skin.</li>
            <li>For me, not so much.</li>
            <li>and it is also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It matches me really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Cover is almost nothing,but I do really like the smell</li>
            <li>It does have a really subtle fruity scent, but by people&#x27;s reviews I was expecting it to smell more strongly.</li>
            <li>I could make the color work by mixing with other better matches but the smell just makes this a no go for me.</li>
            <li>It has an incredibly natural finish and lasts a long time, and with the right powders and setting spray can last 10 hours, although I do have a nice skin tone</li>
            <li>I love that the texture is pretty thick but doesn&#x27;t feel caked on my face</li>
            <li>The consistency is thicker (it&#x27;s a gel foundation) than the &amp;#34;1, 2, 3,&amp;#34; and also has more coverage and doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry.</li>
            <li>Looks extremely natural on skin!</li>
            <li>Of all my makeup, I have yet to find the one foundation that I really like, but this one might finally be the one!!</li>
            <li>I got it early.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely could be more pale.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not dry completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating, moisturizing with a broad range of products and masks, using acid toners, etc.</li>
            <li>This is a personal hygiene sort of product, and I wouldn&#x27;t put something that seemed open already anywhere near my skin</li>
            <li>It applies without settling into dry spots, and gives a very natural, lightweight finish.</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It applies without settling into dry spots, and gives a very natural, lightweight finish.</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was worried the lightest shade, 51, might be too dark for my very pale skin, but it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, it does have a yellow undertone (which works for me but might not work so well for other people).</li>
            <li> May work for others with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was told to try this out because of my really dry patchy skin.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to powder it because I am dry.</li>
            <li> Despite its serum-like texture, it emphasizes every flaw, every dry patch, on my skin.</li>
            <li> This foundation was recommended to me because I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Too wet of a foundation for me.  </li>
            <li> It stays wet and tacky on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Shipping took a while (as expected, it shipped from the UK</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just enough for everyday makeup</li>
            <li> The finish is dewy, but in a way that remains a bit wet or tacky...</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, but it&#x27;s not for my dry skin, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Setting with translucent powder creates an extremely cakey and patchy result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely noticeable and unflattering.</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of a fragrance, but it&#x27;s not off-putting and doesn&#x27;t last past application.</li>
            <li> It almost impossible to blend it with your fingers, a fluffy foundation brush is better but it still takes longer than what I&#x27;m typically used to to get it to an even state.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For loreal tru match I am usually w2 on my pale days.</li>
            <li> But I am in the process of returning it due to it being broken, and will probably not re-order with this seller or any other seller.</li>
            <li> The color was lighter also than the &amp;#34;1,2,3,&amp;#34; but alas was still a shade too dark, so down my neck it went!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually expect my foundation to smell at all</li>
            <li> After reading past reviews from others about the seller, I took a chance and purchased it in it&#x27;s lightest shade, 51 Vanille Clair.</li>

            <li> This is a great formula.  Better than most high-end foundations.</li>
            <li> Too wet of a foundation for me.  It stays wet and tacky on my skin.  May work for others with dry skin.  For me, not so much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Matches my skin tone perfectly and has such flawless coverage for me! Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Great coverage! I love that the texture is pretty thick but doesn&#x27;t feel caked on my face and it is also very moisturizing. The color range is great and it smells so good! I don&#x27;t usually expect my foundation to smell at all but this is a pleasant surprise to have a foundation that smells like fruits.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It looks amazing on the skin, and hides dry patches.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly light and easy to apply. Light coverage but just enough for me. Overall a good light foundation for combination skin in summer.</li>
            <li> This foundation was recommended to me because I have very dry skin. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing! It matches me really well, it doesn&#x27;t accentuate the dry patches on my skin, it&#x27;s very comfortable to wear and doesn&#x27;t make me feel/look like I&#x27;m wearing a mask. Keep in mind, it does have a yellow undertone (which works for me but might not work so well for other people). Shipping took a while (as expected, it shipped from the UK and I&#x27;m in the US) but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have seen this mentioned by many beauty bloggers and finally decided to order it and give it a shot, because I seem to struggle with finding the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; foundation. Of all my makeup, I have yet to find the one foundation that I really like, but this one might finally be the one!! It applies without settling into dry spots, and gives a very natural, lightweight finish. I am loving this foundation! I just wish it were available in the US!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this foundation.  It is light-medium coverage.  It has an incredibly natural finish and lasts a long time, and with the right powders and setting spray can last 10 hours, although I do have a nice skin tone so what has worn off may look better on myself than one who has more discoloration to cover.  Without the right setting techniques, I would say this foundation lasts 6-8 hours without wearing off.  It looks beautiful though, is so easy to apply, and I can tell is extremely gentle on my skin.  Very worth $13.  I purchased one, and then I bought another.</li>
            <li> i have very light, dehydrated skin. i use my fingers to apply this so it melts into the skin. looks really nice and is a nice color match for fair porcelain skin! make sure you set with a powder.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the shade selection isn&#x27;t what I expected, the lightest shade still turns to a darker hue as the day goes on. But that&#x27;s not the amazon seller&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a beautiful natural finish and truly flatters, even on my dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I am giving this item three stars because I am on the fence about it. I did not apply this makeup to my face as it arrived busted (the makeup had spilled onto the bubble wrap). I can&#x27;t believe some reviewers who received damaged or potentially tampered with foundation actually put them on their face! This is a personal hygiene sort of product, and I wouldn&#x27;t put something that seemed open already anywhere near my skin (my product did not seem to be sealed either). I am relieved that it was busted, though, because I was able to notice how strong this foundation smells. While it has a pleasant scent, I have extremely sensitive skin and wouldn&#x27;t have bought this had I known it was so strongly scented (not just with fruits, but actual fragrance). I will say that I was pleasantly surprised that this item arrived roughly two to three weeks ahead of it&#x27;s scheduled arrival time. But I am in the process of returning it due to it being broken, and will probably not re-order with this seller or any other seller. Would recommend others try for themselves, but don&#x27;t use it if it&#x27;s open or if you may have an issue with fragrance in your makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really moisturizing. Super good!</li>
            <li> This is a good gel foundation, It feels good on the face. The only bad part here for me is I chose No51 which is too light for me</li>
            <li> I was told to try this out because of my really dry patchy skin. It doesn&#x27;t glide on and hide as much as I&#x27;d like but it does feel nice on. It&#x27;s just enough for everyday makeup but I wouldn&#x27;t wear this if I was going out at night.</li>
            <li> I love Bourjois in general and have heard so many amazing reviews of this foundation that I decided to order and try it. When I first received it I noticed it wasn&#x27;t sealed or anything which was kind of a let down. People rave about the scent but honestly it doesn&#x27;t smell like much to me. It does have a really subtle fruity scent, but by people&#x27;s reviews I was expecting it to smell more strongly. Not that I particularly WANT a fruity smelling foundation, but I just thought it was worth mentioning because so many people seem to mention its scent.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried it on the back of my hand it seemed like a really nice smooth consistency, kind of creamy without being thick, and lightweight and smooth with seemingly decent coverage. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve used it a total of three times. Every time I have the same experience. It feels a bit heavier of my skin than I anticipated and doesn&#x27;t blend into my skin well. In fact, it&#x27;s quite streaky. It almost impossible to blend it with your fingers, a fluffy foundation brush is better but it still takes longer than what I&#x27;m typically used to to get it to an even state.&lt;br /&gt;It does not dry completely. The finish is dewy, but in a way that remains a bit wet or tacky...adding to the heaviness and the ease of streaking. Setting with translucent powder creates an extremely cakey and patchy result. It&#x27;s so tacky that the powder just sticks to the surface instead of melding into the foundation. Trying to blend too much also creates more of a problem with streaking and the streaking becomes heavier and more noticeable, creating an even more uneven result.&lt;br /&gt;After an hour of wear, this foundation settles into my pores and fine lines. It&#x27;s extremely noticeable and unflattering. By hour 3 it is completely separated and has fully pooled into my pores and fine lines and slid every which way. My skin looks greasy and looks like I&#x27;ve never used foundation in my life and like I don&#x27;t know how to apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to touch it up does more damage than good, even with a fine milled pressed powder blotted onto the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, it oxidizes on me something fierce. It becomes almost 2 shades warmer by the one hour mark.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion this foundation does not work for me. Definitely a  disappointment. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with any wrinkles (fine or otherwise), anyone with larger pores, or anyone with combination skin./&gt;Trying to touch it up does more damage than good, even with a fine milled pressed powder blotted onto the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, it oxidizes on me something fierce.

            <li> This foundation is amazing. It smells really nice and looks beautiful. I will say though, if you&#x27;re very fair this might not suit you. I got the lightest color and while I do have a light skin tone I&#x27;m definitely could be more pale. For loreal tru match I am usually w2 on my pale days. This foundation is slightly darker and more warm toned than that shade. It works for me though. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this but unfortunately it is way too dark for me.  The color isn&#x27;t the problem, though, the issue I have is the overpowering scent of this product.  It has a VERY strong fruity and floral scent that isn&#x27;t obvious when you first pump it out.  I just applied to the back of my hand to look at the finish and I had to wash my hand twice to get the smell to go away as it didn&#x27;t fade even after using makeup remover.  IF YOU SUFFER FROM MIGRAINES - stay away!  I could make the color work by mixing with other better matches but the smell just makes this a no go for me.</li>
            <li> Cover is almost nothing,but I do really like the smell and it is still a great foundation. It just perfectly fit in the summer.</li>
            <li> the best light to median coverage foundation</li>
            <li> Excellent foundation at an excellent price. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Amazing foundation. I got it early. It&#x27;s the most amazing finish on my skin. I is too yellow and I got the 52 Vanille one so I just either put a drop of moisturizer or a lighter foundation. I absolutely love how it leaves me almost dewy and I don&#x27;t have to powder it because I am dry. But yeah, the foundation is definitely buildable AND affordable. I wish it was still at sephora in the states!</li>
            <li> best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used. makes my skin look great</li>
            <li> I was recently on the search for good drugstore foundations. I purchased this and the Bourjous 1,2,3 perfect Foundation (which I also reviewed). I was hesitant to buy this because it was sold through the Amazon Marketplace, through a seller named &amp;#34;Passion for Perfumes&amp;#34; not the first place I&#x27;d plan to buy a foundation from. After reading past reviews from others about the seller, I took a chance and purchased it in it&#x27;s lightest shade, 51 Vanille Clair. It arrived to me about 2 weeks later, in a bubble wrapped envelope. The seal was intact, however it looked liked it could have easily been tampered with. I still used it, applying it with my realtechniques makeup sponge, and setting it with Chanel&#x27;s Les Beige powder in N10. It claims to have extracts of various fruits (pomegranates, apricots, melon, apple, lychee, goji berries) to bring a glow to the skin and also help treat it (as the name healthy mix serum suggests). It does have a fruity smell, hopefully from the extracts, but still probably contains fragrance. It is also hypoallergenic. The consistency is thicker (it&#x27;s a gel foundation) than the &amp;#34;1, 2, 3,&amp;#34; and also has more coverage and doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry. The color was lighter also than the &amp;#34;1,2,3,&amp;#34; but alas was still a shade too dark, so down my neck it went! I preferred how this foundation made my skin look compared to the &amp;#34;1,2,3.&amp;#34; It definitely did give a nice glow. This foundation is very nice, and I would re-purchase it, but through a different place.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and arrived in good condition. I have yet to use it extensively, but the few times I have used it, it has blended in very nicely and felt great on my parched skin. It does have a bit of a fragrance, but it&#x27;s not off-putting and doesn&#x27;t last past application. I was worried the lightest shade, 51, might be too dark for my very pale skin, but it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> this foundation is really good on dry skin, the coverage is buildable can be applied very lightly and looks really nice, dewy.</li>
            <li> Amazing foundation for such a great price! Looks extremely natural on skin! I&#x27;m soooo picky about foundations and usually stick with Armani or Chanel but this one exceeds them. It has light coverage, looks like skin, and the 51 ivory is not crazy pink like most american drugstore foundations. I have dry and sensitive skin and it works very well! I mix this with Face Atelier white foundation because I am paler than death to lighten it a bit.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, but it&#x27;s not for my dry skin, unfortunately. Despite its serum-like texture, it emphasizes every flaw, every dry patch, on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating, moisturizing with a broad range of products and masks, using acid toners, etc. in order to prep my skin for this and I never see an improvement. I&#x27;ll be sticking to more hydrating foundations from now on.</li>
            <li> Wears well, looks beautiful on the skin, medium-light coverage, very lightweight, has a fruity scent, too dark for me (NARS Gobi), relatively long wearing</li>
