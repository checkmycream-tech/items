            <li>Awesome images, stamps perfectly, great value/quality, and I am still confused about the pretzels w/ coffee mugs.</li>
            <li>First of LOVE!</li>
            <li>Overall most of the prints stamp and look great.</li>
            <li>The do fine on me.</li>
            <li>would also like to mention that the seller, Cheeky, was very prompt, courteous and helpful (my delivery was delayed by Customs)</li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase overall.</li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>hummm, I was excited to get this plate...</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun!</li>
            <li>Everyone has their own style, but they are a modern twist on nail art designs that can seem to lean too far toward cutesy and frilly for my own taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it came in the mail after a month I was really excited</li>
            <li>Very nice ..took a long time to come</li>
            <li>I tried out all of the designs, and unlike other plates, all of the designs stamp beautifully.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more real soon.</li>
            <li>I have some problems getting full coverage.</li>
            <li>and I keep them in an album with full sheet page</li>
            <li>It can in a timely fashion, but that is the only good thing I can say.</li>
            <li>The previous Jumbo plates were great</li>
            <li>Would definitely purchase more for cheeky!</li>
            <li>, there are only 3 that I don&#x27;t love!</li>
            <li>Large prints that fit the thumb to&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally worth the 9$ I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The designs are just so fun and versatile.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so easy to use and makes my nails look professionally done</li>
            <li>It gives a crisp pretty image.  </li>
            <li>The first plates that I ordered from Cheeky were the 2013 summer collection</li>
            <li>and I thought they were very affortable and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>You would spend pretty close to that for just one Konad, or two Pueen discs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first was also from Cheeky and was the jumbo size.  </li>
            <li>I just did the flowers on the top row last night.</li>
            <li>The floral image on the top row (6th across) is especially intricate, but it stamps crisply and is gorgeous!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the designs, especially the DNA helix (I&#x27;m science need).</li>
            <li>They make it easy to create some exotic manicures with little time.</li>
            <li>would very highly recommend getting this plate.  </li>
            <li>I expected better from a Cheeky Product</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore all the cheeky plates and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I really like both of the other plates (Princess Charming and European Romance)</li>
            <li>Better than some of the other plates in this series.</li>
            <li>I am particularly fond of the plaid.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to all stampede.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to learn how to do it right, but worth the effort.</li>
            <li>They are etched deep and the designs are crisp.</li>
            <li>They should have left the scale of the design normal while leaving the suface area large.</li>
            <li>large specific designs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues with it so far.</li>
            <li>I get tons of compliments on my nails and people think I had them professionally done.  </li>
            <li>Works well, the images I have tried so far have stamped without any problems.</li>
            <li>So far no issues stamping even on intricate designs</li>
            <li>have tested all the images on copy paper using Konad Special Black stamping polish and Essie Penny Talk nail polish.</li>
            <li>Most of the images are not cut deep enough and over half of the designs don&#x27;t transfer.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they are a bit big, as with all cheeky plates, but better that than too small in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The jumbo size is absolutely the way to go if you have long nails.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they are too small for my thumbs, but fit all my other fingers fairly well.</li>
            <li>so no sharp edges</li>
            <li>only complaint I have is that the plate arrived with a huge scratch across 5 designs, it doesn&#x27;t hinder stamping though.</li>

            <li> i like a few of the designs on there, but the price for this product was a bit too high.</li>
            <li> I would say if you have small to average sized fingers go for it, if you have very large nail beds</li>
            <li> I am not artistic but with these I can have the coolest nails EVER with barely any</li>
            <li> Received this item quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a square or rectangular stamping tool with these, as the round one I have didn&#x27;t transfer the entire design.</li>
            <li> , therefore I have no problem recommending this seller to other buyers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this plate along with 2 other Cheeky plates.</li>
            <li> Due to the curve at the bottom these might not suit those with longer or wider nails.</li>
            <li> the prints are too big and you can&#x27;t tell what it is or the designs is too small and too spaced out and looks odd too.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that some of  </li>
            <li> It was a piece of steel with slight indentions for the graphics.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not excited anymore.  </li>
            <li> No happy overall.</li>
            <li> plate is heavy and mounted on hard plastic</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll ask the Chinese for my money back :-(</li>
            <li> Even the ones with small details.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> but I had a hard time getting the transfer.</li>
            <li> But while waiting for your parcel there were negative reviews.</li>
            <li> backing is a thick cardboard</li>
            <li> The indentions were so shallow.</li>
            <li> But there are some bad etchings on this plate and the designs are to big for my nails.</li>
            <li> This one is a fail for me.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this was just a bad plate.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nail images aren&#x27;t etched deep enough. Kind of hit or miss with this plate. I expected better from a Cheeky Product</li>
            <li> First of LOVE! The only complaint is that some of  the prints are too big and you can&#x27;t tell what it is or the designs is too small and too spaced out and looks odd too. But that would be just for a couple. Overall most of the prints stamp and look great. Would definitely purchase more for cheeky!</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. it is just what it describes. large specific designs.</li>
            <li> Works and my girls love it</li>
            <li> I bought this plstinu polish, because I loved the pictures on it. I bought a plate - there was only one review and neutral. But while waiting for your parcel there were negative reviews. I wanted to give this plate, but did not, fearing that it does not work and keep it. And what was my surprise when I poprobyvala draw pictures and they turn out! I still pictures printed with poprobyvala, but those who typed - all worked! The only thing that I can not say how it works with lacquer Konad - I used regular nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I like the images and the quality seem to be pretty good. Better than some of the other plates in this series.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. They make it easy to create some exotic manicures with little time. I am particularly fond of the plaid.</li>
            <li> hummm, I was excited to get this plate...and then I got it and I&#x27;m not excited anymore.  Most of the images are not cut deep enough and over half of the designs don&#x27;t transfer.  The ones that do are not the cutest ones.  BOOOOO!  I think I&#x27;ll ask the Chinese for my money back :-(</li>
            <li> Really love the designs on this plate, although certain designs are too spaced out and don&#x27;t look great on the nails. The plate arrived on time too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the plate arrived with a huge scratch across 5 designs, it doesn&#x27;t hinder stamping though.</li>
            <li> this has been a blast to use.  It totally covers your nail.  It gives a crisp pretty image.  I am having so much fun!</li>
            <li> i like a few of the designs on there, but the price for this product was a bit too high.</li>
            <li> I really love this plate. I wish I got more. They are etched deep and the designs are crisp. It worked great.</li>
            <li> I like it  just seemed to be a lot of confusion getting it,  do not know if I will order from them again</li>
            <li> The first plates that I ordered from Cheeky were the 2013 summer collection and I thought they were very affortable and well worth the price. Those plates were nice for manis but this plate I can use for both manis and pedicures because of the size. I will be ordering more real soon.</li>
            <li> I love Cheeky nail plates.  Until now. Maybe this was just a bad plate.  But there are some bad etchings on this plate and the designs are to big for my nails. They just don&#x27;t translate well.  They should have left the scale of the design normal while leaving the suface area large. I don&#x27;t think these compaines get what stamping is all about.  This one is a fail for me.  I bought 2 plates but I don&#x27;t think I will get the rest of them.  The previous Jumbo plates were great and I go 5 of those.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this one yet but all of their products have worked out so well for me I don&#x27;t ever hesitate to buy more even if I cant use it yet! they&#x27;re so easy to use and makes my nails look professionally done</li>
            <li> Works very nicely and makes really cool designs.</li>
            <li> I would like to recommend this template to all stampers out there!&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent value for the money - you get 49 patterns to choose from.  You would spend pretty close to that for just one Konad, or two Pueen discs.&lt;br /&gt;I have just tested all of the patterns, and all of them are engraved properly, and transfer well; I&#x27;ve used Konad black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention that the seller, Cheeky, was very prompt, courteous and helpful (my delivery was delayed by Customs), therefore I have no problem recommending this seller to other buyers.</li>
            <li> Love my plate love how I can create many manis I get compliments about my nails all the time</li>
            <li> Works great for beginners or experts! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, all of the designs I use and love. I&#x27;ve had no issues with it so far. The only thing is that with the metal scraper I have the images weren&#x27;t transferring well and it would scratch the plate, but now instead I just use a old credit card that I smoothed the edges with a nail buffer and it works 100%, great, awesome, two thumbs up five stars, 10/10. Totally worth the 9$ I paid for it.</li>
            <li> So nice stamping plate gorgeous images and great quality like all the plates&lt;br /&gt;from cheeky</li>
            <li> This is the second nail plate I have purchased.  The first was also from Cheeky and was the jumbo size.  The designs are just so fun and versatile.  I am not artistic but with these I can have the coolest nails EVER with barely any work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plate is heavy and mounted on hard plastic and I have had zero problems with the designs transferring.  Even the ones with small details.  I just did the flowers on the top row last night. I was worried that the details on the middle of the flowers would not show up or would be smudged but they are crystal clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would very highly recommend getting this plate.  Designs are big enough to cover all of my nails.  Love Love Love Cheeky #10 Nail Plate.</li>
            <li> I love these stamping plates.  The jumbo size is absolutely the way to go if you have long nails.  I get tons of compliments on my nails and people think I had them professionally done.  It takes a little practice to learn how to do it right, but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Since I have no prior experience with the stamping plates I think this is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of prints did not make good stamping.&lt;br /&gt;Could have been better I suppose.</li>
            <li> Very nice ..took a long time to come</li>
            <li> The engraving on the nail art plate is not deep enough and does not print well. I&#x27;m not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Stamps well and cute prints. I will use this a lot. Large prints that fit the thumb to&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;) &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Received this item quicker than expected. Works well, the images I have tried so far have stamped without any problems. I would prefer it if they were square and did not have the rounded edge on the bottom as on my longest nails I have some problems getting full coverage. I am happy with this purchase overall.</li>
            <li> Love! Will purchase more</li>
            <li> I purchased this plate along with 2 other Cheeky plates. I really like both of the other plates (Princess Charming and European Romance) but this one is definitely my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 49 different images on this plate, there are only 3 that I don&#x27;t love! The reason I don&#x27;t care for 2 of those 3 is ONLY because they are a bit too big for my nails. I know no one cares, but the one image that I just don&#x27;t like is the one with heart-emblazoned coffee mugs and pretzels (?). I don&#x27;t get it... do people eat pretzels with coffee, or what? I am so confused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested all the images on copy paper using Konad Special Black stamping polish and Essie Penny Talk nail polish. Every image stamped perfectly, even the highly detailed ones transfer clearly. The floral image on the top row (6th across) is especially intricate, but it stamps crisply and is gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the floral images on this plate a lot, but I LOVE the geometric prints! They are legitimately interesting and versatile. Everyone has their own style, but they are a modern twist on nail art designs that can seem to lean too far toward cutesy and frilly for my own taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR- Awesome images, stamps perfectly, great value/quality, and I am still confused about the pretzels w/ coffee mugs.</li>
            <li> Grand daughter thought it was great!</li>
            <li> Due to the curve at the bottom these might not suit those with longer or wider nails. The do fine on me. So far no issues stamping even on intricate designs</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore all the cheeky plates and this one is no exception. A perfect print every time. Yes, they are a bit big, as with all cheeky plates, but better that than too small in my opinion. Love the designs, especially the DNA helix (I&#x27;m science need). Highly recommended to all stampede.</li>
            <li> This plate has a great selection of designs. My favorite is the floral in the top row. I use it on clients constantly.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone. When it came in the mail after a month I was really excited but when I tried it it did not even work at all. I also bought the rubber stamper and it didn&#x27;t pick up any nail polish. I used all different types. It didn&#x27;t work. No happy overall.</li>
            <li> Love stamping with this product.</li>
            <li> The images are attractive and I have no problem picking up the images. My only complaint is that they are too small for my thumbs, but fit all my other fingers fairly well. I would say if you have small to average sized fingers go for it, if you have very large nail beds these images might be too small.&lt;br /&gt;The backing is a thick cardboard so no sharp edges and I keep them in an album with full sheet page protectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> My best plate by far !!</li>
            <li> It can in a timely fashion, but that is the only good thing I can say. It was a piece of steel with slight indentions for the graphics. I have no idea how you were supposed to stamp your nails with these. The indentions were so shallow. I just threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Love this plate! I tried out all of the designs, and unlike other plates, all of the designs stamp beautifully. I would recommend using a square or rectangular stamping tool with these, as the round one I have didn&#x27;t transfer the entire design. Also, it got delivered two weeks earlier than the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> May be great but I had a hard time getting the transfer.</li>
            <li> Oh they are perfect, I love them this are the best plates I have ever used and they are awesome! !</li>
            <li> The product was bent so I could not run my scraper over it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.  Thank you!</li>
