            <li>A great hold.</li>
            <li>Great transaction.  </li>
            <li>Holds without stiffness and smells great.  </li>
            <li>A guy in a restaurant came over to the table and told me I smelled great, this is all I had on.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE hairspray that I can&#x27;t seem to find in any stores besides Great Clips and Ulta!</li>
            <li>This is a good spray, smells great</li>
            <li>Best hair spray I have ever used, not sticky easy to comb out</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Is feels light, smells great, has great hold and best of all for me, does not create static.  </li>
            <li>Good spray.</li>
            <li>happy with the product; has a nice hold and a nice shine to the hair.</li>
            <li>Love all Redken products, but this finishing spray is especially great because it really does hold your hair in place, even on humid days!!!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>This is a great fast-drying, light hairspray.</li>
            <li>I ran out of hairspray (this kind) and ran to the store to get some to get me by.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it so</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair nice and manageable, no sticky feeling, nor any stiffness.</li>
            <li>Works great and dries quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;About two months ago, my stylist used a different spray (that smelled really good) and she told me it was wonderful, terrific, best thing on the market</li>
            <li>but is I like more hold.</li>
            <li>I guess if I sprayed a lot on it would be more force.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t love the smell.  </li>
            <li>love this hairspray-</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS the product for you, i LoVe it :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this redken product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Was using Chi and Kenra products and I enjoy this one the most.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair at all.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;brushes out easily</li>
            <li>I spray in the morning and it hold my fine hair all day.  </li>
            <li>Huge mistake.</li>
            <li>Speedy and accurate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light</li>
            <li>good product for those who need a bit more of extra hold... gives hair lots of shine!..</li>
            <li>I would love to tell you how great this hairspray is however, because of lazy packaging on the part of this seller my wonderful new hairspray came in pieces with no sprayer or lid attached and completely unfixable.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I hope I like Redken&#x27;s color stay shampoo more because I just ordered that for the first time.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>This product gives my hair a VERY light hold, so much so that by the time I walk in the wind from the parking lot into work, it&#x27;s almost all out.  </li>
            <li>If you want a great hair spray that comes out in a powder like form instead of something sticky and wet</li>
            <li>It smells great and really combats humidity and daily activities with ease.</li>
            <li>Let each burst dry then you can return to the area as needed with more, a very light spray that helps you avoid the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Great hairspray, not too heavy and helps keep hair manageable.</li>
            <li>Not only is this spray not sticky, but it does an amazing job of holding your hair together.</li>
            <li>I love the natural look</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So much cheaper on Amazon though!</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars probably has more to do with my hair than the product itself.</li>
            <li>I have been using this finishing spray for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and using this keeps my hair from becoming so limp by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This really does the job on my hair.  </li>
            <li>We really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>It is too fast drying.</li>
            <li>absolutely holds my hair but still lets me run my fingers through it and keeps the hold all day</li>
            <li>For everyday, this works well on its own.</li>
            <li>Gives good texture to loose long hair as well.</li>
            <li>And for thin &amp; fine hair, that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>The bottle boasts a new fragrance</li>
            <li>Smells pretty gross but works well</li>
            <li>Of course if there is an inordinate amount of moisture or my hair somehow gets wet then of course the effectiveness of the product is reduced however under most circumstances, this product has not let me down.</li>
            <li>Does not build up - not overly stiff for my fine long hair and still holds all day.</li>
            <li>Amazon considers this a hazardous material so when the package yours terrible you will not be able to send it back for another, or even get a refund on the hairspray you never got to use.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no build up, it holds, but it leaves my hair soft to the touch!</li>

            <li> Does not go on wet like some drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li> Kind of annoying how these cosmetic companies and hair care companies stick it to us.</li>
            <li> Then I use just a little bit of a stronger holding hairspray.</li>
            <li> So far there hasn&#x27;t been a situation yet where this product failed to hold the desired style.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a base for my hair because it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li> That way I get maxiumum hold without the hair looking stiff or over-sprayed.  </li>
            <li> This spray holds well without being too stiff.</li>
            <li> It holds without being too stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Very few hair sprays actually hold my hair for the duration of the day or at the very least the event I am attending.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible, and more expensive, too.</li>
            <li> Forceful is not a good choice of wording.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and even when I use the hairspray the style falls a bit by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Very slow delivery</li>
            <li> When it ran out, I tried the product I had previously been using and was very unhappy</li>
            <li> but I hate the smell of it.</li>
            <li> so I bought a bottle -- and hated it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful!</li>

            <li> I ran out of hairspray (this kind) and ran to the store to get some to get me by. Huge mistake. It was horrible, and more expensive, too. I donated it to our art class so they could use it to set chalk drawings. This spray has minimal smell, no stickiness, and allows movement without flop.</li>
            <li> Was using Chi and Kenra products and I enjoy this one the most. Does not build up - not overly stiff for my fine long hair and still holds all day.</li>

            <li> My wife will use noting else!</li>
            <li> Works great and dries quickly</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on me quite a while back and I really liked it so a bought a bottle.  When it ran out, I tried the product I had previously been using and was very unhappy so I reverted back to this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two months ago, my stylist used a different spray (that smelled really good) and she told me it was wonderful, terrific, best thing on the market so I bought a bottle -- and hated it.  Reverted back to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light but if I find I need additional hold, I spray once then let it dry and then spray again.  That way I get maxiumum hold without the hair looking stiff or over-sprayed.  I wish it were cheaper since I keep looking at the brands in the superstore where I shop and the prices look wonderful, but I have found out this is one area I want splurge on and get what works.</li>
            <li> Speedy and accurate. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair spray for years. It is wonderful. There is absolutely no build up, it holds, but it leaves my hair soft to the touch!</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE hairspray that I can&#x27;t seem to find in any stores besides Great Clips and Ulta! So much cheaper on Amazon though! When the hairspray dries it doesn&#x27;t even get crunchy and it doesn&#x27;t even look like I have hairspray in! That is great I love the natural look but it still holds!</li>
            <li> Great product; great shipper&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the product; has a nice hold and a nice shine to the hair.</li>

            <li> Great hairspray, not too heavy and helps keep hair manageable. Also comes in travel sizes. I have been using for several years.</li>

            <li> I use this spray exclusively and have been for several years.  Best Spray for eliminating frizz moist weather.  Does not build up!  Hair shines!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  Is feels light, smells great, has great hold and best of all for me, does not create static.  I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty gross but works well</li>
            <li> Holds hair in place for an evening out when you want hold but touchable softness!</li>

            <li> Redken 23 hairspray is the best. I have been using it since my hairdresser recommended it. Leaves hair in place but you an brush it out.</li>
            <li> This spray holds well without being too stiff. I have fine hair and using this keeps my hair from becoming so limp by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This spray is not a firm hold as I expected. You cannot work with your hair after spraying it. It is too fast drying.</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair a VERY light hold, so much so that by the time I walk in the wind from the parking lot into work, it&#x27;s almost all out.

            <li> A great hold. Gives good texture to loose long hair as well.</li>
            <li> love this hairspray- absolutely holds my hair but still lets me run my fingers through it and keeps the hold all day</li>
            <li> Great transaction.  Love this product.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This is a great fast-drying, light hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have been using this finishing spray for several years and love it.  It holds without being too stiff or sticky.</li>

            <li> Been using this hair spray for my hair for years, and I absolutely love it!!!! Leaves your hair nice and manageable, no sticky feeling, nor any stiffness.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray I have ever used, not sticky easy to comb out</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Flexible hold that lasts.  Does not go on wet like some drugstore brands.  Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Holds without stiffness and smells great.  A guy in a restaurant came over to the table and told me I smelled great, this is all I had on.</li>
            <li> good product for those who need a bit more of extra hold... gives hair lots of shine!..&lt;br /&gt;brushes out easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this redken product for years and love it.  i use it as a finishing spray when i&#x27;m done styling my hair and it holds almost all day.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for my hair because it&#x27;s so light. And for thin &amp; fine hair, that&#x27;s important. Then I use just a little bit of a stronger holding hairspray. For everyday, this works well on its own.</li>
