            <li>I just received this manakin head and its really nice.</li>
            <li>It was also alot cheaper than the ones that&#x27;s not as nice at our beauty supply.</li>
            <li>I really liked it but its sheds alot .</li>
            <li>By far the greatest mannequin ever</li>
            <li>Good price cheap and pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly :) arrived super fast</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100 % sure about it</li>
            <li>Love Love Love.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I would for sure recommended this to a friend for beginners.</li>
            <li>Glad it came with the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The online picture is cute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>We love the mannequin.</li>
            <li>Hair is not as course as most mannequin heads</li>
            <li>, I passed :)</li>
            <li>and i &#x27;ve been used heat on it for dry and iron and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, the hair is 100 % natural</li>
            <li>Oil put a light oil or serum to mend ends.</li>
            <li>Overall its great i would give 5 stars</li>
            <li>The texture of the hair feels nice and real.</li>
            <li>I wanted to teach my girls how to comb hair and this would not be realistic to the kind of hair they would be combing.</li>
            <li>Perfect for practicing hair styles.just don&#x27;t leave it on a table in a dark room, it will scare you!!</li>
            <li>A pain to clean up...</li>
            <li>but, I managed to do a full weave.</li>
            <li>This head is a good little head for what I bought it for (my 11 year-old daughter wanted to be able to practice hairstyles including using a curling iron) but the hair is shorter and thinner than advertised.</li>
            <li>Pros: Decent to use &amp; still able to work with.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly but it was not as pictured.  </li>
            <li>It was not a problem for me because I am a quick learner and (not trying to disrespect anyone</li>
            <li>It straightens amazingly and smooths out, however the hair only holds curls for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I got my money worth.</li>
            <li>She had some fun curling in and playing with it but lost interest.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has real hair, so coloring it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>BUT the first 5 times I used a hot tool on the hair it melted some strands!</li>
            <li>Feels very real.  </li>
            <li>but overall she is lovely</li>
            <li>It is white :)</li>
            <li>The hair length wasn&#x27;t exactly as shown in the image...</li>
            <li>After washing and conditioning this head for the first time it tangled.  </li>
            <li>Great product my daughter works on it for hours everyday!!</li>
            <li>but I really hope that it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>She wants to curl her hair and everything</li>
            <li>It has tons of hair just like a real head.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend a deep conditioner every once in awhile to keep the hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Although functional &amp; YES it does serve the main purpose I bought it for, it is lacking in quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so make sure you have a deep enough area to place it in.</li>
            <li>,you can turn the screw like attachment to either open the clamp more to fit the height of whatever edge and then turn it the other way to secure it tightly on the edge.</li>
            <li>The long strands super were thinned out.</li>
            <li>it was about the same size,  I suggest washing and conditioning first before using it.</li>
            <li>If I see that it stands up to her 13 yr old ideas</li>
            <li>so remember to co wash (wash with conditioner) frequently.</li>
            <li>Ordered my 12 year old daughter this for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>I tried flat ironing it and didn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li>Would get a 5 but hair is thin and falls out very easy.</li>
            <li>I returned it the next day because I wanted a brown complexion and more natural, thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li>Even my clients with thin hair have more.</li>
            <li>Was a Christmas pressent for our 10 year old daughter,  Is half the price of the toy versions, and this is real hear</li>
            <li>Just not this particular head due to</li>
            <li>The last 3 inches of hair is very sparse so ordering a long hair mannequin is relative to what you consider long.</li>

            <li> The last 3 inches of hair is very sparse so ordering a long hair mannequin is relative to what you consider long.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really  long enough to create intricate upstyles for  display.  </li>
            <li> A reviewer mentioned that the clamp is difficult to hold onto things and that is not fully true!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the ends are really dry</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me as much as it was not a massive amount, but if you are thinking to use this dall head on state board exam, you should run a straightener through it at least 10 times.</li>
            <li> but the length is super straggly and the hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected from a human hair mannequin.</li>
            <li> I have used other mannequins and this is simply unacceptable.</li>
            <li> &quot; it is 18 she is smaller than an average manikin head  </li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a black doll and the doll that I received was white....</li>
            <li> From forehead to back it is a little over 24\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not very pretty.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The hair was silkier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to however, because you have to keep in mind that it&#x27;s not a human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I combed through it and it did shed but only a very little.</li>
            <li> but once I compared it to my other mannequin heads</li>
            <li> and there is very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> Common sense would tell you that it needs enough edge wherever you want to put it for it to stay and other than that</li>
            <li> The hair is thick towards the scalp but definitely thins out towards the ends</li>
            <li> The bottom is also very thin and gets very frizzy.</li>
            <li> Bought this to practise a new cut on, but this is an unrealistic amount of hair.</li>
            <li> She does shed a little.</li>
            <li> : Had dead lice in it?</li>
            <li> Hair was thinner than picture and the clamp was smaller as well not happy at all</li>
            <li> &quot; in the back from directly behind the ear.</li>
            <li> Very little hair here.</li>
            <li> She is not cute.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I thought it lot k too small</li>
            <li> In my opinion it was a silky, medium thick, tan mannequin head with @</li>
            <li> Her hair is thick it feels and curls up in water like Indian hair.</li>
            <li> No  good  </li>
            <li> Passed my barber  boatd test this this dumb dummy.</li>
            <li> The product was poorly constructed and even had manufacture defects which in my opinion should never have passed &#x27;quality&#x27; inspection.</li>
            <li> It is so small &amp; it sheds so bad when I comb it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The stand is a bit difficult to hold onto a counter</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very thin hair.</li>
            <li> I am outraged to think that this product was sent to me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> For the price, I must say this is a great deal. I have been using it to practice my updo&#x27;s and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very nice doll head to practice with.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I wasn&#x27;t 100 % sure about it but we will see. The hair feels like it might have plastic in it but I really hope that it doesn&#x27;t. She wants to curl her hair and everything so we will see. If I see that it stands up to her 13 yr old ideas then I will defiantly give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a black doll and the doll that I received was white.... And looked nothing like the picture...</li>
            <li> Her hair Hair is not 24\\&quot; it is 18 she is smaller than an average manikin head  she is not African American like she looks in the picture she is caucasian and she does shed but overall she is lovely</li>
            <li> Passed my barber  boatd test this this dumb dummy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE my Mannequin head!! Love Love Love. She does shed a little.</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas pressent for our 10 year old daughter,  Is half the price of the toy versions, and this is real hear</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture. Good to practice hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Got this to help practice some hair styles before going into cosmetology school. Works perfectly :) arrived super fast and I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet! For the price I paid, I would for sure recommended this to a friend for beginners.</li>
            <li> Pros: Decent to use &amp; still able to work with. Glad it came with the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Had dead lice in it? Hairs look longer in the picture. The long strands super were thinned out.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly but it was not as pictured.  The Pictured mannequin does not have a name but the mannequin I received had the name Lindsay engraved and it is Caucasian. I wanted an African American mannequin like the &amp;#34; Daisy &amp;#34; head. I requested a replacement, expecting something color toned closer to Daisy, and got a second Lindsey so I&#x27;m returning the product for refund</li>
            <li> Does not want to keep a curl</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I got my money worth. It is so small &amp; it sheds so bad when I comb it. She is not cute. The online picture is cute.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  Very nice.  My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Hair was thinner than picture and the clamp was smaller as well not happy at all</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 10th birthday as she always loves to play with hair.  It&#x27;s ok but the length is super straggly and the hair is thin.  She had some fun curling in and playing with it but lost interest.  It&#x27;s just not very pretty.  I&#x27;m dying to give it a hair cut to make the hair nicer.  It is NOTHING like the photo in length and evenness.</li>
            <li> No instructions on how to assemble clamp took several people to figure it out.  Hair quality is good. Once clamp assembled was great</li>
            <li> No  good  .my doll  hair is falling out.</li>
            <li> great head!! no complaints the price was great for the quality of the head. the stand not so great its seem very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Good price cheap and pretty good quality. The mannequin is real human hair . I like it. It is good for student.</li>
            <li> great for practicing styles</li>
            <li> This mannequin training head is perfect for the braiding techniques I wanted to practice.  The hair on the mannequin is of very nice quality.</li>
            <li> Would get a 5 but hair is thin and falls out very easy.</li>
            <li> I just received this manakin head and its really nice. I&#x27;m a, hairdresser and its nicer than the one i got in my kit during training.  It has tons of hair just like a real head. The hair is very nice. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It was also alot cheaper than the ones that&#x27;s not as nice at our beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She loves doing hair. We love the mannequin. It sheds quite a bit so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Great product my daughter works on it for hours everyday!!</li>
            <li> Very little hair here. Bought this to practise a new cut on, but this is an unrealistic amount of hair. Even my clients with thin hair have more. Good for practicing braids, I suppose.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has real hair, so coloring it was pretty easy. I really don&#x27;t like that when it&#x27;s wet and you comb it out, it sheds a lot of hair. The bottom is also very thin and gets very frizzy. I tried flat ironing it and didn&#x27;t really make a difference. I will still buy from this seller because I like these mannequin heads. Just not this particular head due to it&#x27;s very thin hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meeting all my training needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loved it</li>
            <li> Christmas present for daughter I will see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t lie! I am excited!!! I just picked it up. It got here about a week after I ordered. So that is a plus! However,an invoice was not included with the mannequin nor was there any directions on how to assemble the clamp and how to use. It was not a problem for me because I am a quick learner and (not trying to disrespect anyone but)everyone is not. A reviewer mentioned that the clamp is difficult to hold onto things and that is not fully true! Common sense would tell you that it needs enough edge wherever you want to put it for it to stay and other than that,you can turn the screw like attachment to either open the clamp more to fit the height of whatever edge and then turn it the other way to secure it tightly on the edge. From forehead to back it is a little over 24\\&quot; But if you want to be literal, it is 16\\&quot; on both sides from the ear and 16\\&quot; in the back from directly behind the ear. Lets see how this goes!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll review again when I use it!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t like the picture at all but she&#x27;ll work. Great price though.can&#x27;t wait to practice.</li>
            <li> In looking for mannequins for practice  work in the salon, I didn&#x27;t want to spend  alot of money knowing these were  for  training  purposes. The last 3 inches of hair is very sparse so ordering a long hair mannequin is relative to what you consider long. This isn&#x27;t really  long enough to create intricate upstyles for  display.  Although functional &amp; YES it does serve the main purpose I bought it for, it is lacking in quality.&lt;br /&gt;*Not that it affects the ability to work on the mannequin... but this doll looks way \\&quot;prettier\\&quot; on screen than in person. Needless to say, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The hair was silkier than I expected.  It appears to be brown complexion in the picture but it is not; It is white :)&lt;br /&gt;The length of the hair is about 24&amp;#34; it came with a name of Lindsey on it even though it doesn&#x27;t state it anywhere in the description.  The clamp was sufficient.  I returned it the next day because I wanted a brown complexion and more natural, thick head of hair.  The hair also only flows in one direction so if you wanted to cut a bang it would not stay.  In my opinion it was a silky, medium thick, tan mannequin head with @ 24&amp;#34; hair that only flowed to the back.  I did not try any products on it nor did I curl, wash, or brush the hair.  One touch &amp; I knew I couldn&#x27;t use it. I am not a beautician.  I wanted to teach my girls how to comb hair and this would not be realistic to the kind of hair they would be combing.</li>
            <li> The hair length wasn&#x27;t exactly as shown in the image...&lt;br /&gt;It looks longer in this image then it actually is...</li>
            <li> This head is a good little head for what I bought it for (my 11 year-old daughter wanted to be able to practice hairstyles including using a curling iron) but the hair is shorter and thinner than advertised.</li>
            <li> Just the length i needed, This is a beautiful mannequin head. Hair is not as course as most mannequin heads</li>
            <li> Her hair is thick it feels and curls up in water like Indian hair. It&#x27;s long and meets my expectations. It straightens and especially curls well. I recommend it to cosmetology students. The only thing is that the ends are really dry so remember to co wash (wash with conditioner) frequently. Oil put a light oil or serum to mend ends. By far the greatest mannequin ever</li>
            <li> Perfect for practicing hair styles.just don&#x27;t leave it on a table in a dark room, it will scare you!!</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning this head for the first time it tangled.  Not at all what I expected from a human hair mannequin.</li>
            <li> The product was poorly constructed and even had manufacture defects which in my opinion should never have passed &#x27;quality&#x27; inspection. I am outraged to think that this product was sent to me. It will never last the duration of time that it is needed for. I have used other mannequins and this is simply unacceptable. I regret this purchase.....especially at that price.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for the price. The stand is a bit difficult to hold onto a counter so make sure you have a deep enough area to place it in. The hair is thick towards the scalp but definitely thins out towards the ends so I&#x27;d say only 50% of the hair is actually 24&#x27;&#x27;. I dyed some of the hair and it took well. It straightens amazingly and smooths out, however the hair only holds curls for about 4 hours. I would also recommend a deep conditioner every once in awhile to keep the hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I just picked up the mannequin and its is wonderful. I really liked it but its sheds alot . When i began to braid it i found lice in her head but if your willing to remove them then its the perfect mannquin for you. Overall its great i would give 5 stars but i didnt like the lice ðŸ˜·</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, the hair is 100 % natural and i &#x27;ve been used heat on it for dry and iron and it works perfectly. I just dislike the eyes shape but everything also is great!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this mannequin, the hair is really nice and there is very minimal shedding. It arrived faster than I thought, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I thought it lot k too small but once I compared it to my other mannequin heads it was about the same size,  I suggest washing and conditioning first before using it. Very happy :-)</li>
            <li> Her hair sheds a lot: but, I managed to do a full weave. It came out well.</li>
            <li> It is a great length to practice on updos and haircuts. BUT the first 5 times I used a hot tool on the hair it melted some strands! It didn&#x27;t bother me as much as it was not a massive amount, but if you are thinking to use this dall head on state board exam, you should run a straightener through it at least 10 times. I used it on my board exam and it worked out well, I passed :)</li>
            <li> Ordered my 12 year old daughter this for her birthday.  She LOVES it!  Feels very real.  Even her face.  Braids &amp; styles her hair.  I use to be her mannequin lol thankful for this one! ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to play with this, which is what I bought it for, but the hair sheds all over. A pain to clean up...</li>
            <li> Love this! I bought this for my younger sister as a Christmas present and I want one for myself!!! The texture of the hair feels nice and real. I combed through it and it did shed but only a very little. I expected it to however, because you have to keep in mind that it&#x27;s not a human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came just as described with the clamp and all. It also wasn&#x27;t too costly. To anyone who loves to do hair I&#x27;d recommend this to them. I&#x27;M GETTING ME ONE!!!</li>
