            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this!</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for!</li>
            <li>This stuff absorbs very quickly, leaves no greasy after-affects, and has a great scent (coconut, like a tropical bronzing oil).  </li>
            <li>The product itself goes on with ease and has a nice tropical smell.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily compared to some others I&#x27;ve read about or tried...</li>
            <li>I was able to rub it in very easily.  </li>
            <li>and Jason Sunscreen is a wonderful deterrent to future outbreaks....</li>
            <li>We love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I should have looked more closely at the ingredients.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Great for my sons sensitive eczema skin.  </li>
            <li>Goes on so easy.</li>
            <li>Jason Sun goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and chemical-free.</li>
            <li>Tried this sunscreen for the first time and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>My kids don&#x27;t mind it because it goes on easy and has a light tropical smell</li>
            <li>It did not make my face break out, which is rare with most sunscreens, even those specifically made for the face.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t stain and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t stain anything.  </li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li>We tested several products for our young kids and found this product works the best.</li>
            <li>I liked that this product is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful chemicals that the others do.  </li>
            <li>If sitting and sweating in the sun all day of course you need to reapply but that is true with any product.</li>
            <li>mild on the face-works well</li>
            <li>(powder is used over it on hot days) which is what I was looking for in a sunscreen, in addition to providing good UVA&amp;B protection without a surfeit of substances known to produce harmful effects on the human body.</li>
            <li>The lotion is smooth and quick absorbing.  </li>
            <li>I was buying a safe product to use on my 4 and 1 year old children.</li>
            <li>and this is by far my fave, and also my kids&#x27; favorite.</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t strongly noticeable, and I didn&#x27;t think much about it, until receiving a positive &amp;#34;wow</li>
            <li>first, then moved on to the Jason.  </li>
            <li>This is also very good consistency to apply, especially having kids and hoping they sit still enough let us slather on a &amp;#34;paste.&amp;#34; My kids have refused so many others, begging and crying.</li>
            <li>While Jason&#x27;s isn&#x27;t completely chemical-free, I&#x27;m satisfied with the coverage, scent and the natural mineral ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am also sensitive to smells and the scent is mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Remember</li>
            <li>Works very well as per SPF 45 spec.</li>
            <li>Be careful around the eyes, it can sting/irritate like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>We can easily apply the cream to the face of our impatient and very fidgety kids, and the cream is quickly rubbed in.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I both have sensitive skin and this product is so gentle we both can use it on our faces with no irritation or burning.</li>
            <li>In my search for a more natural sunscreen (physical block) with both high UVA/UVB protection, I found the Jason product at my local natural grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Enough protection that we do not get burned but do get a nice little color.</li>
            <li>(It was brand new.)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even when I go out without it, and start to get red, I find that applying this sunscreen stops any further progression of the burning immediately and I&#x27;m able to continue my work outside.  </li>
            <li>but il take it for being less skin friendly than others.  </li>
            <li>great coverage, a little thick</li>
            <li>Does not bother my children&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>We used this all summer so far and not a single sunburn has been encountered by our 4 year old!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it works well so far and is rated highly in terms of low toxicity contents.</li>
            <li>we have tried several natural brands and did not like them at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a bubble shape that adheres on the end of the tube (or as a smooth beaded line when directly applied on the body), and it&#x27;s not goopy, runny, oily, or too thick - and certainly not gritty.  </li>
            <li>With other products, I had issues with lotion being too thick or smeary (easily getting too close to my fidgety kids eyes and in the hair).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> no excessive or hard rubbing to get rid of the white traces.  </li>
            <li> Some other products also did not adsorb as quickly or they left an unpleasant feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as any other 45 spf sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few times too just on my face and no sunburn here either</li>
            <li> However, I will be looking for something less toxic to put on my babies!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product was rotten</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly,  doesn&#x27;t make you feel sticky, hold up well in the water, and did what it was supposed to - protected me from a nasty burn, but let me get a little tan.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; sunscreen that isn&#x27;t thicker than burnt oatmeal and usually smelling worse.</li>
            <li> Thought this was a natural product. :(  </li>
            <li> The product also has a subtle non-coconut fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen turned into a thin, cottage cheese-like substance the moment I rubbed it on my daughter&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> Was sorry to see some ingredients that aren&#x27;t \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but are listed as chemical sunscreens that should be avoided.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great and our son, with many allergies, can tolerate it. Goes on so easy. Every mom who borrows our tube ends up buying it too.</li>
            <li> Was sorry to see some ingredients that aren&#x27;t \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but are listed as chemical sunscreens that should be avoided.  Thought this was a natural product. :(  The smell is great and it goes on well, but homosalate is something I was trying to avoid.  The label indicates that it is a mineral sunblock when in fact it has chemical blocks in it also. Bummed.</li>
            <li> Tried this sunscreen for the first time and I really liked it. It did not make my face break out, which is rare with most sunscreens, even those specifically made for the face. It goes on smoothly,  doesn&#x27;t make you feel sticky, hold up well in the water, and did what it was supposed to - protected me from a nasty burn, but let me get a little tan. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> we have tried several natural brands and did not like them at all.&lt;br /&gt;this one is perfect though.&lt;br /&gt;it goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t stain and isn&#x27;t greasy.  smells good too.</li>
            <li> In my search for a more natural sunscreen (physical block) with both high UVA/UVB protection, I found the Jason product at my local natural grocery store.  I started with the Badger (yuck, greasy for HOURS!) first, then moved on to the Jason.  This stuff absorbs very quickly, leaves no greasy after-affects, and has a great scent (coconut, like a tropical bronzing oil).  I&#x27;ve switched my entire family to this.  It goes on very easily compared to some others I&#x27;ve read about or tried...no excessive or hard rubbing to get rid of the white traces.  Even when my 6YO decided to sunscreen himself (gobs on his face and cheeks...) I was able to rub it in very easily.  My son and I are redheads, my husband is of nordic descent.  We are all WHITE.  And we&#x27;ve had no issues with burning since trying this.  Even when I go out without it, and start to get red, I find that applying this sunscreen stops any further progression of the burning immediately and I&#x27;m able to continue my work outside.  I will be buying more soon...highly recommend!</li>
            <li> mild on the face-works well</li>
            <li> Jason Sun goes on easily.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t stain anything.  Has a mild scent which is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I liked that this product is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful chemicals that the others do.  Seemed to provide good sun protection and smells good!</li>
            <li> great sunblock, not greasy, plus none of the chemical or yucky smelling stuff either... worked great for my family on vacation</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Goes on so smooth, not greasy. Great smell. Best part its all natural and GOOD for you!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not irritate my skin in any way. Also, it can be placed on my eyelids without running  (powder is used over it on hot days) which is what I was looking for in a sunscreen, in addition to providing good UVA&amp;B protection without a surfeit of substances known to produce harmful effects on the human body.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as any other 45 spf sunscreen.  It is not quite as waterproof as some of the best but il take it for being less skin friendly than others.  Also, I like the smell. Wish they would sell it in bigger quantities.</li>
            <li> Seems to stay on in the water and works well.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but I can only use it onmy kid&#x27;s legs as he dislikes teh scent.  Nonetheless, it works well so far and is rated highly in terms of low toxicity contents.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever for kids !!  LOVE it !!</li>
            <li> I love this sun screen for my son! I love all JASON products!!!</li>
            <li> To drippy, gets into their eyes.</li>
            <li> BEST Sunscreen ever!  My kids don&#x27;t mind it because it goes on easy and has a light tropical smell</li>
            <li> Smells good, goes on nicely, kids like it.  I&#x27;m sold</li>
            <li> So far so good! I use this on my very active child and have had no sunburns at all this summer so far. You have to read the directions to know it has to be applied every two hours.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Covers well and does not leave my children with qhite streaks like some of the others do.  Does not bother my children&#x27;s sensitive skin.  Provides a great amount of protection.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; sunscreen that isn&#x27;t thicker than burnt oatmeal and usually smelling worse. Or one that isn&#x27;t more expensive per ounce than caviar. While Jason&#x27;s isn&#x27;t completely chemical-free, I&#x27;m satisfied with the coverage, scent and the natural mineral ingredients. This is also very good consistency to apply, especially having kids and hoping they sit still enough let us slather on a &amp;#34;paste.&amp;#34; My kids have refused so many others, begging and crying. I save myself the headache and go with this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Works very well as per SPF 45 spec.</li>
            <li> Love this product! And it is paraben-free!!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I both have sensitive skin and this product is so gentle we both can use it on our faces with no irritation or burning. If sitting and sweating in the sun all day of course you need to reapply but that is true with any product. They used to have a water sports product which I can no longer find. If in the water or sweating just remember to reapply. Enough protection that we do not get burned but do get a nice little color. I am also sensitive to smells and the scent is mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Remember the backs of your hands so you do not get age spots!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen turned into a thin, cottage cheese-like substance the moment I rubbed it on my daughter&#x27;s body. I&#x27;m not sure if the product was rotten (It was brand new.) or not, but I rinsed it off, didn&#x27;t use it again, and will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this! We used this all summer so far and not a single sunburn has been encountered by our 4 year old! You do have to keep reapplying every couple hours. Be careful around the eyes, it can sting/irritate like most sunscreens. I used it a few times too just on my face and no sunburn here either but it did sting my eyes when i got sweaty!</li>
            <li> We tested several products for our young kids and found this product works the best. The lotion is smooth and quick absorbing.  It takes a bubble shape that adheres on the end of the tube (or as a smooth beaded line when directly applied on the body), and it&#x27;s not goopy, runny, oily, or too thick - and certainly not gritty.  We can easily apply the cream to the face of our impatient and very fidgety kids, and the cream is quickly rubbed in. With other products, I had issues with lotion being too thick or smeary (easily getting too close to my fidgety kids eyes and in the hair).  Some other products also did not adsorb as quickly or they left an unpleasant feeling on the skin. The product also has a subtle non-coconut fragrance.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t strongly noticeable, and I didn&#x27;t think much about it, until receiving a positive &amp;#34;wow what is that&amp;#34; comments from others.</li>
            <li> Great for my sons sensitive eczema skin.  It&#x27;s the only one that didn&#x27;t give him bumps all over.</li>
            <li> Skin cancer is part of my life....and Jason Sunscreen is a wonderful deterrent to future outbreaks....great coverage, a little thick but EWG backed, it&#x27;s awesome!! Third season utilizing this product, I&#x27;m hooked!!!</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out in a rash. We use it on our toddler too. It&#x27;s not greasy and provides great protection when applied as directed. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking I was buying a safe product to use on my 4 and 1 year old children. I should have looked more closely at the ingredients. This sunscreen contains 10.0% Homosalate and 10.0% Octocrylene which can get into your bloodstream and can cause all sorts of unwanted toxic side effects, including hormone disruption. The product itself goes on with ease and has a nice tropical smell. However, I will be looking for something less toxic to put on my babies!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every sunscreen on the market and this is by far my fave, and also my kids&#x27; favorite. Easy to apply and chemical-free. What more can you ask for!</li>
