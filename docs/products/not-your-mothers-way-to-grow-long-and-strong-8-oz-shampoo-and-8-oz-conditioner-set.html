            <li>Works best with d&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; by doo.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>It smells very great and works well</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair feel after I shampooed it and the conditioner wasn&#x27;t the best detangler that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Smells great but ended up with a fur ball</li>
            <li>Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>And smells good, too.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do anything good for my hair</li>
            <li>It has a great apple smell and its sulfate free but still lathers very nicely.</li>
            <li>But this is amazing and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that I&#x27;ve noticed my hair growing faster</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, shiny, manageable, and best of all, healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product and will keep using it;)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and my hair has been already healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is shinier, healthier, and stays clean longer!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the NYM beach babe since it has coconut oil which can control frizz and make your hair strong and feel light.</li>
            <li>Smells great and my hair does actually feel like its growing faster.</li>
            <li>The only plus about this shampoo is that it smells good.</li>
            <li>It quickly lavishes on my head.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, its my second time buy it and really work , my hair is straight and fine and not grow so fast, but when I use this shampoo and conditioner in one month grow maybe 3 or 4 inches, and smell fabulous!....</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair dry but very lovely product.</li>
            <li>but it has definitely grown and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>It was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li>This completely dries out your hair and makes your hair super frizzy.</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t I thought it would be, in that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t help to grow your hair, it claims to help the hair you already have become stronger.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo, i was a little iffy trying it cause my hair gets so frizzy and some shampoos dont work well with my hair.</li>
            <li>its ok shampoo, but leaves my hair feeling stripped and dry, I have really thin hair, might work better on thicker hair</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes your hair feel soft afterward too.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t do anything for me except make my hair extra dry.</li>

            <li> This product seriously dries out your hair. Terrible product, I threw it away after one use, made my hair feel like hay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a month and I have frizzy collarbone lengthed hair and my hair did not grow at all and my hair has been already healthy. I would recommend the NYM beach babe since it has coconut oil which can control frizz and make your hair strong and feel light. if you have dyed hair, just do not use the sea salt beach waves sprary.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and it didn&#x27;t like this product. Smells great but ended up with a fur ball</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. Leaves my hair dry but very lovely product. It smells very great and works well</li>

            <li> This stuff made my hair grow like crazy! Would recommend for ball hair types, I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work for menbecaus i have African american hair but it still worked</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t I thought it would be, in that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t help to grow your hair, it claims to help the hair you already have become stronger. I didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair feel after I shampooed it and the conditioner wasn&#x27;t the best detangler that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Will not finish it.</li>

            <li> It was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li> The only reason it gets one star is because I can&#x27;t give it less. I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but you all should know what it did anyways. It dried out my hair, gave me INTENSE split ends, and inhibited hair growth. It did that to my friends who said I was just over reacting too. This stuff is HORRIBLE.</li>
