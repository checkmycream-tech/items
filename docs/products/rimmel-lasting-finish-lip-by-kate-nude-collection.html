            <li>to be honest my mom couldn&#x27;t tell diff between this color and a bobbi brown brand &amp;#34;heather&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>Does need to be applied kind of often though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a MAC NC25 this summer and it plays off the tan nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>This is a PERFECT match for my natural lip color.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever experienced this in a lipstick.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly and creamy.</li>

            <li>I love the color and look</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t wash me out...</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite  lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>just love that......</li>
            <li>It has more of a matte look, and it moisturizes your lips as well.</li>
            <li>,so pleased from them.</li>
            <li>what can i ask more??</li>
            <li>color which is like 3 times more in cost</li>
            <li>You notice this one more.</li>
            <li>and this is more matte.</li>
            <li>I suspect this color may be more flattering on women with darker hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my lips feeling smooth, and not overpowering with the color!</li>
            <li>For me the most important thing about lipcolor is that it&#x27;s even and feels nice on my lips without being too moist or sticky but also not drying.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re seeking more of a raisin shade I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The color is so lovely, beig darker skin toned</li>
            <li>great lipstick, definitely want to get more of this brand!</li>
            <li>but now that I am into them I got his since I saw great reviews of it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great everyday shade...</li>
            <li>It,s new but the color is very nice.</li>
            <li>Great natural color.</li>
            <li>The colour is lovely and light.</li>
            <li>Why does one need a strong scented lipstick?  </li>
            <li>The texture and the rich silky color make this my one true favorite lipstick .</li>
            <li>Perfect everyday shade for me.</li>
            <li>smooth n creamy .....</li>
            <li>The lipstick goes on smoothly and for the price</li>
            <li>i always reach for them,they all glide so smooth</li>
            <li>but creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand, and the line of lipsticks feel great and last a bit longer than normal lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Rimmel lipsticks in general are excellent and this one is no different.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and seems to last just fine.</li>
            <li>It enhances natural lip color with hint of pink, perfect for office, school, or layer it over for night out.</li>
            <li>very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>Still pretty!</li>
            <li>Stays on great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my already almost chapped lips like a stain would, or even like most long wear lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Very nice with pale skin.</li>
            <li>It applies really nicely and didn&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li>it can be hard picking out pinks but his one is great.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, but too pink for me.</li>
            <li>Looks great as long as I don&#x27;t wear red clothes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty neutral color</li>
            <li>However if you are ordering this for the first time I would like to add that it&#x27;s not quite what one would expect, in my opinion, from the color shown here.  </li>
            <li>good for everyday day use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, but originally thought I may buy a second one and checked reviews and pricing (loyal Amazon customer).  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a modern matte tube with a cute lip print graphic and Kate Moss signature.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the color displayed (on my monitor) doesn&#x27;t look anything like the color I received, but fortunately for me, I love this shade so much better</li>
            <li>I was also surprised at how moisturizing it was and how quickly it shipped.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering a nice mauve color, and what I got was a very dark purple.</li>
            <li>, the scent is very... lipstick.</li>
            <li>I recently received this lipstick free from Influenster for testing.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and it has a vanilla like scent to it.</li>
            <li>also i think there&#x27;s too much fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>Color was more like an aged plum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only guessing, but it might be too light for skin darker than 25.</li>
            <li>Not quite the way it is pictured in real life.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this lipstick holds.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I also really like this packaging</li>
            <li>08 is a much lighter and pinker shade than it appears to be.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be more sheer and natural</li>
            <li>Color not exact to my hopes but ok.</li>
            <li>other than that, i think it is ok</li>
            <li>Is the exact color of my natural lips, I would have preferred a shade with a lighter/orange undertone.</li>
            <li>Love the lip stick, was expecting a different color entirely</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vibrant but not clownish.  </li>
            <li>However I won&#x27;t buy again due to the strong scent.  </li>
            <li>really love this color, very natural looking, its very similar to a my lip color just a bit more dark and pink.</li>
            <li>The color is rich and not too pink.</li>
            <li>but it is very natural looking</li>
            <li>My lips tend to get pale easy</li>
            <li>The same real smell of rimmel lipestic.</li>
            <li>needs to be reapplied frequently.</li>
            <li>Lighter than my natural lip color, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting (I got 008).</li>
            <li>The color is a really pretty pink, not to light, not to dark.</li>
            <li>well it is for my mom, and it looked natural on her lips.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s plenty of pigment and it will cover pigmented lips completely, so it makes my lips look even.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped by Amazon very fast, faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>This is a wearable pink, with a blue undertone, more pink than mauve.</li>
            <li>This is not a dry formula feeling lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly lighter than I had hoped so it doesn&#x27;t help too much</li>
            <li>I have heard others say it was not long lasting, but that was not the case for me.</li>

            <li> Love the lip stick, was expecting a different color entirely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vibrant but not clownish.  </li>
            <li> However I won&#x27;t buy again due to the strong scent.  </li>
            <li> really love this color, very natural looking, its very similar to a my lip color just a bit more dark and pink.</li>
            <li> The color is rich and not too pink.</li>
            <li> but it is very natural looking</li>
            <li> My lips tend to get pale easy</li>
            <li> The same real smell of rimmel lipestic.</li>
            <li> needs to be reapplied frequently.</li>
            <li> Lighter than my natural lip color, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting (I got 008).</li>
            <li> The color is a really pretty pink, not to light, not to dark.</li>
            <li> well it is for my mom, and it looked natural on her lips.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of pigment and it will cover pigmented lips completely, so it makes my lips look even.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped by Amazon very fast, faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a wearable pink, with a blue undertone, more pink than mauve.</li>
            <li> This is not a dry formula feeling lipstick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly lighter than I had hoped so it doesn&#x27;t help too much</li>
            <li> I have heard others say it was not long lasting, but that was not the case for me.</li>
            <li> Not a long lasting or a long wear lipstick by any means</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last exceptionally long</li>
            <li> The texture is creamy but tends to dry out my lips by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> Stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed but it is good overall.</li>
            <li> The other colors may be mixed up to, so I suggest buying from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> a very long time</li>
            <li> It was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a nude pink.</li>
            <li> Little lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Umm I felt a little nervous putting it on my lips since it was unwrapped..</li>
            <li> I had color on my lips for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have used Rimmel in the past but this was drying</li>
            <li> Hard to find this shade in stores</li>
            <li> and I basically don&#x27;t have anything negative to say.</li>
            <li> Instead of a nude/dusty pink hue I got 2 tubes of very dark purple lipstick :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointment because they have the pictures backwards on the Rosetto and the Blue Dragon!</li>
            <li> unfortunately, in a color that looks awful on me, so that wasn&#x27;t much of a plus!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s artificial and hard to describe,  but</li>
            <li> Never getting tired of this shade!</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t match the description at all unfortunately.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this color. Very nice with pale skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. The same real smell of rimmel lipestic. Great natural color.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. The color is great, it matches the picture in the description. I was also surprised at how moisturizing it was and how quickly it shipped.</li>
            <li> Love it, must have for all kinds of lips. It enhances natural lip color with hint of pink, perfect for office, school, or layer it over for night out. Love it.</li>
            <li> It was just as I expected. Feels smooth and great color.</li>
            <li> very nice colour. lipstick is also non-drying and creamy! great purchase</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly and creamy. This is not a dry formula feeling lipstick.  I love it !</li>
            <li> I love the color I got. It goes on so smooth and looks amazing. My issue is it only lasts about an hour before I need to reapply.</li>
            <li> needs to be reapplied frequently.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lipstick that was near natural looking for everyday use. My lips tend to get pale easy so I thought this would suit me. It&#x27;s slightly lighter than I had hoped so it doesn&#x27;t help too much but it is very natural looking so it&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li> Great Color! Glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and gorgeous.  It was shipped by Amazon very fast, faster than I expected. The color was as I had hoped it would be. The texture and the rich silky color make this my one true favorite lipstick . I would recommend this lipstick, it&#x27;s everything I wanted in a lipstick.</li>
            <li> Little lighter than I expected. But still it&#x27;s a beautiful shade.</li>
            <li> I have used Rimmel in the past but this was drying and I did not care for the matte finish.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, but too pink for me. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Love the lip stick, was expecting a different color entirely but this color is will do. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Never getting tired of this shade!</li>
            <li> Its ok but it goes on a litle blotchy. And i gotta re apply alot</li>
            <li> This is a PERFECT match for my natural lip color. It&#x27;s so beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Last a very long time</li>
            <li> Nice rosy/cool tone. Doesn&#x27;t last exceptionally long but the texture is nice and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Matte-ish. Lighter than my natural lip color, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting (I got 008). Looks great as long as I don&#x27;t wear red clothes. (I am brunette)</li>
            <li> 008 Is the exact color of my natural lips, I would have preferred a shade with a lighter/orange undertone. The lipstick is a great quality and I would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Smells and looks amazing! I love the color and look</li>
            <li> really love this color, very natural looking, its very similar to a my lip color just a bit more dark and pink. The texture is good and it smells good, and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li> I never was into nude lipsticks but now that I am into them I got his since I saw great reviews of it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great everyday shade... I love that it doesn&#x27;t wash me out... nudes tend to do that to fair people.</li>
            <li> Color not exact to my hopes but ok. Good texture.</li>
            <li> Perfect mauvey nude for me, MLBB. Beautiful creamy finish, the scent is very... lipstick. Perfect everyday shade for me.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite  lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth n creamy .....just love that......</li>
            <li> I recently received this lipstick free from Influenster for testing. I liked it. It has more of a matte look, and it moisturizes your lips as well. I have heard others say it was not long lasting, but that was not the case for me. I had color on my lips for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, but originally thought I may buy a second one and checked reviews and pricing (loyal Amazon customer).  The color no. 08 is a nice rouge, very pretty color.  Though it&#x27;s somehow listed incorrectly here as Blue Dragon, it&#x27;s actually Rosetto/Roughe a Levres.  The lipstick goes on smoothly and for the price it&#x27;s nice and seems to last just fine. However I won&#x27;t buy again due to the strong scent.  Why does one need a strong scented lipstick?  It&#x27;s artificial and hard to describe,  but distracting every time I apply it. First time I&#x27;ve ever experienced this in a lipstick.</li>
            <li> It came not wrapped in anything. Umm I felt a little nervous putting it on my lips since it was unwrapped.. The color on the model looks nothing like the color it makes in person.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color displayed (on my monitor) doesn&#x27;t look anything like the color I received, but fortunately for me, I love this shade so much better then what I was expecting! The color is a really pretty pink, not to light, not to dark. Lipstick is creamy. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this shade in stores so I risked it and ordered it. It&#x27;s risky to buy personal care products on Amazon since often you don&#x27;t get what you pay for but this one is legit. I love this brand, and the line of lipsticks feel great and last a bit longer than normal lipsticks. And I love this shade!</li>
            <li> I think the color range is amazing i always reach for them,they all glide so smooth, i only apply one coat and im done,so pleased from them.They are my favorite lipsticks great price,great quality what can i ask more??</li>
            <li> Nice color.  Like a Pantone marsala that&#x27;s the hit color of the season.</li>
            <li> the color is great; nude (lip color). good for everyday day use. to be honest my mom couldn&#x27;t tell diff between this color and a bobbi brown brand &amp;#34;heather&amp;#34; color which is like 3 times more in cost</li>
            <li> When I bought this item, I thought it will match the colour in the image but it didn&#x27;t. The colour is lovely and light. I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed but it is good overall.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and it has a vanilla like scent to it. Not bothersome, I actually like it. It is the same color as one of my NYX butter lipsticks but I don&#x27;t mind at all having two. It&#x27;s beautiful. Kind of &amp;#34;your lip color but better&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> great lipstick, definitely want to get more of this brand! the color matched and it lasts a good amount of time</li>
            <li> it Smell lovely, and the color beautiful as will.</li>
            <li> Very disappointment because they have the pictures backwards on the Rosetto and the Blue Dragon! Buyers beware! I thought I was ordering a nice mauve color, and what I got was a very dark purple. The other colors may be mixed up to, so I suggest buying from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Alot darker than I thought it would be. Still pretty!</li>
            <li> I love the color! Great quality but does need to be reapplied every so often. For the price this is a really good buy.</li>
            <li> Great quality lipstick. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Does need to be applied kind of often though.</li>
            <li> well it is for my mom, and it looked natural on her lips. but she doesn&#x27;t like the color. also i think there&#x27;s too much fragrance in it. other than that, i think it is ok</li>
            <li> The color is rich and not too pink. The texture is creamy but tends to dry out my lips by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> browner than I wanted..but creamy and smooth.  Stays on a long time. I will try another color soon.  Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I saw this color in an ad. I loves the color and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, so I thought I would try and order it. The color does not match the ad at all. I do not like the color it is.... Wish I could have returned it!!</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t as soft as expected.  Color was more like an aged plum.</li>
            <li> This is a wearable pink, with a blue undertone, more pink than mauve. It&#x27;s not a nude pink. You notice this one more. It&#x27;s creamy, semi-matte but needs some balm underneath or it&#x27;s drying. The color pay-off is good. There&#x27;s plenty of pigment and it will cover pigmented lips completely, so it makes my lips look even.  I&#x27;m a MAC NC25 this summer and it plays off the tan nicely. I&#x27;m only guessing, but it might be too light for skin darker than 25.</li>
            <li> Stays on great, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my already almost chapped lips like a stain would, or even like most long wear lipsticks. I may buy one in every shade!</li>
            <li> Nice color. Not quite the way it is pictured in real life. I thought it would be more sheer and natural and this is more matte. A neutral plum , good for all seasons. Came on time. I suspect this color may be more flattering on women with darker hair.</li>
            <li> It,s new but the color is very nice.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this lipstick holds. It&#x27;s a pretty neutral color and I basically don&#x27;t have anything negative to say. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this lipstick. The shade is rosier than I thought it&#x27;d be, but beautiful nonetheless. It&#x27;s not sticky at all. Leaves my lips feeling smooth, and not overpowering with the color!</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick a LOT and have purchased it multiple times.  For me the most important thing about lipcolor is that it&#x27;s even and feels nice on my lips without being too moist or sticky but also not drying.  Rimmel lipsticks in general are excellent and this one is no different.  I also really like this packaging, it&#x27;s a modern matte tube with a cute lip print graphic and Kate Moss signature.  However if you are ordering this for the first time I would like to add that it&#x27;s not quite what one would expect, in my opinion, from the color shown here.  08 is a much lighter and pinker shade than it appears to be.  It&#x27;s vibrant but not clownish.  I love it and also like to layer it under brownish lip tint for an ideal color.  If you&#x27;re seeking more of a raisin shade I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The color is so lovely, beig darker skin toned it can be hard picking out pinks but his one is great. It applies really nicely and didn&#x27;t dry out my lips. Not a long lasting or a long wear lipstick by any means but it is still a great product.</li>
            <li> Gostei, minha pele e clara entao ficou muito bem Obrigada</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t match the description at all unfortunately. Instead of a nude/dusty pink hue I got 2 tubes of very dark purple lipstick :( I wanted to like it, but the color was just totally off. To be fair, it did have staying power... unfortunately, in a color that looks awful on me, so that wasn&#x27;t much of a plus!</li>
