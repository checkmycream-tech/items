            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the Caruso Steam Rollers</li>
            <li>this product is the Best, I love it</li>
            <li>in good sturdy box&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>These are just great, love the idea I can have</li>
            <li>Loved this invention best for curling straight hair</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Got my order fast and there wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your great service in so many areas!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through 3 sets; just recently I realized the foam rollers were again wearing out and was so happy to find replacements here at Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Gel will keep the hold better than mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>once it&#x27;s on your head, be sure roll it with the steam hole facing DOWN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have the time, that&#x27;s OK, but if you have time to leave them in for 30-45 minutes, you&#x27;ll be glad you</li>
            <li>I love the way they make my hair turn out</li>
            <li>i have used these for years and still love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also works great on straight hair.</li>
            <li>but I needed more than just one, hence the solution noted here.</li>
            <li>I love these steam rollers.  </li>
            <li>well pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I was well pleased and glad they were available and enexpensive.</li>
            <li>My wife has owned and used her Caruso steam roller setup for years and was surprised and happy to learn that Amazon had the replacement rollers for her.</li>
            <li>Also this set is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>They are easy on fine hair, also.  </li>
            <li>I had worn out the foam part of my old curlers and was thrilled to find them on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>but once you master it, they work just fine.</li>
            <li>These replacement curlers were exactly the same as the ones that came with my original Caruso Molecular Hairsetter and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I can get a great curl with these, especially if you twist the hair before you roll it in the curler.  </li>
            <li>I  get perms and these work great in-between perms to make the curl last longer.  </li>
            <li>The plastic tops don&#x27;t fit well</li>
            <li>These rollers heat quick and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have the original Caruso curlers that came with the steamer</li>
            <li>These small rollers are the perfect answer.  </li>
            <li>The instructions even advise the use of the hair comb/clips to be able to curl short hair more easily, but the company does not provide them.  </li>
            <li>have a lot of flexibility - I can roll the jumbo/medium for a quick hairstyle before a night out.  </li>
            <li>These were all I needed to quickly set my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>they curl my hair without leaving it super damaged.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much for exceeding expectations!</li>
            <li>/&gt;they work great, and do much less damage to your hair.</li>
            <li>The setter and rollers take limpy fine straight hair and gives it volume and curls.</li>
            <li>I love the soft sponge material  they used on these rollers.</li>
            <li>For the best results, your hair has to be dry and the curler steamed for about three seconds (so it doesn&#x27;t get wet).</li>
            <li>Go by look;  once the top of the roller barely starts to form steam beads, take it off and roll it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A couple of tips if you&#x27;re hair is super straight like mine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way they make my hair look and the curls are still there the next day.  </li>
            <li>Seller got me my product fast!</li>
            <li>I do three chunks: top crown, mid section, and below/behind the ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I order these rollers for sponges since i already have many different color rollers.</li>
            <li>sure your hair is bone dry before starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curls are strong and last.</li>
            <li>I needed a tighter curl than the large and jumbo rollers that came with my unit.  </li>
            <li>I use these everyday for work, love it!</li>
            <li>Much healthier for my hair than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Really holds curl in my stick straight hair.</li>
            <li>And the company does not sell the hair combs/clips separately to be able to obtain them in any other way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Caruso Professional Molecular Steam Roller system for decades when I choose to use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully with these new ones I will go another 30 years!</li>
            <li>Most of old rollers have these rough porous sponges around them.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are not easy to use in short hair but work great on hair that is medium to long.</li>
            <li>When you want to go curly, and your hair naturally rebels, THIS system delivers the curl and bounce!</li>
            <li>Had to trim down steamer connection so rollers would fit.</li>
            <li>If your hair typically falls off rollers, go buy a set of cheap plastic rollers that have clamps.  </li>
            <li>The starter kit I got first didn&#x27;t have enough curlers to do my whole head at once though, so I came back for these.</li>
            <li>I like the Caruso steam hair setter  but wish the rollers would last longer or could just replace the foam around the rollers without having to buy the whole roller.  </li>
            <li>These steam rollers are about the only way to put a curl into my straight hair.</li>
            <li>I was getting ready to contact you when I decided to open the boxes just to look at the rollers.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and they arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>Especially if your hair has no natural curl, you can&#x27;t let the roller or clip get any more wet, or the wetness will make it</li>
            <li>I ordered two 6 packs in November, and today I decided to open the package to use them along with my new Caruso ION Steam Set.  </li>
            <li>I got this idea because the original Caruso rollers came with a small purple clamp and a medium purple clamp ---</li>
            <li>I just needed some replacements for my 12+ year old rollers and these were just the same.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I have used this system for over 30 years and on my old rollers the sponge was finally falling apart.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the finished product when using these versus the one size down.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and rather thin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Separate the curls with a comb just a little bit - too much combing will make a frizz ball.  </li>

            <li> The small ones are the only ones I use and that work really well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> your roller isn&#x27;t going to be flat</li>
            <li> The steam rollers are the only thing that don&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leave the curlers in as long as you can.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Put a little mousse/gel in your hair in the middle of blow-drying.  </li>
            <li> These rollers doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out like other heated rollers.</li>
            <li> Still a good product, just needs a little redesign on the base unit.</li>
            <li> I spend the time doing medium, small, and petite for a big day or for Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the small set  then purchased extra of the rollers in the size that I needed.  </li>
            <li> and I bought more small ones from Amazon which have less foam and some of the covers are very difficult to put on or take off.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a good product for short hair.  </li>
            <li> the price for the rollers is expensive since they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Hole at end of roller does not fit onto steamer.  </li>
            <li> The small and petite Caruso rollers do not come with the necessary hair combs/clips to help curl on the difficult to use sponge curler.  </li>
            <li> Together, with the ones that came with my set and the ones I bought afterwards, I have 12 medium, 18 small, 12 jumbo, and 6 petite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get used to putting in your hair</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as expensive as I thought</li>
            <li> just packaged in the wrong boxes.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to rest the covers on for steam.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> These are somewhat more difficult to work with compared to the originals but they get a bit easier with time.  I love the way they make my hair look and the curls are still there the next day.  I have the original Caruso curlers that came with the steamer and I bought more small ones from Amazon which have less foam and some of the covers are very difficult to put on or take off.</li>

            <li> Got my order fast and there wonderful.  I set my Mothers hair with them and she no longer has to sit under a dryer.  thank You!  Seller got me my product fast!</li>

            <li> I use these everyday for work, love it!</li>
            <li> I was dissappointed that I received 2 different types of foam on the rollers-- 6 were soft foam and 12 were rough foam. I would think the entire order would be of the same consistency.</li>
            <li> These steam rollers are about the only way to put a curl into my straight hair. The starter kit I got first didn&#x27;t have enough curlers to do my whole head at once though, so I came back for these.

            <li> The setter and rollers take limpy fine straight hair and gives it volume and curls. The smaller the rollers the tighter the curls and they last.</li>
            <li> My wife has owned and used her Caruso steam roller setup for years and was surprised and happy to learn that Amazon had the replacement rollers for her. I must overcome the tendency to consider Amazon as only a book, video and music store!   Thanks for your great service in so many areas!</li>
            <li> The small and petite Caruso rollers do not come with the necessary hair combs/clips to help curl on the difficult to use sponge curler.  The instructions even advise the use of the hair comb/clips to be able to curl short hair more easily, but the company does not provide them.  Definitely not a good product for short hair.  And the company does not sell the hair combs/clips separately to be able to obtain them in any other way.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I bought the Caruso set.  I am very glad I did.  Together, with the ones that came with my set and the ones I bought afterwards, I have 12 medium, 18 small, 12 jumbo, and 6 petite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of flexibility - I can roll the jumbo/medium for a quick hairstyle before a night out.  I spend the time doing medium, small, and petite for a big day or for Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips if you&#x27;re hair is super straight like mine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a little mousse/gel in your hair in the middle of blow-drying.  Gel will keep the hold better than mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure your hair is bone dry before starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the set is heating up, \\&quot;set up\\&quot; the rest.  Separate your rollers and clips on the counter before you start doing your hair (stand them up), and use hair clips to separate your hair into chunks.  I do three chunks: top crown, mid section, and below/behind the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the bigger curlers closer to the back/bottom and the smaller ones closer to the front/top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your roller isn&#x27;t going to be flat once it&#x27;s on your head, be sure roll it with the steam hole facing DOWN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set the roller on the steamer for a 7-9 seconds.  Go by look;  once the top of the roller barely starts to form steam beads, take it off and roll it.  Then set the clip on the steamer for about a second before clipping it.  Especially if your hair has no natural curl, you can&#x27;t let the roller or clip get any more wet, or the wetness will make it so the curl can&#x27;t set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave the curlers in as long as you can.  If you don&#x27;t have the time, that&#x27;s OK, but if you have time to leave them in for 30-45 minutes, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Separate the curls with a comb just a little bit - too much combing will make a frizz ball.  If it seems too curly, don&#x27;t panic; it will relax over the next 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to use hair spray when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> These are just great, love the idea I can have some curls&lt;br /&gt;any time I want them, and NO damage to hair, I may be&lt;br /&gt;forgoing perms a while.</li>
            <li> These are the best rollers. I love the way they make my hair turn out and I bought these as extras. They aren&#x27;t as expensive as I thought</li>
            <li> i have used these for years and still love them.&lt;br /&gt;they work great, and do much less damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years . These rollers doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out like other heated rollers.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat quick and are easy to use. The curls are strong and last. The rollers are not easy to use in short hair but work great on hair that is medium to long. I got the small set  then purchased extra of the rollers in the size that I needed.  Also this set is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Loved this invention best for curling straight hair&lt;br /&gt;curls last all day and night&lt;br /&gt;is so simple and easy&lt;br /&gt;came in good sturdy box&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this seller&lt;br /&gt;came on time</li>
            <li> I have had this curler set for about 15 years.  The steamer works perfectly.  I had worn out the foam part of my old curlers and was thrilled to find them on Amazon!  My hair is fine and rather thin.  I can get a great curl with these, especially if you twist the hair before you roll it in the curler.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the curlers either.  For the best results, your hair has to be dry and the curler steamed for about three seconds (so it doesn&#x27;t get wet). I leave them in for about ten minutes. I  get perms and these work great in-between perms to make the curl last longer.  Also works great on straight hair. They are easy on fine hair, also.  I am VERY happy to find replacement curlers! I think they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Hole at end of roller does not fit onto steamer.  Had to trim down steamer connection so rollers would fit.</li>
            <li> The plastic tops don&#x27;t fit well and they fall out. I don&#x27;t think they are made where they used to get them since they never did this before.</li>
            <li> Much healthier for my hair than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> These were all I needed to quickly set my hair in the morning.  Here&#x27;s a hint. If your hair typically falls off rollers, go buy a set of cheap plastic rollers that have clamps.  Toss the rollers in the recycle bin.  Use the outside plastic roller clamps to clamp your hair onto this sponge roller.  Then roll your hair, using this Caruso clamp to cover once you have steamed it.  I got this idea because the original Caruso rollers came with a small purple clamp and a medium purple clamp --- but I needed more than just one, hence the solution noted here.</li>
            <li> Really holds curl in my stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> I love these steam rollers.  The small ones are the only ones I use and that work really well on my hair.  I ordered two 6 packs in November, and today I decided to open the package to use them along with my new Caruso ION Steam Set.  To my surprise, the two boxes inside the envelope were labeled &amp;#34;petite&amp;#34;..........not &amp;#34;small&amp;#34;.  I was getting ready to contact you when I decided to open the boxes just to look at the rollers.  Again, to my surprise, inside the box &amp;#34;WERE&amp;#34; the &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; rollers, which are the ones I needed!  So, no panic, the correct rollers........just packaged in the wrong boxes.  So thank you!  Good price too! And the service was great.  I received them in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the Caruso Steam Rollers this product is the Best, I love it and I&#x27;ll recommended to any one.</li>
            <li> Difficult to rest the covers on for steam.  They fall off or the steam burns your fingers.  Still a good product, just needs a little redesign on the base unit.</li>
            <li> I needed a tighter curl than the large and jumbo rollers that came with my unit.  These small rollers are the perfect answer.  I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;extremely well pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> These replacement curlers were exactly the same as the ones that came with my original Caruso Molecular Hairsetter and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get used to putting in your hair but once you master it, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> These rollers cost a lot but you can&#x27;t find them anywhere but online.  That&#x27;s too bad.  The steam rollers are the only thing that don&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Love these! they curl my hair without leaving it super damaged.</li>
            <li> I love the soft sponge material  they used on these rollers. I order these rollers for sponges since i already have many different color rollers. Most of old rollers have these rough porous sponges around them.  Now I wish the manufacturer also sells 1. just sponges only 2.plstic rollers with shorter shaft</li>
