            <li>AAA+++ Seller and Product, Thanks Beauticom!!</li>
            <li>The shape and size are just right.</li>
            <li>and you do have to remove a polish or two to get to any in back, which is very easy</li>
            <li>the seller IMMEDIATLEY contacted me back and sent me out a replacement right away and was very kind, both times it was packed extremely well with foam boards in each slot and all around the box, protecting the case COMPLETELY from getting any damage to the case, the new one works PERFECT, AND DEFINITELY FITS OVER 220 BOTTLES</li>
            <li>It is pretty tall.</li>
            <li>I removed the nail polish sign on top and place my entire inventory of bottle liquids in this display.</li>
            <li>The customers love looking at the different flavors and the ability to spin it to look at all of the flavors.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I can not attach the sign on the top which makes it look too commercial for my taste.  </li>
            <li>it saves so much storage space, my only tiny issue its that it moves a little weeble wobbly, but otherwise a great solution for polish storage!</li>
            <li>I got this nail case for my 2 girls they both have so much nail polish that I didn&#x27;t have any place to put them.</li>
            <li>No broken plastic!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I agree with others who comment about the inconvenience of getting to the polishes placed on the shelves on the inside, but I try to place those that I don&#x27;t use very often in those areas.  </li>
            <li>This takes up less space and allows for more bottles to store on the front.  </li>
            <li>I have used the middle to store nail stickers,  stamping stuff, nail art stuff and the top middle for polish removers, files, buffing etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I have about 300 bottles in my display right now, and to give people an ideah of what fits and what I have, I have Tons of all of the following brands:</li>
            <li>I was greatly pleased with the shipping time and was surprised when it arrived earlier than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have over 160 bottles of polish stored and the bottom row is pretty much empty.  </li>
            <li>, however I use all the shelves in back for all my backups of my extra polishes so this isnt really as much of a problem for me</li>
            <li>Wish it were a little cheaper, but it is well made and in the end worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The holder is made of a durable hard plastic that I am sure will last a long time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The storage rack is nice. It is pretty tall. The rack is an oval shape that has  an outside oval rim on both sides and then there is a divider between each side and you can also store polish behind the outer rims on each side. There are 5 shelves and each shelve will hold about 13 gelish or 13 china glaze polishes, or 13 zoya polishes per side so that is (13 X 5) - 65 polishes per side times 2 is 130 polishes on the outside rim. I have placed 10 polishes on the inside behind the rim on one side and still has room for some mores(this was a mix of CND, OPI, ESSIE and Orly and various top and base coats). So if I was to load up the inside portion of the shelves (10 polishes X 5) &#x3D; 50 polishes X 2 sides &#x3D; 100 polishes more so at minimum this will hold 235 polishes. the only drawback is that the polishes behind the rim are harder to get to you have to remove the polishes from the outside rim to get to them.  So I am storing the polishes that i rarely used behind the outer rim of the rack. All in all it holds tons of polish and it rotates nicely. I was also able to fit the 3 nicole polishes I have on the outer rim as well with no issues.</li>
            <li> i love how much space it has i have a lot of polish and still have room for lots more! it saves so much storage space, my only tiny issue its that it moves a little weeble wobbly, but otherwise a great solution for polish storage!</li>
            <li> I got this nail case for my 2 girls they both have so much nail polish that I didn&#x27;t have any place to put them. But since I got the nail holder I can put all there polish in. I love this nail polish holder.</li>
            <li> I run a small business. We sell liquids in little bottles. I did not want to spend hundreds on a display stand so I brought this as a substitute. I removed the nail polish sign on top and place my entire inventory of bottle liquids in this display. The customers love looking at the different flavors and the ability to spin it to look at all of the flavors. Save some money and forget the expensive display stands. If you have any items that are about the size of a nail polish bottle, this stand will hold them.</li>
            <li> Love it. It holds a lot of&lt;br /&gt;Polish. Great for organizing your polish. You will be able to find what your looking for with just a spin.</li>
            <li> looks great at the salon, holds alot of polish, rotates so customers can pick their favorite colors, drill holes to install</li>
            <li> This product is going down in the books as the best I have ever purchased!  I was greatly pleased with the shipping time and was surprised when it arrived earlier than I expected.  Upon arrival the rack was packed very well with lots of heavy duty styrofoam in every open space. No broken plastic!&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of nail polish so I commenced loading and counted 225 with room for more.  That includes loading polish in the open space behind the area where the main polishes go.  (Some other reviewers may be able to explain that better!)  I recommend this product %100!  I am seriously thinking about purchasing another one for the polish that did not fit and since I will be buying polish for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing - the sign comes separate so you can opt to not install the sign especially if you are just using it in your home.</li>
            <li> so cool that it fits so many polishes&lt;br /&gt;we got this because we didn&#x27;t want to hang&lt;br /&gt;anything on the wall so works out great.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she LOVES it!!</li>
            <li> Love it, exactly what I was looking for.  Fits all of my nail polish, keeps them neat and organized, can see every bottle.</li>
            <li> This nail polish holder is perfect. The shape and size are just right. It arrived quickly, well packaged, and in perfect condition. The holder is made of a durable hard plastic that I am sure will last a long time. I am so excited about giving this to my 23-year-old daughter for Christmas. I just know she will love it. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have more than 115 bottles of nail polish, this nail polish rack stores them all AND I even have room for more! It came in one big box, the only thing that needed to be assembled was the sign and you can take that or leave. Anyone who needs to store their polish but, doesn&#x27;t want to nail something to your wall, this is the solution for you.  The only issue I had with it was the price, after shipping and handling I ended up paying almost $100.  A little pricy, since the original quoted price on Amazon was $75, but goods things are never cheap! Bottom line, I LOVE my nail polish rack!</li>
            <li> I put off buying this because of the price, but finally broke down and spent the big bucks.  It was well packaged and easy to assemble together.  I didn&#x27;t bother with the signage because it was for home use.  I have over 160 bottles of polish stored and the bottom row is pretty much empty.  Some of my polish is narrow and so I put it sideways on the rack.  This takes up less space and allows for more bottles to store on the front.  I have used the middle to store nail stickers,  stamping stuff, nail art stuff and the top middle for polish removers, files, buffing etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> My first one was a little wobbly and snapped in half after loading my polishes, so I contacted the seller and the seller IMMEDIATLEY contacted me back and sent me out a replacement right away and was very kind, both times it was packed extremely well with foam boards in each slot and all around the box, protecting the case COMPLETELY from getting any damage to the case, the new one works PERFECT, AND DEFINITELY FITS OVER 220 BOTTLES, I have about 300 bottles in my display right now, and to give people an ideah of what fits and what I have, I have Tons of all of the following brands: Nicole by OPI, OPI, Orly, Zoya, Essie, Butter London, Milani, JulieG, China Glaze and Finger Paints by Sallys Beauty Supply, Plus I have Loreal Polishes and Sinful Polishes and A few Indie brands like KB Shimmer, so as you can see it fits all types of polishes. My only complaint, like someone else said was that the polishes in the back are hard to get to and you do have to remove a polish or two to get to any in back, which is very easy, however I use all the shelves in back for all my backups of my extra polishes so this isnt really as much of a problem for me but, this is a great display, you wont regret buying this, I may buy a second one to display the rest of my polishes!! AAA+++ Seller and Product, Thanks Beauticom!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Puts all my polishes where I can see them. Mine is for home use and I like that I can not attach the sign on the top which makes it look too commercial for my taste.  Wish it were a little cheaper, but it is well made and in the end worth the price.  I considered it for quite a while before splurging and I am not dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Love this rack, at first I did not think that my polishes was not going to fit because I have so many but they did. Very happy with this purchase. No more polishes in shoe boxes.</li>
            <li> I have a polish problem and I wanted to store them in a way where I could view them all at once and save space. This rack is currently holding my 150+ polishes with ease and I haven&#x27;t used the top shelf yet.  It comes almost fully assembled out of the box. You can add the sign on top or not.  It&#x27;s sturdy and swivels smoothly.</li>
            <li> Holds a lot of nail polish.  Wobbles a bit if you don&#x27;t have the same amount of polish on each side to balance it out.  I agree with others who comment about the inconvenience of getting to the polishes placed on the shelves on the inside, but I try to place those that I don&#x27;t use very often in those areas.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
