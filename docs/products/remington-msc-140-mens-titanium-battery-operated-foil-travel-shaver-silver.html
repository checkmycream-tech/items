            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Great price and delivery time</li>
            <li>Best shaver for the price gives a nice close shave</li>
            <li>any gals reading this the Remington would make a great birthday gift for the man in your life.</li>
            <li>So I just ordered one of my own, and I saved myself over $100 by not buying another Panasonic!</li>
            <li>Best shaver for the money, comparable to many non-disposable.  </li>
            <li>works great as good as my electric.</li>
            <li>He says they are all mostly junk, but this is the best value out there.</li>
            <li>No frills, just a nice close shave every morning for 10 bucks!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the best, but it doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as the best either.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how good it works for the price.  </li>
            <li>This shaver fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned this would be cheap and breakable with the price but its actually perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is good.</li>
            <li>He says it works great and gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>We were looking for a good, lightweight razor and got one of these based on the feedback of others here at amazon.</li>
            <li>- it tells me where I&#x27;ve done a good jow shaving and which spots I&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li>I suppose for $10 this is a fair product.</li>
            <li>All electric razors will miss a whisker here and there, but I find this razor does a good job.</li>
            <li>This one makes a good difference in shaving face and moustache area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a low-priced shaver to carry with me for the days when I forget to shave before leaving the house, and saw this one, saw that the reviews were good, and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life.  </li>
            <li>The Remington 140 is good for nothing.</li>
            <li>It was a good thing I bought three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it shaves as good as $160.00 electric razor.</li>
            <li>It shaves fairly well including the neck area.  </li>
            <li>It worked well for 3 months - probably almost as good as the Panasonic, although it was noisy w quite a bit of vibration.  </li>
            <li>It does shave fairly close to your skin so result is good.</li>
            <li>It weighs almost nothing and has a good handle feel.</li>
            <li>good value for the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>Good shaver for travel/camping or as a back-up.  </li>
            <li>This is a good, reliable value.  </li>
            <li>As Seen On TV one) and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does a good job and runs off of AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Just buy a good set pr rechargable batteries</li>
            <li>It is meant to be a disposable product, since the blades are not replaceable, but the unit is usually good for about a year.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just so good.</li>
            <li>It did shave good while it lasted.</li>
            <li>good every day.</li>
            <li>He loved it and so when the foil was damaged, I sent him another</li>
            <li>This just did not work good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Switch is tricky, but good for preventing accidental triggers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for an overnite kit</li>
            <li>Get a good close shave while on the go.</li>
            <li>work good but foil brocked in 1 week</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>It not work very fine!</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had the greatest success with rechargeable battery life.  </li>
            <li>i was glad to find a shaver by a name brand like Remington for a great price.  </li>
            <li>This is not as good as a $100-150 razor but for the price it is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for cleaning yourself up between getting a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Not something I would use every day but for days when you need to multitask and still get to work clean shaven, this shaver is ideal.     </li>
            <li>I received this very fast and it wirks great!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy a &amp;70+ shaver!</li>
            <li>I have never found a better battery powered shaver than this!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor !!</li>
            <li>Just bought three more of them!</li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>

            <li>They are great for keeping my head smooth and shiny while on location.</li>
            <li>Amazing razor,especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I bought on a year ago and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>At $9.99 and free prime shipping, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver for the price...</li>
            <li>Does a nice job for the touch ups or in-between razor shaves.</li>
            <li>He is thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>I now own two of these.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>Plus You have to buy a foil as well if you use that kind.</li>
            <li>This is as good as any of the more expensiove electric razors out there.  </li>
            <li>Its heavier and fits nicely into the palm</li>
            <li>The most surprising part is the price.</li>
            <li>Handy for travel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased multiple replacements because for the price, weight, and performance it is a great value and perfect for trips.</li>
            <li>just make sure you put in good batteries</li>
            <li>As good as the traveling Shaveman was this shaver gives you a better shave.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased for my choosing and hope to by more products</li>
            <li>Quite easy to buy 1 or 2, put it in your car and travel kit and have something tolerably good for shaving while driving or for emergencies.     </li>
            <li>Works great for a quick touch up at the end of the day or while traveling.  </li>
            <li>For a $10 item, its really good, its got a powerful motor, gives a good close shave.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job and easy to use since it is battery powered</li>
            <li>Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent</li>
            <li>This shaver is also very strong for a battery shaver...</li>
            <li>Keep good batteries in it, and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Great smooth,comfortable shave, Easy to use, batteries easy to change, The shaver very easy to cleanlong life with AA batteries,convenient.</li>
            <li>Also, as I have very fair skin, a gentle shave in required and</li>
            <li>I used a Remington MSC-140 travel shaver on a vacation and liked it better than my triple-head Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap (disposable) and it did a tolerably good job.   </li>
            <li>So far after a week its great!   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you need a massage, but it doesn&#x27;t shave worth beans.</li>
            <li>If you want a shaver that is handy and cheap, this is it!</li>
            <li>It does not have a sideburn trimmer like the old Shaveman, but it is a great shaver!</li>
            <li>OK for good light or for a couple of days,</li>
            <li>This shaver is great for a quick clean shave before the shower or in the car on your way to work!</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>HE SAID IT IS GOOD FOR A QUICK TOUCH UP</li>
            <li>The shaver is good for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>So it is fine for that kind of use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this daily,but its just great to have for certain situations.</li>
            <li>for a better shaver</li>
            <li>If you use the latest Gillette razor, you&#x27;ll spend $50 for replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Most of them will be discarded in landfills, where whatever toxic materials contained within will eventually leak into the water table.  </li>
            <li>as many electrics do.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>one of most of the others, but</li>
            <li>For what this is, at the price it is, I was extremely pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>It performs as well or better than any Braun, etc.</li>
            <li>Works better than shavers 5-10X the price.</li>
            <li>I would like to see a trimmer &amp; a better cover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman, just using this razor for inconspicuous facial hair for which it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I value my time and money more than picking up the lady-kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>Use to get this at Walmart, so glad could find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Works better than many battery razors three or four times the price.</li>
            <li>so I was hoping it would be okay for travel</li>
            <li>MSC-140 better than all others, it shaves closer and quicker.</li>
            <li>I have a rather unusual need for a gentle but effective shaver and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I just bought a couple more.</li>
            <li>in all, the lack of a beard trimmer and the throwaway nature of the product prevent me from giving a better review.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This shaver won&#x27;t take anything off that is more than a couple millimeters.</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year power user of electric shavers, and many years of those with Remington microscreen shavers.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered, so I don&#x27;t need to worry about carrying a charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does an OK job at shaving.</li>
            <li>But it shaves much better than a $10 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was leary to buy this one because I couldn&#x27;t see it in store, but I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Its not as good as the Panasonic, but for occasional use its great, and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the neck area is always better to use a disposable one, but thats in my case.</li>
            <li>I use it when I&#x27;m traveling mostly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just so much better on every level.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find this product on line.</li>
            <li>It is more convinient than the recharge type of shaver.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave every day, so this might work better if you use it every day.</li>
            <li>And outstanding value.</li>
            <li>Sure the Braun gave a closer shave</li>
            <li>what I like even more is it works on my NiMH rechargeable batteries where the Braun would not.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t handle anything more than a day or two&#x27;s growth.    </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll probably keep buying more of these.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is lightweight and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>But I expect more from a Remington shaver.  </li>
            <li>Both the top and the bottom foil must be touching your face at all times.  </li>
            <li>this is a nice cheap razor.</li>
            <li>It has two foil/cutters that do a better job than the titanium turbo could.  </li>
            <li>Better than any electric razor I have used.  </li>
            <li>But better then you might suspect for the price.</li>
            <li>I order these for someone else and they love them.</li>
            <li>I suggest ordering more then one at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying two now because I can&#x27;t find them at Walmart any more.</li>
            <li>So much better than rechargeables.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve paid more for replacement foils...)</li>
            <li>Shaves nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads cost more than the razor itself.</li>
            <li>He thinks he is looking better every day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you try, it will leave the stubble on your face and  you will never get a close shave.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy something that&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li>I ordered 5 more for family and friends.  </li>
            <li>but there are no parts available for it anywhere!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>It performs much better.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>It will probably workout cheaper to spend more $ on a better quality shaver.</li>
            <li>A razor that ran on two AA batteries with no need to charge anything just pop in a fresh set of batteries and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>,I LOVE</li>
            <li>I just ordered 4 more.</li>
            <li>I found I was using the shaver more than the blade</li>
            <li>Make no mistake about it, this is a throwaway razor, as its&#x27; blades cannot be replaced, so you may want to order more than one.  </li>
            <li>but many say electric shavers need to grow on you so still waiting for it to not burn but gets the job done</li>
            <li>We are pleased with this item, but have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>I also coupled it with pre-electric shave to get an even better shave as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I must have ordered many of them before.</li>
            <li>I am not only impressed with the shaver, but the cost, size and weight.</li>
            <li>Buy a 20 buck Braun M90, much better choice.</li>
            <li>Granted, I do not have a heavy beard, but for me this is a good razor at an excellent price.  </li>
            <li>great shave for a really inexpensive shaver</li>
            <li>Love the shaver for this price</li>
            <li>many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would therefore recommend the  Panasonic for 4.00 more.</li>
            <li>When the screens give up the ghost after a year or more, I just toss them out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Shaves better than any electric I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>AN OK SHAVER</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad</li>
            <li>Love the product...</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job and the price is very cheap.</li>
            <li>A good pair of Lithium batteries for long life and this shaver has performed great.      </li>
            <li>but they just never gave me the kind of clean, close shave</li>
            <li>HANDY FOR CAMPING ON TRIPS AND VACATION LIGHT AND EASY ON BATTERIES USED IT ON A TRIP FOR TWO WEEKS</li>
            <li>When you shave with it it does a pretty good job</li>
            <li>It makes you feel touching a very light and cheap item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little shaver to use in a pinch, and it&#x27;s great for taking on the road.</li>
            <li>Although no electric I have ever used is as close, or as comfortable as a razor with blades, after lathering with a good brush using hot water and shaving soap, this is an excellent razor for occasional use.  </li>
            <li>I shaved very quickly, maybe 5 min at most.</li>
            <li>It also comes in handy when I have an evening engagement as I can do a quick touch up shave to make me presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A super light-weight Remington shaver at a great price, and so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>cleans up the stubble very good and in such a hurry.</li>
            <li>Why would you ever want to buy an electric shaver when you can purchase this ecologically sound product at more than 1/3 the cost?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a cheap shaver, not too much more you can say than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it took more work and wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable is the MSC-140.</li>
            <li>a nice, cheap grooming tool with great results with short stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best of all,the battery life is longer than expected.</li>
            <li>Really Remington and Wahl are the value leaders in shaving in my opinion with shavers that lack the Braun type of detail but give as good</li>
            <li>Why spend 5 to 10 times as much on rechargeable electric razors when this gives every bit as good of a shave?  </li>
            <li>Hello, Fast shippment, item arrived as description, good quality.</li>
            <li>A really good portable shaver with a very good price in a small package that is easy to pack for trips.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave and is easy to clean and lubricate (it was a chore to clean and lubricate the Norelco triple-head).  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is the perfect shaver for me.</li>
            <li>Better than expected,  Very good.</li>
            <li>Plus I have moles on my face that are easy to cut.</li>
            <li>The plastic cover for the head comes off way too easily.  </li>
            <li>An easy recommendation for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a battery razor.</li>
            <li>It falls off easily, and since it contains the cleaning brush expect to lose that part in a hotel</li>
            <li>The on/off switch of convieniently located on the underside of the razor and is easily worked with the thumb.</li>
            <li>so it packs easily for travel.</li>
            <li>I have been using one of these electric razors for a year and it is easy on batteries (AAx2.)</li>
            <li>the batteries are easy to buy anywhere</li>
            <li>He loves it and says the shave is close and easy to operate without charging like others.</li>
            <li>so it can be easily damaged if you put it in your Dopp kit withouth protecting it somehow.</li>
            <li>Compact easy to use</li>
            <li>the past, I had a very nice compact (about the size of a wallet) foil razor (don&#x27;t remember the brand, but do think it was Braun) that did a wonderful job, and was very compact and light.</li>
            <li>Average share at best.</li>
            <li>4 star average rating... $10... sounds great right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you do not want close shave , can&#x27;t get new blades for it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>so this shaver is fine to me.</li>
            <li>But, since I just use it when traveling, it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine, just does not have the trimmer that I needed.</li>
            <li>So light weight and so easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>still works fine though.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li>but it is fine.  </li>
            <li>Does a fine job.</li>
            <li>fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine if you shave every day.  </li>
            <li>The shaver held up fine until I nicked the screen somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mother in law loves these for quick touch up in the nursing home!  </li>
            <li>Still, as far as electric shavers go, this one is great to keep in the briefcase or glove box for a quick touch up.  </li>
            <li>If you use 2 AA Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable Batteries for more than 2 weeks of great shave from single charge.</li>
            <li>For a cheap shaver it works very well for a quick shave well worth the money great value would buy it again.</li>
            <li>This little gem has to be one of THE best electric razor values out there!!</li>
            <li>This is the best little electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>As long as you have good batteries in it, it works quite well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain, but I am going to give you a review that is accurate unlike the rest of these.</li>
            <li>Hubby uses everyday &amp; will be perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li>Cheap not made with standards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this electric shaver for quite a while now...did not buy it as a primary shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great low price</li>
            <li>It is not at all as cheap looking or feeling as some shavers in the $60-80 range.  </li>
            <li>The switch is already going out, but hey, it&#x27;s so cheap, right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can get about 8-10 months out of one, and then I  just replace it as there are no cutters  available.</li>
            <li>He is serving our country in Iraq and water isn&#x27;t always available for shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lightly bearded and, for me, it runs for weeks on 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and light weight</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Cheap construction</li>
            <li>but it still doesn&#x27;t give that smooth shave that is wanted.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the razor</li>
            <li>Pro&#x27;s  Cheap.  </li>
            <li>The Remington short cut is great for body hair and short/tight hair cuts.</li>
            <li>I bought three (to get free shipping).  </li>
            <li>(I have a light beard).</li>
            <li>This can easily be a primary razor</li>
            <li>I am thinking of buying another one of these just in case and they are so cheap in price.</li>
            <li>My brother-in-law liked it so much he bought one.</li>
            <li>AA batts are cheap, so I dont mind.</li>
            <li>enjoy and keep one in the car to shave on the way to work</li>
            <li>But NO screen replacement is available.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start off by saying that this is not a recommendation:  I never could recommend any electric shaver, being a confirmed blade user.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver for travel or daily use.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I use this as my primary razor.</li>
            <li>No shaver will cut hair that cannot enter the foil.&lt;br /&gt;The foil guard doesn&#x27;t snap on securely.</li>
            <li>great for use on private areas.</li>
            <li>I got it just as a cheap way to do a touch-up between shaves and</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again if it was on sale for a penny and had free shipping.</li>
            <li>Shave is close &amp; comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver, use, and clean.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.  </li>
            <li>no matter where you go, battery always available no need to bring adapter as you travel  from country to country.</li>
            <li>I use the lotion before shaving and this thing glides over my face and gives me an amazingly smooth shave with no missed stuble.</li>
            <li>plastic body looks cheap.</li>
            <li>I use Enelope AA rechargeable batteries and (with light use of the Remington)</li>
            <li>My very first original Microscreen was an excellent shaver, but the NI-CAD batteries in it died and were not readily replaceable.</li>
            <li>It looks identical to the old one but not as well made, and it does not perform quite as good.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very handy for traveling, especially in our camper.  </li>
            <li>Even with stubbles of hair, it shaves clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about how effective it is, seriously not</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this shaver if you need to keep something handy around for travel.</li>
            <li>, you better believe it&#x27;s getting replaced with an exact replica.</li>
            <li>I was able to get that first month of use out of one set of batteries.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I used to buy a version of this razor from time to time, in Walmart, under some off brand from China.    </li>
            <li>I was really glad to find another one here on Amazon, for when the first one wears out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So long as it lasts over 6 months this is a great value.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It gives a great shave, and the battery life is surprisingly long.</li>
            <li>I had no idea what to expect when I originally ordered this electric razor.  </li>
            <li>recommend using this shaver, to keep stubble at a minimum and to maintain a great look, however if your hair gets a bit long, a trimmer or the barbershop would be recommended.</li>
            <li>, I did notice the price went up significantly, nah</li>
            <li>Great shave and runs a long time on two AA rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>I stay clean now</li>
            <li>It took a couple passes to get a clean shave as I would expect for a foil shaver.      </li>
            <li>Of course it cannot give you a clean shave like razors</li>
            <li>Also, I have never gotten any sort of cut or burn from it -- at most a very very mild tingling in places where I was particularly aggressive.    </li>
            <li>but I just clean it up with a blade if needed.</li>
            <li>The device is powered by 2 AA batteries which when paired with the razor head give a reasonably clean shave.</li>
            <li>This razor gives for smooth shaves, quickly.</li>
            <li>and when you go to clean the blades out with the bursh they fall out .</li>
            <li>Gets a SMOOTH finish QUICKLY.  </li>
            <li>You can shave so quick and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always able to get a very close, smooth shave without suffering any cuts or scrapes.</li>
            <li>Powerful  and easy to clean,easy to handle</li>
            <li>Clean blades after each use.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li>because I always put freshly charged batteries in, but either way, its strong.</li>
            <li>read many positive reviews of this, and was hoping that this would replace my need to purchase manual blades.</li>
            <li>Thought the   constant smooth, close shaves were too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I purchased for a cheap price and got way more than expected, very Satisfied</li>
            <li>Just a little slower than my Norelco at home, but the shave is very good.</li>
            <li>The ergonomics are great and I love this better than shavers that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money, and works great, as long as you don&#x27;t mind using up AA batteries.</li>
            <li>They do a good job for a daily shave!</li>
            <li>It can be as good as a blade when used often enough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so superior to my regular shaver that I use it almost all the time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this shaver based on the numerous reviews that stated that this thing was just as good as a full sized and full priced electric shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, each are good at different trimming tasks.</li>
            <li>It does not do quite as good a job as the prior one</li>
            <li>I bought this as a back up because it is so good</li>
            <li>really surprised,shaves better than a eighty dollar razor that i had tried,wish it was rechargable</li>
            <li>full time home razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a full on beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing, but not by a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great value -- idea for a travel razer, shaver for the car (but be careful) or for those quick touch-ups</li>
            <li>I leave this in my car or sometimes pack it when I want to travel light, Not quite as good as my Norelco but at literally one tenth the cost a pretty close second.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to pop a second set of batteries in while charging the first set.</li>
            <li>but the foil tends to wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a quick way for my HWP to get a quick shave in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Quick tip:</li>
            <li>That was a lucky day.</li>
            <li>Use it for quick shaves and evening touchup.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed enough with the quality of shave, and especially the price, to get another when the foil disintegrated.</li>
            <li>And yes, a trimmer would be nice but come on; if you really need a trimmer you should buy a real trimmer anyway.</li>
            <li>Good for travel (light, uses AA which you probably already carry when traveling), not really a replacement for home/daily use.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product, I wish the foils would last longer, but its meant to be a disposable product so all in all, I am pleased</li>
            <li>It just takes too many passes to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>Luckily for me my credit card refunded my money and I shipped this piece of junk to them.</li>
            <li>When I need a quick shave, all I do is reach in my office desk drawer or in my carry-on bag and shave away.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly but didn&#x27;t include two batteries as claimed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not that into electric razors, but this seems adequate.</li>
            <li>I have tryed most of the high priced razors and I like the Remington</li>
            <li>I normally just pull off the top and bang it on the sink.  </li>
            <li>Pretty smooth results.</li>
            <li>The razor is great but head only last for a month or so, that is why I have bought so many razors.</li>
            <li>Good shave, holds a charge, doesnt take long to charge.</li>
            <li>Even the 1 year old shaver is still working, though takes more pressure to do a clean cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not having to pack a special charger, and 2 AA batteries actually last a while in it.</li>
            <li>My New favorite ...</li>
            <li>So I bought a new Microscreen which worked well for me for many years until the batteries in it also died.</li>
            <li>If you think nothing of buying a $150 shaver every 2 years then this shaver is a better deal and you get new heads with each shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 7/27/14 - ok the foil on the new one detached as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been used to shaving in the shower in order to get a closer shave, but the Titanium did every bit as good a job dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a couple of electric shavers before and this one is actually pretty good with a low price.</li>
            <li>It is good for traveling or for a backup at work or in your car, if you need a dry shave on the go.</li>
            <li>Great little</li>
            <li>It has a little brush included with the cover which works great for cleaning it.  </li>
            <li>This is really a great little shaver.</li>
            <li>I searched around and came across this one, and for $10, it&#x27;s a great little razor that I have used a lot in the 1 month that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver to use between shaves.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver.</li>
            <li>The plastic cover doesn&#x27;t fit real well.  </li>
            <li>In addition, two AA batteries last an amazing length of time.</li>
            <li>Gives me a very close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>An amazing razor for only $10.</li>
            <li>Shaves unusually smooth and fast.  </li>
            <li>now I stay fresh.</li>
            <li>I just hope Remington continues to make this nice travel shaver (of which I said I now use daily).  </li>
            <li>I had used that one for several years and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I do think it is as good as electrics costing several times as much money.</li>
            <li>I liked it back then for one reason:</li>
            <li>I took this to Europe with a fresh battery but abandoned it in favor of razor blade.  </li>
            <li>Being loud is actually ok</li>
            <li>I used freshly charged Eneloops and had no problems.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth $5.00 IMO.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I thought I would be able to use it when I don&#x27;t have time to shave the old fashioned  way.  </li>
            <li>However, I would not buy it again to hack off three days worth of growth in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>Not even useful for travel.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly powerful...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for travelling and working as expected.</li>
            <li>but I got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>old grandson to keep him looking handsome.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Powerful with rechargeable batteries, and Handy for big hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>worth the 10$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was worth the purchase price and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remington should refocus their efforts if this is a product they claim is worth my time and money.</li>
            <li>For those who complain about it not cutting anything beyond a days beard growth, well, ever heard of pre-electric shave?</li>
            <li>nice close shave to get especially when traveling!</li>
            <li>For a very economical appliance, it delivers very satisfactory performance.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, just like my many other Remington shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>My older model Remington still works fine but</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;m married with a newborn; I&#x27;m quickly closing in on 40.</li>
            <li>The cutters are affixed which actually makes it better to clean with the supplemented brush in the headguard.    </li>
            <li>thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being extremely affordable, it does a really good job of shaving.  </li>
            <li>i love this shaver , it is very portable, i have one at work and another at home,  not expensive,  delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>It is helpful for those days when I miss a spot or want a touch up if I am going out right after work.  </li>
            <li>I can easily use this for a year without having to buy a new one, the price cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li>The batteries do hold up well and it does a decent job of cleaning up a light beard.</li>
            <li>All in all, if you needed something in an Emergency, or want to clean up some 5 o&#x27;clock shadow before heading out to dinner from the office, and found this on a store shelf, then it&#x27;s reasonable for $10.  </li>
            <li>It does a pretty close shave pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The small razor is a great buy, I bought two</li>
            <li>good shaver, I have bought 2 so far, they last about 8 months if you use it every day but still worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap, handy little shaver.</li>
            <li>For what it is ---a low cost shaver--- this little shaver is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>But for most other shavers, a replacement screen costs more than this whole shaver.</li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s cheap, but come on, it&#x27;s only been a month, but again, it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>I use an old toothbrush to quickly and effectively clean the heads after each shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus usual Amazon great service and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The cap does tend to come off, the power switch is a bit soft but overall a good value.</li>
            <li>I have several different makes and prices of elect razors.</li>
            <li>this does that nicely, even for the more delicate areas.</li>
            <li>For ten bucks each I more than get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap but it definitely is not made cheaply.</li>
            <li>Gives an adequate shave which is surprising since it is powered be two AA batteries and has a small shaving surface.  </li>
            <li>The unit got hot fairly quickly, but very close shave.</li>
            <li>This razor does not irritate the skin and shaves very, very, close.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>very very close shave.</li>
            <li>The batteries die very fast.</li>
            <li>It gets clogged very fast as well.</li>
            <li>My previous Remington shaver have been far more cost effective that $75.00 per year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First pair of batteries didn&#x27;t work, but they work fine on my 15 years old Hitachi BM-5200.</li>
            <li>This is a very surprising product that out-performs far more expensive shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it hard to believe that any electric razor needs to be more than 10 bucks if this one can do such a great job.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying one of the higher end models, give this thing a try.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to a blade, you&#x27;ll most likely get razor burn the first time you use an electric.    </li>
            <li>Because of it&#x27;s inexpensive price he is not concerned if he loses it, it does a great job and it doesn&#x27;t take up alot of room.</li>
            <li>The first one served me well for over three years.  </li>
            <li>The reason the first one broke was because I dropped it on a tile floor, bending the foil screen cover.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that this is my first purchase of an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>The first one I bought was at Kmart but thay no longer sell these.</li>
            <li>Beats the N______ that cost me ten times more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Norelco triple heads, Braun pockets, and Panasonic ES4025 (best, but the battery finally failed; they don&#x27;t make these anymore).  </li>
            <li>I am glad they continue to make this same shaver.</li>
            <li>My first one, the foil got damaged somehow.</li>
            <li>This shaver is lightweight, easy to clean, fairly quiet and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The slow-down doesn&#x27;t affect it&#x27;s performance too much, but if it were rechargeable, it would be freshly charged and singing on every shave.  </li>
            <li>Better than the regular electric razors I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money and so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I believe that is the first place I  bought this shaver for him years ago.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If one buys it, I hope you will be at least as happy as I have been.</li>
            <li>on, man, really!?</li>
            <li>Just won&#x27;t handle coarse beard or more than a day&#x27;s growth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend this razor !!</li>
            <li>Better to allow an owner to use the unit, replacing the blade and screen set as necessary, unti</li>
            <li>I had purchased this same one 2 or more years ago for my son.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my electric shaver but is good enough to get rid of my early evening stubble so that it doesn&#x27;t show much.  </li>
            <li>The shaver does exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 3-5 years.</li>
            <li>It does a reasonably good job at it&#x27;s intended purpose and so far as achieved a long battery life.  </li>
            <li>Also, if I forget to shave for a few days, it does a good job of shortening my beard to make my manual blade shaving</li>
            <li>but still you are getting a very good shave for very little money, less then replacing the foil / cutter or heads of most any brand shaver even after the cost of batteries.  </li>
            <li>The only thing he would have liked is if the new rezor had a pop out trimmer.</li>
            <li>Take responsibility Remington and TRY to provide a product that is worth more than One Single Star.</li>
            <li>Feels very cheap, which of course it is, but really not even worth what I paid ($10).</li>
            <li>Keep it handy, it does as well as a large 120V shaver, and as close as a wet razor.</li>
            <li>I see several people had issues with it not lasting that long but after using about 6 months now I&#x27;m very happy with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom-line: This is a no-nonsense product that&#x27;s a great alternative to the expensive shavers since it&#x27;s cheap and works well.</li>
            <li>Great travel razor that shaves, at least for me very well.  </li>
            <li>Obviously it shouldn&#x27;t be the only thing you use, but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>most cheap razors in the past-i&#x27;ve thrown away after a few uses-bad shaves plus razor burn.</li>
            <li>The party it was purchased for liked it well enough to ask for a direct replacement.</li>
            <li>It is fairly inexpensive and worth investing in at least a couple of them.</li>
            <li>Until the foil falls out these two foil shavers are far better than the single foil cheap throw away shavers.  </li>
            <li>When my original broke after about 18 months of fairly consistent use, I decided the 12 bucks was worth spending on something that did the job and saved me the cost of constantly using blades.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Ditto\\&quot;, to all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Why all the positive comments on this razer?</li>
            <li>The head cover is pretty lacking (it doesn&#x27;t really stay on),</li>
            <li>All in all, this has been one of the better purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>It shaves fairly close and comes with a small cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li>This travel shaver works better than almost all of the electric shavers I have previously used--I use it almost every day and continue to be amazed at how close and quickly it works for me.  </li>
            <li>Also, the head is too broad for maintaining any kind of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Not the closest shave in the world, especially compared to a blade, but it does a very respectable job in short order.  </li>
            <li>Let me first say, my facial hair is medium to light.</li>
            <li>I got it for a quick, shave when I forget to shave, and for when,  old</li>
            <li>Only problem I have had is the switch placement makes it easy to accidentally turn off while shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries once in 6 months, and this second set is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Shaves close and the batteries last a good, long time.</li>
            <li>Batteries last for a long time and a good shave.</li>
            <li>I certainly have no complaints about it and would buy another one.</li>
            <li>Also has a large head for a faster shave.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and small, yet does as good a job shaving as his regular at-home razor.  </li>
            <li>However this MSC-140 is only good if you shave 2 or 3 times a day as it will not cut a very long hair.</li>
            <li>The fact that is it AA-battery powered makes it snag and pull less than more powerful shavers.</li>
            <li>I have a $2 tiny single foil that runs off a AAA battery that does as good of a job as this, but takes longer.</li>
            <li>If you can accept that you are paying $10 for a shaver that you will likely replace again in half a year, then you will be more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>This actually makes it kind of good for shaving your neck -- if you do that every day, it will only shave off the short hairs and leave the long ones alone.    </li>
            <li>Handy little travel razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a handy little brush for cleaning that&#x27;s stored in the protective cover.  </li>
            <li>, the Remington would not run fast enough using rechargeable (fully so) batteries, which work fine in the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how they make such a great razor for so little money.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t get very close even when there isn&#x27;t much on your face.</li>
            <li>I guess if you don&#x27;t want a very close shave</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just AAs though, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes the Remmington razor.  </li>
            <li>The Remington MSC-140 is much cheaper than the Norelco and the head lasts about a year.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all I need and the price makes it a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Having been a blade man all my life, I found myself needing the ability of a fast \\&quot;clean-up\\&quot; from time to time.  </li>
            <li>While on vacation, I went 3 days without shaving and then decided to give the Remington a real life test even though I had my trusty razor in my shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Remington&#x27;s honesty in this instance is commendable, but it nothing to allay my annoyance that in this day and age of economic turmoil, resource depletion, and environmental degradation, short-lifespan devices like this are still being made.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an earlier version of a travel shaver that is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>(manual razor blade for that really close shave).</li>
            <li>This has been my primary shaver since July of last year.  </li>
            <li>I keep it in the office or in the car and it works very well for those occasions.  </li>
            <li>However, unless you are just entering puberty and starting the shaving experience, this should not be your primary shaver.</li>
            <li>I have been using one of those for ~ one month, and it is very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>but I am Asia, I don&#x27;t have much beard</li>
            <li>(Really, it&#x27;s probably about a 3 star device, in my book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to last for 6 months - with the light usage it&#x27;s getting, who knows.  </li>
            <li>satisfied with the money I spent.</li>
            <li>Husband said it snagged too much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are not replaceable, but for $10 for the whole shaver, I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t really shave well at all, on any part of my face.  </li>
            <li>All in all, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s an investment, but you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>(the twin foils/blades seem to really make a difference).</li>
            <li>Mine is not broken</li>
            <li>On every trip he raves about the convenience of this razor and thanks me again for finding it for him.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect much for 10 bucks</li>
            <li>Like all electric razors, if you decide to do a Grizzly Adams and let yuour beard grow, this won&#x27;t be much help.  </li>
            <li>Really just one.  </li>
            <li>Price is reasonable so it&#x27;s not costly to replace.</li>
            <li>It costs almost twice as much as the razor to replace the shaving head and screen.  </li>
            <li>A real performer.  </li>
            <li>cuts reasonably close, takes rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li>Really close shave.</li>
            <li>I does not work at all and will not even cut straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It shaves really well</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I call on Amazon to remove item before it really hurts someone.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>While this unit is light weight, it&#x27;s not exactly tiny.  </li>
            <li>But, for the price, it is convenient and do the job for me, since I don&#x27;t have that much mustache.</li>
            <li>but it grows fast.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>very close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Cuts real close</li>
            <li>If only I could get screens that fit.</li>
            <li>So this shaver isn&#x27;t very durable.</li>
            <li>But turns out I&#x27;d pushed in the batteries too much.</li>
            <li>This is as good if not better !</li>
            <li>I also purchased a more expensive (much more) Panasonic, and while I am pleased with it, it is only a little better than the Remington.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a few hairs here and there,  but does a pretty good job overall.</li>
            <li>A couple of months later I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have been buying Remington travel shavers for a number of years, and this is the third edition I&#x27;m familiar with.  </li>
            <li>This cheap little toy keeps me from full shaves on the weekend.</li>
            <li>Have to go over and over and over the same spot for a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide a clean shave and if you have a lot of facial hair</li>
            <li>As usual the Norelco did a great job, but it does irritate my face and that&#x27;s why I was looking for something different.</li>
            <li>i even use it to clean up my back side</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll eventually open it to clean out under the foil.</li>
            <li>would recommend rechargeable batteries to keep it going strong longer, but keep in mind that NiMh batteries gradually loose their charge when not in use.</li>
            <li>works good on my beard (your mileage my vary as this seems to be very individual) - one less thing to charge-</li>
            <li>Ok as very cheap--used a couple times decided not to take on trip as much less satisfactory compared with Remington rechargeable used at home</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 so far and keep them in different places for easy access.</li>
            <li>Cost a lot less than regular shavers and does as good a job.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe what a great job this little cheapo did on my dry face!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to be a great purchase, but at least the price was low.</li>
            <li>It is very good for a quick emergency shave but not good to take on vacation for shaving everyday as I did.</li>
            <li>This little device works great - if there&#x27;s not much hair there to begin with.  </li>
            <li>But since they warranty the damn thing for a year, you can get a whole new razor under warranty.  </li>
            <li>Another pair of new batteries worked, but very weak.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than a travel rotary razor purchased previous to this one.</li>
            <li>This shaver does perform adequately, but to my immense chagrin, the package stated that no replacement foils or blades are made for this model.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great value to at least try BEFORE you spend $70</li>
            <li>Decent shave if used every day.    </li>
            <li>so this serves me well for a quick 1-2 minutes shave on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I have been using these shavers as my main shaver for a number of years</li>
            <li>Does not shave as closely as a blade but does a decent job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it functions at a decent level, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for it&#x27;s product category.  </li>
            <li>Above instructions apply to most shavers especially foil type shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was amazed in the fact that it provided a decent shave.</li>
            <li>am soooo...pleased with this shaver, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>In his words, &amp;#34;I highly recommend this Remington Foil Travel Shaver.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shaver...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend,also for spare part&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this razor.</li>
            <li>i highly recomend it.  </li>
            <li>It misses less hair then the faster model and based on using it every day, it works just fine (for a multi day growth, the other one works better).  </li>
            <li>Could use a little more power</li>
            <li>I love them little thing.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I purchased this little</li>
            <li>Given the large size for a travel razor, and double foil, I expected a better shave.   </li>
            <li>Great little razor for about 10 bucks, beats the way more expensive brands in my opinion, yup</li>
            <li>This shaver actually costs less than replacing the blades alone for most electric shavers!  </li>
            <li>For me it is not, but for ten dollars it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>The product kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Performance rates 5 stars, but length of service is only worth 1 Star, so I give this shaver 2 Stars.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong, and the shave it gives is pretty darn good too.  </li>
            <li>Worth it for the low price.</li>
            <li>Normally I would say &amp;</li>
            <li>, beware that some rechargeable AA batteries are just slightly too large to fit.</li>
            <li>When you put it back, make sure you&#x27;re holding down the two buttons you used to take it off in the first place.</li>
            <li>than I&#x27;ve owned in the past AND you can easily take it with you!</li>
            <li>I have thick whiskers and never had one cut so quick and as smooth as this one.</li>
            <li>Then I put this new disposable to the test, to clean up those loose ends.  </li>
            <li>A decent, comfortable shave, works with my rechargeables and cheaper than replacing the cutter and screen on an expensive model, what&#x27;s not to love about that?</li>
            <li>and as I only use it occasionally, it suites me just fine.</li>
            <li>With enough time, this razor will do a pretty decent job.  </li>
            <li>I get no gain from what I say, other than I enjoy sharing my experience.</li>
            <li>An old toothbrush works better for cleaning the blades than the dinky little cleaning brush that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li>Well, this $10 shaver isn&#x27;t too different than the expensive ones, performance wise, and seems to stay full power for awhile.</li>
            <li>With this, it&#x27;s $10 for a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li>When you wear out the head, just purchase a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The blades aren&#x27;t replaceable, but at this price just buy a new one when they wear out.  </li>
            <li>And every time you throw in a new set of AA batteries, it is like you have a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;d need to buy a new one as I don&#x27;t believe you can buy replacement foil (nor the shaver cutter head).</li>
            <li>You cannot get new foil screens or cutters, but at the price, that&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li>If it ever gives up,i just order a new one.</li>
            <li>but should you need to use a rubber band to hold the cover on a brand new shaver?</li>
            <li>Order 2 of them, at the price point they are a terrific value and cheap enough to just leave one in car and desk.</li>
            <li>drawbacks are (1) very loud, and (2) no replacement blades or foil, so when it wears out, you just pitch it.</li>
            <li>very loud.</li>
            <li>After the Norelco was due for new blades I chucked it and bought three more Remington MSC-140 shavers to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Before the second set of batteries were discharged my first shaver broke.  </li>
            <li>Power switch has issue after months of consistent use, but it has given me a closer shave than $100+ razors of the same style.</li>
            <li>I wanted a small portable to be able to take when traveling.  </li>
            <li>first I bought one of these a couple years ago for travel but after my home shaver broke I started using as my daily shaver because it works</li>
            <li>I have probably purchased 6 or more over the past.  </li>
            <li>But overall a better shave than any of my other cord-cordless razors.</li>
            <li>Razor works very well in general.</li>
            <li>I had my first one for about 4 years with use as a daily shaver for about 1 year and combined travel time of 10 weeks over a 3 year period.  </li>
            <li>I usually get a lot of mileage out of most razors</li>
            <li>For under $9.00, I&#x27;m not sure you could ever find a more affordable electric razor.</li>
            <li>First one last me about 5 years.</li>
            <li>The little plastic cover falls off easily but you can hold it in place with a rubber band.  </li>
            <li>Runs right over those long hairs.  </li>
            <li>Once a week lightly use a standard tripple blade hand shaver after you have shaved to trim stubborn minor hair build up.</li>
            <li>so far, I&#x27;m just now replacing my first one after  a couple of years of occasional use (couple times a week).</li>
            <li>A darn good little razor that cost about half of the price of new cutters for my old razor.</li>
            <li>If you shave every day, this little shaver will do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t believe that the positive comments come from real daily users.</li>
            <li>this razor shaves relatively close with only mild razor burn.</li>
            <li>This one works better than any of them including my super duper expensive ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may seem a little under-powered, but I take my time, and get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>You could potentially use this as your only shaver if you stay consistent with shaving!</li>
            <li>I purchased two electric razors in the interim and took them both back because these little razors were actually better.  </li>
            <li>others have said, the clear plastic headguard will not stay snapped on.  </li>
            <li>As far as a close shave - only a straight blade razor would beat it.</li>
            <li>I guess they think cause it&#x27;s only a $10 shaver that people should just order a whole, complete, unit when it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too agressive on the face, and has never once irritated my skin like my old Mach 3 sometimes did.  </li>
            <li>This shaver offers a shave that is comparable to the the ShaveMan or Braun</li>
            <li>atleast so far.</li>
            <li>It is loud.  </li>
            <li>I had to replace my old Titanium Turbo razor that I bought some 8 years ago</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud and uses a AA.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic used two permanently modified AAs from the factory, so this was no surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am always surprised by the quality of a shave I get from this inexpensive shaver.</li>
            <li>So I started using the second shaver and just like the first one the screen let go in the same place and at almost exactly the same time.  </li>
            <li>the rubberized cover over the push-button switch wore out and am cautious not to get it near water...</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my 15 year old son for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I have had two of these and in both cases the foil head came apart and could not be fixed.  </li>
            <li>This one however is amazing:shaves close and fast enough.</li>
            <li>The old one still works but believe cutters are a bit worn.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit loud</li>
            <li>I replaced a 3 year old panasonic with this Remington.  </li>
            <li>I plan order at least one more for \\&quot;back-up.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I use it nearly every time I shave.</li>
            <li>My old Braun shaver was damaged and I thought I would try a Remington once again.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hairs, cut them with a trimmer first.</li>
            <li>I see a product marked &amp;#34;Remington,&amp;#34; I will move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it completely wears out.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.  </li>
            <li>the least i ask is that when you selling something make sure it works,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 80 years old.</li>
            <li>Which it is not, by far.</li>
            <li>Has a soft grip and lightweight.</li>
            <li>The foil does not seem to shave as close as the old one either.</li>
            <li>This is really kids - a total bust!</li>
            <li>( I have an early meeting I attend</li>
            <li>However, I found that this did not provide nearly a close enough shave to be appropriate for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Good bye expensive razors.</li>
            <li>The blades and foils on it lasted longer than most of the other expensive ones I&#x27;ve had, and it shaved better than them.</li>
            <li>Williams Lectric Shave Original with Green Tea Complex - 7 oz.]], and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with a foil shaver, you know that once you get a little tear in the foil-</li>
            <li>For the price hard to beat, it is a cheap shaver so don&#x27;t set the bar to high.</li>
            <li>I bought this from Amazon due to all the very positive reviews.</li>
            <li>You have to purchase a whole new unit and through the old unit into the nearest landfill or recycling center.  </li>
            <li>After two days I&#x27;m clean shaven except for these few stubborn hairs that keep getting longer.</li>
            <li>i would rubbed the back of my hand up and down against my cheeks, chin and neck after shaving and it felt really, really smooth, as close as my Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li>Light and small</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who needs a small, cheap, serviceable electric razor.</li>
            <li>I ordered this time arrived promptly and are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>but you really need a full blown razor for serious shaving.</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t use it as my daily at-home tool, but only because it doesn&#x27;t have the power and features</li>
            <li>(On the other hand, it did run for 3 weeks on one set of batteries and did the basic shaving adequately).</li>
            <li>I tried 2 sets of brand new batteries and even tried putting them in backwards as a last ditch effort but nothing.  </li>
            <li>I use the same AA rechargeable batteries in it that I use in my digital camera, so batteries are never going to make the whole shaver unuseable.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, because it takes so many passes, it doesn&#x27;t really save time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not quite as smooth as a proper wet shave, which is why only 4 stars, but if you&#x27;re travelling or in a hurry, this is a nice razor that won&#x27;t steer you wrong.</li>
            <li>buy the braun pocketgo, double the price but has a REAL foil which will shave and not pull your hair, is quiet and in addition has a rounded trimmer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t grow much facial hair and this thing still can&#x27;t really shave properly.</li>
            <li>It only works if your facial hair is very trimmed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After several passes over the main areas with the disposable, it did give a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;However, when going over those same areas with my regular razor</li>
            <li>Works really well, I now use it instead of my more expensive electric razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned very nice, very expensive shavers before.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised how well this shaver works, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li>This also means you&#x27;ll never get stuck with a dead shaver in the morning - when you need it most - as long as you have extra AA&#x27;s on hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If not dissapointed at first, I will be eventually due to recharge batt</li>
            <li>and I prefer batteries because my other remington razors never could keep a charge longer than a day after the first six months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries after a year, despite using it every other day.</li>
            <li>For the cost of the other shavers, this one does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>but apparently the producer is now out of business.</li>
            <li>Cons - About double as noisy as the seven year old Norelco ($120 then) that it replaced.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, but the cap does not stay on very well.</li>
            <li>Thus far it seems like it&#x27;ll last forever...</li>
            <li>All in all, for $10.00 I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>Folks, If your an adult who shaves on a daily basis, this shaver is just not going to hold up.</li>
            <li>It barely even works.</li>
            <li>but it barely did anything.</li>
            <li>That was in March 2015,  It barely lasted 6 months before the foil went belly up</li>
            <li>gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a card carrying blade razor guy since I was old enough to shave.  </li>
            <li>it is practically useless plus it&#x27;s only good for people who keeps a regularly shaving</li>
            <li>Very sharp, very fast motor.</li>
            <li>the first time this happened ,the bladed went down the drain .</li>
            <li>You never have to worry about soldering new batteries into the unit like the more expensive shavers since it just takes AA&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>So, between now and when the second set of batteries get low I have to find a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>so much I wanted to have a exra one if something happen to the other one .  </li>
            <li>With such care they last as much as twice as long.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a replacement screen, but at this price, the whole thing is cheaper than other model&#x27;s replacements, so just ordered another one.</li>
            <li>Within minutes of use, my face felt irritated and upon inspection, I noticed small cuts... from an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the foil starts to get very hot after two or three minutes of shaving.</li>
            <li>wow,incredible performance.i really into it.highly recomended not just for emergency shaving but also for  shaving spots that other well known shave&#x27;s often miss them.  </li>
            <li>Although noisy and a bit slow, it&#x27;s OK for its low price -- except for long whiskers.  </li>
            <li>It probably wont work well with thick beards but for thin it will work great.  </li>
            <li>The shave is not as smooth as I would like, and have to repeat it over some areas ( such as chin and underneath jaw line) as I said this is just an extra when i&#x27;m too lazy to shave properly.</li>
            <li>Save your money, it isn&#x27;t worth the very, very little it costs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a $10 item, worth no more than that.</li>
            <li>The razor really sings the first two shaves, but it stars slowing down a little on the third shave.  </li>
            <li>Due to price it is a decent unit.</li>
            <li>My beard isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li>Provides a good shave and much less expensive than having to replace the screen on the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bulky, the plastic cover does not stay on very well and the foil is not replacable, but what to you expect for this price.  </li>
            <li>This little razor works really well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However,  the brand new Remington does not even shave close when new,  and it is not much better than the  Panasonic at its age even though the latter has been used over 150 times.</li>
            <li>I do not have a tough beard, but it gets it plenty smooth.</li>
            <li>You may need to go over certain spots a few times at different angles to get everything</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great price and delivery time</li>
            <li> Best shaver for the price gives a nice close shave</li>
            <li> any gals reading this the Remington would make a great birthday gift for the man in your life.</li>
            <li> So I just ordered one of my own, and I saved myself over $100 by not buying another Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Best shaver for the money, comparable to many non-disposable.  </li>
            <li> works great as good as my electric.</li>
            <li> He says they are all mostly junk, but this is the best value out there.</li>
            <li> No frills, just a nice close shave every morning for 10 bucks!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the best, but it doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as the best either.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how good it works for the price.  </li>
            <li> This shaver fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned this would be cheap and breakable with the price but its actually perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is good.</li>
            <li> He says it works great and gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a good, lightweight razor and got one of these based on the feedback of others here at amazon.</li>
            <li> - it tells me where I&#x27;ve done a good jow shaving and which spots I&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li> I suppose for $10 this is a fair product.</li>
            <li> All electric razors will miss a whisker here and there, but I find this razor does a good job.</li>
            <li> This one makes a good difference in shaving face and moustache area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a low-priced shaver to carry with me for the days when I forget to shave before leaving the house, and saw this one, saw that the reviews were good, and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life.  </li>
            <li> The Remington 140 is good for nothing.</li>
            <li> It was a good thing I bought three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it shaves as good as $160.00 electric razor.</li>
            <li> It shaves fairly well including the neck area.  </li>
            <li> It worked well for 3 months - probably almost as good as the Panasonic, although it was noisy w quite a bit of vibration.  </li>
            <li> It does shave fairly close to your skin so result is good.</li>
            <li> It weighs almost nothing and has a good handle feel.</li>
            <li> good value for the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for travel/camping or as a back-up.  </li>
            <li> This is a good, reliable value.  </li>
            <li> As Seen On TV one) and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does a good job and runs off of AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Just buy a good set pr rechargable batteries</li>
            <li> It is meant to be a disposable product, since the blades are not replaceable, but the unit is usually good for about a year.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just so good.</li>
            <li> It did shave good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> good every day.</li>
            <li> He loved it and so when the foil was damaged, I sent him another</li>
            <li> This just did not work good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Switch is tricky, but good for preventing accidental triggers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for an overnite kit</li>
            <li> Get a good close shave while on the go.</li>
            <li> work good but foil brocked in 1 week</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> It not work very fine!</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had the greatest success with rechargeable battery life.  </li>
            <li> i was glad to find a shaver by a name brand like Remington for a great price.  </li>
            <li> This is not as good as a $100-150 razor but for the price it is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for cleaning yourself up between getting a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Not something I would use every day but for days when you need to multitask and still get to work clean shaven, this shaver is ideal.     </li>
            <li> I received this very fast and it wirks great!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy a &amp;70+ shaver!</li>
            <li> I have never found a better battery powered shaver than this!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor !!</li>
            <li> Just bought three more of them!</li>
            <li> I love this razor!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Great value, works fine.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing value for the money.</li>
            <li> They are great for keeping my head smooth and shiny while on location.</li>
            <li> Amazing razor,especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I bought on a year ago and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> At $9.99 and free prime shipping, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the price...</li>
            <li> Does a nice job for the touch ups or in-between razor shaves.</li>
            <li> He is thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> I now own two of these.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave for the price.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> Plus You have to buy a foil as well if you use that kind.</li>
            <li> This is as good as any of the more expensiove electric razors out there.  </li>
            <li> Its heavier and fits nicely into the palm</li>
            <li> The most surprising part is the price.</li>
            <li> Handy for travel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased multiple replacements because for the price, weight, and performance it is a great value and perfect for trips.</li>
            <li> just make sure you put in good batteries</li>
            <li> As good as the traveling Shaveman was this shaver gives you a better shave.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased for my choosing and hope to by more products</li>
            <li> Quite easy to buy 1 or 2, put it in your car and travel kit and have something tolerably good for shaving while driving or for emergencies.     </li>
            <li> Works great for a quick touch up at the end of the day or while traveling.  </li>
            <li> For a $10 item, its really good, its got a powerful motor, gives a good close shave.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job and easy to use since it is battery powered</li>
            <li> Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent</li>
            <li> This shaver is also very strong for a battery shaver...</li>
            <li> Keep good batteries in it, and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Great smooth,comfortable shave, Easy to use, batteries easy to change, The shaver very easy to cleanlong life with AA batteries,convenient.</li>
            <li> Also, as I have very fair skin, a gentle shave in required and</li>
            <li> I used a Remington MSC-140 travel shaver on a vacation and liked it better than my triple-head Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was cheap (disposable) and it did a tolerably good job.   </li>
            <li> So far after a week its great!   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you need a massage, but it doesn&#x27;t shave worth beans.</li>
            <li> If you want a shaver that is handy and cheap, this is it!</li>
            <li> It does not have a sideburn trimmer like the old Shaveman, but it is a great shaver!</li>
            <li> OK for good light or for a couple of days,</li>
            <li> This shaver is great for a quick clean shave before the shower or in the car on your way to work!</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> HE SAID IT IS GOOD FOR A QUICK TOUCH UP</li>
            <li> The shaver is good for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> So it is fine for that kind of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this daily,but its just great to have for certain situations.</li>
            <li> for a better shaver</li>
            <li> If you use the latest Gillette razor, you&#x27;ll spend $50 for replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Most of them will be discarded in landfills, where whatever toxic materials contained within will eventually leak into the water table.  </li>
            <li> as many electrics do.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> one of most of the others, but</li>
            <li> For what this is, at the price it is, I was extremely pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> It performs as well or better than any Braun, etc.</li>
            <li> Works better than shavers 5-10X the price.</li>
            <li> I would like to see a trimmer &amp; a better cover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, just using this razor for inconspicuous facial hair for which it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I value my time and money more than picking up the lady-kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> Use to get this at Walmart, so glad could find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works better than many battery razors three or four times the price.</li>
            <li> so I was hoping it would be okay for travel</li>
            <li> MSC-140 better than all others, it shaves closer and quicker.</li>
            <li> I have a rather unusual need for a gentle but effective shaver and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just bought a couple more.</li>
            <li> in all, the lack of a beard trimmer and the throwaway nature of the product prevent me from giving a better review.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This shaver won&#x27;t take anything off that is more than a couple millimeters.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year power user of electric shavers, and many years of those with Remington microscreen shavers.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered, so I don&#x27;t need to worry about carrying a charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does an OK job at shaving.</li>
            <li> But it shaves much better than a $10 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was leary to buy this one because I couldn&#x27;t see it in store, but I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Its not as good as the Panasonic, but for occasional use its great, and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the neck area is always better to use a disposable one, but thats in my case.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m traveling mostly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just so much better on every level.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find this product on line.</li>
            <li> It is more convinient than the recharge type of shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave every day, so this might work better if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> And outstanding value.</li>
            <li> Sure the Braun gave a closer shave</li>
            <li> what I like even more is it works on my NiMH rechargeable batteries where the Braun would not.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t handle anything more than a day or two&#x27;s growth.    </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll probably keep buying more of these.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is lightweight and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> But I expect more from a Remington shaver.  </li>
            <li> Both the top and the bottom foil must be touching your face at all times.  </li>
            <li> this is a nice cheap razor.</li>
            <li> It has two foil/cutters that do a better job than the titanium turbo could.  </li>
            <li> Better than any electric razor I have used.  </li>
            <li> But better then you might suspect for the price.</li>
            <li> I order these for someone else and they love them.</li>
            <li> I suggest ordering more then one at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying two now because I can&#x27;t find them at Walmart any more.</li>
            <li> So much better than rechargeables.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve paid more for replacement foils...)</li>
            <li> Shaves nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads cost more than the razor itself.</li>
            <li> He thinks he is looking better every day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you try, it will leave the stubble on your face and  you will never get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy something that&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li> I ordered 5 more for family and friends.  </li>
            <li> but there are no parts available for it anywhere!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> It performs much better.  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> It will probably workout cheaper to spend more $ on a better quality shaver.</li>
            <li> A razor that ran on two AA batteries with no need to charge anything just pop in a fresh set of batteries and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> ,I LOVE</li>
            <li> I just ordered 4 more.</li>
            <li> I found I was using the shaver more than the blade</li>
            <li> Make no mistake about it, this is a throwaway razor, as its&#x27; blades cannot be replaced, so you may want to order more than one.  </li>
            <li> but many say electric shavers need to grow on you so still waiting for it to not burn but gets the job done</li>
            <li> We are pleased with this item, but have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> I also coupled it with pre-electric shave to get an even better shave as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I must have ordered many of them before.</li>
            <li> I am not only impressed with the shaver, but the cost, size and weight.</li>
            <li> Buy a 20 buck Braun M90, much better choice.</li>
            <li> Granted, I do not have a heavy beard, but for me this is a good razor at an excellent price.  </li>
            <li> great shave for a really inexpensive shaver</li>
            <li> Love the shaver for this price</li>
            <li> many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would therefore recommend the  Panasonic for 4.00 more.</li>
            <li> When the screens give up the ghost after a year or more, I just toss them out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Shaves better than any electric I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> AN OK SHAVER</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad</li>
            <li> Love the product...</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job and the price is very cheap.</li>
            <li> A good pair of Lithium batteries for long life and this shaver has performed great.      </li>
            <li> but they just never gave me the kind of clean, close shave</li>
            <li> HANDY FOR CAMPING ON TRIPS AND VACATION LIGHT AND EASY ON BATTERIES USED IT ON A TRIP FOR TWO WEEKS</li>
            <li> When you shave with it it does a pretty good job</li>
            <li> It makes you feel touching a very light and cheap item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little shaver to use in a pinch, and it&#x27;s great for taking on the road.</li>
            <li> Although no electric I have ever used is as close, or as comfortable as a razor with blades, after lathering with a good brush using hot water and shaving soap, this is an excellent razor for occasional use.  </li>
            <li> I shaved very quickly, maybe 5 min at most.</li>
            <li> It also comes in handy when I have an evening engagement as I can do a quick touch up shave to make me presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A super light-weight Remington shaver at a great price, and so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> cleans up the stubble very good and in such a hurry.</li>
            <li> Why would you ever want to buy an electric shaver when you can purchase this ecologically sound product at more than 1/3 the cost?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a cheap shaver, not too much more you can say than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it took more work and wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable is the MSC-140.</li>
            <li> a nice, cheap grooming tool with great results with short stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best of all,the battery life is longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Really Remington and Wahl are the value leaders in shaving in my opinion with shavers that lack the Braun type of detail but give as good</li>
            <li> Why spend 5 to 10 times as much on rechargeable electric razors when this gives every bit as good of a shave?  </li>
            <li> Hello, Fast shippment, item arrived as description, good quality.</li>
            <li> A really good portable shaver with a very good price in a small package that is easy to pack for trips.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave and is easy to clean and lubricate (it was a chore to clean and lubricate the Norelco triple-head).  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is the perfect shaver for me.</li>
            <li> Better than expected,  Very good.</li>
            <li> Plus I have moles on my face that are easy to cut.</li>
            <li> The plastic cover for the head comes off way too easily.  </li>
            <li> An easy recommendation for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a battery razor.</li>
            <li> It falls off easily, and since it contains the cleaning brush expect to lose that part in a hotel</li>
            <li> The on/off switch of convieniently located on the underside of the razor and is easily worked with the thumb.</li>
            <li> so it packs easily for travel.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these electric razors for a year and it is easy on batteries (AAx2.)</li>
            <li> the batteries are easy to buy anywhere</li>
            <li> He loves it and says the shave is close and easy to operate without charging like others.</li>
            <li> so it can be easily damaged if you put it in your Dopp kit withouth protecting it somehow.</li>
            <li> Compact easy to use</li>
            <li> the past, I had a very nice compact (about the size of a wallet) foil razor (don&#x27;t remember the brand, but do think it was Braun) that did a wonderful job, and was very compact and light.</li>
            <li> Average share at best.</li>
            <li> 4 star average rating... $10... sounds great right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if you do not want close shave , can&#x27;t get new blades for it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> so this shaver is fine to me.</li>
            <li> But, since I just use it when traveling, it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine, just does not have the trimmer that I needed.</li>
            <li> So light weight and so easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> still works fine though.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li> but it is fine.  </li>
            <li> Does a fine job.</li>
            <li> fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine if you shave every day.  </li>
            <li> The shaver held up fine until I nicked the screen somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mother in law loves these for quick touch up in the nursing home!  </li>
            <li> Still, as far as electric shavers go, this one is great to keep in the briefcase or glove box for a quick touch up.  </li>
            <li> If you use 2 AA Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable Batteries for more than 2 weeks of great shave from single charge.</li>
            <li> For a cheap shaver it works very well for a quick shave well worth the money great value would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This little gem has to be one of THE best electric razor values out there!!</li>
            <li> This is the best little electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> As long as you have good batteries in it, it works quite well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t complain, but I am going to give you a review that is accurate unlike the rest of these.</li>
            <li> Hubby uses everyday &amp; will be perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> Cheap not made with standards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric shaver for quite a while now...did not buy it as a primary shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great low price</li>
            <li> It is not at all as cheap looking or feeling as some shavers in the $60-80 range.  </li>
            <li> The switch is already going out, but hey, it&#x27;s so cheap, right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can get about 8-10 months out of one, and then I  just replace it as there are no cutters  available.</li>
            <li> He is serving our country in Iraq and water isn&#x27;t always available for shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lightly bearded and, for me, it runs for weeks on 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and light weight</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Cheap construction</li>
            <li> but it still doesn&#x27;t give that smooth shave that is wanted.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the razor</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s  Cheap.  </li>
            <li> The Remington short cut is great for body hair and short/tight hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I bought three (to get free shipping).  </li>
            <li> (I have a light beard).</li>
            <li> This can easily be a primary razor</li>
            <li> I am thinking of buying another one of these just in case and they are so cheap in price.</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law liked it so much he bought one.</li>
            <li> AA batts are cheap, so I dont mind.</li>
            <li> enjoy and keep one in the car to shave on the way to work</li>
            <li> But NO screen replacement is available.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start off by saying that this is not a recommendation:  I never could recommend any electric shaver, being a confirmed blade user.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver for travel or daily use.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I use this as my primary razor.</li>
            <li> No shaver will cut hair that cannot enter the foil.&lt;br /&gt;The foil guard doesn&#x27;t snap on securely.</li>
            <li> great for use on private areas.</li>
            <li> I got it just as a cheap way to do a touch-up between shaves and</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again if it was on sale for a penny and had free shipping.</li>
            <li> Shave is close &amp; comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver, use, and clean.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.  </li>
            <li> no matter where you go, battery always available no need to bring adapter as you travel  from country to country.</li>
            <li> I use the lotion before shaving and this thing glides over my face and gives me an amazingly smooth shave with no missed stuble.</li>
            <li> plastic body looks cheap.</li>
            <li> I use Enelope AA rechargeable batteries and (with light use of the Remington)</li>
            <li> My very first original Microscreen was an excellent shaver, but the NI-CAD batteries in it died and were not readily replaceable.</li>
            <li> It looks identical to the old one but not as well made, and it does not perform quite as good.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very handy for traveling, especially in our camper.  </li>
            <li> Even with stubbles of hair, it shaves clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about how effective it is, seriously not</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this shaver if you need to keep something handy around for travel.</li>
            <li> , you better believe it&#x27;s getting replaced with an exact replica.</li>
            <li> I was able to get that first month of use out of one set of batteries.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I used to buy a version of this razor from time to time, in Walmart, under some off brand from China.    </li>
            <li> I was really glad to find another one here on Amazon, for when the first one wears out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So long as it lasts over 6 months this is a great value.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It gives a great shave, and the battery life is surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what to expect when I originally ordered this electric razor.  </li>
            <li> recommend using this shaver, to keep stubble at a minimum and to maintain a great look, however if your hair gets a bit long, a trimmer or the barbershop would be recommended.</li>
            <li> , I did notice the price went up significantly, nah</li>
            <li> Great shave and runs a long time on two AA rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I stay clean now</li>
            <li> It took a couple passes to get a clean shave as I would expect for a foil shaver.      </li>
            <li> Of course it cannot give you a clean shave like razors</li>
            <li> Also, I have never gotten any sort of cut or burn from it -- at most a very very mild tingling in places where I was particularly aggressive.    </li>
            <li> but I just clean it up with a blade if needed.</li>
            <li> The device is powered by 2 AA batteries which when paired with the razor head give a reasonably clean shave.</li>
            <li> This razor gives for smooth shaves, quickly.</li>
            <li> and when you go to clean the blades out with the bursh they fall out .</li>
            <li> Gets a SMOOTH finish QUICKLY.  </li>
            <li> You can shave so quick and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always able to get a very close, smooth shave without suffering any cuts or scrapes.</li>
            <li> Powerful  and easy to clean,easy to handle</li>
            <li> Clean blades after each use.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li> because I always put freshly charged batteries in, but either way, its strong.</li>
            <li> read many positive reviews of this, and was hoping that this would replace my need to purchase manual blades.</li>
            <li> Thought the   constant smooth, close shaves were too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I purchased for a cheap price and got way more than expected, very Satisfied</li>
            <li> Just a little slower than my Norelco at home, but the shave is very good.</li>
            <li> The ergonomics are great and I love this better than shavers that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money, and works great, as long as you don&#x27;t mind using up AA batteries.</li>
            <li> They do a good job for a daily shave!</li>
            <li> It can be as good as a blade when used often enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so superior to my regular shaver that I use it almost all the time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver based on the numerous reviews that stated that this thing was just as good as a full sized and full priced electric shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , each are good at different trimming tasks.</li>
            <li> It does not do quite as good a job as the prior one</li>
            <li> I bought this as a back up because it is so good</li>
            <li> really surprised,shaves better than a eighty dollar razor that i had tried,wish it was rechargable</li>
            <li> full time home razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a full on beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing, but not by a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great value -- idea for a travel razer, shaver for the car (but be careful) or for those quick touch-ups</li>
            <li> I leave this in my car or sometimes pack it when I want to travel light, Not quite as good as my Norelco but at literally one tenth the cost a pretty close second.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to pop a second set of batteries in while charging the first set.</li>
            <li> but the foil tends to wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a quick way for my HWP to get a quick shave in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Quick tip:</li>
            <li> That was a lucky day.</li>
            <li> Use it for quick shaves and evening touchup.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed enough with the quality of shave, and especially the price, to get another when the foil disintegrated.</li>
            <li> And yes, a trimmer would be nice but come on; if you really need a trimmer you should buy a real trimmer anyway.</li>
            <li> Good for travel (light, uses AA which you probably already carry when traveling), not really a replacement for home/daily use.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, I wish the foils would last longer, but its meant to be a disposable product so all in all, I am pleased</li>
            <li> It just takes too many passes to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> Luckily for me my credit card refunded my money and I shipped this piece of junk to them.</li>
            <li> When I need a quick shave, all I do is reach in my office desk drawer or in my carry-on bag and shave away.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly but didn&#x27;t include two batteries as claimed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that into electric razors, but this seems adequate.</li>
            <li> I have tryed most of the high priced razors and I like the Remington</li>
            <li> I normally just pull off the top and bang it on the sink.  </li>
            <li> Pretty smooth results.</li>
            <li> The razor is great but head only last for a month or so, that is why I have bought so many razors.</li>
            <li> Good shave, holds a charge, doesnt take long to charge.</li>
            <li> Even the 1 year old shaver is still working, though takes more pressure to do a clean cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not having to pack a special charger, and 2 AA batteries actually last a while in it.</li>
            <li> My New favorite ...</li>
            <li> So I bought a new Microscreen which worked well for me for many years until the batteries in it also died.</li>
            <li> If you think nothing of buying a $150 shaver every 2 years then this shaver is a better deal and you get new heads with each shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 7/27/14 - ok the foil on the new one detached as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used to shaving in the shower in order to get a closer shave, but the Titanium did every bit as good a job dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of electric shavers before and this one is actually pretty good with a low price.</li>
            <li> It is good for traveling or for a backup at work or in your car, if you need a dry shave on the go.</li>
            <li> Great little</li>
            <li> It has a little brush included with the cover which works great for cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> This is really a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> I searched around and came across this one, and for $10, it&#x27;s a great little razor that I have used a lot in the 1 month that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver to use between shaves.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver.</li>
            <li> The plastic cover doesn&#x27;t fit real well.  </li>
            <li> In addition, two AA batteries last an amazing length of time.</li>
            <li> Gives me a very close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> An amazing razor for only $10.</li>
            <li> Shaves unusually smooth and fast.  </li>
            <li> now I stay fresh.</li>
            <li> I just hope Remington continues to make this nice travel shaver (of which I said I now use daily).  </li>
            <li> I had used that one for several years and liked it.  </li>
            <li> I do think it is as good as electrics costing several times as much money.</li>
            <li> I liked it back then for one reason:</li>
            <li> I took this to Europe with a fresh battery but abandoned it in favor of razor blade.  </li>
            <li> Being loud is actually ok</li>
            <li> I used freshly charged Eneloops and had no problems.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth $5.00 IMO.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought I would be able to use it when I don&#x27;t have time to shave the old fashioned  way.  </li>
            <li> However, I would not buy it again to hack off three days worth of growth in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Not even useful for travel.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly powerful...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for travelling and working as expected.</li>
            <li> but I got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> old grandson to keep him looking handsome.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Powerful with rechargeable batteries, and Handy for big hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> worth the 10$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was worth the purchase price and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remington should refocus their efforts if this is a product they claim is worth my time and money.</li>
            <li> For those who complain about it not cutting anything beyond a days beard growth, well, ever heard of pre-electric shave?</li>
            <li> nice close shave to get especially when traveling!</li>
            <li> For a very economical appliance, it delivers very satisfactory performance.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, just like my many other Remington shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> My older model Remington still works fine but</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;m married with a newborn; I&#x27;m quickly closing in on 40.</li>
            <li> The cutters are affixed which actually makes it better to clean with the supplemented brush in the headguard.    </li>
            <li> thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being extremely affordable, it does a really good job of shaving.  </li>
            <li> i love this shaver , it is very portable, i have one at work and another at home,  not expensive,  delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> It is helpful for those days when I miss a spot or want a touch up if I am going out right after work.  </li>
            <li> I can easily use this for a year without having to buy a new one, the price cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li> The batteries do hold up well and it does a decent job of cleaning up a light beard.</li>
            <li> All in all, if you needed something in an Emergency, or want to clean up some 5 o&#x27;clock shadow before heading out to dinner from the office, and found this on a store shelf, then it&#x27;s reasonable for $10.  </li>
            <li> It does a pretty close shave pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The small razor is a great buy, I bought two</li>
            <li> good shaver, I have bought 2 so far, they last about 8 months if you use it every day but still worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, handy little shaver.</li>
            <li> For what it is ---a low cost shaver--- this little shaver is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> But for most other shavers, a replacement screen costs more than this whole shaver.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s cheap, but come on, it&#x27;s only been a month, but again, it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> I use an old toothbrush to quickly and effectively clean the heads after each shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus usual Amazon great service and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The cap does tend to come off, the power switch is a bit soft but overall a good value.</li>
            <li> I have several different makes and prices of elect razors.</li>
            <li> this does that nicely, even for the more delicate areas.</li>
            <li> For ten bucks each I more than get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap but it definitely is not made cheaply.</li>
            <li> Gives an adequate shave which is surprising since it is powered be two AA batteries and has a small shaving surface.  </li>
            <li> The unit got hot fairly quickly, but very close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor does not irritate the skin and shaves very, very, close.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> very very close shave.</li>
            <li> The batteries die very fast.</li>
            <li> It gets clogged very fast as well.</li>
            <li> My previous Remington shaver have been far more cost effective that $75.00 per year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First pair of batteries didn&#x27;t work, but they work fine on my 15 years old Hitachi BM-5200.</li>
            <li> This is a very surprising product that out-performs far more expensive shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that any electric razor needs to be more than 10 bucks if this one can do such a great job.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying one of the higher end models, give this thing a try.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to a blade, you&#x27;ll most likely get razor burn the first time you use an electric.    </li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s inexpensive price he is not concerned if he loses it, it does a great job and it doesn&#x27;t take up alot of room.</li>
            <li> The first one served me well for over three years.  </li>
            <li> The reason the first one broke was because I dropped it on a tile floor, bending the foil screen cover.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this is my first purchase of an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> The first one I bought was at Kmart but thay no longer sell these.</li>
            <li> Beats the N______ that cost me ten times more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco triple heads, Braun pockets, and Panasonic ES4025 (best, but the battery finally failed; they don&#x27;t make these anymore).  </li>
            <li> I am glad they continue to make this same shaver.</li>
            <li> My first one, the foil got damaged somehow.</li>
            <li> This shaver is lightweight, easy to clean, fairly quiet and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The slow-down doesn&#x27;t affect it&#x27;s performance too much, but if it were rechargeable, it would be freshly charged and singing on every shave.  </li>
            <li> Better than the regular electric razors I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money and so reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I believe that is the first place I  bought this shaver for him years ago.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> If one buys it, I hope you will be at least as happy as I have been.</li>
            <li> on, man, really!?</li>
            <li> Just won&#x27;t handle coarse beard or more than a day&#x27;s growth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomend this razor !!</li>
            <li> Better to allow an owner to use the unit, replacing the blade and screen set as necessary, unti</li>
            <li> I had purchased this same one 2 or more years ago for my son.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my electric shaver but is good enough to get rid of my early evening stubble so that it doesn&#x27;t show much.  </li>
            <li> The shaver does exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 3-5 years.</li>
            <li> It does a reasonably good job at it&#x27;s intended purpose and so far as achieved a long battery life.  </li>
            <li> Also, if I forget to shave for a few days, it does a good job of shortening my beard to make my manual blade shaving</li>
            <li> but still you are getting a very good shave for very little money, less then replacing the foil / cutter or heads of most any brand shaver even after the cost of batteries.  </li>
            <li> The only thing he would have liked is if the new rezor had a pop out trimmer.</li>
            <li> Take responsibility Remington and TRY to provide a product that is worth more than One Single Star.</li>
            <li> Feels very cheap, which of course it is, but really not even worth what I paid ($10).</li>
            <li> Keep it handy, it does as well as a large 120V shaver, and as close as a wet razor.</li>
            <li> I see several people had issues with it not lasting that long but after using about 6 months now I&#x27;m very happy with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom-line: This is a no-nonsense product that&#x27;s a great alternative to the expensive shavers since it&#x27;s cheap and works well.</li>
            <li> Great travel razor that shaves, at least for me very well.  </li>
            <li> Obviously it shouldn&#x27;t be the only thing you use, but it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> most cheap razors in the past-i&#x27;ve thrown away after a few uses-bad shaves plus razor burn.</li>
            <li> The party it was purchased for liked it well enough to ask for a direct replacement.</li>
            <li> It is fairly inexpensive and worth investing in at least a couple of them.</li>
            <li> Until the foil falls out these two foil shavers are far better than the single foil cheap throw away shavers.  </li>
            <li> When my original broke after about 18 months of fairly consistent use, I decided the 12 bucks was worth spending on something that did the job and saved me the cost of constantly using blades.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Ditto\\&quot;, to all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Why all the positive comments on this razer?</li>
            <li> The head cover is pretty lacking (it doesn&#x27;t really stay on),</li>
            <li> All in all, this has been one of the better purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> It shaves fairly close and comes with a small cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> This travel shaver works better than almost all of the electric shavers I have previously used--I use it almost every day and continue to be amazed at how close and quickly it works for me.  </li>
            <li> Also, the head is too broad for maintaining any kind of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Not the closest shave in the world, especially compared to a blade, but it does a very respectable job in short order.  </li>
            <li> Let me first say, my facial hair is medium to light.</li>
            <li> I got it for a quick, shave when I forget to shave, and for when,  old</li>
            <li> Only problem I have had is the switch placement makes it easy to accidentally turn off while shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries once in 6 months, and this second set is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Shaves close and the batteries last a good, long time.</li>
            <li> Batteries last for a long time and a good shave.</li>
            <li> I certainly have no complaints about it and would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Also has a large head for a faster shave.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and small, yet does as good a job shaving as his regular at-home razor.  </li>
            <li> However this MSC-140 is only good if you shave 2 or 3 times a day as it will not cut a very long hair.</li>
            <li> The fact that is it AA-battery powered makes it snag and pull less than more powerful shavers.</li>
            <li> I have a $2 tiny single foil that runs off a AAA battery that does as good of a job as this, but takes longer.</li>
            <li> If you can accept that you are paying $10 for a shaver that you will likely replace again in half a year, then you will be more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> This actually makes it kind of good for shaving your neck -- if you do that every day, it will only shave off the short hairs and leave the long ones alone.    </li>
            <li> Handy little travel razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a handy little brush for cleaning that&#x27;s stored in the protective cover.  </li>
            <li> , the Remington would not run fast enough using rechargeable (fully so) batteries, which work fine in the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how they make such a great razor for so little money.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t get very close even when there isn&#x27;t much on your face.</li>
            <li> I guess if you don&#x27;t want a very close shave</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just AAs though, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes the Remmington razor.  </li>
            <li> The Remington MSC-140 is much cheaper than the Norelco and the head lasts about a year.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I need and the price makes it a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Having been a blade man all my life, I found myself needing the ability of a fast \\&quot;clean-up\\&quot; from time to time.  </li>
            <li> While on vacation, I went 3 days without shaving and then decided to give the Remington a real life test even though I had my trusty razor in my shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s honesty in this instance is commendable, but it nothing to allay my annoyance that in this day and age of economic turmoil, resource depletion, and environmental degradation, short-lifespan devices like this are still being made.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an earlier version of a travel shaver that is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> (manual razor blade for that really close shave).</li>
            <li> This has been my primary shaver since July of last year.  </li>
            <li> I keep it in the office or in the car and it works very well for those occasions.  </li>
            <li> However, unless you are just entering puberty and starting the shaving experience, this should not be your primary shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of those for ~ one month, and it is very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> but I am Asia, I don&#x27;t have much beard</li>
            <li> (Really, it&#x27;s probably about a 3 star device, in my book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to last for 6 months - with the light usage it&#x27;s getting, who knows.  </li>
            <li> satisfied with the money I spent.</li>
            <li> Husband said it snagged too much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not replaceable, but for $10 for the whole shaver, I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t really shave well at all, on any part of my face.  </li>
            <li> All in all, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s an investment, but you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> (the twin foils/blades seem to really make a difference).</li>
            <li> Mine is not broken</li>
            <li> On every trip he raves about the convenience of this razor and thanks me again for finding it for him.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect much for 10 bucks</li>
            <li> Like all electric razors, if you decide to do a Grizzly Adams and let yuour beard grow, this won&#x27;t be much help.  </li>
            <li> Really just one.  </li>
            <li> Price is reasonable so it&#x27;s not costly to replace.</li>
            <li> It costs almost twice as much as the razor to replace the shaving head and screen.  </li>
            <li> A real performer.  </li>
            <li> cuts reasonably close, takes rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li> Really close shave.</li>
            <li> I does not work at all and will not even cut straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It shaves really well</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I call on Amazon to remove item before it really hurts someone.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> While this unit is light weight, it&#x27;s not exactly tiny.  </li>
            <li> But, for the price, it is convenient and do the job for me, since I don&#x27;t have that much mustache.</li>
            <li> but it grows fast.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> very close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Cuts real close</li>
            <li> If only I could get screens that fit.</li>
            <li> So this shaver isn&#x27;t very durable.</li>
            <li> But turns out I&#x27;d pushed in the batteries too much.</li>
            <li> This is as good if not better !</li>
            <li> I also purchased a more expensive (much more) Panasonic, and while I am pleased with it, it is only a little better than the Remington.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a few hairs here and there,  but does a pretty good job overall.</li>
            <li> A couple of months later I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Remington travel shavers for a number of years, and this is the third edition I&#x27;m familiar with.  </li>
            <li> This cheap little toy keeps me from full shaves on the weekend.</li>
            <li> Have to go over and over and over the same spot for a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a clean shave and if you have a lot of facial hair</li>
            <li> As usual the Norelco did a great job, but it does irritate my face and that&#x27;s why I was looking for something different.</li>
            <li> i even use it to clean up my back side</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll eventually open it to clean out under the foil.</li>
            <li> would recommend rechargeable batteries to keep it going strong longer, but keep in mind that NiMh batteries gradually loose their charge when not in use.</li>
            <li> works good on my beard (your mileage my vary as this seems to be very individual) - one less thing to charge-</li>
            <li> Ok as very cheap--used a couple times decided not to take on trip as much less satisfactory compared with Remington rechargeable used at home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 so far and keep them in different places for easy access.</li>
            <li> Cost a lot less than regular shavers and does as good a job.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe what a great job this little cheapo did on my dry face!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to be a great purchase, but at least the price was low.</li>
            <li> It is very good for a quick emergency shave but not good to take on vacation for shaving everyday as I did.</li>
            <li> This little device works great - if there&#x27;s not much hair there to begin with.  </li>
            <li> But since they warranty the damn thing for a year, you can get a whole new razor under warranty.  </li>
            <li> Another pair of new batteries worked, but very weak.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than a travel rotary razor purchased previous to this one.</li>
            <li> This shaver does perform adequately, but to my immense chagrin, the package stated that no replacement foils or blades are made for this model.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great value to at least try BEFORE you spend $70</li>
            <li> Decent shave if used every day.    </li>
            <li> so this serves me well for a quick 1-2 minutes shave on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have been using these shavers as my main shaver for a number of years</li>
            <li> Does not shave as closely as a blade but does a decent job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it functions at a decent level, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for it&#x27;s product category.  </li>
            <li> Above instructions apply to most shavers especially foil type shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was amazed in the fact that it provided a decent shave.</li>
            <li> am soooo...pleased with this shaver, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> In his words, &amp;#34;I highly recommend this Remington Foil Travel Shaver.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shaver...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend,also for spare part&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this razor.</li>
            <li> i highly recomend it.  </li>
            <li> It misses less hair then the faster model and based on using it every day, it works just fine (for a multi day growth, the other one works better).  </li>
            <li> Could use a little more power</li>
            <li> I love them little thing.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I purchased this little</li>
            <li> Given the large size for a travel razor, and double foil, I expected a better shave.   </li>
            <li> Great little razor for about 10 bucks, beats the way more expensive brands in my opinion, yup</li>
            <li> This shaver actually costs less than replacing the blades alone for most electric shavers!  </li>
            <li> For me it is not, but for ten dollars it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> The product kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance rates 5 stars, but length of service is only worth 1 Star, so I give this shaver 2 Stars.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong, and the shave it gives is pretty darn good too.  </li>
            <li> Worth it for the low price.</li>
            <li> Normally I would say &amp;</li>
            <li> , beware that some rechargeable AA batteries are just slightly too large to fit.</li>
            <li> When you put it back, make sure you&#x27;re holding down the two buttons you used to take it off in the first place.</li>
            <li> than I&#x27;ve owned in the past AND you can easily take it with you!</li>
            <li> I have thick whiskers and never had one cut so quick and as smooth as this one.</li>
            <li> Then I put this new disposable to the test, to clean up those loose ends.  </li>
            <li> A decent, comfortable shave, works with my rechargeables and cheaper than replacing the cutter and screen on an expensive model, what&#x27;s not to love about that?</li>
            <li> and as I only use it occasionally, it suites me just fine.</li>
            <li> With enough time, this razor will do a pretty decent job.  </li>
            <li> I get no gain from what I say, other than I enjoy sharing my experience.</li>
            <li> An old toothbrush works better for cleaning the blades than the dinky little cleaning brush that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li> Well, this $10 shaver isn&#x27;t too different than the expensive ones, performance wise, and seems to stay full power for awhile.</li>
            <li> With this, it&#x27;s $10 for a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> When you wear out the head, just purchase a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> The blades aren&#x27;t replaceable, but at this price just buy a new one when they wear out.  </li>
            <li> And every time you throw in a new set of AA batteries, it is like you have a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;d need to buy a new one as I don&#x27;t believe you can buy replacement foil (nor the shaver cutter head).</li>
            <li> You cannot get new foil screens or cutters, but at the price, that&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> If it ever gives up,i just order a new one.</li>
            <li> but should you need to use a rubber band to hold the cover on a brand new shaver?</li>
            <li> Order 2 of them, at the price point they are a terrific value and cheap enough to just leave one in car and desk.</li>
            <li> drawbacks are (1) very loud, and (2) no replacement blades or foil, so when it wears out, you just pitch it.</li>
            <li> very loud.</li>
            <li> After the Norelco was due for new blades I chucked it and bought three more Remington MSC-140 shavers to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Before the second set of batteries were discharged my first shaver broke.  </li>
            <li> Power switch has issue after months of consistent use, but it has given me a closer shave than $100+ razors of the same style.</li>
            <li> I wanted a small portable to be able to take when traveling.  </li>
            <li> first I bought one of these a couple years ago for travel but after my home shaver broke I started using as my daily shaver because it works</li>
            <li> I have probably purchased 6 or more over the past.  </li>
            <li> But overall a better shave than any of my other cord-cordless razors.</li>
            <li> Razor works very well in general.</li>
            <li> I had my first one for about 4 years with use as a daily shaver for about 1 year and combined travel time of 10 weeks over a 3 year period.  </li>
            <li> I usually get a lot of mileage out of most razors</li>
            <li> For under $9.00, I&#x27;m not sure you could ever find a more affordable electric razor.</li>
            <li> First one last me about 5 years.</li>
            <li> The little plastic cover falls off easily but you can hold it in place with a rubber band.  </li>
            <li> Runs right over those long hairs.  </li>
            <li> Once a week lightly use a standard tripple blade hand shaver after you have shaved to trim stubborn minor hair build up.</li>
            <li> so far, I&#x27;m just now replacing my first one after  a couple of years of occasional use (couple times a week).</li>
            <li> A darn good little razor that cost about half of the price of new cutters for my old razor.</li>
            <li> If you shave every day, this little shaver will do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t believe that the positive comments come from real daily users.</li>
            <li> this razor shaves relatively close with only mild razor burn.</li>
            <li> This one works better than any of them including my super duper expensive ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may seem a little under-powered, but I take my time, and get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> You could potentially use this as your only shaver if you stay consistent with shaving!</li>
            <li> I purchased two electric razors in the interim and took them both back because these little razors were actually better.  </li>
            <li> others have said, the clear plastic headguard will not stay snapped on.  </li>
            <li> As far as a close shave - only a straight blade razor would beat it.</li>
            <li> I guess they think cause it&#x27;s only a $10 shaver that people should just order a whole, complete, unit when it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too agressive on the face, and has never once irritated my skin like my old Mach 3 sometimes did.  </li>
            <li> This shaver offers a shave that is comparable to the the ShaveMan or Braun</li>
            <li> atleast so far.</li>
            <li> It is loud.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Titanium Turbo razor that I bought some 8 years ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud and uses a AA.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic used two permanently modified AAs from the factory, so this was no surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always surprised by the quality of a shave I get from this inexpensive shaver.</li>
            <li> So I started using the second shaver and just like the first one the screen let go in the same place and at almost exactly the same time.  </li>
            <li> the rubberized cover over the push-button switch wore out and am cautious not to get it near water...</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 15 year old son for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these and in both cases the foil head came apart and could not be fixed.  </li>
            <li> This one however is amazing:shaves close and fast enough.</li>
            <li> The old one still works but believe cutters are a bit worn.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit loud</li>
            <li> I replaced a 3 year old panasonic with this Remington.  </li>
            <li> I plan order at least one more for \\&quot;back-up.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I use it nearly every time I shave.</li>
            <li> My old Braun shaver was damaged and I thought I would try a Remington once again.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hairs, cut them with a trimmer first.</li>
            <li> I see a product marked &amp;#34;Remington,&amp;#34; I will move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it completely wears out.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.  </li>
            <li> the least i ask is that when you selling something make sure it works,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 80 years old.</li>
            <li> Which it is not, by far.</li>
            <li> Has a soft grip and lightweight.</li>
            <li> The foil does not seem to shave as close as the old one either.</li>
            <li> This is really kids - a total bust!</li>
            <li> ( I have an early meeting I attend</li>
            <li> However, I found that this did not provide nearly a close enough shave to be appropriate for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Good bye expensive razors.</li>
            <li> The blades and foils on it lasted longer than most of the other expensive ones I&#x27;ve had, and it shaved better than them.</li>
            <li> Williams Lectric Shave Original with Green Tea Complex - 7 oz.]], and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with a foil shaver, you know that once you get a little tear in the foil-</li>
            <li> For the price hard to beat, it is a cheap shaver so don&#x27;t set the bar to high.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon due to all the very positive reviews.</li>
            <li> You have to purchase a whole new unit and through the old unit into the nearest landfill or recycling center.  </li>
            <li> After two days I&#x27;m clean shaven except for these few stubborn hairs that keep getting longer.</li>
            <li> i would rubbed the back of my hand up and down against my cheeks, chin and neck after shaving and it felt really, really smooth, as close as my Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li> Light and small</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who needs a small, cheap, serviceable electric razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this time arrived promptly and are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> but you really need a full blown razor for serious shaving.</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t use it as my daily at-home tool, but only because it doesn&#x27;t have the power and features</li>
            <li> (On the other hand, it did run for 3 weeks on one set of batteries and did the basic shaving adequately).</li>
            <li> I tried 2 sets of brand new batteries and even tried putting them in backwards as a last ditch effort but nothing.  </li>
            <li> I use the same AA rechargeable batteries in it that I use in my digital camera, so batteries are never going to make the whole shaver unuseable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because it takes so many passes, it doesn&#x27;t really save time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not quite as smooth as a proper wet shave, which is why only 4 stars, but if you&#x27;re travelling or in a hurry, this is a nice razor that won&#x27;t steer you wrong.</li>
            <li> buy the braun pocketgo, double the price but has a REAL foil which will shave and not pull your hair, is quiet and in addition has a rounded trimmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grow much facial hair and this thing still can&#x27;t really shave properly.</li>
            <li> It only works if your facial hair is very trimmed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After several passes over the main areas with the disposable, it did give a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;However, when going over those same areas with my regular razor</li>
            <li> Works really well, I now use it instead of my more expensive electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned very nice, very expensive shavers before.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised how well this shaver works, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li> This also means you&#x27;ll never get stuck with a dead shaver in the morning - when you need it most - as long as you have extra AA&#x27;s on hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If not dissapointed at first, I will be eventually due to recharge batt</li>
            <li> and I prefer batteries because my other remington razors never could keep a charge longer than a day after the first six months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries after a year, despite using it every other day.</li>
            <li> For the cost of the other shavers, this one does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> but apparently the producer is now out of business.</li>
            <li> Cons - About double as noisy as the seven year old Norelco ($120 then) that it replaced.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but the cap does not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> Thus far it seems like it&#x27;ll last forever...</li>
            <li> All in all, for $10.00 I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> Folks, If your an adult who shaves on a daily basis, this shaver is just not going to hold up.</li>
            <li> It barely even works.</li>
            <li> but it barely did anything.</li>
            <li> That was in March 2015,  It barely lasted 6 months before the foil went belly up</li>
            <li> gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a card carrying blade razor guy since I was old enough to shave.  </li>
            <li> it is practically useless plus it&#x27;s only good for people who keeps a regularly shaving</li>
            <li> Very sharp, very fast motor.</li>
            <li> the first time this happened ,the bladed went down the drain .</li>
            <li> You never have to worry about soldering new batteries into the unit like the more expensive shavers since it just takes AA&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> So, between now and when the second set of batteries get low I have to find a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> so much I wanted to have a exra one if something happen to the other one .  </li>
            <li> With such care they last as much as twice as long.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a replacement screen, but at this price, the whole thing is cheaper than other model&#x27;s replacements, so just ordered another one.</li>
            <li> Within minutes of use, my face felt irritated and upon inspection, I noticed small cuts... from an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the foil starts to get very hot after two or three minutes of shaving.</li>
            <li> wow,incredible performance.i really into it.highly recomended not just for emergency shaving but also for  shaving spots that other well known shave&#x27;s often miss them.  </li>
            <li> Although noisy and a bit slow, it&#x27;s OK for its low price -- except for long whiskers.  </li>
            <li> It probably wont work well with thick beards but for thin it will work great.  </li>
            <li> The shave is not as smooth as I would like, and have to repeat it over some areas ( such as chin and underneath jaw line) as I said this is just an extra when i&#x27;m too lazy to shave properly.</li>
            <li> Save your money, it isn&#x27;t worth the very, very little it costs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a $10 item, worth no more than that.</li>
            <li> The razor really sings the first two shaves, but it stars slowing down a little on the third shave.  </li>
            <li> Due to price it is a decent unit.</li>
            <li> My beard isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li> Provides a good shave and much less expensive than having to replace the screen on the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bulky, the plastic cover does not stay on very well and the foil is not replacable, but what to you expect for this price.  </li>
            <li> This little razor works really well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However,  the brand new Remington does not even shave close when new,  and it is not much better than the  Panasonic at its age even though the latter has been used over 150 times.</li>
            <li> I do not have a tough beard, but it gets it plenty smooth.</li>
            <li> You may need to go over certain spots a few times at different angles to get everything</li>
            <li> Small complaint, as the shaver is cheap enough to just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, it seems like no razor can easily get to the difficult spot, and this disposable seems to do an \\&quot;average\\&quot; job on general areas, with multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Not very happy with Remington razors right mow.</li>
            <li> I tried other battery powered shavers and they don&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as this one does.  </li>
            <li> I think it COULD be a daily shaver, since daily beard maintenance means it wont have to cut any long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A classic example of mediocrity.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless if used everyday it gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t have trimmer, neither can it give a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> It does shave a little slower than a normal one.</li>
            <li> After trying the \\&quot;titanium turbo\\&quot; and it having a hard time shaving the neck area plus the foil breaking through a bit I ordered this(should of done so first but didn&#x27;t see it after the fact.)   </li>
            <li> It seems like the blades were dull from the first shave.</li>
            <li> Still on the first set of rechargables for at least 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shaver as long as you do not expect blade performance.  </li>
            <li> husband loves these, they last a long time</li>
            <li> Batteries seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts long enough on two AA batteries to take on a two week trip without worry.</li>
            <li> The aa batts last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving long hair and short hair and both do not get shaven with this &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s intended for touch-up shaving, such as before going out for dinner after a long day at the office, or before getting off of a long international flight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite stunned that this shaver last as long as it did.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time, this is my second unit purchased.  </li>
            <li> Do I expect the Remington to last as long?  </li>
            <li> The battery seem to last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It shaves close but does not last to long...</li>
            <li> Batteries seem to last about 9 long shaves.</li>
            <li> This is too high a price to pay in the long run for a little short-term convenience.</li>
            <li> Generally I&#x27;m not especially hard on my things (the ES4025 lasted 3 years w no problems), so there&#x27;s no excuse for this poor design quality.  </li>
            <li> After a month one whole side of the head sheered off despite very careful use and always covering the head before laying it down and keeping it in a case.</li>
            <li> work on very long beards but did not cut my short beard</li>
            <li> To solve some of the complaints people have:1 use a common rubber band to hold the cover on,2 after shaving lightly blow off the cuttings, 3 every three to four days clean the blades with a toothbrush (no water) and 4 when putting the cutting head on the shaver body</li>
            <li> I can not speak for  the one guy who hated it (in the reviews) but dollar for dollar, I can&#x27;t recall buying anything and getting such great value.  </li>
            <li> Last two had the screen come loose.</li>
            <li> The screen came loose and I can&#x27;t put it back.</li>
            <li> If only this shaver would last like some of the other reviews said it did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  To make them last longer EXTREME care must be taken to assure that at NO time is only on side of the foil being used.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly decent shaver for a small travel model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the performance of this little shaver.  </li>
            <li> being said, this shaver will work if you have no other razor, a few days growth, and a regular razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li> but when I was done shaving, it was hard to tell that anything was accomplished.  </li>
            <li> , the screen breaks loose from the head after a few months and Remington will not sell you a new $.50 replacement head with the screen.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never had an expensive razor, just cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Duh, highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m military and it gets plenty close enough to pass our standards.  </li>
            <li> Grey stubble is not flattering.  </li>
            <li> when* I have a long drive.  </li>
            <li> Runs a long time on just 2 batteries.</li>
            <li> I had had several rotary shavers which never really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Will NOT trim any long hairs.</li>
            <li> Takes too long to shave seems like it takes 5 to 10 minutes - after a while you will give up.</li>
            <li> I only use it since I spent my shaver budget and can&#x27;t afford another.  </li>
            <li> The batteries lasted a long time, no complaints there.  </li>
            <li> Must carry a blade razor or scissor for long hairs.</li>
            <li> To be expected with low price cordless - razor burn</li>
            <li> Also long battery life.</li>
            <li> But as long as I can order online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years, and it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Being in the military, where shaving is not optional, I have used a number of different shavers over the years.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> had it long but seems durable.</li>
            <li> I started use this product long ago, when AAFES used to sell them, Wal-Mart used to carried them.</li>
            <li> not being full power or just basic decline in performance... and some shavers are expensive.</li>
            <li> This shaver is almost as good as these past shavers, but much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I expect it will get only a few uses a year, and so the blades should stay sharp enough to last until the entire shaver gets replaced.  </li>
            <li> The cutting mechanism is somewhat slower than my other Remington, but for me, it actually shaves better.  </li>
            <li> I like how long it runs on a single set of batteries</li>
            <li> Lasts long with a single set of batteries.</li>
            <li> This is not a razor that you can expect to use quietly in the privacy of your office -- other people will hear.    </li>
            <li> We took it on a 5-1/2 week driving trip and were astonished how long the batteries lasted!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who wrote the other reviews, but I doubt they were independent voices.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers suggested, just use a regular razor blade when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, Doesn&#x27;t shave off any hairs, long or short.</li>
            <li> My husband has use several other kinds of shavers and didn&#x27;t like any of them.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for several months before it finally tore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit put off by the fact that the blades and microscreen are expected to last for only 6 months but again it&#x27;s less than $9.00.</li>
            <li> Two heads provide for a quicker shave than a single head.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> , I travel a lot and use it while traveling and have gotten up to 6 months on a single set of batteries.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small cleaning brush and a clear plastic shaver head protection cover.</li>
            <li> Has an odd cutting action that seems to miss one day then hit the next because it likes only strong hard hairs, it slides over weaker hairs like they are not there.</li>
            <li> This thing does not remove facial hair accept in spots, not worth 29 cents</li>
            <li> : The plastic foil head fits too loosely.  </li>
            <li> After 5 shaves, the screen that covers the blades came loose and could not be reattached.</li>
            <li> In a month or two, the foil [not replaceable] came loose on all three and the switch became intermittent on all three.</li>
            <li> Convenient to carry but doesn&#x27;t get down to the skin without multiple strokes.</li>
            <li> They only cost 10 dollars, but not worth it when I&#x27;m left somewhere with half a beard.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a similar shaver called a ShaveMan</li>
            <li> so I likely have a typical example of it</li>
            <li> Used this razor for about 3 months, works fine until yesterday, when half of the shaving head screen popped out rendering the shaver useless.  </li>
            <li> I tried gluing it back a few times but it didn&#x27;t hold for long.</li>
            <li> Iy was difficult to find, but the two Remington MSC-40 Shavers shavers I purchased tthen arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> When you travel you shave in bad light, and you miss some -- and once a whisker gets past a certain length this shaver can&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would last a little longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Norelco and Remington rechargeable razors and this little razor shaves me as close as any of them did.</li>
            <li> If my stubble grows past a certain length, the shaver will have trouble, missing some long hairs that have \\&quot;curved\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> My husband has this shaver in the car and uses it when he&#x27;s running late in the morning or has to go unexpected out up town.</li>
            <li> In fact I still have the same 2 double a batteries in it for at least 20 plus shaves.</li>
            <li> This does not really work at all.  </li>
            <li> I fully expected to throw it away immediately, however, here I am....</li>
            <li> have found spending over $60 on a shaver is just a waste of money, same on spending over $25 for replacement foil/cutters.  </li>
            <li> It does sort of work, but honestly not very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably had about 8 of these over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> I use rechargeable 2500 mAh AA batteries-they do seem to last quite a few weeks before requiring recharging.</li>
            <li> If this sounds like exaggeration, it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m rough on the foil guards.</li>
            <li> It is money well spent.</li>
            <li> shaves as wet.</li>
            <li> Pity, since they shave well until the foil pops out.</li>
            <li> I used to only use my previous disposable to touch up on the way to the in-laws or just to get rid of my 5 o&#x27;clock mustache, but I&#x27;d use this now even for work!</li>
            <li> This could cause early foil failure if something comes into contact with the uncovered/unprotected foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> less than half the cost of a replacement blade on a standard electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I throw it in my backpack with all my other military gear and it comes out working like a champ everytime.      </li>
            <li> It lasted about as long as a typical foil does on other razors.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not fair to compare it to a much more expensive model, but I received a Panasonic ES8243A model about 4 or 5 years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a different cheap cordless from a discount store but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once the hairs are a little long, they just don&#x27;t want to go inside the holes to get cut.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these at 10.00 a piece,  one to give away perhaps, after having used the Panasonic ES3831K Single Blade Travel Shaver (14.00) almost daily for about 6 months, as it is dull by now.</li>
            <li> has a plastic cover that doesn&#x27;t stray on, but as one other reviewer said...</li>
            <li> the other day in case they get discontinued or something.</li>
            <li> shaves just like any foil-based razor and you dont have to bothered with getting your eletric razor to work with foreign power outlets</li>
            <li> I usually use a regular shaver (saving cream &amp; a blade)each morning.  </li>
            <li> when I have a meeting or some other event to attend after work.</li>
            <li> I bought it only ~2month, and used no more than 10 times.  </li>
            <li> A life expectancy of 6 to 12 months is given for the product due to these non-replaceable parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I go on a appointments and see VIP clients for my accounts and have to look A+, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate for a second to use this shaver before the appointment, assuming I&#x27;ve shaved with this or a razor in the past day or so.  </li>
            <li> Ive had several shavers in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> However, I won&#x27;t be taking it on any other trips since it just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other Thoughts  </li>
            <li> Runs well on rechargeable alkaline or other rechargeable AA.</li>
            <li> Keep one in the office, the car, the other car, anywhere I think I may need a touch up.  </li>
            <li> only downside- small size takes a bit longer to shave.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for four days (I shave every other day) just to test it out.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my car for beard touch-up every other day.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other thing to watch for is the foil cover itself.</li>
            <li> Despite having a tough beard, yet the Panasonic gave a close shave when it was new, and despite being a travel razor it performed well for months.</li>
            <li> Finding a small, inexpensive battery-operated shaver in local stores was impossible, but once again, Amazon came through with a huge inventory to choose from.</li>
            <li> I just finally got tired of going over and over the same spot on my ankle-</li>
            <li> It also costs less than a pack of refills for my manual razor, or replacement blades for the other electrics I&#x27;ve had.   </li>
            <li> This shaver costs less than blades for my other razor.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take any of the hair off of his chin and he had pressed so hard that it left</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a built in beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It shaves like an expensive shaver, close and fast</li>
            <li> At the end of my testing, I concluded that the Remington Titanium Travel Shaver is really not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> its just not worth it.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.</li>
            <li> the last year I have been using it at least once a week</li>
            <li> Due to poor design and manufacturing, the blades cut through the built-in foil retaining (plastic) clips on the removable foil after only about 2 months of use; causing the foil to come loose.</li>
            <li> He says they last as long as the expensive ones and the entire unit is cheaper to replace than a set of new blades on the expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> And it shows no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li> Just as the shaver was slowing down indicating the batteries were beginning to get low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;ll do if the batteries wear down.</li>
            <li> It even has a safety to keep it from turning on accidentally and running down the battery.</li>
            <li> But then your sales would go down and you would eventually discontinue them.</li>
            <li> mean for only $9.99</li>
            <li> I typically will use an electric razor to knock down the length before using a disposable blade.</li>
            <li> Previously he had a ShaveMan.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close enough that you do not see \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; for several hours, and it does not chew up skin in difficult to shave places</li>
            <li> I can get a half dozen of these for the price</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED IN LESS THAN GIFT CONDITION.  </li>
            <li> It would have been less troubling to just throw $10 in the trash.</li>
            <li> Foil broke after less than a month of use.</li>
            <li> works well, odd shape falls off things</li>
            <li> Not worth the few dollars that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Plus there are no cords to mess with.</li>
            <li> If you wait a few days, you&#x27;ll need to use a body hair trimmer to cut it down to the point that this shaver can take care of it, or just use a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that it uses 2 AA batteries is great but the biggest drawback is that you cannot get replacement blades for this shaver and you must throw it away when it becomes dull - really bad marketing decision and very poor thought process on providing replacement blades.</li>
            <li> It will not cut that -- you will be left with lots of random long hairs.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take the number of these that I&#x27;ve gone through as a note of poor quality... far from it, but deployments, dirt, dust, and excessive abuse takes it&#x27;s toll.  </li>
            <li> I bought this little thing for a one time use</li>
            <li> after batteries are worn a little).  -</li>
            <li> so I could see how this little shaver worked.</li>
            <li> I needed a small, inexpensive electric shaver because due to medication I&#x27;m temporarily not allowed to use a blade razor.  </li>
            <li> A little noisy..</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you need to use a razor if your hair grows out a little.</li>
            <li> A little noisey but cuts well</li>
            <li> At first unsettling, but then you realize it&#x27;s a 10 dollar shaver!</li>
            <li> prefer the way the little Panasonic feels in the hand.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these little razors and keeps one in each vehicle.  </li>
            <li> I keep this little guy in my car or desk drawer at work just in case</li>
            <li> Powerfull little machine.  </li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this little shaver.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Remington Titanium 3 or 4 years ago, used it a little</li>
            <li> I experimented with electric razors a little over the years</li>
            <li> Foils on the Norelco and Brauns didn&#x27;t last very long, and were too expensive to replace (that&#x27;s the agenda, no?).  </li>
            <li> Do not expect long term life due to poor foil construction.</li>
            <li> Not really good, takes really long to shave with this.</li>
            <li> I use it for trim work because I prefer my electric rotary shaver for the heavy lifting.</li>
            <li> , I bought a $70 Braun foil shaver a few months ago to see if I could get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> - Does take a few passes to get a majority of the hairs (esp.</li>
            <li> This shaver has trouble with the neck area</li>
            <li> No doubt a waste of money</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> If I recall correctly it&#x27;s also advertised to last approximately one year</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hassle having to remove the AA NiMHs and charge them every few days to a week.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this shaver and has been for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money, it doesn&#x27;t cut your hair</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> except it misses a few hairs on my neck that it will not cut and they keep getting longer and will not cut.</li>
            <li> I brought it with me when I traveled to Vietnam for a few weeks and it worked</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it probably lasts a yr or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that I disliked it</li>
            <li> As the batteries wore down it did slow down, but still worked about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> #.5 is enough where it&#x27;s uncomfortable to shave with a blade and needs to be knocked down before you can use a disposable blade(gillette sensor 3) .</li>
            <li> When the shaver begins to slow down, I place the two cells in my Ni-MH charger for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> but I think this is sort of a poor excuse of a shaver.</li>
            <li> My previous two shavers were replaced due to broken foil screen.</li>
            <li> If you buy a high-end foil shaver, you&#x27;ll spend $20-30 on a new foil and cutting head.</li>
            <li> First set back, its a throwaway, you can&#x27;t replace the cutting foil or cutting blade.</li>
            <li> My fancy, expensive wet/dry rechargeable Panasonic shaver just bit the dust all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> Can get expensive over time to keep buying batteries, though the batteries do tend to last a while (2+ weeks) before speed of blade gets noticeably slower.  </li>
            <li> For an electric shaver,   there&#x27;s no more \\&quot;bang out of your buck\\</li>
            <li> However, I have tried others of this type (not this brand) in the past</li>
            <li> You get features but not a better shave.</li>
            <li> If I had an expensive electric razor this would have been a big deal.  </li>
            <li> Out of all cheap-line travel Shavers, &amp;#34;Nobody never able to beat Remington MSC-140 shaver.</li>
            <li> and they all fail for the same reason.  </li>
            <li> I have taken a picture and uploaded it ,not sure they will allow it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately one trimmer does not do it all, that&#x27;s why I have different ones</li>
            <li> The only glaring problem is that the screen often separates from the razor and renders it useless.  </li>
            <li> Works the same as a expensive electric one.</li>
            <li> Not sure why people are saying \\&quot;it</li>
            <li> After using a Msc-140 the past five years it never broke down,gives a closer shave as it wears in, and it never burned my skin like the rotary shavers do.</li>
            <li> alot cheaper than buying an expensive one for 50 to $100 which last about a year</li>
            <li> gives the same shave as an expensive one.</li>
            <li> Do not tap or clean the cutting screen as this will soon cause the screen to crack as it is very thin.  </li>
            <li> (plastic parts on all shavers will wear down if an item slides over them).Do not apply excess pressure when shaving,instead overlap each pass 1/2 the cutter head width to allow a double cutting.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced this when using other foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> guess it&#x27;s possible that I got a bad shaver, but I have other Remington shavers.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  I was mildly disappointed to find that it&#x27;s really a disposable, as you can&#x27;t replace the blade unit.  </li>
            <li> As with all electrics, tends to miss hair, especially in hard areas (under chin, around lip, next to ears, etc.)    </li>
            <li> But for a backup shaver, travel, use in the car, etc, you will find it hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Cleaning brush is hard to remove from cap.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why everyone in these reviews are raving about this shaver, it hardly does anything.</li>
            <li> Leaving the \\&quot;hard to get places\\&quot; on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Dull junk is what this is.</li>
            <li> The store across the street had one of these, and I just thought it would at least get me through the weekend.   </li>
            <li> Only disappointment, no trimmer.</li>
            <li> For 10 bucks, I always have at least one on hand in case</li>
            <li> It does last a few years before the foil screen cracks and go bad</li>
            <li> I have been using this Remington for at least 2 or 3 years.</li>
            <li> I forced myself to use it for a while, but now it sits on my shelf</li>
            <li> so I dont have thick hair like a man&#x27;s beard or mustache.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately - as noted in some other reviews - the foil came unhooked from the inside and kept coming off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other expensive Remingtons over the years .</li>
            <li> For 10 bucks, it&#x27;s half the price of the blades on my expensive razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to load batteries because of the tight space.</li>
            <li> For only &amp;#34;TEN BUCKS!&amp;#34; per 1 year, isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it after is a bit of a chore, but not surprising.  </li>
            <li> I started with this disposable shaver, and did the bulk of my face, leaving the difficult spots for my heavy duty</li>
            <li> This razor is underpowered and too weak to shave with.</li>
            <li> Slow!</li>
            <li> BATTERY IS VERY HARD TO GET TO.</li>
            <li> and I have a tough beard.  </li>
            <li> And I have a tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though it wasn&#x27;t expensive, I&#x27;m sad that I wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> He is not happy at all about this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> It tends to miss some hairs that are thin</li>
            <li> I startet to use this type of shaver approximately 7 years ago and since then I did not change the type of my shaver.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described, still working, but quality of shaving terrible</li>
            <li> so poor performance.. doesn&#x27;t shave well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but not great at it.</li>
            <li> After about 10 days of use, I noticed my face was getting nicked by it, and I discovered the screen had broken in two places, revealing the blades.  </li>
            <li> I grew tired of spending $100+ on the fancy rechargeable razors with the expensive replacement blades, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want something expensive nor did I require a wet/dry electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I almost feel guilty knocking it.</li>
            <li> It is almost useless.  </li>
            <li> I can buy 15 of these for the price of one of the expensive one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I did&#x27;t want to have to replace it with an expensive one.</li>
            <li> I have three and the foil has failed on two of them but the razor will operate(without shaving).</li>
            <li> When my expensive Braun gave up the ghost I purchased Braun&#x27;s version of the travel razor and used it for about a year.</li>
            <li> Yes it is dependable whining away without fail.</li>
            <li> AM UNABLE TO REVIEW THE ITEM AT THIS TIME</li>
            <li> - A SILLY AMAZON REQUIREMENT THAT SKEWS PRODUCT RATINGS...  </li>
            <li> but it still kept coming off, so now this shaver is useless.  </li>
            <li> but so did the expensive ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they bother to make these useless things.</li>
            <li> If it stops working, you don&#x27;t feel a hit in the pocket book like with the expensive</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expensive and did the job.</li>
            <li> At the price, it&#x27;s cheaper than buying replacements foils and heads for an expensive razor.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after a friend telling me he used one, I had to get on board.</li>
            <li> Its a bit difficult learn to wear this razor</li>
            <li> I have gone through three, each replacing one that failed.  </li>
            <li> but I was unable to find them when the ones I had wore out.</li>
            <li> price, met the needs, but short-lived and dangerous.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s say you replace the cutting heads every six months.</li>
            <li> and they inexplicably unpredicatably stop, never to work again.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find another</li>
            <li> Even for a foil \\&quot;travel\\&quot; razor, this Remington shaver was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll start cutting your face.</li>
            <li> Disappointing performance.</li>
            <li> If you are cutting stubble it will work</li>
            <li> The cutting foil is riveted in and cannot be removed for replacement.</li>
            <li> squeeze the two buttons on each side of the shaver before sliding the cutting head onto the shaver</li>
            <li> but he says it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I put some enloop rechargables in this bad boy and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  </li>
            <li> Remington the shavers not to bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe I refused a bad product</li>
            <li> bad that the Remington name appears on this crummy product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually i am disappointed in their performance.</li>
            <li> If you are disappointed, please do not blame me, it was you who made the choice.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed that there weren&#x27;t any user replaceable parts, which might be why it sells for $10.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t work well and all, but the horrifying thing about it is that the blades eat through the foil and cut your face, it is simply a dangerous item.</li>
            <li> Remington was stupid for removing it from store shelves.</li>
            <li> This piece of crap was DOA.  </li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> But it is very bad if the hair grows longer than about a day or so.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This shaver is worthless!</li>
            <li> Remington MSC 140 cuts horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Razor works well but the foil tends to wear out quickly.  It would be great if one could buy replacement foils.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the price...I use it for trim work because I prefer my electric rotary shaver for the heavy lifting.</li>
            <li> Works  great after a break in period</li>
            <li> This does not really work at all.  I don&#x27;t even know how it could.  It seems like you need to use this, then a regular razor.  I guess if you don&#x27;t want a very close shave it&#x27;s fine.  It definitely leaves stubble.</li>
            <li> Not really good, takes really long to shave with this.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It  has a plastic cover that doesn&#x27;t stray on, but as one other reviewer said...a rubber band solves this problem.&lt;br /&gt;I am soooo...pleased with this shaver, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It not work very fine!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for cleaning yourself up between getting a nice shave. I stay clean now I was getting a cut once a week its been like 5 weeks now I stay fresh.</li>
            <li> does not give a close shave&lt;br /&gt;must press too hard&lt;br /&gt;might work on very long beards but did not cut my short beard&lt;br /&gt;look for a better shaver</li>
            <li> Hubby uses everyday &amp; will be perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive shaver.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on 12/29/2012, fell apart on 7/6/2013 while I was using it. Got myself cut.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, met the needs, but short-lived and dangerous.</li>
            <li> I bought this little thing for a one time use becuase I didn&#x27;t have my razor while traveling.  I fully expected to throw it away immediately, however, here I am....6 months later, still using it daily.  I&#x27;m military and it gets plenty close enough to pass our standards.  It&#x27;s not too agressive on the face, and has never once irritated my skin like my old Mach 3 sometimes did.  I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries once in 6 months, and this second set is still going strong.  They&#x27;re just AAs though, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  It has a little brush included with the cover which works great for cleaning it.  I normally just pull off the top and bang it on the sink.  Viola!  The head cover is pretty lacking (it doesn&#x27;t really stay on), but I don&#x27;t really care.  I throw it in my backpack with all my other military gear and it comes out working like a champ everytime.      Instead of buying one of the higher end models, give this thing a try.  You won&#x27;t believe how good it works for the price.  When this thing dies (it&#x27;s still shaving like it did on day 1), you better believe it&#x27;s getting replaced with an exact replica.</li>
            <li> Cheap not made with standards.</li>
            <li> This shaver offers a shave that is comparable to the the ShaveMan or Braun On The Go .... atleast so far. My New favorite ...</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the Remmington razor.  Previously he had a ShaveMan.  The only thing he would have liked is if the new rezor had a pop out trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used a Remington MSC-140 travel shaver on a vacation and liked it better than my triple-head Norelco shaver.  After the Norelco was due for new blades I chucked it and bought three more Remington MSC-140 shavers to use on a daily basis.  It gives a nice close shave and is easy to clean and lubricate (it was a chore to clean and lubricate the Norelco triple-head).  The Remington MSC-140 is much cheaper than the Norelco and the head lasts about a year.  I just hope Remington continues to make this nice travel shaver (of which I said I now use daily).  I only wish the shaver had a plug-in recepticle with an optional ac adapter so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use AA batteries.  Other than that it is the perfect shaver for me.</li>
            <li> I know Remington has always made quality shavers and the MSC-140 doesn&#x27;t disappoint. This is really a great little shaver. I shave my head and I use it to maintain my &#x27;do&#x27;. This razor shaves my head so close that it feels like a baby&#x27;s butt. And it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s a battery hog either. It&#x27;s all I need and the price makes it a real bargain. I give it 5 stars. [[ASIN:B0038LXD02 Remington MSC-140 MSC140 Titanium 2X Travel Shaver]]</li>
            <li> Having been a blade man all my life, I found myself needing the ability of a fast \\&quot;clean-up\\&quot; from time to time.  Grey stubble is not flattering.  I didn&#x27;t want something expensive nor did I require a wet/dry electric shaver.  This shaver fit the bill perfectly.  I chose this shaver because it is not a rechargeable.  Rechargeables are just that, rechargeable.  You&#x27;re still tied to a cord at some point and I haven&#x27;t had the greatest success with rechargeable battery life.  A good pair of Lithium batteries for long life and this shaver has performed great.      While on vacation, I went 3 days without shaving and then decided to give the Remington a real life test even though I had my trusty razor in my shaving kit.  It took a couple passes to get a clean shave as I would expect for a foil shaver.      My only word of caution would apply to all electric shavers.  If you&#x27;re used to a blade, you&#x27;ll most likely get razor burn the first time you use an electric.    All in all, this has been one of the better purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I started using this shaver when I joined the Army, since I had to shave every day and razors make me break out. Plus I have moles on my face that are easy to cut. If you shave every day, this little shaver will do the job just fine. If you wait a few days, you&#x27;ll need to use a body hair trimmer to cut it down to the point that this shaver can take care of it, or just use a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note, I bought a $70 Braun foil shaver a few months ago to see if I could get a closer shave. I forced myself to use it for a while, but now it sits on my shelf and I&#x27;m back to using this one. It works very well. I even went to Walmart and bought three of them the other day in case they get discontinued or something. I&#x27;m stil on #1, and I&#x27;ve had it for about six months now, shaving every day. I put a drop of machine oil on it every week to help preserve the life of the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about cost. Let&#x27;s say you replace the cutting heads every six months. If you buy a high-end foil shaver, you&#x27;ll spend $20-30 on a new foil and cutting head. If you use the latest Gillette razor, you&#x27;ll spend $50 for replacement heads. With this, it&#x27;s $10 for a brand new shaver. Can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job for the touch ups or in-between razor shaves.</li>
            <li> This shaver does perform adequately, but to my immense chagrin, the package stated that no replacement foils or blades are made for this model.  It is a \\&quot;throw-away\\&quot; device.  In fact, it even states on the package that it has an estimated lifespan of one year.  Remington&#x27;s honesty in this instance is commendable, but it nothing to allay my annoyance that in this day and age of economic turmoil, resource depletion, and environmental degradation, short-lifespan devices like this are still being made.  Most of them will be discarded in landfills, where whatever toxic materials contained within will eventually leak into the water table.  This is too high a price to pay in the long run for a little short-term convenience.</li>
            <li> I was concerned this would be cheap and breakable with the price but its actually perfect for travel.  shaves just like any foil-based razor and you dont have to bothered with getting your eletric razor to work with foreign power outlets</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an earlier version of a travel shaver that is no longer available.  I had used that one for several years and liked it.  The Remington MSC-140 is a very good replacement.  Although no electric I have ever used is as close, or as comfortable as a razor with blades, after lathering with a good brush using hot water and shaving soap, this is an excellent razor for occasional use.  It is not as close as a blade, but it does a commendable job, especially when considering the price.  It shaves close enough that you do not see \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; for several hours, and it does not chew up skin in difficult to shave places as many electrics do.  I would definitely recommend this shaver as long as you do not expect blade performance.  I do think it is as good as electrics costing several times as much money.</li>
            <li> My fancy, expensive wet/dry rechargeable Panasonic shaver just bit the dust all of a sudden. I went and grabbed my son&#x27;s Titanium shaver which we had gotten him for a &amp;#34;coming of age&amp;#34; present. I couldn&#x27;t believe what a great job this little cheapo did on my dry face! I&#x27;ve been used to shaving in the shower in order to get a closer shave, but the Titanium did every bit as good a job dry. So I just ordered one of my own, and I saved myself over $100 by not buying another Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month.  This $12 razor is replacing a $170 self cleaning Braun that never worked well at all.  I was able to get that first month of use out of one set of batteries.  As the batteries wore down it did slow down, but still worked about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such a low price you will be amazed how well this thing works.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a built in beard trimmer.  So if you have a stray hair that sneaks buy or bends/curves into your flesh a bit you&#x27;ll need a separate trimmer to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a three foil Remington several years ago  (it was great too) but can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore.  Three razors later this is the closest thing I have found to it.  :)</li>
            <li> I got this one time when I got to my armory and realized I&#x27;d left my razor at home. The store across the street had one of these, and I just thought it would at least get me through the weekend.   The blades and foils on it lasted longer than most of the other expensive ones I&#x27;ve had, and it shaved better than them. I can get a half dozen of these for the price one of most of the others, but so far, I&#x27;m just now replacing my first one after  a couple of years of occasional use (couple times a week). It also costs less than a pack of refills for my manual razor, or replacement blades for the other electrics I&#x27;ve had.   It&#x27;s nice not having to pack a special charger, and 2 AA batteries actually last a while in it. I actually use this both on the road and at home when I don&#x27;t have time to \\&quot;really\\&quot; shave (manual razor blade for that really close shave).</li>
            <li> This has been my primary shaver since July of last year.  Bought it when I forgot my Norelco rotary on a trip.  Have not looked back since.  This shaver outperformed my Norelco in every aspect.  Just shows that price ($10 vs. $90) does not equal quality.    Why four stars?  A couple items:  - Battery operated.  Can get expensive over time to keep buying batteries, though the batteries do tend to last a while (2+ weeks) before speed of blade gets noticeably slower.  - Can&#x27;t replace the blades or foil.  Small complaint, as the shaver is cheap enough to just buy a new one.  - Does take a few passes to get a majority of the hairs (esp. after batteries are worn a little).  - As with all electrics, tends to miss hair, especially in hard areas (under chin, around lip, next to ears, etc.)    Overall, a great value to at least try BEFORE you spend $70+ on a rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric shaver for quite a while now...did not buy it as a primary shaver.  I usually use a regular shaver (saving cream &amp; a blade)each morning.  I bought this for touch ups and clean-ups...when I have a meeting or some other event to attend after work. I keep it in the office or in the car and it works very well for those occasions.  It is a little bulky, the plastic cover does not stay on very well and the foil is not replacable, but what to you expect for this price.  The batteries do hold up well and it does a decent job of cleaning up a light beard. So it is fine for that kind of use. However, unless you are just entering puberty and starting the shaving experience, this should not be your primary shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a light-weight travel shaver for a trip to India.  Although noisy and a bit slow, it&#x27;s OK for its low price -- except for long whiskers.  When you travel you shave in bad light, and you miss some -- and once a whisker gets past a certain length this shaver can&#x27;t find it.  Runs right over those long hairs.  OK for good light or for a couple of days, but that&#x27;s all. (On the other hand, it did run for 3 weeks on one set of batteries and did the basic shaving adequately).</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver two days ago. I did not shave for two days so I could see how this little shaver worked. I shaved with pre-electric shave lotion  [[ASIN:B0013NB7DW Williams Lectric Shave Original with Green Tea Complex - 7 oz.]], and it was fantastic! I shaved very quickly, maybe 5 min at most. it removed my stubble from cheeks,chin,  neck with one or two passes. The Adam&#x27;s apple area it two over 3 - 4 passes to remove. i would rubbed the back of my hand up and down against my cheeks, chin and neck after shaving and it felt really, really smooth, as close as my Gillette fusion. I highly recommended. I have no problem with the plastic cover it stayed on once I finished using it.</li>
            <li> Iy was difficult to find, but the two Remington MSC-40 Shavers shavers I purchased tthen arrived quickly.  I have been using one of those for ~ one month, and it is very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a quick way for my HWP to get a quick shave in the morning.  He is thrilled with it.  Likes the convenience and quality......Great low price</li>
            <li> Great travel razor that shaves, at least for me very well.  Much better than a travel rotary razor purchased previous to this one.</li>
            <li> I now own two of these. They do a good job for a daily shave!</li>
            <li> For what this is, at the price it is, I was extremely pleased with its performance.  It is not at all as cheap looking or feeling as some shavers in the $60-80 range.  Cleaning it after is a bit of a chore, but not surprising.  This is ideal for travel, or if you just need a touch-up.  I also purchased a more expensive (much more) Panasonic, and while I am pleased with it, it is only a little better than the Remington.  Buy this one with confidence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of electric shavers before and this one is actually pretty good with a low price. Of course it cannot give you a clean shave like razors do but I am Asia, I don&#x27;t have much beard so this shaver is fine to me.</li>
            <li> My husband has this shaver in the car and uses it when he&#x27;s running late in the morning or has to go unexpected out up town. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Why would you ever want to buy an electric shaver when you can purchase this ecologically sound product at more than 1/3 the cost? It performs as well or better than any Braun, etc. than I&#x27;ve owned in the past AND you can easily take it with you!</li>
            <li> Works better than shavers 5-10X the price. Not something I would use every day but for days when you need to multitask and still get to work clean shaven, this shaver is ideal.     The fact that is it AA-battery powered makes it snag and pull less than more powerful shavers. You may need to go over certain spots a few times at different angles to get everything but it never hurts and you can immediately feel the results.     Great value -- idea for a travel razer, shaver for the car (but be careful) or for those quick touch-ups when you don&#x27;t have time to lather and shave.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim above and below my mustache.  It does a pretty good job and the price is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Average share at best. Misses a lot of hair have to go it time and time again and a battery hog.  Needs some lithium batteries.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a great shave.  The battery life is good. When you wear out the head, just purchase a new shaver.  I would like to see a trimmer &amp; a better cover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this guy for a month now.  Found 2 issues.  And just so people would read this review, I&#x27;ve rated it 1 star.  (Really, it&#x27;s probably about a 3 star device, in my book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The switch is already going out, but hey, it&#x27;s so cheap, right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The plastic cover for the head comes off way too easily.  This could cause early foil failure if something comes into contact with the uncovered/unprotected foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s cheap, but come on, it&#x27;s only been a month, but again, it&#x27;s so cheap I almost feel guilty knocking it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of these.  They work well but eventually the foil head breaks.  You can expect to get 3-6 months daily use until it breaks.  Nice close shave for the price.  Get rechargeable batteries &amp; you&#x27;ll be quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought it only ~2month, and used no more than 10 times.  But the blade already broke during the middle of shaving,  and left a scar on my husband&#x27;s chin. I hope I never bought  this shaver</li>
            <li> I needed a small, inexpensive electric shaver because due to medication I&#x27;m temporarily not allowed to use a blade razor.  This little device works great - if there&#x27;s not much hair there to begin with.  I&#x27;m a woman, just using this razor for inconspicuous facial hair for which it&#x27;s perfect.  I tried it on some longer leg hair &amp; it literally \\&quot;couldn&#x27;t cut it.\\&quot;  I was mildly disappointed to find that it&#x27;s really a disposable, as you can&#x27;t replace the blade unit.  This explains why it&#x27;s so inexpensive.  It&#x27;s supposed to last for 6 months - with the light usage it&#x27;s getting, who knows.  The little plastic cover falls off easily but you can hold it in place with a rubber band.  An old toothbrush works better for cleaning the blades than the dinky little cleaning brush that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I used to buy a version of this razor from time to time, in Walmart, under some off brand from China.    I liked it back then for one reason: It was cheap (disposable) and it did a tolerably good job.   I like it for shaving in the car on the way to work *when* I have a long drive.  (I worked in different places and sometimes the drives could be &gt;15 minutes).    With enough time, this razor will do a pretty decent job.  It can be as good as a blade when used often enough.  Also, I have never gotten any sort of cut or burn from it -- at most a very very mild tingling in places where I was particularly aggressive.    It is also very good for cleaning up 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.     But it is very bad if the hair grows longer than about a day or so.  It will not cut that -- you will be left with lots of random long hairs.  This actually makes it kind of good for shaving your neck -- if you do that every day, it will only shave off the short hairs and leave the long ones alone.    It is loud.  This is not a razor that you can expect to use quietly in the privacy of your office -- other people will hear.    Also, a plastic cap that comes with it to protect the foil will not stay on.  It is almost useless.  This is the one thing the engineers who work on this should fix.      Remember though -- it is ONLY $10.00.  Quite easy to buy 1 or 2, put it in your car and travel kit and have something tolerably good for shaving while driving or for emergencies.     I will definitely be buying another one even though there are lots of faults. It is, after all, only $10.00.</li>
            <li> I grew tired of spending $100+ on the fancy rechargeable razors with the expensive replacement blades, so I decided to give this a try. Please note that I&#x27;m not a shaving afficionado; I&#x27;m married with a newborn; I&#x27;m quickly closing in on 40. Therefore, I value my time and money more than picking up the lady-kind. This review reflects these preferences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1. You never have to worry about soldering new batteries into the unit like the more expensive shavers since it just takes AA&#x27;s. This also means you&#x27;ll never get stuck with a dead shaver in the morning - when you need it most - as long as you have extra AA&#x27;s on hand.&lt;br /&gt;2. Two heads provide for a quicker shave than a single head.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s cheap! I can buy 15 of these for the price of one of the expensive one&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;4. I cannot tell the difference between this shaver and my much more expensive Braun shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1. The foil cleaner that comes with it is a joke. Quick tip: I use an old toothbrush to quickly and effectively clean the heads after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. No beard/side burn trimmer, although for me these are a joke even on the Braun I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line: This is a no-nonsense product that&#x27;s a great alternative to the expensive shavers since it&#x27;s cheap and works well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver. Got this for my husband. He says it works great and gives him a nice close shave. Great for traveling. A little noisy..but he says it&#x27;s not that bad. Use to get this at Walmart, so glad could find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a cheap shaver, not too much more you can say than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build material reflects the \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; sticker but it seems well put together, just lightweight - a con in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with the money I spent.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old Titanium Turbo razor that I bought some 8 years ago and I did&#x27;t want to have to replace it with an expensive one. I searched around and came across this one, and for $10, it&#x27;s a great little razor that I have used a lot in the 1 month that I&#x27;ve had it. An easy recommendation for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a battery razor.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Ditto\\&quot;, to all of the positive reviews. For an electric shaver,   there&#x27;s no more \\&quot;bang out of your buck\\&quot; you can get. Thought the   constant smooth, close shaves were too good to be true. That it was   only a matter of time before it went kaput. Well, it&#x27;s been a while   now. And it shows no signs of slowing down. (Like some others   mentioned, its only fault is that it&#x27;s plastic cover never stays on.   But that&#x27;s no big deal, to me.).</li>
            <li> We were looking for a good, lightweight razor and got one of these based on the feedback of others here at amazon. We took it on a 5-1/2 week driving trip and were astonished how long the batteries lasted! It doesn&#x27;t last forever, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive, I ordered another dozen to keep my husband supplied for several years. Works better than many battery razors three or four times the price.</li>
            <li> Love it! Shaves close and the batteries last a good, long time. The price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Husband said it snagged too much.  Not a quality shave.  It is lightweight and cordless so I was hoping it would be okay for travel but he refused to even use it for that and tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. I am a repeat buyer and use this product for travel and/or as a pre shaver as I have a mustache and van-dyke...It is very good on detailing and I recommend it for everyone for both uses.[[ASIN:B0009OAFVG Remington MSC-140 Men&#x27;s Titanium Battery Operated Foil Travel Shaver]]</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a close shave, until the blades and screen wear out.&lt;br /&gt;They are not replaceable, but for $10 for the whole shaver, I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two I ordered this time arrived promptly and are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very handy for traveling, especially in our camper.  It does a reasonably good job at it&#x27;s intended purpose and so far as achieved a long battery life.  However, I have tried others of this type (not this brand) in the past and they inexplicably unpredicatably stop, never to work again.</li>
            <li> This little gem has to be one of THE best electric razor values out there!!</li>
            <li> I took this to Europe with a fresh battery but abandoned it in favor of razor blade.  Not worth the few dollars that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The small razor is a great buy, I bought two I like it so much I wanted to have a exra one if something happen to the other one .  I have tryed most of the high priced razors and I like the Remington MSC-140 better than all others, it shaves closer and quicker.</li>
            <li> Excellent close shave.  Battery power that lasts.  The plastic cover doesn&#x27;t fit real well.  I like this product.</li>
            <li> I have a rather unusual need for a gentle but effective shaver and this is perfect. I had cancer on the tip of my nose and the surgeon rebuilt my nose using a graft from just inside my hair line. Yep, I have to shave my nose! Electrol treatments are working but for now this is perfect. I have had it for over a year and it is working perfectly. Remington, you need to remove that (Men&#x27;s) in the description.</li>
            <li> Works great for a quick touch up at the end of the day or while traveling.  Clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Absolute waste of money. I bought this for my 13-year-old as a beginner shaver and it shaves next to nothing! I don&#x27;t know who wrote the other reviews, but I doubt they were independent voices. This shaver is worthless!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the best, but it doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as the best either. I use this razor when traveling and at home when I don&#x27;t feel like using a manual blade. This shaver has trouble with the neck area but I just clean it up with a blade if needed. This shaver is also very strong for a battery shaver... Maybe its because I always put freshly charged batteries in, but either way, its strong. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver.  Obviously it shouldn&#x27;t be the only thing you use, but it does a good job.  The blades aren&#x27;t replaceable, but at this price just buy a new one when they wear out.  This shaver costs less than blades for my other razor.  Plus You have to buy a foil as well if you use that kind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend rechargeable batteries to keep it going strong longer, but keep in mind that NiMh batteries gradually loose their charge when not in use.</li>
            <li> I get the best shave of any razor with this.  Even the \\&quot;non-disposable\\&quot; quality razors.  It lasted about as long as a typical foil does on other razors.  I just bought a couple more.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a back up to my regular Remington electric.  I have now used it for over 8 months almost every day.  It&#x27;s so superior to my regular shaver that I use it almost all the time.  The cutting mechanism is somewhat slower than my other Remington, but for me, it actually shaves better.  It misses less hair then the faster model and based on using it every day, it works just fine (for a multi day growth, the other one works better).  This shaver actually costs less than replacing the blades alone for most electric shavers!  It&#x27;s a ridiculously great buy.  I can not speak for  the one guy who hated it (in the reviews) but dollar for dollar, I can&#x27;t recall buying anything and getting such great value.  I recommend it enthusiastically!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud and uses a AA. I wish it had a rechargeable battery. But, since I just use it when traveling, it&#x27;s been fine. Being loud is actually ok - it tells me where I&#x27;ve done a good jow shaving and which spots I&#x27;ve missed. It does a pretty close shave pretty quickly. I&#x27;m happy with it for the money.</li>
            <li> For the price, this thing is great - but don&#x27;t expect it to be a long-term product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enclosed printed directions sheet affirms that neither the screens nor the cutters are replaceable.  A life expectancy of 6 to 12 months is given for the product due to these non-replaceable parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, the clear plastic headguard will not stay snapped on.  It falls off easily, and since it contains the cleaning brush expect to lose that part in a hotel somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is powered by 2 AA batteries;  I used freshly charged Eneloops and had no problems.  My old Panasonic used two permanently modified AAs from the factory, so this was no surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the lack of a beard trimmer and the throwaway nature of the product prevent me from giving a better review.  If you can accept that you are paying $10 for a shaver that you will likely replace again in half a year, then you will be more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Keep good batteries in it, and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> A darn good little razor that cost about half of the price of new cutters for my old razor. Runs a long time on just 2 batteries. Only draw back is the lack of a side bun trimmer. I can get about 8-10 months out of one, and then I  just replace it as there are no cutters  available.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t really shave well at all, on any part of my face.  Going to order another Panasonic shaver instead soon.</li>
            <li> The Remington MSC-140 appears to be a solidly built plastic body razor. The on/off switch of convieniently located on the underside of the razor and is easily worked with the thumb. The device is powered by 2 AA batteries which when paired with the razor head give a reasonably clean shave. The head of the razor can be removed for cleaning. I don&#x27;t think the blades are replaceable, but I plan to use the razor for travel, with only occassional use.</li>
            <li> This shaver won&#x27;t take anything off that is more than a couple millimeters. It really doesn&#x27;t get very close even when there isn&#x27;t much on your face. I suppose for $10 this is a fair product.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my glove box for those hectic mornings. I am always surprised by the quality of a shave I get from this inexpensive shaver. Even when the battery is low I get a close shave without pulling my hairs.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year power user of electric shavers, and many years of those with Remington microscreen shavers. My very first original Microscreen was an excellent shaver, but the NI-CAD batteries in it died and were not readily replaceable. I had had several rotary shavers which never really worked well for me. So I bought a new Microscreen which worked well for me for many years until the batteries in it also died. This shaver is almost as good as these past shavers, but much less expensive. Some disadvantages: The screen is not replaceable. But for most other shavers, a replacement screen costs more than this whole shaver. I use the same AA rechargeable batteries in it that I use in my digital camera, so batteries are never going to make the whole shaver unuseable. It does shave a little slower than a normal one. But for a backup shaver, travel, use in the car, etc, you will find it hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Great value, works fine.  I use it for end of the day in the office if I have to go to dinner.</li>
            <li> Just used this for one week on vacation.  Given the large size for a travel razor, and double foil, I expected a better shave.   Will NOT trim any long hairs. I really wanted this to be a great purchase, but at least the price was low. I have a $2 tiny single foil that runs off a AAA battery that does as good of a job as this, but takes longer.</li>
            <li> Leaves a few hairs here and there,  but does a pretty good job overall.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these over a year ago to keep in my suitcase. I love the fact that it&#x27;s battery powered, so I don&#x27;t need to worry about carrying a charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an OK job at shaving. What do you expect for 10 bucks? It doesn&#x27;t shave as well as a $200 razor. But it shaves much better than a $10 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this shaver if you need to keep something handy around for travel. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t use it as my daily at-home tool, but only because it doesn&#x27;t have the power and features I want daily. For travel times though - PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son.  He is serving our country in Iraq and water isn&#x27;t always available for shaving so he found this travel razor that he can use.  Because of it&#x27;s inexpensive price he is not concerned if he loses it, it does a great job and it doesn&#x27;t take up alot of room.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these razors for a couple years that I got on impulse, while waiting in line at K-Mart. That was a lucky day. I keep it in the car, and shave on the way to work. I&#x27;m lightly bearded and, for me, it runs for weeks on 2 AA batteries. I was really glad to find another one here on Amazon, for when the first one wears out.&lt;br /&gt;It may seem a little under-powered, but I take my time, and get a smooth shave. All electric razors will miss a whisker here and there, but I find this razor does a good job. Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> No you won&#x27;t have a trimmer and you&#x27;ll need to buy batteries but still you are getting a very good shave for very little money, less then replacing the foil / cutter or heads of most any brand shaver even after the cost of batteries.  So long as it lasts over 6 months this is a great value.  I see several people had issues with it not lasting that long but after using about 6 months now I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the larger sized Remington shavers as those shave a bit faster plus with the features you&#x27;d want for daily use but I&#x27;m not nuts about their current ones.  Really Remington and Wahl are the value leaders in shaving in my opinion with shavers that lack the Braun type of detail but give as good a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found spending over $60 on a shaver is just a waste of money, same on spending over $25 for replacement foil/cutters.  You get features but not a better shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it didn&#x27;t work well at all. He had to keep going over the same spots trying to get it to actually shave the hair. When it did shave, it did it in spots. So he had to go back over with a regular razor. Returned it.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly decent shaver for a small travel model. Comfortable and light weight this shaver does the job it&#x27;s supposed to. The fact that it uses 2 AA batteries is great but the biggest drawback is that you cannot get replacement blades for this shaver and you must throw it away when it becomes dull - really bad marketing decision and very poor thought process on providing replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a similar shaver called a ShaveMan I got from target for $5-6 about 5 years ago and had finally died. I was desperate to find another but apparently the producer is now out of business. I was leary to buy this one because I couldn&#x27;t see it in store, but I&#x27;m glad I got it. It works beautifully! You could potentially use this as your only shaver if you stay consistent with shaving! If you don&#x27;t, you need to use a razor if your hair grows out a little. I used to only use my previous disposable to touch up on the way to the in-laws or just to get rid of my 5 o&#x27;clock mustache, but I&#x27;d use this now even for work! I go on a appointments and see VIP clients for my accounts and have to look A+, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate for a second to use this shaver before the appointment, assuming I&#x27;ve shaved with this or a razor in the past day or so.  All in all, highly recommend! Can&#x27;t beat the price and definitely can&#x27;t beat the shave for the price! I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy a &amp;70+ shaver!</li>
            <li> Great for shaving and touch-ups on the road. Just a little slower than my Norelco at home, but the shave is very good. I bought this shaver because it has two shaving heads. At ten bucks, it&#x27;s a terrific deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on vacation, as I did not want to get my Panasonic ES8243 (a $150 shaver) damaged in my luggage.  For a $10 item, its really good, its got a powerful motor, gives a good close shave.  Its not as good as the Panasonic, but for occasional use its great, and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> For its price (under 10 Dollars) this product performs great. The batter life is great. The shave is not as smooth as I would like, and have to repeat it over some areas ( such as chin and underneath jaw line) as I said this is just an extra when i&#x27;m too lazy to shave properly. Works great</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver. I am a woman, but bought it because I needed an inexpensive, battery-operated shaver for a camping trip and ended up liking this thing more than my expensive rechargeable woman&#x27;s razor. It works faster and cleaner than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Gives an adequate shave which is surprising since it is powered be two AA batteries and has a small shaving surface.  Light and small so it packs easily for travel.</li>
            <li> Best shaver for the money, comparable to many non-disposable.  Replacing the entire shaver is almost the same cost and just having to buy a cartridge for a non - disposable.  I can easily use this for a year without having to buy a new one, the price cannot be beat.  Used along with  a double edge razor, this disposable electric are all you&#x27;ll need and you&#x27;ll save tons of money on blades.</li>
            <li> Use it for quick shaves and evening touchup.  Does a good job and easy to use since it is battery powered</li>
            <li> This is my second Remington Titanium.  The first one served me well for over three years.  The reason the first one broke was because I dropped it on a tile floor, bending the foil screen cover.  If I had an expensive electric razor this would have been a big deal.  At under $10 delivered, I didn&#x27;t give it a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being extremely affordable, it does a really good job of shaving.  I like the fact that it uses double &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; batteries over being rechargeable.  In a pinch you throw batteries in, instead of having to wait for it to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor cuts as close as any Norelco  or Braun that I&#x27;ve had, at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> Ive had several shavers in the past 10 years. This one makes a good difference in shaving face and moustache area.&lt;br /&gt;the neck area is always better to use a disposable one, but thats in my case.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, handy little shaver. I use it when I&#x27;m traveling mostly.</li>
            <li> This is a very surprising product that out-performs far more expensive shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this at home, at the office, on the road or in a men&#x27;s room before a meeting. You have nothing to lose. It only costs 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> If you use 2 AA Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable Batteries for more than 2 weeks of great shave from single charge. For only &amp;#34;TEN BUCKS!&amp;#34; per 1 year, isn&#x27;t bad at all. Out of all cheap-line travel Shavers, &amp;#34;Nobody never able to beat Remington MSC-140 shaver.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a low-priced shaver to carry with me for the days when I forget to shave before leaving the house, and saw this one, saw that the reviews were good, and decided to try it.  Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  I&#x27;m hard-pressed, though, to come up with a way that this shaver falls short compared to my fancy rechargeable shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer for sideburns, but that&#x27;s all I can think of.  It&#x27;s well worth the money, and works great, as long as you don&#x27;t mind using up AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Feels very cheap, which of course it is, but really not even worth what I paid ($10). It does sort of work, but honestly not very well. I&#x27;d have to go over the same area multiple times from all directions. I know it&#x27;s not fair to compare it to a much more expensive model, but I received a Panasonic ES8243A model about 4 or 5 years ago and it&#x27;s just so much better on every level. I know it&#x27;s an investment, but you really do get what you pay for. I got this for traveling internationally because I didn&#x27;t want to risk losing my nicer Panasonic wet/dry shaver. However, I won&#x27;t be taking it on any other trips since it just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend or buy again. Like other reviewers suggested, just use a regular razor blade when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;+ Uses AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap construction&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work well&lt;br /&gt;- Low power</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, Doesn&#x27;t shave off any hairs, long or short. Not even worth $5.00 IMO.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this is my first purchase of an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read many positive reviews of this, and was hoping that this would replace my need to purchase manual blades. However, I found that this did not provide nearly a close enough shave to be appropriate for everyday use. It is good for traveling or for a backup at work or in your car, if you need a dry shave on the go. Also, if I forget to shave for a few days, it does a good job of shortening my beard to make my manual blade shaving easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my beard hair may be different than others, and it may provide a close enough shave for some to be a daily shaver. For me it is not, but for ten dollars it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find this product on line. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store.  It is more convinient than the recharge type of shaver.</li>
            <li> Realiza el corte muy bien sin lastimar la piel, sobre todo es bastante portatil el uso de baterias la hace ideal para viajes largos o viajes hacia lugares remotos donde no puedes recargar baterias, solo compras un par de baterias y listo para funcionar nuevamente.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed.  Have to go over and over and over the same spot for a clean shave.  I don&#x27;t shave every day, so this might work better if you use it every day. Once the hairs are a little long, they just don&#x27;t want to go inside the holes to get cut.</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Pros - Price is $9.95? What a deal! Excellent choice for anyone having to be presentable for formal meetings both morning and evening. Shaving twice a day is no problem and does not irritate skin. My beard is a coarse, fast growing, beard producing heavy stubble within 12 hours - not just the 5:00 O&#x27;clock shadow variety. I have been using one of these electric razors for a year and it is easy on batteries (AAx2.) I am a minister who also works as a manager in an industrial facility and I often need to do a shave in afternoon for ministry meetings in evening. This razor does not irritate the skin and shaves very, very, close.  Cons - About double as noisy as the seven year old Norelco ($120 then) that it replaced.</li>
            <li> Best electric shave I&#x27;ve had in years (the twin foils/blades seem to really make a difference). And outstanding value. Plus usual Amazon great service and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The product kind of sucks. It doesn&#x27;t provide a clean shave and if you have a lot of facial hair it is practically useless plus it&#x27;s only good for people who keeps a regularly shaving but it still doesn&#x27;t give that smooth shave that is wanted. No doubt a waste of money</li>
            <li> I enjoy the razor but I wish they would sell replacement foils.  I have three and the foil has failed on two of them but the razor will operate(without shaving).</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LIKES IT.  HE SAID IT IS GOOD FOR A QUICK TOUCH UP</li>
            <li> When my expensive Braun gave up the ghost I purchased Braun&#x27;s version of the travel razor and used it for about a year. I was impressed enough with the quality of shave, and especially the price, to get another when the foil disintegrated. Then I came across this even cheaper Remington whose twin cutter tempted me to give it a try. A couple of months later I&#x27;m not disappointed. Sure the Braun gave a closer shave but it took more work and wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable is the MSC-140. I can buzz through a two-day growth in no time with this baby, and what I like even more is it works on my NiMH rechargeable batteries where the Braun would not. And yes, a trimmer would be nice but come on; if you really need a trimmer you should buy a real trimmer anyway. A decent, comfortable shave, works with my rechargeables and cheaper than replacing the cutter and screen on an expensive model, what&#x27;s not to love about that?</li>
            <li> My husband has use several other kinds of shavers and didn&#x27;t like any of them. He got 3 of these because we can&#x27;t find them anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver based on the numerous reviews that stated that this thing was just as good as a full sized and full priced electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not.  It does not have the power to hack through a couple days of growth without having to make numerous passes.  I bought this because I thought I would be able to use it when I don&#x27;t have time to shave the old fashioned  way.  Unfortunately, because it takes so many passes, it doesn&#x27;t really save time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this thing 100 times if I was simply looking for a shaver to get me by while traveling.  However, I would not buy it again to hack off three days worth of growth in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> It works fine, just does not have the trimmer that I needed.</li>
            <li> A classic example of mediocrity. Yes it is dependable whining away without fail. Has an odd cutting action that seems to miss one day then hit the next because it likes only strong hard hairs, it slides over weaker hairs like they are not there. Slow! Takes too long to shave seems like it takes 5 to 10 minutes - after a while you will give up. I only use it since I spent my shaver budget and can&#x27;t afford another.  Why all the positive comments on this razer? Mine is not broken so I likely have a typical example of it and I don&#x27;t believe that the positive comments come from real daily users.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s  Cheap.  Uses 2 AA batteries.  Good battery life.  Decent shave if used every day.    Con&#x27;s  Doesn&#x27;t come with batteries.  Cap doesn&#x27;t stay on.  Cleaning brush is hard to remove from cap.  Doesn&#x27;t handle anything more than a day or two&#x27;s growth.    Other Thoughts  For the price hard to beat, it is a cheap shaver so don&#x27;t set the bar to high. Nonetheless if used everyday it gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of these MSC-140&#x27;s and they all fail for the same reason.  The foil falls out and then you can throw it away.  But then again it is a throw away anyway.  Until the foil falls out these two foil shavers are far better than the single foil cheap throw away shavers.  So I&#x27;ll probably keep buying more of these.  If someone can find a place to buy replacement foil heads only - let me know.  I have three of these without heads in my bottom drawer.</li>
            <li> this product seemed like what I was looking for.  It wasnt.  It does not trim at all. Maybe its me  but I dont use it</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but the cap does not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a travel shaver, but I shaves better/closer than my Panasonic Linear.</li>
            <li> I chose this battery operated razor for my husband to take on our travels. It is light weight and small, yet does as good a job shaving as his regular at-home razor.  Although he takes extra batteries when we travel, he has never needed to change them over a 3-week trip even with daily use.  On every trip he raves about the convenience of this razor and thanks me again for finding it for him.  In his words, &amp;#34;I highly recommend this Remington Foil Travel Shaver.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I did not expect much for 10 bucks so I can&#x27;t complain, but I am going to give you a review that is accurate unlike the rest of these. I even attached a picture after, I see they did not allow it though after publishing. I didn&#x27;t think they would. It didn&#x27;t look like I had shaved at all lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s possible that I got a bad shaver, but I have other Remington shavers.  The Remington short cut is great for body hair and short/tight hair cuts. I also have a Whal Trimmer lithium which the battery last for ever On a charge, and I have a Norelco Bodygroom BG2040, which is what I grabbed to actually shave what this #140 did not cut. As usual the Norelco did a great job, but it does irritate my face and that&#x27;s why I was looking for something different. The Whal trimmer I use to assist haircuts. Now, the Remington #140 definitely doesn&#x27;t irritate your face because it doesn&#x27;t cut anything ;)  I only made this purchase based on the reviews. To call this a shaver is a joke, you might as well take the razor head out of it, put the screen back on , and try to shave without the blade in it. That&#x27;s about how effective it is, seriously not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I typically will use an electric razor to knock down the length before using a disposable blade. At that point my beard growth is about a .5 on the trimmer scale if you went by a standard guide of #1, #2 and so on. #.5 is enough where it&#x27;s uncomfortable to shave with a blade and needs to be knocked down before you can use a disposable blade(gillette sensor 3) . This razor cut about 10 percent of my beard growth. What that means is if a guy had 100 whiskers hypothetical  number, this would cut 10 of them and only a quarter of the length of those 10, and that is after running it 20 times over the same area in every direction over and over. If you went over that same area 100 times , you might get 30 percent and again a quarter of the length only. I have taken a picture and uploaded it ,not sure they will allow it. The picture is of my chin after I went over the area , over and over and over again, approx 25 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. Unfortunately one trimmer does not do it all, that&#x27;s why I have different ones, each are good at different trimming tasks. The Remington 140 is good for nothing.</li>
            <li> Bought this several years ago. It still operates, but it never shaved well. Not even useful for travel.</li>
            <li> I have a love-hate relationship with this razor.  I love the fact that it is lightweight and inexpensive.  The price allows me to have one by the bed, on in the bathroom, one in my luggage, one at the office and on in the car.  And every time you throw in a new set of AA batteries, it is like you have a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the screen breaks loose from the head after a few months and Remington will not sell you a new $.50 replacement head with the screen. But since they warranty the damn thing for a year, you can get a whole new razor under warranty.  Corporate ignorance abounds!</li>
            <li> husband loves these, they last a long time</li>
            <li> This is as good as any of the more expensiove electric razors out there.  Like all electric razors, if you decide to do a Grizzly Adams and let yuour beard grow, this won&#x27;t be much help.  If you shave every day, then this will definitely work.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this shaver.  A super light-weight Remington shaver at a great price, and so many positive reviews.  I bought three (to get free shipping).  It was a good thing I bought three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  So light weight and so easy to hold.  Ergonomically it is a perfect shaver.  It shaves like an expensive shaver, close and fast (I have a light beard). The batteries lasted a long time, no complaints there.  Easy to clean, just like my many other Remington shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Really just one.  Before the second set of batteries were discharged my first shaver broke.  The shaver screen let go on the back side.  So I started using the second shaver and just like the first one the screen let go in the same place and at almost exactly the same time.  Just as the shaver was slowing down indicating the batteries were beginning to get low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;m on my final shaver.  So, between now and when the second set of batteries get low I have to find a new shaver.  If only this shaver would last like some of the other reviews said it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance rates 5 stars, but length of service is only worth 1 Star, so I give this shaver 2 Stars.  If you think nothing of buying a $150 shaver every 2 years then this shaver is a better deal and you get new heads with each shaver.  But I expect more from a Remington shaver.  My previous Remington shaver have been far more cost effective that $75.00 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish these light-weight shavers lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  To make them last longer EXTREME care must be taken to assure that at NO time is only on side of the foil being used.  Both the top and the bottom foil must be touching your face at all times.  With such care they last as much as twice as long.</li>
            <li> Great shave! Only disappointment, no trimmer. Must carry a blade razor or scissor for long hairs.</li>
            <li> Buy this. Best shaver I have owned.  2 AA alkalines powers. $12 best buy. Best Remington. Great brand. Buy it.</li>
            <li> great  razor that runs on batteries and works like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;i am VERY happy with this and will be taking it with me on&lt;br /&gt;all my travels.</li>
            <li> this is a nice cheap razor. i&#x27;ve never had an expensive razor, just cheap ones. most cheap razors in the past-i&#x27;ve thrown away after a few uses-bad shaves plus razor burn. this razor shaves relatively close with only mild razor burn. i use it often</li>
            <li> I like this shaver but it don&#x27;t give a close shave but is great on the go.  The first one I bought was at Kmart but thay no longer sell these.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Remington travel shavers for a number of years, and this is the third edition I&#x27;m familiar with.  For me, this razor is all I need to supplement my non-electric razors.  Why spend 5 to 10 times as much on rechargeable electric razors when this gives every bit as good of a shave?  In addition, two AA batteries last an amazing length of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in JUL 2011.  What a bargain at Amazon.  This razor has become one I use a great deal.  Batteries last for a long time and a good shave. This can easily be a primary razor and I have a tough beard.  I am thinking of buying another one of these just in case and they are so cheap in price. Definetly recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> After 18 months the foil pops up on side so I am buying a replacement. It fits well in the hand and does the job. The cap does tend to come off, the power switch is a bit soft but overall a good value. Runs well on rechargeable alkaline or other rechargeable AA.</li>
            <li> To be expected with low price cordless - razor burn</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver to use between shaves. Works great. Batteries last. Shaves close.</li>
            <li> THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT.  THE PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED IN LESS THAN GIFT CONDITION.  I WROTE TO THE COMPANY AND THEY APOLOGIZED AND REFUNDED THE TOTAL AMOUNT (price &amp; shipping) THE NEXT DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM UNABLE TO REVIEW THE ITEM AT THIS TIME SO I GAVE IT A THREE BECAUSE YOU CAN&#x27;T CONTINUE WITH THE REVIEW UNTIL YOU RATE THE PRODUCT - A SILLY AMAZON REQUIREMENT THAT SKEWS PRODUCT RATINGS...  MAYBE THEY SHOULD ADJUST THEIR SOFTWARE.</li>
            <li> Very good product, great for taking on vacations and it shaves as good as $160.00 electric razor. Also long battery life.</li>
            <li> After trying the \\&quot;titanium turbo\\&quot; and it having a hard time shaving the neck area plus the foil breaking through a bit I ordered this(should of done so first but didn&#x27;t see it after the fact.)   It shaves fairly well including the neck area.  It has two foil/cutters that do a better job than the titanium turbo could.  The cutters are affixed which actually makes it better to clean with the supplemented brush in the headguard.    So far after a week its great!   Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best shaver I have ever used. It gives me the closest shave. It is very comfortable to hold. It is great. My brother-in-law liked it so much he bought one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably had about 8 of these over the last few years.  Keep one in the office, the car, the other car, anywhere I think I may need a touch up.  Don&#x27;t take the number of these that I&#x27;ve gone through as a note of poor quality... far from it, but deployments, dirt, dust, and excessive abuse takes it&#x27;s toll.  For 10 bucks, I always have at least one on hand in case I lose one and need to replace it.  Can&#x27;t go wrong, and the shave it gives is pretty darn good too.  Definately will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This shaver is an excellent value. I have used it for quite a while and i get great results. I am thinking of ordering a spare!</li>
            <li> Better than any electric razor I have used.  Beats the N______ that cost me ten times more.  My older model Remington still works fine but the rubberized cover over the push-button switch wore out and am cautious not to get it near water...still works fine though.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent.  If I need it again I will buy the same again.</li>
            <li> This is a great travel electric razor. Cuts just as well as my plugin , rechargeable fullsized Remington.  Runs off of 2 AA batteries.  A little noisey but cuts well</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon due to all the very positive reviews. I&#x27;ve owned Norelco triple heads, Braun pockets, and Panasonic ES4025 (best, but the battery finally failed; they don&#x27;t make these anymore).  Foils on the Norelco and Brauns didn&#x27;t last very long, and were too expensive to replace (that&#x27;s the agenda, no?).  So I bought this Remington to replace the ES4025.  It worked well for 3 months - probably almost as good as the Panasonic, although it was noisy w quite a bit of vibration.  Unfortunately - as noted in some other reviews - the foil came unhooked from the inside and kept coming off.  I tried gluing the foil in place from the inside but it still kept coming off, so now this shaver is useless.  Generally I&#x27;m not especially hard on my things (the ES4025 lasted 3 years w no problems), so there&#x27;s no excuse for this poor design quality.  I will never buy Remington again.</li>
            <li> It works well for the price</li>
            <li> I used this almost daily for four months till the screen wore out.  You can&#x27;t get a replacement screen, but at this price, the whole thing is cheaper than other model&#x27;s replacements, so just ordered another one. I do not have a tough beard, but it gets it plenty smooth.</li>
            <li> Good for travel (light, uses AA which you probably already carry when traveling), not really a replacement for home/daily use.</li>
            <li> works good on my beard (your mileage my vary as this seems to be very individual) - one less thing to charge- the batteries are easy to buy anywhere you go.  only downside- small size takes a bit longer to shave.</li>
            <li> A good razor, not the best. But better then you might suspect for the price.</li>
            <li> Convenient to carry but doesn&#x27;t get down to the skin without multiple strokes.</li>
            <li> I am glad they continue to make this same shaver. This is my third purchase. It does last a few years before the foil screen cracks and go bad then you&#x27;d need to buy a new one as I don&#x27;t believe you can buy replacement foil (nor the shaver cutter head). My previous two shavers were replaced due to broken foil screen. Price is reasonable so it&#x27;s not costly to replace. I don&#x27;t have heavy/thick facial hair so this serves me well for a quick 1-2 minutes shave on a daily basis. It does shave fairly close to your skin so result is good. I use rechargeable 2500 mAh AA batteries-they do seem to last quite a few weeks before requiring recharging. It comes with a small cleaning brush and a clear plastic shaver head protection cover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to like electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Usually i am disappointed in their performance. If not dissapointed at first, I will be eventually due to recharge batt not being full power or just basic decline in performance... and some shavers are expensive. Well, this $10 shaver isn&#x27;t too different than the expensive ones, performance wise, and seems to stay full power for awhile. AA batts are cheap, so I dont mind. Batteries seem to last a long time. I don&#x27;t use this daily,but its just great to have for certain situations. I think it COULD be a daily shaver, since daily beard maintenance means it wont have to cut any long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With short stubble this shaver is a great. Pretty smooth results. Surprisingly powerful... If my stubble grows past a certain length, the shaver will have trouble, missing some long hairs that have \\&quot;curved\\&quot;....but so did the expensive ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a nice, cheap grooming tool with great results with short stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one Ive owned. My first one, the foil got damaged somehow. Keep that protector on it, it may be fragile....but for $10 I would expect that.</li>
            <li> i was glad to find a shaver by a name brand like Remington for a great price.  less than half the cost of a replacement blade on a standard electric shaver.  enjoy and keep one in the car to shave on the way to work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and tried this on my legs.  My husband thought he needed to show me how to use an electric razor and he couldn&#x27;t get it to do anything either.  I don&#x27;t know why they bother to make these useless things. I can&#x27;t even call it a razor.  I sent it back and got my money back.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, I wish the foils would last longer, but its meant to be a disposable product so all in all, I am pleased</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for travelling and working as expected.I am very pleased for my choosing and hope to by more products</li>
            <li> Works really well, I now use it instead of my more expensive electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using these shavers as my main shaver for a number of years and I continue to be impressed! This is an amazing value for the money. This shaver is lightweight, easy to clean, fairly quiet and gives a very close shave. I have never found a better battery powered shaver than this!</li>
            <li> A really good portable shaver with a very good price in a small package that is easy to pack for trips.</li>
            <li> A great shaver. It&#x27;s advertised as a travel or touch-up shaver but I use it every morning at home. If I recall correctly it&#x27;s also advertised to last approximately one year but I&#x27;ve been using mine for well over two years and it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li> Best battery operated I have ever bought. Came back and bought another TWO!</li>
            <li> Remington MSC 140 cuts horrible</li>
            <li> For what it is ---a low cost shaver--- this little shaver is an excellent choice. It gives a great shave, and the battery life is surprisingly long. It weighs almost nothing and has a good handle feel. You cannot get new foil screens or cutters, but at the price, that&#x27;s no problem. When they wear out, I&#x27;ll just order another of the same shaver from Amazon and keep using it.</li>
            <li> I order these for someone else and they love them.</li>
            <li> I have several different makes and prices of elect razors. This one works better than any of them including my super duper expensive ones. Great value and you do not need a charger. Just replace the batteries every couple of months or so.</li>
            <li> For a cheap shaver it works very well for a quick shave well worth the money great value would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Used this razor for about 3 months, works fine until yesterday, when half of the shaving head screen popped out rendering the shaver useless.  It costs almost twice as much as the razor to replace the shaving head and screen.  Not very happy with Remington razors right mow.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shaver... over 200 reviews... 4 star average rating... $10... sounds great right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong! Even for a foil \\&quot;travel\\&quot; razor, this Remington shaver was a disappointment. Within minutes of use, my face felt irritated and upon inspection, I noticed small cuts... from an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the foil starts to get very hot after two or three minutes of shaving. I have not experienced this when using other foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;This being said, this shaver will work if you have no other razor, a few days growth, and a regular razor to finish the job. If this sounds like exaggeration, it&#x27;s really not. I used this razor for four days (I shave every other day) just to test it out. At the end of my testing, I concluded that the Remington Titanium Travel Shaver is really not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I have yet to understand why this shaver is labeled \\&quot;titanium.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Shaves closer than my Norelco PT730 rotary at about 1/5th the cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it was rechargeable.  It&#x27;s a hassle having to remove the AA NiMHs and charge them every few days to a week.  The razor really sings the first two shaves, but it stars slowing down a little on the third shave.  The slow-down doesn&#x27;t affect it&#x27;s performance too much, but if it were rechargeable, it would be freshly charged and singing on every shave.  I don&#x27;t want to carry a separate charger nor extra batteries when I travel somewhere for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, a good bargain!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 15 year old son for Christmas. He doesn&#x27;t shave often, so I thought this would be perfect. It didn&#x27;t take any of the hair off of his chin and he had pressed so hard that it left scratches.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it wasn&#x27;t expensive, I&#x27;m sad that I wasted money on it. He is not happy at all about this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to buy him another one that will work.</li>
            <li> Took this on a trip where I wouldn&#x27;t have access to electricity.  I loaded it with lithium batteries.  It makes lots of noise but when I was done shaving, it was hard to tell that anything was accomplished.  I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these and in both cases the foil head came apart and could not be fixed.  Tossed them both away</li>
            <li> Gives me a very close, smooth shave.  Better than the regular electric razors I&#x27;ve owned.  A real performer.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before and like the weight and comfort.  Only problem is the cover which will not stay on properly which will expose shaver to knicks.</li>
            <li> An amazing razor for only $10. It lasts long enough on two AA batteries to take on a two week trip without worry. As far as a close shave - only a straight blade razor would beat it. Also, as I have very fair skin, a gentle shave in required and this does that nicely, even for the more delicate areas.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shaver and has been for quite a few years. He loves it and says the shave is close and easy to operate without charging like others. Well worth the money and so reasonable.  It&#x27;s great.  Just wish we could find them in the stores such as Walgreens.  I believe that is the first place I  bought this shaver for him years ago.  But as long as I can order online I will. An excellent product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> A great disposable razor for the price.Do not expect long term life due to poor foil construction. Due to price it is a decent unit.I suggest ordering more then one at a time.</li>
            <li> 5 stars based on value. Power switch has issue after months of consistent use, but it has given me a closer shave than $100+ razors of the same style. I&#x27;m buying two now because I can&#x27;t find them at Walmart any more.</li>
            <li> This takes AAA batteries, which is great for travel, since you can always buy them if yours die. So much better than rechargeables. This razor gives for smooth shaves, quickly. Not quite as smooth as a proper wet shave, which is why only 4 stars, but if you&#x27;re travelling or in a hurry, this is a nice razor that won&#x27;t steer you wrong.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money, it doesn&#x27;t cut your hair</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Convenient and great for touch up shaves. good value for the inexpensive price. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> cuts reasonably close, takes rechargeable batteries just fine&lt;br /&gt;Only drawbacks are (1) very loud, and (2) no replacement blades or foil, so when it wears out, you just pitch it. At first unsettling, but then you realize it&#x27;s a 10 dollar shaver! (I&#x27;ve paid more for replacement foils...)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned very nice, very expensive shavers before.  They didn&#x27;t last a year before the recharging feature decided to stop functioning.  This razer works off of batteries and for the cost, I think I prefer this one.  If it stops working, you don&#x27;t feel a hit in the pocket book like with the expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The plastic foil head fits too loosely.  I hold mine on with a rubber band.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to damage the foil heads, after all.</li>
            <li> please do not buy this item. It cuts nothing. It makes you feel touching a very light and cheap item. do not spend battery charge for thi rubbish item</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!!  The only thing is that they have a short life, but for the price it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Great smooth,comfortable shave, Easy to use, batteries easy to change, The shaver very easy to cleanlong life with AA batteries,convenient.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for travel/camping or as a back-up.  But NO screen replacement is available.  Dis-appointing feature.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver to leave at work.  It is helpful for those days when I miss a spot or want a touch up if I am going out right after work.  I certainly have no complaints about it and would buy another one.</li>
            <li> This is a good, reliable value.  For a very economical appliance, it delivers very satisfactory performance.  I keep it in my car for beard touch-up every other day.</li>
            <li> What a great product! Shaves nice &amp; smooth. Was at a good price too! .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a different cheap cordless from a discount store but was disappointed.This one however is amazing:shaves close and fast enough.Best of all,the battery life is longer than expected.If it ever gives up,i just order a new one.For this price,why bother with replacing parts?</li>
            <li> I have used one for travel for four or five years.  I am buying another.  The old one still works but believe cutters are a bit worn.  Probably gets used only 45 or 50 times a year.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> I shave with this every day.  This is not as good as a $100-150 razor but for the price it is truly amazing.  You just replace it 2-3 times a year and I prefer batteries because my other remington razors never could keep a charge longer than a day after the first six months.  Plus there are no cords to mess with.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with a foil shaver, you know that once you get a little tear in the foil- it&#x27;s all over. It&#x27;ll start cutting your face. There&#x27;s definite savings against buying disposable razors, plus the comfort and ease of use. I used it everyday for several months before it finally tore. I was hoping it would last a little longer but I got my money&#x27;s worth.  And I&#x27;ll probably do it again.</li>
            <li> I would not say buy this item. I bought 2 and when you go to clean the blades out with the bursh they fall out . the first time this happened ,the bladed went down the drain . You cand replace them eather !!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a small portable to be able to take when traveling.  I had no idea what to expect when I originally ordered this electric razor.  Since receiving it, I&#x27;ve ordered a second to keep as a spare.  As long as you have good batteries in it, it works quite well and is very easy to use. It outperformed my expectations, hence the second one ordered. 12-16 I&#x27;ve now ordered a third and fourth razor. (I&#x27;m rough on the foil guards. But these came with a plastic cover for them!) I purchased two electric razors in the interim and took them both back because these little razors were actually better.  I will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I had a Titanium shaver from a different  manufacturer (the As Seen On TV one) and absolutely loved it.  Unfortuantely, it died after a couple of years and I replaced it with this...another very good value for $10.00.  It does not do quite as good a job as the prior one but it is fine.  My only gripe, since it is a &amp;#34;travel shaver&amp;#34; is that it didn&#x27;t come with a clip-on guard so it can be easily damaged if you put it in your Dopp kit withouth protecting it somehow.</li>
            <li> I have been using these shavers for years.  They are great for keeping my head smooth and shiny while on location.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start off by saying that this is not a recommendation:  I never could recommend any electric shaver, being a confirmed blade user.  Still, as far as electric shavers go, this one is great to keep in the briefcase or glove box for a quick touch up.  I expect it will get only a few uses a year, and so the blades should stay sharp enough to last until the entire shaver gets replaced.  Finding a small, inexpensive battery-operated shaver in local stores was impossible, but once again, Amazon came through with a huge inventory to choose from.</li>
            <li> hurt my skin. does not shave close. very loud. buy the braun pocketgo, double the price but has a REAL foil which will shave and not pull your hair, is quiet and in addition has a rounded trimmer. waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor out there because it&#x27;s not rechargeable.  The aa batts last a long time.  and its inexpensive.  I have owned 10+ of the $60 or $70 razors, they all die in a year or so.  What a waist!!!!  ive had one of these for over two years, it rocks!</li>
            <li> I bought this one for travel because of the size &amp; price. works great as good as my electric. maybe just use it all the time. very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The razor is great but head only last for a month or so, that is why I have bought so many razors. The replacement heads cost more than the razor itself.</li>
            <li> This little razor works really well.  Bought for my 13 yr. old grandson to keep him looking handsome. He thinks he is looking better every day.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for travel or daily use.&lt;br /&gt;At first I bought one of these a couple years ago for travel but after my home shaver broke I started using as my daily shaver because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;If used daily, it provides a smoother and closer shave than even my blade shaver provides.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit loud but I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;Also, beware that some rechargeable AA batteries are just slightly too large to fit.</li>
            <li> This razor is underpowered and too weak to shave with. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you try, it will leave the stubble on your face and  you will never get a close shave. Save your money and buy something that&#x27;s a lot better.</li>
            <li> I leave this in my car or sometimes pack it when I want to travel light, Not quite as good as my Norelco but at literally one tenth the cost a pretty close second.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 3 year old panasonic with this Remington.  I don&#x27;t have that much facial hair but do shave daily (asian facial hair).  Maybe once a month with a razor.  I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the performance of this little shaver.  I put some enloop rechargables in this bad boy and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Still on the first set of rechargables for at least 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my daily shaver and I believe I have found a gem.  Thus far it seems like it&#x27;ll last forever... Another 3 year shaver for under 15 bucks!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  I have probably purchased 6 or more over the past.  The only glaring problem is that the screen often separates from the razor and renders it useless.  I have thrown away about 4 razors.  If the screen could be replaced, it would be a five star product.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, very fast motor. Amazing razor,especially for the price.  I ordered 5 more for family and friends.  Only downside, no trimmer. But overall a better shave than any of my other cord-cordless razors.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009OAFVG Remington MSC-140 Men&#x27;s Titanium Battery Operated Foil Travel Shaver]] This travel shaver works better than almost all of the electric shavers I have previously used--I use it almost every day and continue to be amazed at how close and quickly it works for me.  I plan order at least one more for \\&quot;back-up.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This shaver does a good job and runs off of AA batteries. That is my highest level requirement. It tends to miss some hairs that are thin so that is why I only gave it 4 starts. Other than that I like how long it runs on a single set of batteries, I travel a lot and use it while traveling and have gotten up to 6 months on a single set of batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought five. They are gifts to be taken to family in Vietnam. I am American, but my wife is from Vietnam. I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years, and it lasts quite a long time. It is money well spent. For all that, I can only speak for myself. If you are disappointed, please do not blame me, it was you who made the choice. I get no gain from what I say, other than I enjoy sharing my experience. If one buys it, I hope you will be at least as happy as I have been.</li>
            <li> I startet to use this type of shaver approximately 7 years ago and since then I did not change the type of my shaver. You need to renew it after 2 years or less,but I recommend and use only this one.</li>
            <li> Great razor to keep in the glove compartment. Shaves closer than my ($80) Norelco.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job. I have looked everywhere for this type of razor since I bought one several years ago but could not find one. This razor meets all my expectations and needs.</li>
            <li> I have been use this for years. Good bye expensive razors. Works the same as a expensive electric one. Just buy a good set pr rechargable batteries and you are set for months.</li>
            <li> wow,incredible performance.i really into it.highly recomended not just for emergency shaving but also for  shaving spots that other well known shave&#x27;s often miss them.  than you amazon for providing and uptodating your product.  highly recommend,also for spare part&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Best one on the market.  Gets a SMOOTH finish QUICKLY.  My honey and I both are happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Very awesome and meets up to the good reviews I read. You can shave so quick and smooth. I have thick whiskers and never had one cut so quick and as smooth as this one. In fact I still have the same 2 double a batteries in it for at least 20 plus shaves.</li>
            <li> Keep it handy, it does as well as a large 120V shaver, and as close as a wet razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;cheap shaver&amp;#34; for use meanwhile traffic...&lt;br /&gt;But not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> It just takes too many passes to get a decent shave.  I stopped using it after the one vacation I took it on. I&#x27;ll probably end up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> This product does not shave anything! I&#x27;ve tried shaving long hair and short hair and both do not get shaven with this &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34;. Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Cuts great but there are no parts available for it anywhere! The foil over the blades will eventually rip off but there are no replacements made by Remington! I guess they think cause it&#x27;s only a $10 shaver that people should just order a whole, complete, unit when it breaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, man, really!?</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Will get another as i gave this one 2 family member</li>
            <li> Piece of junk!  I didn&#x27;t bother testing it before heading out figuring I&#x27;ll pop a couple batteries in it when I get there but I guess I should have.  This piece of crap was DOA.  It would not do anything.  I tried 2 sets of brand new batteries and even tried putting them in backwards as a last ditch effort but nothing.  It would have been less troubling to just throw $10 in the trash.</li>
            <li> works great! it is for my pre-teen son and it does the job perfectly. However, I don&#x27;t think I could use it on a regular basis. great as a backup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Wasn&#x27;t expensive and did the job. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> Foil broke after less than a month of use.</li>
            <li> Best shaver.I use it nearly every time I shave.I bought on a year ago and it is amazing.Decided to get an extra for the car.For 10 bucks delivered via Prime sensational!!!</li>
            <li> This thing does not remove facial hair accept in spots, not worth 29 cents let alone 29 doallars.  I got mine a lot cheaper thank goodness.  But I recomment you pass this thing by.  save your money its just not worth it.</li>
            <li> My mother in law loves these for quick touch up in the nursing home!  Didn&#x27;t want the type you have to set on a charger.</li>
            <li> No problems, inexpensive and works.</li>
            <li> Great for a quickie on the run !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model shaver for 4 years. It is meant to be a disposable product, since the blades are not replaceable, but the unit is usually good for about a year. I&#x27;m always able to get a very close, smooth shave without suffering any cuts or scrapes. At $9.99 and free prime shipping, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve had this same remington  razor about 1 1/2 years I bought this as a back up because it is so good and if something happens to the one I use every day I want to have a replacement at hand it&#x27;s just so good.</li>
            <li> Disappointing performance. My old Braun shaver was damaged and I thought I would try a Remington once again.  I had one ages ago. However this MSC-140 is only good if you shave 2 or 3 times a day as it will not cut a very long hair. Also, the head is too broad for maintaining any kind of facial hair.  I purchased another Braun (M90) after this Remington.  It performs much better.  You definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I use this as my primary razor. About once every 6 months to a year the foil comes apart from the head and can&#x27;t be reattached. I just toss it and open another. At the price, it&#x27;s cheaper than buying replacements foils and heads for an expensive razor.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really close shave. For 10 bucks, it&#x27;s half the price of the blades on my expensive razor. Works just as well.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver. Well worth the money. Buy it! It&#x27;ll change your life!</li>
            <li> Doesnt work on pubes... probably works on face but didnt want to go balls to face. Probably goes well in a travel kit and compact.</li>
            <li> I does not work at all and will not even cut straight hair.  DO NOT BUY IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard and this gave me a close shave. Not sure why people are saying \\&quot;it doesnt work\\&quot;. If you are cutting stubble it will work&lt;br /&gt;just fine. If you have long hairs, cut them with a trimmer first. No shaver will cut hair that cannot enter the foil.&lt;br /&gt;The foil guard doesn&#x27;t snap on securely. Not a big deal but should you need to use a rubber band to hold the cover on a brand new shaver? Come on.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the way the little Panasonic feels in the hand. Its heavier and fits nicely into the palm and you can also wash it. All in all, for $10.00 I have no regrets. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/12/13 - The foil now detached from the head. I tried gluing it back a few times but it didn&#x27;t hold for long. Ended up just buying another one.&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/27/14 - ok the foil on the new one detached as well. Folks, If your an adult who shaves on a daily basis, this shaver is just not going to hold up. It did shave good while it lasted. It will probably workout cheaper to spend more $ on a better quality shaver.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this razor. A razor that ran on two AA batteries with no need to charge anything just pop in a fresh set of batteries and you are good to go.First set back, its a throwaway, you can&#x27;t replace the cutting foil or cutting blade. The cutting foil is riveted in and cannot be removed for replacement. When you shave with it it does a pretty good job except it misses a few hairs on my neck that it will not cut and they keep getting longer and will not cut. After two days I&#x27;m clean shaven except for these few stubborn hairs that keep getting longer. If it had a trimmer this would help.&lt;br /&gt;  It is very good for a quick emergency shave but not good to take on vacation for shaving everyday as I did. As a spare shaver to use in a pinch its great. I gave it to my wife for shaving her legs and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Eddy</li>
            <li> Works as well as any electric I&#x27;ve ever used - at the fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Not the closest shave in the world, especially compared to a blade, but it does a very respectable job in short order.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for over a month with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Remington for at least 2 or 3 years.It shaves really well,I LOVE IT.The price is also great.I just ordered 4 more.</li>
            <li> great for use on private areas. very very close shave. i even use it to clean up my back side</li>
            <li> I have no idea how anyone likes this thing. I got it just as a cheap way to do a touch-up between shaves and it can&#x27;t even do that without carving up my face. It seems like the blades were dull from the first shave. I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;ll do if the batteries wear down. Save your money, it isn&#x27;t worth the very, very little it costs.</li>
            <li> I tried using one of these for over a year to augment my blade and save on the cost of same.  I found I was using the shaver more than the blade and it did a very good job of keeping me in acceptable condition.  When my original broke after about 18 months of fairly consistent use, I decided the 12 bucks was worth spending on something that did the job and saved me the cost of constantly using blades.  Does not shave as closely as a blade but does a decent job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if you do not want close shave , can&#x27;t get new blades for it. It is a throw away</li>
            <li> Make no mistake about it, this is a throwaway razor, as its&#x27; blades cannot be replaced, so you may want to order more than one.  It&#x27;s intended for touch-up shaving, such as before going out for dinner after a long day at the office, or before getting off of a long international flight.  It shaves fairly close and comes with a small cleaning brush.  The razor uses two AA batteries so there are no cords to deal with.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a small, cheap, serviceable electric razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out electric shaving but I think this is sort of a poor excuse of a shaver. I don&#x27;t grow much facial hair and this thing still can&#x27;t really shave properly. I don&#x27;t see why everyone in these reviews are raving about this shaver, it hardly does anything.</li>
            <li> Remington the shavers not to bad. does irritate now but many say electric shavers need to grow on you so still waiting for it to not burn but gets the job done</li>
            <li> Ten words are required to submit this form.  We are pleased with this item, but have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> I purchased seven units over a period of two years. Razor works very well in general. Last two had the screen come loose. Called Remington customer service about issue and got no sympathy or help. After I use up the units on hald I will find another brand. Wnen I see a product marked &amp;#34;Remington,&amp;#34; I will move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert F. Lucas</li>
            <li> Being in the military, where shaving is not optional, I have used a number of different shavers over the years. Even though no electric shaver will be the equivalent of shaving with a mach 3 razor, this one comes as close as you will ever get. The most surprising part is the price. I find it hard to believe that any electric razor needs to be more than 10 bucks if this one can do such a great job. Bottom line, don&#x27;t think twice about buying this shaver. Mine is on its second deployment and I used it daily. You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver daily and it shaves as close as my Remington Titanium MS-5100.  I save on batteries with a pair of Ni-MH 3000 mAh&lt;br /&gt;1.2 V rechargeable.  When the shaver begins to slow down, I place the two cells in my Ni-MH charger for a few hours.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> Works fine if you shave every day.  Just won&#x27;t handle coarse beard or more than a day&#x27;s growth.  Handy for travel.</li>
            <li> really surprised,shaves better than a eighty dollar razor that i had tried,wish it was rechargable</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a travel razor and it works great. I tried other battery powered shavers and they don&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as this one does.  I had my first one for about 4 years with use as a daily shaver for about 1 year and combined travel time of 10 weeks over a 3 year period.  The shaver held up fine until I nicked the screen somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased multiple replacements because for the price, weight, and performance it is a great value and perfect for trips.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Lasts long with a single set of batteries. I brought it with me when I traveled to Vietnam for a few weeks and it worked&lt;br /&gt;very good every day. An excellent travel shaver.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money. Product does not cut any hair at all. Maybe I refused a bad product but I doubt it. You get what you pay for. Luckily for me my credit card refunded my money and I shipped this piece of junk to them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other expensive Remingtons over the years . This is as good if not better ! This is a fantastic razor !! I highly recomend this razor !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite stunned that this shaver last as long as it did. I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries after a year, despite using it every other day. I was quite disappointed that there weren&#x27;t any user replaceable parts, which might be why it sells for $10. I&#x27;m not the type that shaves on a daily basis, but every time it does, it gets close as possible without irritation. I also coupled it with pre-electric shave to get an even better shave as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Remington!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time, this is my second unit purchased.  When I need a quick shave, all I do is reach in my office desk drawer or in my carry-on bag and shave away.  The only gripe I have about the unit is you cannot replace the blade and screen set.  You have to purchase a whole new unit and through the old unit into the nearest landfill or recycling center.  Better to allow an owner to use the unit, replacing the blade and screen set as necessary, unti it completely wears out.</li>
            <li> Handy little travel razor. Best battery op travel razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  I am ordering another for a back up.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described, still working, but quality of shaving terrible</li>
            <li> Better than expected,  Very good.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how well this shaver works, especially for the money.  I use it when I travel, but it shaves every bit as close as my $150 Braun shaver.  Do I expect the Remington to last as long?  No, but at 1/10 the price, I can just buy another.</li>
            <li> After 5 shaves, the screen that covers the blades came loose and could not be reattached. The razor was unusable. Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t work well and all, but the horrifying thing about it is that the blades eat through the foil and cut your face, it is simply a dangerous item. I call on Amazon to remove item before it really hurts someone. I would rated lower but 1 star is as low as it gets.</li>
            <li> It barely even works. You have to go over the same spot multiple times to even have it shave. The batteries die very fast. It gets clogged very fast as well. It only works if your facial hair is very trimmed.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift and was a one for one replacement that broke after years of use. So I can&#x27;t personally verify it&#x27;s quality. The party it was purchased for liked it well enough to ask for a direct replacement.</li>
            <li> Had another one now I have two</li>
            <li> Good shave, holds a charge, doesnt take long to charge. shaves as wet. Havn&#x27;t had it long but seems durable.</li>
            <li> Works great, a steal for $10.00. Buy a set of rechargeable AA batteries and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this same one 2 or more years ago for my son. He loved it and so when the foil was damaged, I sent him another and he recommended it to some friends. After a month one whole side of the head sheered off despite very careful use and always covering the head before laying it down and keeping it in a case. 2 friends have had the same experience! the head is held in place by 2 plastic clips or pins on each side...must have cheapened them...time to look for a different brand...</li>
            <li> This just did not work good I bought it for my son he didn&#x27;t like this at all</li>
            <li> My husband loves these little razors and keeps one in each vehicle.  Provides a good shave and much less expensive than having to replace the screen on the more expensive models.  I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li> Powerful with rechargeable batteries, and Handy for big hands.&lt;br /&gt;Switch is tricky, but good for preventing accidental triggers.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly did not come with maintenance brush..</li>
            <li> My elderly father goes through about 3 shavers a year and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it is a $70 Norelco, a $90 Bosch or one of this inexpensive Remingtons.  He says they last as long as the expensive ones and the entire unit is cheaper to replace than a set of new blades on the expensive ones.  He says they are all mostly junk, but this is the best value out there.</li>
            <li> Hello, Fast shippment, item arrived as description, good quality. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Let me first say, my facial hair is medium to light. Not heavy.  I usually get a lot of mileage out of most razors/shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I purchased this to have something while I travel, and so I wouldn&#x27;t need to lug my existing Braun home razor each time.&lt;br /&gt;It was so inexpensive (which is all relative) that I purchased a second one, just in case I want to keep one at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I shaved using my existing home Braun shaver as I do each morning. Leaving the \\&quot;hard to get places\\&quot; on my neck.  Then I put this new disposable to the test, to clean up those loose ends.  Ehhh...Mediocre at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I did the reverse order.  I started with this disposable shaver, and did the bulk of my face, leaving the difficult spots for my heavy duty full time home razor.&lt;br /&gt;After several passes over the main areas with the disposable, it did give a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;However, when going over those same areas with my regular razor I noticed some clicks of hairs being shaved that the disposable missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it seems like no razor can easily get to the difficult spot, and this disposable seems to do an \\&quot;average\\&quot; job on general areas, with multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I had a very nice compact (about the size of a wallet) foil razor (don&#x27;t remember the brand, but do think it was Braun) that did a wonderful job, and was very compact and light. While this unit is light weight, it&#x27;s not exactly tiny.  All in all, if you needed something in an Emergency, or want to clean up some 5 o&#x27;clock shadow before heading out to dinner from the office, and found this on a store shelf, then it&#x27;s reasonable for $10.  However, I would not recommend making this an every trip travel razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it functions at a decent level, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for it&#x27;s product category.  For my needs I would give it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This shaver is worth every penny. I purchased for a cheap price and got way more than expected, very Satisfied</li>
            <li> I keep this little guy in my car or desk drawer at work just in case I forget to shave in the morning, works out great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I must have ordered many of them before. It doesn&#x27;t last forever. But, for the price, it is convenient and do the job for me, since I don&#x27;t have that much mustache.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from a razor to an electric shaver. I was skeptical but after a friend telling me he used one, I had to get on board. This shaver is great for a quick clean shave before the shower or in the car on your way to work! For the cost of the other shavers, this one does exactly what I need. I am not only impressed with the shaver, but the cost, size and weight. You can put it in your gym bag or brief case. I&#x27;m getting an extra one so I can keep at home and in my bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this shaver, to keep stubble at a minimum and to maintain a great look, however if your hair gets a bit long, a trimmer or the barbershop would be recommended. It&#x27;s a shaver, not a full on beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Ok as very cheap--used a couple times decided not to take on trip as much less satisfactory compared with Remington rechargeable used at home</li>
            <li> The unit got hot fairly quickly, but very close shave.</li>
            <li> Buy a 20 buck Braun M90, much better choice.</li>
            <li> Had low expectations but this thing actually works well!  My beard isn&#x27;t super thick but it grows fast.  This cheap little toy keeps me from full shaves on the weekend.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t have trimmer, neither can it give a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad that the Remington name appears on this crummy product</li>
            <li> I carried this razor with me whenever I travel. I always have it in the airport or wherever I need. It it&#x27;s simple to use and does the trick. The battery seem to last quite a long time. It even has a safety to keep it from turning on accidentally and running down the battery.</li>
            <li> For under $9.00, I&#x27;m not sure you could ever find a more affordable electric razor. I&#x27;m a bit put off by the fact that the blades and microscreen are expected to last for only 6 months but again it&#x27;s less than $9.00. I&#x27;ve used several Norelco and Remington rechargeable razors and this little razor shaves me as close as any of them did. Granted, I do not have a heavy beard, but for me this is a good razor at an excellent price.  I figure it works out to about 5 cents per shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you need a massage, but it doesn&#x27;t shave worth beans.</li>
            <li> The shaver is good for a quick shave.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my electric shaver but is good enough to get rid of my early evening stubble so that it doesn&#x27;t show much.  Great in a pinch when your electric shaver goes kaput.  Worth it for the low price.</li>
            <li> Even with stubbles of hair, it shaves clean and smooth. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I respect everyone hustle, i don&#x27;t know their stories and what do have to go through to pay bills&lt;br /&gt;but the least i ask is that when you selling something make sure it works,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-thank you</li>
            <li> great shave for a really inexpensive shaver</li>
            <li> Best value for the price. No frills, just a nice close shave every morning for 10 bucks! There&#x27;s no reason not to buy this.</li>
            <li> It does NOT work AT ALL.  Also, came without batteries but I installed the batteries. Has been discarded. I did report to you earlier that it did not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman so I dont have thick hair like a man&#x27;s beard or mustache. I used this to shave my legs with and this couldnt even cut 4 day stubble. I went over it and over it and over it and it must have taken me 20-25 minutes to do one leg and even then it didnt cut everything. I just finally got tired of going over and over the same spot on my ankle- so I quit. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again if it was on sale for a penny and had free shipping. Dull junk is what this is.</li>
            <li> Shave is close &amp; comfortable.  Easy to maneuver, use, and clean.  Light weight.  Better than I expected.  Price is almost at the disposable price point.</li>
            <li> This is the best battery operated shaver I have ever used.It shaves as close as a blade shaver in about the same time frame.Powerful  and easy to clean,easy to handle I would recommend this to anyone who shaves on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> After using a Msc-140 the past five years it never broke down,gives a closer shave as it wears in, and it never burned my skin like the rotary shavers do.To solve some of the complaints people have:1 use a common rubber band to hold the cover on,2 after shaving lightly blow off the cuttings, 3 every three to four days clean the blades with a toothbrush (no water) and 4 when putting the cutting head on the shaver body squeeze the two buttons on each side of the shaver before sliding the cutting head onto the shaver (plastic parts on all shavers will wear down if an item slides over them).Do not apply excess pressure when shaving,instead overlap each pass 1/2 the cutter head width to allow a double cutting. Do not tap or clean the cutting screen as this will soon cause the screen to crack as it is very thin.  Once a week lightly use a standard tripple blade hand shaver after you have shaved to trim stubborn minor hair build up. Above instructions apply to most shavers especially foil type shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Battery will last about a month.  Love the shaver for this price</li>
            <li> i love this shaver , it is very portable, i have one at work and another at home,  not expensive,  delivery was fast.  price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> It shaves close but does not last to long...after two weeks the screen came apart......</li>
            <li> The shaver does exactly what I wanted it for. It&#x27;s a great little shaver to use in a pinch, and it&#x27;s great for taking on the road.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these at 10.00 a piece,  one to give away perhaps, after having used the Panasonic ES3831K Single Blade Travel Shaver (14.00) almost daily for about 6 months, as it is dull by now. Despite having a tough beard, yet the Panasonic gave a close shave when it was new, and despite being a travel razor it performed well for months. And I have a tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,  the brand new Remington does not even shave close when new,  and it is not much better than the  Panasonic at its age even though the latter has been used over 150 times. And if i skip  a day with the Remington I  need to shave for about 5 minutes, going over the same area many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the Remington would not run fast enough using rechargeable (fully so) batteries, which work fine in the Panasonic. I would therefore recommend the  Panasonic for 4.00 more.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly but didn&#x27;t include two batteries as claimed.</li>
            <li> it hurts when shavibg</li>
            <li> Came on time. No problems yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if it cost $100 it would be a steal.  I have no idea how they make such a great razor for so little money.  I use it every day. I&#x27;ve owned it about 90 days and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lawrence Brown</li>
            <li> I buy these 2 or 3 a time, they last about 6 months each and then i toss them.  alot cheaper than buying an expensive one for 50 to $100 which last about a year and then you have to toss it?  gives the same shave as an expensive one.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing, but not by a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;I think it easiest to say &amp;#34;underwhelmed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> HANDY FOR CAMPING ON TRIPS AND VACATION LIGHT AND EASY ON BATTERIES USED IT ON A TRIP FOR TWO WEEKS AND THE BATTERIES STILL HAD JUICE IN THEM.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the handest shaver ever.  I&#x27;m 80 years old. That&#x27;s it,enough said.  Remington was stupid for removing it from store shelves.</li>
            <li> My husband used this for about a year and then it didn&#x27;t shave well after that.  You can&#x27;t buy replacement heads so it&#x27;s basically a throw away item.  It&#x27;s good for an overnite kit but you really need a full blown razor for serious shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used the Remington MSC-140 for years. Keep enough on hand so I can have one in both vehicles and in my motorcycle. Operate well on AA batteries. Get a good close shave while on the go. When the screens give up the ghost after a year or more, I just toss them out. For ten bucks each I more than get my money&#x27;s worth. Just bought three more of them!</li>
            <li> work good but foil brocked in 1 week</li>
            <li> cleans up the stubble very good and in such a hurry.</li>
            <li> Its a bit difficult learn to wear this razor</li>
            <li> It meets the needs I wanted served.  Compact easy to use and it travels well.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Use this on overseas trips. Batteries seem to last about 9 long shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that into electric razors, but this seems adequate.</li>
            <li> This shaver worked so well for over 6 months with just one pair of alkaline batteries that I ordered another pair for keeping in my travel bag. The ergonomics are great and I love this better than shavers that are much more expensive. I&#x27;ve bought 3 so far and keep them in different places for easy access. Even the 1 year old shaver is still working, though takes more pressure to do a clean cut.</li>
            <li> so poor performance.. doesn&#x27;t shave well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not worth the 10$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some stores sell it for 30$ tho</li>
            <li> it does it&#x27;s job. but not great at it. it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> was worth the purchase price and exceeded my expectations. very close shave for an electric razor. just make sure you put in good batteries so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I received this very fast and it wirks great! Could use a little more power but what can you expect from 2 AA batteries. Cuts real close and as I only use it occasionally, it suites me just fine.</li>
            <li> Shaves better than any electric I have ever used.  Batteries are a  pain but I might try rechargeable and see how that goes, but a great shave.</li>
            <li> Due to poor design and manufacturing, the blades cut through the built-in foil retaining (plastic) clips on the removable foil after only about 2 months of use; causing the foil to come loose.</li>
            <li> Worthless. I kept going over the same area over and over but it barely did anything. I&#x27;ll probably throw them away.</li>
            <li> This is the best little electric shaver I have ever owned. If you want a shaver that is handy and cheap, this is it!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this shaver a try. I was amazed in the fact that it provided a decent shave. Ten minutes later I decided to touch up where it missed and it no longer comes on. Ten minutes...I replaced the batteries. No go. No hum, no buzz, no click. The unit died within ten minutes. Normally I would say &amp;#34;Oh Well, it was just ten bucks&amp;#34; but this is a matter of principle. Take responsibility Remington and TRY to provide a product that is worth more than One Single Star. The product may be Ten Bucks, but It should not be a minute of use per dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington should refocus their efforts if this is a product they claim is worth my time and money. Which it is not, by far.</li>
            <li> I love this razor! It&#x27;s cheap but it definitely is not made cheaply. I use it everyday and it probably lasts a yr or so. It would go longer but the screen always wears out. If only I could get screens that fit. But then your sales would go down and you would eventually discontinue them. LOL</li>
            <li> Great little razor for about 10 bucks, beats the way more expensive brands in my opinion, yup i might just order another. That was in March 2015,  It barely lasted 6 months before the foil went belly up, I did notice the price went up significantly, nah it&#x27;s a $10 item, worth no more than that.</li>
            <li> I started use this product long ago, when AAFES used to sell them, Wal-Mart used to carried them. for the price and viable, on the go. O keep one in my travel bag, one in each of my cars, and one in each of my bathroom. I love them little thing. no matter where you go, battery always available no need to bring adapter as you travel  from country to country.</li>
            <li> I have gone through three, each replacing one that failed.  In a month or two, the foil [not replaceable] came loose on all three and the switch became intermittent on all three. They only cost 10 dollars, but not worth it when I&#x27;m left somewhere with half a beard. Pity, since they shave well until the foil pops out.</li>
            <li> Love this! Will be buying another to save. For those who complain about it not cutting anything beyond a days beard growth, well, ever heard of pre-electric shave? I use the lotion before shaving and this thing glides over my face and gives me an amazingly smooth shave with no missed stuble. Also, take care of your things. Clean blades after each use. Duh, highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Great shave and runs a long time on two AA rechargeable batteries.Nice to be able to pop a second set of batteries in while charging the first set. Also has a large head for a faster shave. I&#x27;ve just been using it for a few weeks so I can&#x27;t comment on durability. Now I can comment on durability. The screen came loose and I can&#x27;t put it back. Can&#x27;t find one either. So this shaver isn&#x27;t very durable. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Now all i need Is a mirror...........  I got it for a quick, shave when I forget to shave, and for when,  old what&#x27;s Er name says aren&#x27;t you gonna shave today?  Great price and delivery time</li>
            <li> put batteries in it. not rechargable and ran it for about 1 min and gave up. so if you got lots of time and patience and don&#x27;t want a close shave this is for you.lol</li>
            <li> Powerfull little machine.  i highly recomend it.  It probably wont work well with thick beards but for thin it will work great.  Excellent price too.  Thanks Amazon for the fast shipping and good packaging.</li>
            <li> Real nice portable shaver. Shaves close and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area over and over again. Cost a lot less than regular shavers and does as good a job. Only problem I have had is the switch placement makes it easy to accidentally turn off while shaving. The screen breaks too soon compared to a Braun travel shaver.</li>
            <li> Not the shaver to use for your wedding day - it&#x27;s not that close of a shave. But ideal to keep in glove compartment or desk draw for a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34;. Order 2 of them, at the price point they are a terrific value and cheap enough to just leave one in car and desk.</li>
            <li> BATTERY IS VERY HARD TO GET TO. AN OK SHAVER BUT I WOULDN&#x27;T HAVE PURCHASED IF I&#x27;D KNOWN THAT YOU NEEDED PLIERS TO GET TO BATTERY.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use while out on an extended camping trip.  After about 10 days of use, I noticed my face was getting nicked by it, and I discovered the screen had broken in two places, revealing the blades.  You&#x27;d think something with \\&quot;Titanium\\&quot; in its name would last longer...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad. Has a soft grip and lightweight. Helps him a lot because he has tremors.</li>
            <li> It shaves almost as close as a blade and keeps me on the go when I don&#x27;t have time to shave the blade way. It is fairly inexpensive and worth investing in at least a couple of them. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Shaveman shavers but I was unable to find them when the ones I had wore out. As good as the traveling Shaveman was this shaver gives you a better shave. It does not have a sideburn trimmer like the old Shaveman, but it is a great shaver!</li>
            <li> This is My 2nd one. First one last me about 5 years. Love the product...</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this little shaver.  Shaves unusually smooth and fast.  We bought 4 for gifts.</li>
            <li> foil cuts the plastic tabs that hold it in</li>
            <li> This is the second one I purchased for DH. The first one lasted 3-5 years. This newer one has a touchy button that does not seem like it will last. He has only had it a month or so. The foil does not seem to shave as close as the old one either. It looks identical to the old one but not as well made, and it does not perform quite as good. Maybe it is just this one shaver, so I took off 1 star.</li>
            <li> This is really kids - a total bust!</li>
            <li> good shaver, I have bought 2 so far, they last about 8 months if you use it every day but still worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very good value. I&#x27;ve been using this as a Monday morning shaver for a couple of years now. I initially thought this was DOA. But turns out I&#x27;d pushed in the batteries too much. Pulled both batteries out a notch and used the cover/lid to push close. Problem solved. Other thing to watch for is the foil cover itself. You&#x27;ll eventually open it to clean out under the foil. When you put it back, make sure you&#x27;re holding down the two buttons you used to take it off in the first place. You could push it back on like I did once, but now there&#x27;s a hairline crack on both sides of the foil cover. I will buy another once this dies.</li>
            <li> works well, odd shape falls off things</li>
            <li> It broke within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> nice close shave to get especially when traveling!</li>
            <li> Best shaver for the price gives a nice close shave</li>
            <li> It shaves. Kinda. Not impressive, but better than nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to load batteries because of the tight space. First pair of batteries didn&#x27;t work, but they work fine on my 15 years old Hitachi BM-5200. Another pair of new batteries worked, but very weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic body looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had maybe a dozen electric shavers over the years, some battery, some with cords and 3 circular heads. This inexpensive shaver gives the best shave of them all.  Since the blades can&#x27;t be replaced, I bought 3 of them.  Has no trimmer and the head cover needs a rubber band to stay on.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington Titanium 3 or 4 years ago, used it a little and then forgot I had it in my medicine cabinet in the bathroom.  It wasn&#x27;t that I disliked it but I am such a creature of habit (shaving with a blade razor)  I plum forgot I had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last year I have been using it at least once a week ( I have an early meeting I attend and I don&#x27;t have time to lather up and use my Shick Xtreme blade razor on that morning ) and I am glad I purchased this little gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a card carrying blade razor guy since I was old enough to shave.  I experimented with electric razors a little over the years but they just never gave me the kind of clean, close shave that IMHO a blade delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I have to say that the Remington Titanium gives me almost as close a shave as my blade.  And, hey, I can shave while I&#x27;m reading the news headlines on my computer.  A minute or  so and I&#x27;m good to go.  I take the Remington camping and on weekend trips too. It also comes in handy when I have an evening engagement as I can do a quick touch up shave to make me presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a handy little brush for cleaning that&#x27;s stored in the protective cover.  I use Enelope AA rechargeable batteries and (with light use of the Remington) I probably don&#x27;t have to recharge but once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  mean for only $9.99 it&#x27;s one heck of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any gals reading this the Remington would make a great birthday gift for the man in your life.</li>
