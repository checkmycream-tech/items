            <li> I really liked this product.  A nice mint taste that didn&#x27;t leave an after taste.</li>
            <li> My husband verifies that my breath is better.  My mouth feels good after I brush my tongue!</li>
            <li> Only way to use the tung brush since regular toothpaste gets stuck in the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tastes really nice, but doesn&#x27;t have an aftertaste</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Best on the market but can no longer find it in stores have to order online.  Only see oral brand foam and that does nothing in comparison to Tung.</li>
            <li> Tung gel is the first tongue cleaner I ever used. I started using it about 8 years ago. I have strayed a few times when lured in by great reviews but I always come back to Tung brand. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the aftertaste and how it doesn&#x27;t rinse out easily but I have found a solution to that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Tung gel to the Tung brush and scrub lightly. Then I rinse it out and follow with a tongue scraper. The tongue scraper removes the rest of the residue from the gel and cleans off extra tongue stuff. No more aftertaste &amp; a sparklingly photogenic tongue!</li>
            <li> Good as promised--thank you!</li>
            <li> Great taste after you use it - I forgot that I needed to use mouthwash.  Love the clean taste.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff in place of toothpaste. Love the taste and it works great!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works well.  My mouth feels fresh long after using it too.</li>
            <li> I decided I need to take care of my mouth and teeth.  So I came across the TUNG brush with a sample in it.  I loved it so I chose to get the gel. My tongue felt so CLEAN for 12 hours I can actually FEEL it just using a little dab.  C&#x27;mon, you gotta get this, Think about it, are you really gonna use SUGAR mints to freshen your breath?  (ok, maybe a little here and there when you go to a wedding or something) but you get the point.  Are you gonna use sugarless candy?  That not good for your health....  You gotta take care of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew about this product sooner, I&#x27;m 28 and I had a lot of dental work done.  I don&#x27;t plan on stop using this product anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight is 3.OZ per- bottle, its a lot bigger than you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all its made right here in the USA! :-)</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this product. I now simply can&#x27;t go back to just brushing my teeth and beginning my day without this godsend.</li>
            <li> I really like this gel. It really cleans your tongue, and freshens it very well. I bought the brush, too! Happy with all of it!! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using for the past several years. Very effective product.</li>
            <li> I prefer my toothbrush to this. The gel is not the greatest and the brush is irritating to the tongue. I just get better results brushing with my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product with the proper tongue cleaners. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and this is my second purchase of (four).  I no longer hear complaints about my breath, on the days that I use this product. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> awesome little tool! tongue is cleaner than ever, feels cleaner than ever, and breath is fresher for much much longer!</li>
            <li> Great temporary tongue treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product forever... excellent.</li>
            <li> so clean. i cannot brush my teeth w/ out this and the tung brush and tung sweeper. i am a smoker &amp; my bf hates it, but he cant ever tell ive smoked after i use &amp; brush. the zinc is good!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love with this gel? Excellent cleaning gel. Cleans way better than toothpaste and tastes better. Genius product</li>
            <li> Great for tongue plaque.</li>
            <li> As a &amp;#34;once in a while cigar smoker&amp;#34; I can get some pretty raunchy breath. The tongue brush and this gel works wonders to clean my tongue and freshen my breath. It is a must for any smoker.</li>
            <li> Been using product for years. Bought in large quantities.  Just ran out.  Luckily Amazon was able to locate and fill order.  This product cleans your toungh and surrounding tissue better than tooth paste, mouth wash, water pick, or flossing.  If you have serious health issues and this is a major issue  having a clean mouth, go for it. Thanks.</li>
