            <li>Good product, reasonably priced with a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>These are easy rollers to use if you need to set your hair overnight.</li>
            <li>and it was so easy to come off.</li>
            <li>They are nothing more than foam rollers with extraordinarily substandard fabric around them.</li>
            <li>But other wise love and would recommend to you.</li>
            <li>It also keeps your hair super moisturized.</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t buy they break too easy, not worth it at all</li>
            <li>The frames fall apart non-stop, so you&#x27;re constantly having to fit the pieces back together at the slightest pressure.  </li>
            <li>These rollers give my natural hair a perm-like effect when I wash and set my hair with them, No-heat required!</li>
            <li>Many of the roller ends would break off -- hard plastic end are not durable/flexible.</li>
            <li>these roles to soft  </li>
            <li>Went straight into my other piles of hair products I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used MANY types of rollers in the past and these are by far the most annoying.  </li>
            <li>Just be a little gentle with this brand.</li>

            <li> I love love these rollers. I can now use the rollers versus doing the bantu knots, and its healthier and safe for your hince you won&#x27;t have to use heat to curl your hair. It also keeps your hair super moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering these rollers for myself and my daughter for  years and always happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the rollers are covered in satin so that the foam doesn&#x27;t cling to my hair.  The only drawback is that the satin eventually unravels over time, so you may end up havingi to buy another set.</li>
            <li> I use on partially dried hair or dry moisturized hair produces a sleek bouncy finish.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what i need them to do without sucking all the moisture from my hair into the sponge.  Great even curls!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but was unable to find it again locally.  Therefore, I was delighted when I saw it on Amazon and purchased it immediately.  Although it appears to be the same product, it is not.  The cover on the rollers is stiff and sounds/feels like something other then satin.  I feels very much like material that has been starched.</li>
            <li> Some of the curls started to break after the first time I put them in.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the most pathetic hair rollers I&#x27;ve ever tried to use!  They are nothing more than foam rollers with extraordinarily substandard fabric around them. You can&#x27;t get your hair to roll because the rollers just slide off the hair.</li>
            <li> Rolling my hair with these rollers are great.  It protects my ends.  They can slip off if you are a rough sleeper.</li>
            <li> This item was not meant for my thick Chinese hair. Can&#x27;t hold or do anything. Went straight into my other piles of hair products I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as other brands I tried. But the end result was beautiful curls. For the price of these rollers, they worked for me. Other brands are super expensive. Just be a little gentle with this brand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy they break too easy, not worth it at all...remember the old school pink rollers, yeah, they&#x27;re nothing like those,darn it...</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these.  A foam roller with satin around it so your hair doesn&#x27;t dry out.  Perfect.  However these things are just flimsy.  The satin gets all bunched on either end of the roller or slides off.  The frames fall apart non-stop, so you&#x27;re constantly having to fit the pieces back together at the slightest pressure.  I&#x27;ve used MANY types of rollers in the past and these are by far the most annoying.  When you manage to get them on your hair with the satin intact and without breaking the two pieces apart, It does leave a nice shiny curl.  Good luck holding on to your patience long enough to get two curlers in.</li>
            <li> These are easy rollers to use if you need to set your hair overnight. They work well, and the curls were tight. I would recommend for any busy lady in between salon visits if you need to set your curls quickly.</li>
            <li> Love these use them all the time especially in between roller wraps. The sponge rollers are covered in a satin slip so it helps prevent hair breakage. Wish the satin slips were sewn on because they slide sometimes. But other wise love and would recommend to you.</li>
            <li> these roles to soft  I will not buy them again</li>
            <li> I like the smoothness of the satin covers and the durability of the foam.</li>
            <li> love the satin covers.</li>
            <li> I like to roll my hair. To keep from using to much heat. I love the idea os the satin rollers. I wish the whole roller was cover with the satin and it was so easy to come off. Just like the old school pink rollers the clips do comes apart.</li>
            <li> They are okay...while rolling my hair a few of them came apart and had to reattach...the satin around them seems to bunch up while rolling...would I buy again...I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> do not curl my hair at all</li>
            <li> Good for transitioning hair. The satin keeps your hair from breaking off on the foam. Still recommend using a satin bonnet or scarf over...</li>
            <li> I have really long thick natural hair so i didn&#x27;t have any use for the smaller size and I didn&#x27;t realize they were assorted sizes but they are great. I fount a pack of 12 full size rollers at my local Walgreens. These rollers look beautiful on dry stretched hair!</li>
            <li> Many of the roller ends would break off -- hard plastic end are not durable/flexible. Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonably priced with a variety of sizes. Blends in with your darker hair color so maybe you can go ahead and make a grocery store run with them in your hair [under a scarf].</li>
            <li> These rollers give my natural hair a perm-like effect when I wash and set my hair with them, No-heat required!</li>
