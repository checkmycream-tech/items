    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome razor.  </li>
            <li>I am now very happy that I have both in my collection.  </li>
            <li>Typically excellent quality and craftsmanship from Merkur.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it with Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock and Israeli Personnas, and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!</li>
            <li>and I am impressed by this razor.  </li>
            <li>A hefty, compact, awesome razor.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a closer shave than my Edwin Jagger DE89 (which is also an awesome tool) gives when I add XTG and ATG</li>
            <li>gave me best close shave ever</li>
            <li>Happy shaving!</li>
            <li>that work perfectly well in the Slant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, you might want to consider a blade variety pack to see which ones you like best.  </li>
            <li>I used this razor with a feather blade and it was the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Great slant!</li>
            <li>the chrome finish and knurling is excellent.</li>
            <li>I just wish Merkur made an adjustable slant - THAT would be the perfect razor.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have started with this razor, give me the best shave</li>
            <li>no cuts - best shave I ever got!</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I did not encounter anything like this found this to be a very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While this razor has a great weighty feel it is just as lacking that perfectly balanced</li>
            <li>This thing is incredible.  </li>
            <li>The chrome plating is good, but not as perfect as Muhle chroming.</li>
            <li>Merkur makes a beautiful razor, no doubt about it.  </li>
            <li>IF you have the time and patience to treat this razor with respect, you will be rewarded with a great shave.</li>
            <li>Having said that, the slant does offer a great advantage for people with hair that grows in swirl patterns (as mine does).  </li>
            <li>I am writing this review after having had a really great BSS with the Merkur 37C razor.</li>
            <li>The handle has a great knurling and feels almost like my</li>
            <li>This slant razor does a great job taking out hair growth.</li>
            <li>but I like the weight and am happy otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great razor great quality</li>
            <li>Nothing to fear with it, just give it the respect it deserves and you&#x27;ll get a great shave from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>Great Razor  </li>
            <li>Happy shaving.</li>
            <li>Its still a great razor</li>
            <li>I think it will be great when I find the correct blade for my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy.</li>
            <li>Shaves great.</li>
            <li>Great shave.</li>
            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be happy.  </li>
            <li>Very nice razor.</li>
            <li>Great razor, requires good technique regarding shave angle etc.</li>
            <li>razor has a good amount of heft, which is great in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Feels great in hand and looks great on the counter top!</li>
            <li>What a pleasant mistake.  </li>
            <li>I found this would best fit my needs.</li>
            <li>I find that to be a superior combination for me.  </li>
            <li>Merkur 37C  Astra Superior Platinum</li>
            <li>This was a good thing, he says.</li>
            <li>If I could combine the fit, finish, and balanced feel of the Edwin Jagger DE89BL and the weight and cut of the Merkur 37C that would be an awesome razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My experience with this razor is nothing but good.</li>
            <li>Size and weight are good.</li>
            <li>Good knurling on the handle.</li>
            <li>Use of a good Shaving</li>
            <li>experience should be a good one.</li>
            <li>The outcome is a super close shave especially good for thicker, rougher stubble.</li>
            <li>The blades that work the best in the 34c aren&#x27;t the same as the blades that work best in this #37c.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT RAZOR,CUTS STUBBLE LIKE A HOT KNIFE CUTS THROUGH BUTTER!</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>It is nice and stout with a good weight to it.</li>
            <li>The first week was the best shave or my life.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is an amazing razor.</li>
            <li>A truly amazing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do get an amazingly close shave with each use,  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>The sound feedback is great</li>
            <li>Nice weight and balance.</li>
            <li>Aggressive in a nice way.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t replace the need for good technique, but it makes the shave noticeably more efficient.</li>
            <li>, the 37C is a nice razor but is lacking in a couple of areas.</li>
            <li>I got a sample pack and think I&#x27;ve settled on the feather blades which are really nice.  </li>
            <li>I have a nice brush, Tribute shave cream, And Proraso preshave cream.</li>
            <li>As with any shaver (even a &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; one) - always have a styptic stick handy.</li>
            <li>The plating isn&#x27;t as nice as the EJ DE 89.</li>
            <li>The weight of the razor is good and never feels too light (which is good in DE shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The weight of the razor is nice and</li>
            <li>I want  but effective for avoding said problems.</li>
            <li>Nice finish..</li>
            <li>The razor looks nice and does provide a close shave</li>
            <li>Nothing that didn&#x27;t stop bleeding on its own bedre the end of the shave.  </li>
            <li>It requires a light touch to use but rewards that light touch with an excellent shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The feel on my face (I&#x27;m using Astra blades) is incredible, very smooth and quick across the beard.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure your technique is on-point because the blade exposure is very prominent.</li>
            <li>That said, I recommend buying a cheap safety razor, get good at shaving with it, and then buy a nice slant razor.</li>
            <li>That said, I recommend buying a cheap safety razor, get good at shaving with it, and then buy a nice slant razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great razor and worthy of giving it a try.</li>
            <li>when speaking of a chrome finish, it is near flawless in its finish.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I have used!</li>
            <li>Three stars because *any* slant razor is kind of a specialty, niche product that is often overkill.... probably not for most shavers.</li>
            <li>I would say this is a great razor and well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably never find the perfect setup, but you can certainly find a comfortable one.</li>
            <li>Best razor I ever used  gets a really close shave baby face smooth but you can&#x27;t  put no pressure on the razor or it will cut you</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t agree, just use a VERY light touch and if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll have no problems with this razor.</li>
            <li>Weight and slant did seem to give a better cut and very smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Good technique, very light pressure, quality lather, and the right blades make all the difference.  </li>
            <li>many have said, this takes experience to use.</li>
            <li>And I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li>many have said, this takes experience to use.</li>
            <li>And I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li>Hold the Top and unscrew the bottom</li>
            <li>and in one pass I&#x27;ll be more than presentable.</li>
            <li>It is certainly more &#x27;aggressive&#x27; than a straight-bar razor, however don&#x27;t let that deter you.</li>
            <li>Hoffritz slant blade razor which had seen better days and was truly worn out.</li>
            <li>Imagine a capital letter T and now tilt the top bar so that instead of pointing to 3 and 9 o&#x27;clock, it&#x27;s pointing to 3:30 and 9:30.</li>
            <li>I am glad I chose the 37HD over the 34HD.</li>
            <li>Close shave and extremely agile in your hand.</li>
            <li>This razor goes to the top of my favorites</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>It cuts better than my 34c.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for 3 months with my Edwin Jagger which I love.</li>
            <li>Even with my preshave and Tabac shaving soap this baby bites into the face when you try anything more than 2 passes.</li>
            <li>I have gotten to better with this lawn mower.</li>
            <li>I find that because there is more space between the blade and razor, it doesn&#x27;t clog up.</li>
            <li>Whereas with a cartridge and even with a safety they will clog and you spend more time rinsing.</li>
            <li>I find that because there is more space between the blade and razor, it doesn&#x27;t clog up.</li>
            <li>Whereas with a cartridge and even with a safety they will clog and you spend more time rinsing.</li>
            <li>and it took way to many passes to get the job done.</li>
            <li>More agresive then the 34c</li>
            <li>Then there may be no reason to buy another razor again &#x3D;).</li>
            <li>[Revised review:]</li>
            <li>To read my articles that include my evolution of opinion on this razor (from fear to infatuation to apathy) and much more, check out shavelikegrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com and be sure to substitute periods (.)</li>
            <li>I bought the Merkur Futur, better, but bulky and unwieldy.</li>
            <li>But better.</li>
            <li>The lighter the handle, the better the control.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the fascination is with 1/2 pound handles, but the lighter ones let you feel the grain better,</li>
            <li>This is the third razor I have owned in the 3 years I&#x27;ve been using DE razors, and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had over one year experience with DE razors (EJ DE 89) and have longed for a more aggressive shave.</li>
            <li>You twist the bottom of the pole to release the top plate.</li>
            <li>I like the handle a lot more than my DE 89L</li>
            <li>Day 2-3 was where most of the learning process took place.</li>
            <li>I plan to use this razor for many years.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>can tell why everyone says it&#x27;s more aggressive though.</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite safety razor.  </li>
            <li>It is my razor of choice when I have more than three days growth to hack through.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with a gold Markur HD 34G for a couple years, which has been my favorite razor ... until now.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I know they claim you should call your children and tell them you love them before putting a slant to your throat</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>Using the standby rituals for a close and safe shave as described below:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>They do take a touch more attention than cartridge, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>My razor is at most from the 1930s.</li>
            <li>I feel the finish could be a bit better.</li>
            <li>I like the weight of this razor, but the balance could be a bit better</li>
            <li>Now, I was able to get a closer shave with 3 passed with this than I do with 4 passes of my Feather razor.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It is not as aggressive as advertised -- just more efficient.  </li>
            <li>In comparison, the 37C is better for me.</li>
            <li>Overall excellent product, came on time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still going through the process of finding the right blade to match up with it to get a good shave and not it irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>this is your first DE Razor don&#x27;t be scared, take the plunge, and good luck because you will enjoy!</li>
            <li>It was the perfect compromise between convenience, portability and quality - much better shave than cartridge and much easier/faster than straight edge.  </li>
            <li>Came quick and looks nice..</li>
            <li>It is a more aggressive shave, but with good shaving cream it shaves very well.</li>
            <li>Takes a steady hand, concentration, and good technique to keep it going safely.</li>
            <li>It takes sometime getting used to it, though, the handle is heavier and the blade still has more chance to cut you than a Gillette cheap system.</li>
            <li>If you can shave comfortably with this one, which many people can.</li>
            <li>Specifically, the underside of the top piece isn&#x27;t smooth or well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still a bit inexperienced, though, and I think that with some practice I&#x27;ll be getting a great shave with the 37C!</li>
            <li>They are excellent, but are too sharp for the slant razor.  </li>
            <li>They display the extreme quality and craftmanship and deliver an awesome shave.</li>
            <li>(See I told you it was easy).</li>
            <li>After 5 days of growth this razor will easily shave through my beard with precision while leaving the irritation to the multi-blade cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is well made and easy to remove/add blades.</li>
            <li>After I figured out how to shave my sideburns, the rest was easy.</li>
            <li>Makes for easy cleaning and drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have been using symmetrical DEs, this is an adjustment, but an easy one.</li>
            <li>But in mine and literally hundreds of cases, the chrome begins to flake off very quickly and the metal corrodes.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing is that you&#x27;ve developed good lathering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just fine</li>
            <li>It does go through blades more quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably end up replacing this eventually but it was a nice entry into a new territory for me :)</li>
            <li>I found the heavier weight in the head, angle of the blade and overall experience to be more pleasant.</li>
            <li>I use a light touch and short strokes and this razor is joy in the hand.</li>
            <li>GIVES A VERY CLOSE AND SMOOTH SHAVE WITH JUST TWO PASSES.VERY EFFECTIVE, AND</li>
            <li>The two piece assembly of this product couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use; it fits together snugly and securely and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Great bargain price especially for a slant razor.</li>
            <li>Baby smooth finish...</li>
            <li>With the Derby blade a close and comfortable shave was delivered.</li>
            <li>I like the time savings of only  two passes and still getting a great shave.</li>
            <li>Just remember light to no pressure  </li>
            <li>Think: light a match off my face)</li>
            <li>Think: light a match off my face)</li>
            <li>Melts all hair beneath its mighty bite.</li>
            <li>Instead go as light as you can and let the weight of the razor do the work.  </li>
            <li>This razor has a slicing motions that makes for a surprisingly smooth smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Even with the sharpest blades - your shave is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Efficient Comfortable DE.  </li>
            <li>As has been said before, it is a very aggressive shave which leads to amazing closeness.</li>
            <li>and if you can get it cheap</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a comfortable shave since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>A smooth 2 pass not as aggressive as some say.</li>
            <li>Plus Free 1.29 Oz Marvis Toothpaste]]</li>
            <li>and I think I would enjoy the longer handle of the 39c.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the shave.</li>
            <li>This glides so smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blown away by how fantastic the slant aspect is.  </li>
            <li>Seeking to re-connect with that smooth shave, and again enjoy non-plastic shaving, I sought out this model.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t press or pull, lightly glide.</li>
            <li>And enjoy.</li>
            <li>Make sure you pair it with a blade like a Derby or a Gillette Silver Blue and a good quality soap.</li>
            <li>I had to experiment with many different blades to find the right combination that worked for my skin and beard, but since I figured that out it has been great.</li>
            <li>Great razor, smooth shaver, way better than even I expected!!</li>
            <li>My first DE razor is the Edwin Jagger 89, which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Merkur took over Hoffritz years ago and this razor is a close version of my original.</li>
            <li>Like the original, this razor pivots (cantors?  </li>
            <li>This is my first slant bar razor and I love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unique slicing</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>which slices through the hairs; you won&#x27;t feel a thing, even with significant growth.</li>
            <li>So smooth, extremely close, no nicks, neck feels great, under the chin has never been this smooth.</li>
            <li>The best shaves for me are with soft water to maximize lather and to reduce dulling the blade, a badger brush and mug shave soap, and the Merkur Slant Razor and drug store double edged blades.  </li>
            <li>Something ineffective to get the clean shaving quality</li>
            <li>My last shave with 7 o&#x27;clock yellows was probably the best so far.</li>
            <li>The knurling on the handle provides vary good gripping of the razor even when wet and soapy.</li>
            <li>Well the second week of shaving with this razor wasn&#x27;t as pleasant.</li>
            <li>, then I started to feel the blade edge against my face more at certain angles.</li>
            <li>While the slant head is a sort of special configuration</li>
            <li>The first shave was great and very smooth, the second - not so much.</li>
            <li>then I thought \\&quot;This cannot be any more aggressive than a straight razor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This is a smaller handled razor, but still carries a good weight to it.</li>
            <li>These are truely works of art.</li>
            <li>The mildest plate delivered a better shave than the agressive 37C. (but does cost almost 4x as much)</li>
            <li>Good shave, but not close enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this slant razor for about a month now and am so far loving it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone that&#x27;s had a reasonable amount of experience with DE shaving and is looking for something more aggressive and faster to shave with.</li>
            <li>I lathered up good and did my usual pre-shave routine after taking a warm shower and letting my whiskers soak up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It reduced tugging and pulling significantly, even with my first shave with it, no nicks, not even razor burn!</li>
            <li>Once you have a proper shaving technique, this razor will give you a very close and surprising smooth, and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The Merkur  HD Slant Razor 37c is a great addition to my other safety razors and I will use it often.</li>
            <li>The entire piece feels very sturdy and has a great chrome like look.</li>
            <li>The scruff comes off just about as quick.</li>
            <li>The scruff comes off just about as quick.</li>
            <li>Very aggressive but with a smooth hand comes a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Even with the relatively sharp blades I use (Astra Superior Platinum), this is a comfortable razor.  </li>
            <li>I like this razor very much!</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with using the razor with my Gillette Silver Blues</li>
            <li>Hence I had my first bleeder in a year and the sound of Jaws emanated in the background.  </li>
            <li>I just used the 37C for the first time and what a world of difference it made!</li>
            <li>Slant is a great idea and sure to be my daily razor for a long time.  </li>
            <li>This would have given me a good foundation of what is available and saved me a little money in the long-run.  </li>
            <li>You need to pay attention to the angle of the blade and direction of your stroke a lot more than you would with other, more mild razors.</li>
            <li>I will have to wait until my shaving abilities get Jedi Knight ready before I take this light saber on again.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin and are determined to use this razor, be sure to use a blade that is coated for smoothness.</li>
            <li>In my experience with wet shaving, I can tell you that of the five razors I use most, Merkur holds two of the top five.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice weight and a short handle.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are getting a good thick lather on your face and not just a running soap.</li>
            <li>I do think it might give a smoother shave, quicker, than my Merkur HD razor, but I rarely cut myself with the Merkur HD.</li>
            <li>Yes, it may be a razor/blade combination, though I have yet to experience problems with that, but it can also be trying to use a blade beyond its useful life or not using the right angle.</li>
            <li>Nice weight in the hand and the ribbing on handle makes it easy to hold, even if some shaving cream runs down</li>
            <li>Mild aggressive razor, for beginners and &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34;) and Gillette Slim Adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>This is a very nice heavy DE razor.  </li>
            <li>However, I switched to \\&quot;generic\\&quot; drug store razor blades which are good but not quite as sharp.  </li>
            <li>Been shaving on work days for 2 weeks, on the first days I had to make sure I was more careful around the jaw line</li>
            <li>The 37 C is the right length  and weight.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try because of all the reviews and some YouTube videos on techniques that seemed to be the right ones .</li>
            <li>The 37c glides right over with no friction.  </li>
            <li>great blade self-centering (when the proper process is used -- see my web site), heft and implementation of the general design.</li>
            <li>I thought that the slant would be too much for me, but it was just right!</li>
            <li>The slant can also chop through a week&#x27;s worth of growth far better than any of my straight bar razors as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without stepping up to a higher price bracket either of these two razors are worth having.</li>
            <li>It mowed right through on the first pass.</li>
            <li>The safety bar luckily does provide a nice gentle cushion but at the same time the blade will be straight up on your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particularly good if you&#x27;re sporting a few days&#x27; worth of stubble.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have a great technique, but it felt almost no different than a regular DE.</li>
            <li>you very much for your email and the link to the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the rare shave when I experience any irritation with the Slant, and when I do, I am certain it is user error.  </li>
            <li>This razor does an amazing job of giving me the closest of shaves with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li>First WTG pass was a BREEZE.</li>
            <li>but man I can say with honesty that it is a VERY efficient cut!</li>
            <li>but overall I love this</li>
            <li>but overall I love this</li>
            <li>First of all, this an aggressive razor.  </li>
            <li>It certainly is more aggressive than, say, a 40&#x27;s Super Speed, but if you have three, four months practice with any regular double edge razor you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>but very efficient!</li>
            <li>At first I also used the Merkur blades with the Merkur Slant Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li>Recommended but maybe not as a first safety razor.</li>
            <li>A lovely, close shave that will make one look forward to the next time.</li>
            <li>I do not consider it to be &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; as so many enthusiasts do simply because (IMHO)</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I had my first shave with this razor</li>
            <li>Just got the 37C and first impressions are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first shave a did not use the supplied sample blade in favor of a Derby</li>
            <li>current weapon of choice is a Edwin Jagger DE89BL truly an outstanding razor</li>
            <li>I occasionally switch off with my Merkur 34C for a day here and there, but the Slant is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I remember when I got my first safety razor about a year ago.</li>
            <li>While those razors may be milder/smoother shavers, they are a much higher price.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use light pressure and shave exclusively with direct strokes (that is, stroke direction parallel to the handle).</li>
            <li>shaving!t was intimidating for the first shave or two.    </li>
            <li>Second, the manufacturing of Merkur products is top notch.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I find the Slant to be flattering to MOST razor blades.  </li>
            <li>A bit more severe that being cut with a standard razor.  </li>
            <li>At first it looks as if your razor was warped in production</li>
            <li>However, The outside of the razor (top side, shaft, etc.) is plated</li>
            <li>This left razor bumps and gave me many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Feather is my personal favorite with this razor, but the Astra&#x27;s are a close second...and 1/3 the price of the Feathers.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving DE for a few years now, but was aware that people say it&#x27;s fairly agressive.</li>
            <li>Just had my first shave with a chrome HD Slant</li>
            <li>I find the 37c definitely does slice through hair better.</li>
            <li>First shave with the personna blades on 3 days of hair felt like no blade and no hair.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought the slant bar first</li>
            <li>First pass with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>found at first use I indeed had to shave even slower.  </li>
            <li>My first razor was a Van Der Hagen from Target.</li>
            <li>First, I have been using DE razors for about 2 weeks as of today.</li>
            <li>and I love the open comb.</li>
            <li>I will admit, I didnt exactly know what I was doing when I bought a &amp;#34;slant&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The handle is short, but I tend to choke up on the handle in order to get the most control of the razor.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re just about to buy your first safety razor, buy this</li>
            <li>First shave got closer than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t know if it matters, but personally I almost always shave after a shower; and after I shave I always always always wash and rub fairly vigorously my face and neck with a rag and face soap, and then another final rinse.</li>

            <li>First, it is agressive (i.e., effective at mowing down stubble), without any decrease in the comfort of the shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a more aggressive shave due to its slant design (which means that it cuts closer, faster, more danger of cuts if you&#x27;re not careful).</li>
            <li>That being said, it might not hurt to keep a milder razor around if you want to go BBS with your final pass, but I have no problem keeping the slant as my only razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic razor, quality is top of the line as you&#x27;d expect from Merkur.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as someone&#x27;s first safety razor, but it&#x27;s found a valuable place in my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I also recommend using a good slick soap or shave cream.</li>
            <li>And if you are a young person, in general, make sure you do the face and neck wash with a rag and face soap after anytime you sweat, and always before bed, and when you wake up - and that will take care of almost all pimples.</li>

            <li>I have large hands</li>
            <li>This short-handled 37C and the longer-handled 39C. Even with large hands</li>
            <li>This short-handled 37C and the longer-handled 39C. Even with large hands</li>
            <li>If you have a large hand you might want to consider the longer handle.</li>
            <li>I have a couple other DE razors that, when paired with the right blade, give consistently more comfortable shaves that can still be quite close without the potential irritation and hazard of this slant.    </li>
            <li>I would say this is a pretty decent razor.</li>
            <li>This is a mildly aggressive razor, definitely not for a beginner but for someone who wants a slightly more aggressive shave then a regular Merkur 34C.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little razor but never got me &#x27;close&#x27; close</li>
            <li>I did notice that my very first blade started getting a tad harsh after a few nice shaves - I just have to adjust to the idea of replacing them more often.</li>
            <li>They certainly are cheap enough.)</li>
            <li>It is a great everyday shaver and will likely end up being one of your favorites as well.e up.  </li>
            <li>It is a great everyday shaver and will likely end up being one of your favorites as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like the design of this razor, and having it be two piece instead of three makes such a huge difference in handling.</li>
            <li>Very efficient</li>
            <li>This razor is very well made and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>The rewards are a shave that&#x27;s as close to being shaved with a straight blade.</li>
            <li>Very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does feel like a closer shave than my straight bar.</li>
            <li>I was astonished at how much closer</li>
            <li>Well, do you have to be more careful?</li>
            <li>Very aggressive and efficient.</li>
            <li>I had the respect it for what it can do, my shaves ended up much closer.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the packaging was as-expected.rritated</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the packaging was as-expected.</li>
            <li>It can shave very close, baby-skin close.</li>
            <li>I have been wet shaving for over three years now and have purchased or used more than a dozen double-edge razors.  </li>
            <li>This whole debate is moot, in my opinion, when it comes to the Slant.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think the slant adds or detracts much from the shave, though.  </li>
            <li>And very close.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After much research on the forums, and Amazon reviews, I settled on this two piece slant razor.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the texture on the pole is much rougher and easier to grip.</li>
            <li>Day 1 was really intimidating.</li>
            <li>The Merkur HD Slant is a fantastic second razor and is well built.</li>
            <li>I recommended using it with a light touch only.</li>
            <li>Should have bought this much sooner.</li>
            <li>just came to the conclusion that it&#x27;s too much for my face on a day to day basis.  </li>
            <li>I get a much smoother closer shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally I did return slowing my motion ever more carefully without a nick or a burn.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see why - the machines don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s slanted or straight.</li>
            <li>I only did additional passes afterwards to make it feel smooth to touch in all directions.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve perfected the straight edge).  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Finish with a real after-shave (not cologne) and if you are ready for a bracing experience grab a bottle of Bay Rum and splash on!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was given a slant edged (Hoffritz) razor by my parents in the late 1970&#x27;s and loved it.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, good grip (this apparently has a better grip than the 39C), decent size, overall a classic.</li>
            <li>Properly lubricate and use decent shaving cream and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>Slant razors take a little more patience at first</li>
            <li>A lot more blade is exposed compared to other razors.</li>
            <li>More than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried, this one will make you pay for pressing it into your skin.</li>
            <li>Going ATG requires a little more care, but if you don&#x27;t need to be BBS, a single WTG pass should more than suffice.</li>
            <li>Even shaving the night before and taking the time to go over areas again and again, I would end up having to switch back to the 23C to clean up again in the morning.</li>
            <li>My Edwin Jagger is very forgiving and mild for me, so when I purchased this razor I used the same methods I used with the Jagger......BOY</li>
            <li>Makes me have an even higher regard for my father&#x27;s 60+ year old gold plated brass Gillette which came in a gold plated velvet lined brass case.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure: this is my 4th DE razor, and I only started DE shaving 2 months ago.</li>
            <li>The varied blade angle makes the edge more face friendly at the end where the blade-bar gap is larger, but more harsh where the gap is smaller -- so the large capacity plus the varying blade angle yields the moderate harshness.</li>
            <li>The first few strokes with my new safety razor were astonishing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this little razor and is now my go-to when getting ready for work or a night out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this little razor and is now my go-to when getting ready for work or a night out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a little harsh, but couples great with my favorite blade- the dull but smooth dorco 300s.  </li>
            <li>Go gently and the razor cuts the stubble very efficiently with a sharp smooth blade.</li>
            <li>This razor doesn&#x27;t require many passes to reach the closeness desired, so my skin will tends to be less irritated (YMMV).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Though, I hear the balance of the 39C lends more weight to the head of the razor and makes for less pressure required in the pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The knurl on the handle is less like that of the 3/8 ratchet in your tool box and more like that if a surgical instrument.</li>
            <li>The lower head is not finished (smooth and polished) nearly as well as the upper one.  </li>
            <li>I love the weighty heft and the simple, but extremely solid mechanism for securing the blade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy enough that with a good blade, the weight of the razor does all the work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry for not being able to give you more favorable news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The Merkur Slant Safety Razor is highly recommended, but with my reservation as noted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Why is the slant so high on my list?  </li>
            <li>High quality razor.</li>
            <li>Only nicked myself 1 time, and after a few more shaves I&#x27;m sure I will master it just as well as any regular DE.  </li>
            <li>The finish is nowhere near as polished as the EJ, but every other aspect is better.  </li>
            <li>I had been shaving for about two years with the Hefty Classic and decided to go with something new</li>
            <li>The entire center of the shaft is hollow, which is great because you can rinse it through, or stick a q-tip in there for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a slant razor because they are designed to be more aggressive and I have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>For me, I use mostly Proraso green soap and either Feather or Astra SP blades.  </li>
            <li>though after using it for a few months I am in love.</li>
            <li>Just hold it and angle it like your symmetrical DEs and shave normally.</li>
            <li>your razors show is part of the normal wear and tear that occurs&lt;</li>
            <li>but, this is the tamest razor I own and cuts my tough beard better than any other.  </li>
            <li>you are new to wet shaving, this is a fantastic entry level razor.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I easily get that hard to reach spot right under the nose.</li>
            <li>I shaved for probably the third time with it today and didn&#x27;t even find myself trying to be more careful with this particular razor.</li>
            <li>First the overall finish could be a little better - for example visible machining lines can be seen.</li>
            <li>I have a fine beard and regular skin, and this razor makes short work of my stubble.</li>
            <li>However, if you use care and take your time, you will get an extremely close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>As a few others have stated, I agree that this razor is not for all, but a great addition that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>If you know how to use a safety razor (important), this doesn&#x27;t turn your face into hamburger anymore than any other razor.  </li>
            <li>It was almost like a brand new blade.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to the sport, get a sample pack of blades to see what your face will take.  </li>
            <li>I used the same technique and products as I did with the $5 razor, but the 37C sliced through my tough beard much more easily and without any tugging.</li>
            <li>This gives a very close shave with the Gillette Yellow&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, I fear it&#x27;s a bit too much for me as I was getting a cut on every shave</li>
            <li>It does have to used slightly more carefully then my Edwin Jagger, but it is not a vast difference.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I tried the slant bar, and I finally know what it is to enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard and after a four days growth using a Derby blade in the razor I got a very close comfortable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why I waited so long for a better shave, better skin, and to save money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was also concerned with the \\&quot;slant\\&quot; as this was my first double edged razor and a lot of reviews</li>
            <li>This is my second DE razor, but my first slant razor.  </li>
            <li>so I could get a better comparison to my usual shavers.</li>
            <li>Due to my lurking on wet shaving forums I noticed the EJ DE89 was a popular product and the Kelvin was a shorter, knurled handle version, to all intents and purposes.</li>
            <li>I then bought the Muhle R41, an open comb razor which provides a very close shave, but is not comfortable to use, and tended to nick my throat area more than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first is my Merkur Progress (with modifications to the adjustment mechanism, making it a \\&quot;Mergress\\&quot;) and the second is this razor, the Slant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The Merkur 37c was the second razor I bought after my first one broke.</li>
            <li>The second DE razor I have bought and my first slant razor.</li>
            <li>They all worked, some better than others, and I could get a decent shave pretty quick if I had shaved in the past few days, but pretty much they were all very expensive and to me just we’re doing what I felt they should do for that kind of money.</li>
            <li>After using pretty much all of the Gilette multi blades all the way up to the Fusion growing up, I finally had enough and purchased the Merkur 37c razor.</li>
            <li>It really pays to try 6-8 different blades with any new razor.</li>
            <li>The slant makes the shave very aggressive, which is what I&#x27;ve gotten used to due to my first razor.</li>
            <li>But if you are afraid that this razor + Feather &#x3D; suicide - relax, you&#x27;ll be fine :)  </li>
            <li>This slant razor is super aggressive and tears up my face, but somehow doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck at all, and even does a great job of getting those hard to get hairs that every other razor seems to have trouble with.  </li>
            <li>This razor is clearly designed for the guy who has the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 3pm if he doesn&#x27;t shave correctly.  </li>
            <li>Some razor manufacturers clearly have defective molds, resulting in pitting or imperfections with the finished product.</li>
            <li>AND I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So I got this in the mail today after a year of trying out a lot of different razors and blades, including straight razors.</li>
            <li>pass ATG, and WOW...</li>
            <li>Near BBS shave in two passes and some touch ups.</li>
            <li>This one was far easier and gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li>All Stainless Steel Double Edge Shaving Razor]]</li>
            <li>Wow what a change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like how well built the TTO (twist to open)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t used to seeing so much blade exposed (especially on the bottom of the blade).</li>
            <li>Each shave pass is also closer than my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the 37c nearly as often as I used to.   </li>
            <li>When I put the old blade in the 37c there was no pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li>As far as my head went it works</li>
            <li>I started getting into straight edge shaving a couple of years ago, but because it takes a bit of time and care still fell back on cartridge razors when I was in a hurry or traveling.</li>
            <li>Many say they use this as their daily shaver, and I have for a few weeks, but this baby really shines on multiple day beard growth.</li>
            <li>I made the switch from traditional because I had course, fast growing hair and was prone to ingrow hairs.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you want fast shaving--this requires a process, and time must be devoted to doing this properly.</li>
            <li>I normally shave with a straight razor, but that takes too long and can&#x27;t shave like that during work days, so I bought this as</li>
            <li>would avoid this if you are a first timer, other than that the Slant does live up to the hype and</li>
            <li>And it was pretty damn close for a WTG pass, it was already close enough that it could&#x27;ve been considered my second pass.</li>
            <li>Not familiar with the slant feature yet but sweet as the 34C</li>
            <li>a fast alternative.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving is so close that is almost as if you were shaving with a straight, but in half the time.</li>
            <li>(I do like and recommend the super sharp Merkur double edged blades for a NON-slant safety razor.)      </li>
            <li>and they were sharp enough yet smooth enough to go against the grain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new daily shaver!</li>
            <li>So I can safely say that my thick facial hair had NO chance against this razor, and yes I did nick and cut myself for the first time in a long time with a DE razor even with proper prep.</li>
            <li>As far as performance of the skew cut, I can&#x27;t really tell a big difference, but maybe I&#x27;m not experienced enough to be able to discern the difference.</li>
            <li>For a series of five blog-journal articles (with lots of photos) on my first week with this razor -- as well as lots of other DE-shaving info, check out shavelikegrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com</li>
            <li>This is my first double edge (I tried a shavette for a while, think like a barbershop blade with a replaceable single edge).</li>
            <li>Of course the Merkur stainless blades are far superior to the old Gillette blue blades; too bad I cannot say the same about the 37C.</li>
            <li>I suppose due to the way the blade touches, is slanted, and you can easily judge where the cutting will take place…for lack of better description.</li>
            <li>Very efficient shave as to be expected from a slant razor.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;aggressiveness\\&quot; is related to the efficient cutting/slicing action.  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only used Gillette Silver Blues with this razor.</li>
            <li>this razor is solid and will last forever if taken care of and the slant is noticeably smoother than regular straight razor design.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a coarse beard.  </li>
            <li>Anyone, and I mean anyone, can use it to good effect as long as you have some basic knowledge and experience with wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I shave down first.  </li>
            <li>It did leave a bit more razor burn on my face than the previous razor, and I cut myself a few times.</li>
            <li>Finish your shave with a wet alum block, a cold water rinse, and a healthy handful of Clubman&#x27;s Original or Bay Rum</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s due to the slant angled design you feel both gentle safety bar and aggressive blade...</li>
            <li>I had the feather blades, and they work great with the grain, but made my face extremely raw against the grain, which I need to do due to my thick hairs.</li>
            <li>With the 37c, you really need to be careful under your nose and around your upper lip.</li>
            <li>I have fairly coarse facial hair, which is greying, and my skin is moderately sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have trouble getting a very close shave directly under my chin and on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switched to shaving with a DE blade a few months ago, and it was way better, but still not totally comfortable.</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned about the lack of grip, but after having 30+ shaves I have had little to no problem with grip.</li>
            <li>no problem, XTG some problems, ATG major facial reconstruction!</li>
            <li>My first shave with it was a little intimidating.</li>
            <li>Not long ago, I decided to purchase the Edwin Jagger Kelvin.</li>
            <li>Well, I dropped my old DE razor on the tile once and chipped the edge, so that was my excuse to buy</li>
            <li>I had been using my trusty Merkur 23C I first bought at The Art of Shaving for a few years now.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even aware of what I was missing.</li>
            <li>In fact if I know I will be tight on time the next morning, that&#x27;s exactly what I do.</li>
            <li>Would take down even a couple days growth on the head (much thicker than my beard hairs) with no problem.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell when I&#x27;m down to just skin.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little practice and inattentiveness often precedes minor nicks, but the outcome is worth the effort.</li>
            <li>have DE Wet Shaving for less than a month, and when I used this razor, it came VERY natural to me on how to use it, how much pressure to apply and even the angle.</li>
            <li>So after much research into safety razors I put down about 100 bucks on an entire set up: safety razor, a bunch of blades, soap mug, some soap, a razor and brush holder, a couple creams that I don&#x27;t use anymore, and definitely some barber alum.</li>
            <li>I made the switch to this from a cheap-o $5 Chinese razor because it was too mild for my thick, dense beard and it would tug at it as I shaved.</li>
            <li>Gives a very close shave with little effort.</li>

            <li> A hefty, compact, awesome razor.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a closer shave than my Edwin Jagger DE89 (which is also an awesome tool) gives when I add XTG and ATG</li>
            <li> gave me best close shave ever</li>
            <li> Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> that work perfectly well in the Slant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, you might want to consider a blade variety pack to see which ones you like best.  </li>
            <li> I used this razor with a feather blade and it was the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Great slant!</li>
            <li> the chrome finish and knurling is excellent.</li>
            <li> I just wish Merkur made an adjustable slant - THAT would be the perfect razor.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have started with this razor, give me the best shave</li>

            <li> Perfect.</li>
            <li> I did not encounter anything like this found this to be a very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While this razor has a great weighty feel it is just as lacking that perfectly balanced</li>
            <li> This thing is incredible.  </li>
            <li> The chrome plating is good, but not as perfect as Muhle chroming.</li>
            <li> Merkur makes a beautiful razor, no doubt about it.  </li>
            <li> IF you have the time and patience to treat this razor with respect, you will be rewarded with a great shave.</li>
            <li> Having said that, the slant does offer a great advantage for people with hair that grows in swirl patterns (as mine does).  </li>
            <li> I am writing this review after having had a really great BSS with the Merkur 37C razor.</li>
            <li> The handle has a great knurling and feels almost like my</li>
            <li> This slant razor does a great job taking out hair growth.</li>
            <li> but I like the weight and am happy otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great razor great quality</li>
            <li> Nothing to fear with it, just give it the respect it deserves and you&#x27;ll get a great shave from it.&lt;br</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy.</li>
            <li> Shaves great.</li>

            <li> Great razor.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be happy.  </li>
            <li> Very nice razor.</li>
            <li> Great razor, requires good technique regarding shave angle etc.</li>
            <li> razor has a good amount of heft, which is great in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Feels great in hand and looks great on the counter top!</li>
            <li> What a pleasant mistake.  </li>
            <li> I found this would best fit my needs.</li>
            <li> I find that to be a superior combination for me.  </li>
            <li> Merkur 37C  Astra Superior Platinum</li>
            <li> This was a good thing, he says.</li>
            <li> If I could combine the fit, finish, and balanced feel of the Edwin Jagger DE89BL and the weight and cut of the Merkur 37C that would be an awesome razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My experience with this razor is nothing but good.</li>
            <li> Size and weight are good.</li>
            <li> Good knurling on the handle.</li>
            <li> Use of a good Shaving</li>
            <li> experience should be a good one.</li>
            <li> The outcome is a super close shave especially good for thicker, rougher stubble.</li>
            <li> The blades that work the best in the 34c aren&#x27;t the same as the blades that work best in this #37c.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR,CUTS STUBBLE LIKE A HOT KNIFE CUTS THROUGH BUTTER!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is nice and stout with a good weight to it.</li>
            <li> The first week was the best shave or my life.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is an amazing razor.</li>
            <li> A truly amazing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do get an amazingly close shave with each use,  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> The sound feedback is great</li>
            <li> Nice weight and balance.</li>
            <li> Aggressive in a nice way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t replace the need for good technique, but it makes the shave noticeably more efficient.</li>
            <li> , the 37C is a nice razor but is lacking in a couple of areas.</li>
            <li> I got a sample pack and think I&#x27;ve settled on the feather blades which are really nice.  </li>
            <li> I have a nice brush, Tribute shave cream, And Proraso preshave cream.</li>
            <li> As with any shaver (even a &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; one) - always have a styptic stick handy.</li>
            <li> The plating isn&#x27;t as nice as the EJ DE 89.</li>
            <li> The weight of the razor is good and never feels too light (which is good in DE shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The weight of the razor is nice and</li>
            <li> I want  but effective for avoding said problems.</li>
            <li> Nice finish..</li>
            <li> The razor looks nice and does provide a close shave</li>
            <li> Nothing that didn&#x27;t stop bleeding on its own bedre the end of the shave.  </li>
            <li> It requires a light touch to use but rewards that light touch with an excellent shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The feel on my face (I&#x27;m using Astra blades) is incredible, very smooth and quick across the beard.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure your technique is on-point because the blade exposure is very prominent.</li>
            <li> That said, I recommend buying a cheap safety razor, get good at shaving with it, and then buy a nice slant razor.</li>
            <li> That said, I recommend buying a cheap safety razor, get good at shaving with it, and then buy a nice slant razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great razor and worthy of giving it a try.</li>
            <li> when speaking of a chrome finish, it is near flawless in its finish.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have used!</li>
            <li> Three stars because *any* slant razor is kind of a specialty, niche product that is often overkill.... probably not for most shavers.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a great razor and well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably never find the perfect setup, but you can certainly find a comfortable one.</li>
            <li> Best razor I ever used  gets a really close shave baby face smooth but you can&#x27;t  put no pressure on the razor or it will cut you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree, just use a VERY light touch and if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll have no problems with this razor.</li>
            <li> Weight and slant did seem to give a better cut and very smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Good technique, very light pressure, quality lather, and the right blades make all the difference.  </li>
            <li> many have said, this takes experience to use.</li>
            <li> And I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li> many have said, this takes experience to use.</li>
            <li> And I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li> Hold the Top and unscrew the bottom</li>
            <li> and in one pass I&#x27;ll be more than presentable.</li>
            <li> It is certainly more &#x27;aggressive&#x27; than a straight-bar razor, however don&#x27;t let that deter you.</li>
            <li> Hoffritz slant blade razor which had seen better days and was truly worn out.</li>
            <li> Imagine a capital letter T and now tilt the top bar so that instead of pointing to 3 and 9 o&#x27;clock, it&#x27;s pointing to 3:30 and 9:30.</li>
            <li> I am glad I chose the 37HD over the 34HD.</li>
            <li> Close shave and extremely agile in your hand.</li>
            <li> This razor goes to the top of my favorites</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It cuts better than my 34c.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for 3 months with my Edwin Jagger which I love.</li>
            <li> Even with my preshave and Tabac shaving soap this baby bites into the face when you try anything more than 2 passes.</li>
            <li> I have gotten to better with this lawn mower.</li>
            <li> I find that because there is more space between the blade and razor, it doesn&#x27;t clog up.</li>
            <li> Whereas with a cartridge and even with a safety they will clog and you spend more time rinsing.</li>

            <li> Whereas with a cartridge and even with a safety they will clog and you spend more time rinsing.</li>
            <li> and it took way to many passes to get the job done.</li>
            <li> More agresive then the 34c</li>
            <li> Then there may be no reason to buy another razor again &#x3D;).</li>

            <li> I bought the Merkur Futur, better, but bulky and unwieldy.</li>
            <li> But better.</li>
            <li> The lighter the handle, the better the control.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the fascination is with 1/2 pound handles, but the lighter ones let you feel the grain better,</li>
            <li> This is the third razor I have owned in the 3 years I&#x27;ve been using DE razors, and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had over one year experience with DE razors (EJ DE 89) and have longed for a more aggressive shave.</li>
            <li> You twist the bottom of the pole to release the top plate.</li>
            <li> I like the handle a lot more than my DE 89L</li>
            <li> Day 2-3 was where most of the learning process took place.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this razor for many years.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> can tell why everyone says it&#x27;s more aggressive though.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite safety razor.  </li>
            <li> It is my razor of choice when I have more than three days growth to hack through.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a gold Markur HD 34G for a couple years, which has been my favorite razor ... until now.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I know they claim you should call your children and tell them you love them before putting a slant to your throat</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li> Using the standby rituals for a close and safe shave as described below:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> They do take a touch more attention than cartridge, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> My razor is at most from the 1930s.</li>
            <li> I feel the finish could be a bit better.</li>
            <li> I like the weight of this razor, but the balance could be a bit better</li>
            <li> Now, I was able to get a closer shave with 3 passed with this than I do with 4 passes of my Feather razor.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It is not as aggressive as advertised -- just more efficient.  </li>
            <li> In comparison, the 37C is better for me.</li>
            <li> Overall excellent product, came on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going through the process of finding the right blade to match up with it to get a good shave and not it irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> this is your first DE Razor don&#x27;t be scared, take the plunge, and good luck because you will enjoy!</li>
            <li> It was the perfect compromise between convenience, portability and quality - much better shave than cartridge and much easier/faster than straight edge.  </li>
            <li> Came quick and looks nice..</li>
            <li> It is a more aggressive shave, but with good shaving cream it shaves very well.</li>
            <li> Takes a steady hand, concentration, and good technique to keep it going safely.</li>
            <li> It takes sometime getting used to it, though, the handle is heavier and the blade still has more chance to cut you than a Gillette cheap system.</li>
            <li> If you can shave comfortably with this one, which many people can.</li>
            <li> Specifically, the underside of the top piece isn&#x27;t smooth or well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a bit inexperienced, though, and I think that with some practice I&#x27;ll be getting a great shave with the 37C!</li>
            <li> They are excellent, but are too sharp for the slant razor.  </li>
            <li> They display the extreme quality and craftmanship and deliver an awesome shave.</li>
            <li> (See I told you it was easy).</li>
            <li> After 5 days of growth this razor will easily shave through my beard with precision while leaving the irritation to the multi-blade cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is well made and easy to remove/add blades.</li>
            <li> After I figured out how to shave my sideburns, the rest was easy.</li>
            <li> Makes for easy cleaning and drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have been using symmetrical DEs, this is an adjustment, but an easy one.</li>
            <li> But in mine and literally hundreds of cases, the chrome begins to flake off very quickly and the metal corrodes.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing is that you&#x27;ve developed good lathering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just fine</li>
            <li> It does go through blades more quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably end up replacing this eventually but it was a nice entry into a new territory for me :)</li>
            <li> I found the heavier weight in the head, angle of the blade and overall experience to be more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I use a light touch and short strokes and this razor is joy in the hand.</li>
            <li> GIVES A VERY CLOSE AND SMOOTH SHAVE WITH JUST TWO PASSES.VERY EFFECTIVE, AND</li>
            <li> The two piece assembly of this product couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use; it fits together snugly and securely and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Great bargain price especially for a slant razor.</li>
            <li> Baby smooth finish...</li>
            <li> With the Derby blade a close and comfortable shave was delivered.</li>
            <li> I like the time savings of only  two passes and still getting a great shave.</li>
            <li> Just remember light to no pressure  </li>
            <li> Think: light a match off my face)</li>
            <li> Think: light a match off my face)</li>
            <li> Melts all hair beneath its mighty bite.</li>
            <li> Instead go as light as you can and let the weight of the razor do the work.  </li>
            <li> This razor has a slicing motions that makes for a surprisingly smooth smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Even with the sharpest blades - your shave is smooth.  </li>
            <li> Efficient Comfortable DE.  </li>
            <li> As has been said before, it is a very aggressive shave which leads to amazing closeness.</li>
            <li> and if you can get it cheap</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a comfortable shave since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> A smooth 2 pass not as aggressive as some say.</li>
            <li> Plus Free 1.29 Oz Marvis Toothpaste]]</li>
            <li> and I think I would enjoy the longer handle of the 39c.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the shave.</li>
            <li> This glides so smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blown away by how fantastic the slant aspect is.  </li>
            <li> Seeking to re-connect with that smooth shave, and again enjoy non-plastic shaving, I sought out this model.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press or pull, lightly glide.</li>
            <li> And enjoy.</li>
            <li> Make sure you pair it with a blade like a Derby or a Gillette Silver Blue and a good quality soap.</li>
            <li> I had to experiment with many different blades to find the right combination that worked for my skin and beard, but since I figured that out it has been great.</li>
            <li> Great razor, smooth shaver, way better than even I expected!!</li>
            <li> My first DE razor is the Edwin Jagger 89, which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Merkur took over Hoffritz years ago and this razor is a close version of my original.</li>
            <li> Like the original, this razor pivots (cantors?  </li>
            <li> This is my first slant bar razor and I love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unique slicing</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> which slices through the hairs; you won&#x27;t feel a thing, even with significant growth.</li>
            <li> So smooth, extremely close, no nicks, neck feels great, under the chin has never been this smooth.</li>
            <li> The best shaves for me are with soft water to maximize lather and to reduce dulling the blade, a badger brush and mug shave soap, and the Merkur Slant Razor and drug store double edged blades.  </li>
            <li> Something ineffective to get the clean shaving quality</li>
            <li> My last shave with 7 o&#x27;clock yellows was probably the best so far.</li>
            <li> The knurling on the handle provides vary good gripping of the razor even when wet and soapy.</li>
            <li> Well the second week of shaving with this razor wasn&#x27;t as pleasant.</li>
            <li> , then I started to feel the blade edge against my face more at certain angles.</li>
            <li> While the slant head is a sort of special configuration</li>
            <li> The first shave was great and very smooth, the second - not so much.</li>
            <li> then I thought \\&quot;This cannot be any more aggressive than a straight razor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This is a smaller handled razor, but still carries a good weight to it.</li>
            <li> These are truely works of art.</li>
            <li> The mildest plate delivered a better shave than the agressive 37C. (but does cost almost 4x as much)</li>
            <li> Good shave, but not close enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this slant razor for about a month now and am so far loving it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone that&#x27;s had a reasonable amount of experience with DE shaving and is looking for something more aggressive and faster to shave with.</li>
            <li> I lathered up good and did my usual pre-shave routine after taking a warm shower and letting my whiskers soak up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It reduced tugging and pulling significantly, even with my first shave with it, no nicks, not even razor burn!</li>
            <li> Once you have a proper shaving technique, this razor will give you a very close and surprising smooth, and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The Merkur  HD Slant Razor 37c is a great addition to my other safety razors and I will use it often.</li>
            <li> The entire piece feels very sturdy and has a great chrome like look.</li>
            <li> The scruff comes off just about as quick.</li>
            <li> The scruff comes off just about as quick.</li>
            <li> Very aggressive but with a smooth hand comes a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Even with the relatively sharp blades I use (Astra Superior Platinum), this is a comfortable razor.  </li>
            <li> I like this razor very much!</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with using the razor with my Gillette Silver Blues</li>
            <li> Hence I had my first bleeder in a year and the sound of Jaws emanated in the background.  </li>
            <li> I just used the 37C for the first time and what a world of difference it made!</li>
            <li> Slant is a great idea and sure to be my daily razor for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This would have given me a good foundation of what is available and saved me a little money in the long-run.  </li>
            <li> You need to pay attention to the angle of the blade and direction of your stroke a lot more than you would with other, more mild razors.</li>
            <li> I will have to wait until my shaving abilities get Jedi Knight ready before I take this light saber on again.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin and are determined to use this razor, be sure to use a blade that is coated for smoothness.</li>
            <li> In my experience with wet shaving, I can tell you that of the five razors I use most, Merkur holds two of the top five.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice weight and a short handle.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are getting a good thick lather on your face and not just a running soap.</li>
            <li> I do think it might give a smoother shave, quicker, than my Merkur HD razor, but I rarely cut myself with the Merkur HD.</li>
            <li> Yes, it may be a razor/blade combination, though I have yet to experience problems with that, but it can also be trying to use a blade beyond its useful life or not using the right angle.</li>
            <li> Nice weight in the hand and the ribbing on handle makes it easy to hold, even if some shaving cream runs down</li>
            <li> Mild aggressive razor, for beginners and &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34;) and Gillette Slim Adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> This is a very nice heavy DE razor.  </li>
            <li> However, I switched to \\&quot;generic\\&quot; drug store razor blades which are good but not quite as sharp.  </li>
            <li> Been shaving on work days for 2 weeks, on the first days I had to make sure I was more careful around the jaw line</li>
            <li> The 37 C is the right length  and weight.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because of all the reviews and some YouTube videos on techniques that seemed to be the right ones .</li>
            <li> The 37c glides right over with no friction.  </li>
            <li> great blade self-centering (when the proper process is used -- see my web site), heft and implementation of the general design.</li>
            <li> I thought that the slant would be too much for me, but it was just right!</li>
            <li> The slant can also chop through a week&#x27;s worth of growth far better than any of my straight bar razors as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without stepping up to a higher price bracket either of these two razors are worth having.</li>
            <li> It mowed right through on the first pass.</li>
            <li> The safety bar luckily does provide a nice gentle cushion but at the same time the blade will be straight up on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly good if you&#x27;re sporting a few days&#x27; worth of stubble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have a great technique, but it felt almost no different than a regular DE.</li>
            <li> you very much for your email and the link to the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the rare shave when I experience any irritation with the Slant, and when I do, I am certain it is user error.  </li>
            <li> This razor does an amazing job of giving me the closest of shaves with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> First WTG pass was a BREEZE.</li>
            <li> but man I can say with honesty that it is a VERY efficient cut!</li>
            <li> but overall I love this</li>
            <li> but overall I love this</li>
            <li> First of all, this an aggressive razor.  </li>
            <li> It certainly is more aggressive than, say, a 40&#x27;s Super Speed, but if you have three, four months practice with any regular double edge razor you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> but very efficient!</li>
            <li> At first I also used the Merkur blades with the Merkur Slant Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li> Recommended but maybe not as a first safety razor.</li>
            <li> A lovely, close shave that will make one look forward to the next time.</li>
            <li> I do not consider it to be &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; as so many enthusiasts do simply because (IMHO)</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I had my first shave with this razor</li>
            <li> Just got the 37C and first impressions are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first shave a did not use the supplied sample blade in favor of a Derby</li>
            <li> current weapon of choice is a Edwin Jagger DE89BL truly an outstanding razor</li>
            <li> I occasionally switch off with my Merkur 34C for a day here and there, but the Slant is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I remember when I got my first safety razor about a year ago.</li>
            <li> While those razors may be milder/smoother shavers, they are a much higher price.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use light pressure and shave exclusively with direct strokes (that is, stroke direction parallel to the handle).</li>
            <li> shaving!t was intimidating for the first shave or two.    </li>
            <li> Second, the manufacturing of Merkur products is top notch.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I find the Slant to be flattering to MOST razor blades.  </li>
            <li> A bit more severe that being cut with a standard razor.  </li>
            <li> At first it looks as if your razor was warped in production</li>
            <li> However, The outside of the razor (top side, shaft, etc.) is plated</li>
            <li> This left razor bumps and gave me many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Feather is my personal favorite with this razor, but the Astra&#x27;s are a close second...and 1/3 the price of the Feathers.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving DE for a few years now, but was aware that people say it&#x27;s fairly agressive.</li>
            <li> Just had my first shave with a chrome HD Slant</li>
            <li> I find the 37c definitely does slice through hair better.</li>
            <li> First shave with the personna blades on 3 days of hair felt like no blade and no hair.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought the slant bar first</li>
            <li> First pass with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> found at first use I indeed had to shave even slower.  </li>
            <li> My first razor was a Van Der Hagen from Target.</li>
            <li> First, I have been using DE razors for about 2 weeks as of today.</li>
            <li> and I love the open comb.</li>
            <li> I will admit, I didnt exactly know what I was doing when I bought a &amp;#34;slant&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The handle is short, but I tend to choke up on the handle in order to get the most control of the razor.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re just about to buy your first safety razor, buy this</li>
            <li> First shave got closer than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t know if it matters, but personally I almost always shave after a shower; and after I shave I always always always wash and rub fairly vigorously my face and neck with a rag and face soap, and then another final rinse.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t know if it matters, but personally I almost always shave after a shower; and after I shave I always always always wash and rub fairly vigorously my face and neck with a rag and face soap, and then another final rinse.</li>
            <li> First, it is agressive (i.e., effective at mowing down stubble), without any decrease in the comfort of the shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a more aggressive shave due to its slant design (which means that it cuts closer, faster, more danger of cuts if you&#x27;re not careful).</li>
            <li> That being said, it might not hurt to keep a milder razor around if you want to go BBS with your final pass, but I have no problem keeping the slant as my only razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic razor, quality is top of the line as you&#x27;d expect from Merkur.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as someone&#x27;s first safety razor, but it&#x27;s found a valuable place in my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I also recommend using a good slick soap or shave cream.</li>
            <li> And if you are a young person, in general, make sure you do the face and neck wash with a rag and face soap after anytime you sweat, and always before bed, and when you wake up - and that will take care of almost all pimples.</li>

            <li> This short-handled 37C and the longer-handled 39C. Even with large hands</li>

            <li> If you have a large hand you might want to consider the longer handle.</li>
            <li> I have a couple other DE razors that, when paired with the right blade, give consistently more comfortable shaves that can still be quite close without the potential irritation and hazard of this slant.    </li>
            <li> I would say this is a pretty decent razor.</li>
            <li> This is a mildly aggressive razor, definitely not for a beginner but for someone who wants a slightly more aggressive shave then a regular Merkur 34C.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little razor but never got me &#x27;close&#x27; close</li>
            <li> I did notice that my very first blade started getting a tad harsh after a few nice shaves - I just have to adjust to the idea of replacing them more often.</li>
            <li> They certainly are cheap enough.)</li>
            <li> It is a great everyday shaver and will likely end up being one of your favorites as well.e up.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like the design of this razor, and having it be two piece instead of three makes such a huge difference in handling.</li>
            <li> Very efficient</li>
            <li> This razor is very well made and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> The rewards are a shave that&#x27;s as close to being shaved with a straight blade.</li>
            <li> Very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does feel like a closer shave than my straight bar.</li>
            <li> I was astonished at how much closer</li>
            <li> Well, do you have to be more careful?</li>
            <li> Very aggressive and efficient.</li>
            <li> I had the respect it for what it can do, my shaves ended up much closer.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the packaging was as-expected.rritated</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the packaging was as-expected.</li>
            <li> It can shave very close, baby-skin close.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for over three years now and have purchased or used more than a dozen double-edge razors.  </li>
            <li> This whole debate is moot, in my opinion, when it comes to the Slant.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think the slant adds or detracts much from the shave, though.  </li>
            <li> And very close.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After much research on the forums, and Amazon reviews, I settled on this two piece slant razor.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the texture on the pole is much rougher and easier to grip.</li>
            <li> Day 1 was really intimidating.</li>
            <li> The Merkur HD Slant is a fantastic second razor and is well built.</li>
            <li> I recommended using it with a light touch only.</li>
            <li> Should have bought this much sooner.</li>
            <li> just came to the conclusion that it&#x27;s too much for my face on a day to day basis.  </li>
            <li> I get a much smoother closer shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I did return slowing my motion ever more carefully without a nick or a burn.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see why - the machines don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s slanted or straight.</li>
            <li> I only did additional passes afterwards to make it feel smooth to touch in all directions.  </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve perfected the straight edge).  </li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Finish with a real after-shave (not cologne) and if you are ready for a bracing experience grab a bottle of Bay Rum and splash on!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was given a slant edged (Hoffritz) razor by my parents in the late 1970&#x27;s and loved it.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, good grip (this apparently has a better grip than the 39C), decent size, overall a classic.</li>
            <li> Properly lubricate and use decent shaving cream and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> Slant razors take a little more patience at first</li>
            <li> A lot more blade is exposed compared to other razors.</li>
            <li> More than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried, this one will make you pay for pressing it into your skin.</li>
            <li> Going ATG requires a little more care, but if you don&#x27;t need to be BBS, a single WTG pass should more than suffice.</li>
            <li> Even shaving the night before and taking the time to go over areas again and again, I would end up having to switch back to the 23C to clean up again in the morning.</li>
            <li> My Edwin Jagger is very forgiving and mild for me, so when I purchased this razor I used the same methods I used with the Jagger......BOY</li>
            <li> Makes me have an even higher regard for my father&#x27;s 60+ year old gold plated brass Gillette which came in a gold plated velvet lined brass case.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure: this is my 4th DE razor, and I only started DE shaving 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> The varied blade angle makes the edge more face friendly at the end where the blade-bar gap is larger, but more harsh where the gap is smaller -- so the large capacity plus the varying blade angle yields the moderate harshness.</li>
            <li> The first few strokes with my new safety razor were astonishing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this little razor and is now my go-to when getting ready for work or a night out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this little razor and is now my go-to when getting ready for work or a night out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a little harsh, but couples great with my favorite blade- the dull but smooth dorco 300s.  </li>
            <li> Go gently and the razor cuts the stubble very efficiently with a sharp smooth blade.</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t require many passes to reach the closeness desired, so my skin will tends to be less irritated (YMMV).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Though, I hear the balance of the 39C lends more weight to the head of the razor and makes for less pressure required in the pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though, I hear the balance of the 39C lends more weight to the head of the razor and makes for less pressure required in the pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The knurl on the handle is less like that of the 3/8 ratchet in your tool box and more like that if a surgical instrument.</li>
            <li> The lower head is not finished (smooth and polished) nearly as well as the upper one.  </li>
            <li> I love the weighty heft and the simple, but extremely solid mechanism for securing the blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough that with a good blade, the weight of the razor does all the work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry for not being able to give you more favorable news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Merkur Slant Safety Razor is highly recommended, but with my reservation as noted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why is the slant so high on my list?  </li>
            <li> High quality razor.</li>
            <li> Only nicked myself 1 time, and after a few more shaves I&#x27;m sure I will master it just as well as any regular DE.  </li>
            <li> The finish is nowhere near as polished as the EJ, but every other aspect is better.  </li>
            <li> I had been shaving for about two years with the Hefty Classic and decided to go with something new</li>
            <li> The entire center of the shaft is hollow, which is great because you can rinse it through, or stick a q-tip in there for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a slant razor because they are designed to be more aggressive and I have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> For me, I use mostly Proraso green soap and either Feather or Astra SP blades.  </li>
            <li> though after using it for a few months I am in love.</li>
            <li> Just hold it and angle it like your symmetrical DEs and shave normally.</li>
            <li> your razors show is part of the normal wear and tear that occurs&lt;</li>
            <li> but, this is the tamest razor I own and cuts my tough beard better than any other.  </li>
            <li> you are new to wet shaving, this is a fantastic entry level razor.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I easily get that hard to reach spot right under the nose.</li>
            <li> I shaved for probably the third time with it today and didn&#x27;t even find myself trying to be more careful with this particular razor.</li>
            <li> First the overall finish could be a little better - for example visible machining lines can be seen.</li>
            <li> I have a fine beard and regular skin, and this razor makes short work of my stubble.</li>
            <li> However, if you use care and take your time, you will get an extremely close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> As a few others have stated, I agree that this razor is not for all, but a great addition that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> If you know how to use a safety razor (important), this doesn&#x27;t turn your face into hamburger anymore than any other razor.  </li>
            <li> It was almost like a brand new blade.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to the sport, get a sample pack of blades to see what your face will take.  </li>
            <li> I used the same technique and products as I did with the $5 razor, but the 37C sliced through my tough beard much more easily and without any tugging.</li>
            <li> This gives a very close shave with the Gillette Yellow&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, I fear it&#x27;s a bit too much for me as I was getting a cut on every shave</li>
            <li> It does have to used slightly more carefully then my Edwin Jagger, but it is not a vast difference.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I tried the slant bar, and I finally know what it is to enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and after a four days growth using a Derby blade in the razor I got a very close comfortable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I waited so long for a better shave, better skin, and to save money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also concerned with the \\&quot;slant\\&quot; as this was my first double edged razor and a lot of reviews</li>
            <li> This is my second DE razor, but my first slant razor.  </li>
            <li> so I could get a better comparison to my usual shavers.</li>
            <li> Due to my lurking on wet shaving forums I noticed the EJ DE89 was a popular product and the Kelvin was a shorter, knurled handle version, to all intents and purposes.</li>
            <li> I then bought the Muhle R41, an open comb razor which provides a very close shave, but is not comfortable to use, and tended to nick my throat area more than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first is my Merkur Progress (with modifications to the adjustment mechanism, making it a \\&quot;Mergress\\&quot;) and the second is this razor, the Slant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The Merkur 37c was the second razor I bought after my first one broke.</li>
            <li> The second DE razor I have bought and my first slant razor.</li>
            <li> They all worked, some better than others, and I could get a decent shave pretty quick if I had shaved in the past few days, but pretty much they were all very expensive and to me just we’re doing what I felt they should do for that kind of money.</li>
            <li> After using pretty much all of the Gilette multi blades all the way up to the Fusion growing up, I finally had enough and purchased the Merkur 37c razor.</li>
            <li> It really pays to try 6-8 different blades with any new razor.</li>
            <li> The slant makes the shave very aggressive, which is what I&#x27;ve gotten used to due to my first razor.</li>
            <li> But if you are afraid that this razor + Feather &#x3D; suicide - relax, you&#x27;ll be fine :)  </li>
            <li> This slant razor is super aggressive and tears up my face, but somehow doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck at all, and even does a great job of getting those hard to get hairs that every other razor seems to have trouble with.  </li>
            <li> This razor is clearly designed for the guy who has the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 3pm if he doesn&#x27;t shave correctly.  </li>
            <li> Some razor manufacturers clearly have defective molds, resulting in pitting or imperfections with the finished product.</li>
            <li> AND I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So I got this in the mail today after a year of trying out a lot of different razors and blades, including straight razors.</li>
            <li> pass ATG, and WOW...</li>
            <li> Near BBS shave in two passes and some touch ups.</li>
            <li> This one was far easier and gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li> All Stainless Steel Double Edge Shaving Razor]]</li>
            <li> Wow what a change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like how well built the TTO (twist to open)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t used to seeing so much blade exposed (especially on the bottom of the blade).</li>
            <li> Each shave pass is also closer than my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the 37c nearly as often as I used to.   </li>
            <li> When I put the old blade in the 37c there was no pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li> As far as my head went it works</li>
            <li> I started getting into straight edge shaving a couple of years ago, but because it takes a bit of time and care still fell back on cartridge razors when I was in a hurry or traveling.</li>
            <li> Many say they use this as their daily shaver, and I have for a few weeks, but this baby really shines on multiple day beard growth.</li>
            <li> I made the switch from traditional because I had course, fast growing hair and was prone to ingrow hairs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you want fast shaving--this requires a process, and time must be devoted to doing this properly.</li>
            <li> I normally shave with a straight razor, but that takes too long and can&#x27;t shave like that during work days, so I bought this as</li>
            <li> would avoid this if you are a first timer, other than that the Slant does live up to the hype and</li>
            <li> And it was pretty damn close for a WTG pass, it was already close enough that it could&#x27;ve been considered my second pass.</li>
            <li> Not familiar with the slant feature yet but sweet as the 34C</li>
            <li> a fast alternative.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving is so close that is almost as if you were shaving with a straight, but in half the time.</li>
            <li> (I do like and recommend the super sharp Merkur double edged blades for a NON-slant safety razor.)      </li>
            <li> and they were sharp enough yet smooth enough to go against the grain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my new daily shaver!</li>
            <li> So I can safely say that my thick facial hair had NO chance against this razor, and yes I did nick and cut myself for the first time in a long time with a DE razor even with proper prep.</li>
            <li> As far as performance of the skew cut, I can&#x27;t really tell a big difference, but maybe I&#x27;m not experienced enough to be able to discern the difference.</li>
            <li> For a series of five blog-journal articles (with lots of photos) on my first week with this razor -- as well as lots of other DE-shaving info, check out shavelikegrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge (I tried a shavette for a while, think like a barbershop blade with a replaceable single edge).</li>
            <li> Of course the Merkur stainless blades are far superior to the old Gillette blue blades; too bad I cannot say the same about the 37C.</li>
            <li> I suppose due to the way the blade touches, is slanted, and you can easily judge where the cutting will take place…for lack of better description.</li>
            <li> Very efficient shave as to be expected from a slant razor.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;aggressiveness\\&quot; is related to the efficient cutting/slicing action.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only used Gillette Silver Blues with this razor.</li>
            <li> this razor is solid and will last forever if taken care of and the slant is noticeably smoother than regular straight razor design.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a coarse beard.  </li>
            <li> Anyone, and I mean anyone, can use it to good effect as long as you have some basic knowledge and experience with wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I shave down first.  </li>
            <li> It did leave a bit more razor burn on my face than the previous razor, and I cut myself a few times.</li>
            <li> Finish your shave with a wet alum block, a cold water rinse, and a healthy handful of Clubman&#x27;s Original or Bay Rum</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s due to the slant angled design you feel both gentle safety bar and aggressive blade...</li>
            <li> I had the feather blades, and they work great with the grain, but made my face extremely raw against the grain, which I need to do due to my thick hairs.</li>
            <li> With the 37c, you really need to be careful under your nose and around your upper lip.</li>
            <li> I have fairly coarse facial hair, which is greying, and my skin is moderately sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting a very close shave directly under my chin and on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched to shaving with a DE blade a few months ago, and it was way better, but still not totally comfortable.</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned about the lack of grip, but after having 30+ shaves I have had little to no problem with grip.</li>
            <li> no problem, XTG some problems, ATG major facial reconstruction!</li>
            <li> My first shave with it was a little intimidating.</li>
            <li> Not long ago, I decided to purchase the Edwin Jagger Kelvin.</li>
            <li> Well, I dropped my old DE razor on the tile once and chipped the edge, so that was my excuse to buy</li>
            <li> I had been using my trusty Merkur 23C I first bought at The Art of Shaving for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even aware of what I was missing.</li>
            <li> In fact if I know I will be tight on time the next morning, that&#x27;s exactly what I do.</li>
            <li> Would take down even a couple days growth on the head (much thicker than my beard hairs) with no problem.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell when I&#x27;m down to just skin.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice and inattentiveness often precedes minor nicks, but the outcome is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> have DE Wet Shaving for less than a month, and when I used this razor, it came VERY natural to me on how to use it, how much pressure to apply and even the angle.</li>
            <li> So after much research into safety razors I put down about 100 bucks on an entire set up: safety razor, a bunch of blades, soap mug, some soap, a razor and brush holder, a couple creams that I don&#x27;t use anymore, and definitely some barber alum.</li>
            <li> I made the switch to this from a cheap-o $5 Chinese razor because it was too mild for my thick, dense beard and it would tug at it as I shaved.</li>
            <li> Gives a very close shave with little effort.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be scared at the slight angle of the blade when it is properly seated in the razor; if you shave normally, you won&#x27;t notice the difference (except, perhaps, in the ease in which the razor goes about its business).  </li>
            <li> Pick a blade just sharp enough to suit your beard, but get coated blades to suit sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> If you are like most people into DE shaving and like to explore new things, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this little razor.</li>
            <li> While this will suit you well whether it is your first razor or your one-hundredth, it will not be very forgiving of flawed technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is very straight and can get thick at times.</li>
            <li> While all razors, blades, and soaps/cremes are personal, I found that with the slant my choice in blade and soap now mattered far less than it did with the Merkur 34.</li>
            <li> I usually would not spend this much on a razor, but my sons gave me money for a birthday</li>
            <li> There are an awful lot of blades out there to throw in a DE razor, and most wet shavers will disagree on which is better than another.  </li>
            <li> I have returned to traditional wet shaving about two and a half years ago, so my technique was down pretty solid.</li>
            <li> Even my wife commented and she normally couldn&#x27;t care less!</li>
            <li> Oblique strokes will either nullify the slant, or, worse, increase it, which could lead quickly to blood loss.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really any closer, but i get the same shaves as with my other straight bar razors with obe less pass</li>
            <li> OK I bought this a few weeks ago, I was starting to become bored with the merkur 180, and figured I was a big boy</li>
            <li> due to my coarse facial hair</li>
            <li> I love the feel and cutting efficiency of this razor.  </li>
            <li> With this, I get a better cutting angle</li>
            <li> After about four months ownership, I was first afraid of this razor a bit, then I became quite fond of it (infatuation, really), then I put it in the closet.</li>
            <li> As long as you adhere to the fundamentals, this razor will not bite you.  </li>
            <li> The problem is you can&#x27;t shave with it the same way you shave with other razors.</li>
            <li> IMHO, after weight and blade-lock, the rest is up to other factors, such as sharpness of the blade and your technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My shaving ended up being same as with any other safety razor.</li>
            <li> I use Personna Red and Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock (Green and Yellow) blades in this razor.</li>
            <li> Mind you, I read the scare stories and was being careful, but about as careful as I am with a regular DE anyway.</li>
            <li> have thick facial hair and sensitive skin, and this does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and a LOT of it, and the efficiency of the slant bar on this razor was pretty much what I needed to tame my beard down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years and wish I had adopted this razor a long time ago.</li>
            <li> With swirls, it&#x27;s impossible to not shave against the grain (which causes irritation) unless you follow the direction of the swirl which could lead to many cuts.  </li>
            <li> I still typically make three passes (wtg, xtg, atg) followed with an occasional water shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Technique differs slightly from a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it slow the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> I mean you have to go super slow</li>
            <li> in my experience, the only way this razor is too aggressive is if you&#x27;re a little to cavalier with your method.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as a daily shaver yet because it seems to be a little to aggressive still.</li>
            <li> You have to be very PATIENT and VERY SLOW with this face eater.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s somewhat irksome that the upper and lower shaving heads appear to be chrome plated diecast and may be likely to pit like the chrome plated diecast exterior parts common on the automobiles of the 1950&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> And if that isn&#x27;t enough to clear things up after a few weeks, stop eating junk food, drink a gallon of water a day, and change your pillow cases and sheets at least once a week.</li>
            <li> And if that isn&#x27;t enough to clear things up after a few weeks, stop eating junk food, drink a gallon of water a day, and change your pillow cases and sheets at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I have a moderate to heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Even shaving carefully and with minimal pressure it was diffucult not to cut myself or to irritate my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He called to let me know that he had shaved, that his face felt boyish, and that he was feverishly waiting for four days to pass so that he could shave again.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about 6 months</li>
            <li> Literally, when I&#x27;m done, I wet my hand and rub my face and neck, and not one stubble.</li>
            <li> There were several 30 minute practice shaves and a few boo boo’s no doubt though.</li>
            <li> If you have been wet shaving for years, but haven&#x27;t purchased a Slant, I truly recommend picking one up.  </li>
            <li> I was curious to see how this one handled compared to my others.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li> The razor would get stuck and drag.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li> Then run your hand over your face, In the areas where you feel uneven stubble, address that with the razor on the next</li>
            <li> Certainly not for newbie wet shavers; but, once you get your technique honed try this one.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is the flat lying hair hard to reach and remove when shaving only downwards.</li>
            <li> i have 5:00 shadow after only a few hours with other type of razors.</li>
            <li> in areas with poor water quality and/or a high concentration of chemicals in the tap</li>
            <li> There seems to be some stigma about this razor and is frequently described as not a good razor for beginners.</li>
            <li> and you might be pushing your luck if you use a sharp blade going ATG.</li>
            <li> You have to relearn how to shave specifically with this razor, forget how you shaved with your other razors.</li>
            <li> I have used blades--intolerable in other razors--</li>
            <li> it is on the sharp side.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Faster shave than other DE razors&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Closer shave than other DE razors</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other razor, it&#x27;s just smoother because of the slanted blade.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews say that this razor isn&#x27;t for beginning wet-shavers and I tend to agree.</li>
            <li> Towards day 5 the blade usually starts tugging and pulling especially around the chin area.</li>
            <li> , my other 4 razors just watch me use this one every day.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave on Mondays and Saturdays, and recently had an even longer beard, so I tried the SLANT.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur HD 37C may not be my everyday razor, but it will be used frequently when I need to get through a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> I have been a DE convert for a few years now, and was previously using the long handled razor.</li>
            <li> Average: four stars.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, let me get the only negative out of the way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s late for about about 1 week and has reached finally.</li>
            <li> I have THICK facial hair, like barbwire.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving now for a few months.</li>

            <li> I have a few razor bumps but not nearly as much as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not press down as you would with a Gillette-esque multi razor, allow the weight of the razor to apply the pressure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try again down the road and see how it works.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble getting a close shave with my other razor, and after some research decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experience razor burn with other razors as I do shave everyday</li>
            <li> Except it&#x27;s less costly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super aggressive, but it will let you know if your technique needs improvement...  </li>
            <li> The 37C is cuts through my thickest hair with less pressure and fewer strokes.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to beginners, but once you have your technique down this little baby belongs in your rotation.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to razor when I have not shaved in a few days and have some stubble that I want to chop down.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing the term \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; when it came to this razor, so I was a little hesitant and apprehensive about using this, but</li>
            <li> I have had this razor a little over 2 months and have used it exclusively since it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Just remember that it&#x27;s an aggressive little bugger with no conscience.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Until I found a little chip in the chrome on the handle.</li>
            <li> I like how the cream just slides through openings in the razor and lets me shave a little bit longer without rinsing the razor.</li>
            <li> Even with the Merkur blade it came with.(felt a little tug here and there)</li>
            <li> I like the blade angle as it feels aggressive enough for my tough stubble.</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard you need a slant.  </li>
            <li> I know this will take a few shaves getting used to</li>
            <li> And just like the safety, after a few uses, I got the hang of it and my shaves are closer than ever.</li>

            <li> I was worried after reading other reports about this shaver being dangerous, and as I have been shaving with a double-edged razor only about 3 months, I knew I had to be very careful.</li>

            <li> This razor is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I had bought this one first. :(</li>
            <li> Point is, my usual experience with the blade were thrown out the window with this razor.</li>
            <li> A bit aggressive, though certainly not my most aggressive razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed something to take down my hair (I shave my head) with as few passes as possible to avoid irritating my skin and cutting down my prep time before work.</li>
            <li> It was very harsh and I got a lot of razor burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are not expensive razors but their reputation for quality is undeserved and they don&#x27;t give a crap.</li>
            <li> and I thought I might find it hard to hold to shave.  </li>
            <li> Depending on the user it has been said this can be a hard razor to use and can hand out nicks and cuts in abundance.</li>
            <li> the blade maybe 5 or 10 degrees so that the sweeping motion of your hand combines with slicing secondary to the angle.</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> at least once every shave.</li>
            <li> in my opinion, this may be the solution for you guys out there with thick and just sort of dense beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful, you can get bit badly.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Not good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This 37C slant was a godsend.</li>
            <li> and I can shave up and down without fear of cutting my throat.  </li>
            <li> Merkur will not stand behind the product.  </li>
            <li> Shave slowly without rushing to prevent razor burn and cutting one’s</li>
            <li> , I know my technique is not perfect</li>
            <li> WAS I WRONG.</li>
            <li> and this baby will never do you wrong.</li>
            <li> I could shave versus an expensive cartridge razor, and believe me I tried all of them.</li>
            <li> :  It is not forgiving to the novice or the careless.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I have used can shave my difficult neck hairs like the 37c.  </li>
            <li> It always would stick the blade out in weird angles.</li>
            <li> Because of its design, the razor blade is twisted a bit and as a result cuts through the hair like a knife through butter.</li>
            <li> Cutting thru butter, I used a Feather razor so it was like</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of this razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s design makes it nearly impossible to foul, even with the heaviest of growth.</li>

            <li> He tried it, BAD idea.  </li>
            <li> I hated the insane pricing of cartridge razors for my Mach 3 and after reading landed on this safety razor.  </li>

            <li> Not familiar with the slant feature yet but sweet as the 34C</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard you need a slant.  Very efficient</li>
            <li> I have THICK facial hair, like barbwire. AND I have sensitive skin. So Leisureguy suggested that I pick up a Slantbar. I found this would best fit my needs. Not too heavy, good grip (this apparently has a better grip than the 39C), decent size, overall a classic. My current razor before this was the Merkur long-handle model 180. So I got this in the mail today after a year of trying out a lot of different razors and blades, including straight razors. I kept hearing the term \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; when it came to this razor, so I was a little hesitant and apprehensive about using this, but then I thought \\&quot;This cannot be any more aggressive than a straight razor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I lathered up good and did my usual pre-shave routine after taking a warm shower and letting my whiskers soak up. First WTG pass was a BREEZE. Cutting thru butter, I used a Feather razor so it was like that hair wasn&#x27;t even there after I was done shaving. And it was pretty damn close for a WTG pass, it was already close enough that it could&#x27;ve been considered my second pass. So I did the next XTG pass, then I started to feel the blade edge against my face more at certain angles. I felt the blade riding on my skin. I knew at this point is when I&#x27;d have to slow down and apply even less pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last pass ATG, and WOW...this IS an aggressive razor! I mean you have to go super slow and you might be pushing your luck if you use a sharp blade going ATG. The safety bar luckily does provide a nice gentle cushion but at the same time the blade will be straight up on your face. It&#x27;s due to the slant angled design you feel both gentle safety bar and aggressive blade...but man I can say with honesty that it is a VERY efficient cut! It&#x27;s supposed to mimic a guillotine where it slices efficiency at an angle. So I can safely say that my thick facial hair had NO chance against this razor, and yes I did nick and cut myself for the first time in a long time with a DE razor even with proper prep. I know this will take a few shaves getting used to but overall I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many have said, this takes experience to use. So as Leisureguy says; \\&quot;Slantbars should be your second razor, not your first.\\&quot; And I couldn&#x27;t agree more. Try a non-slant first before graduating to this bad boy.will take a few shaves getting used to but overall I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many have said, this takes experience to use.

            <li> Great razor, smooth shaver, way better than even I expected!!</li>
            <li> This gives a very close shave with the Gillette Yellow&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, I fear it&#x27;s a bit too much for me as I was getting a cut on every shave, I know my technique is not perfect and I still learning DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would avoid this if you are a first timer, other than that the Slant does live up to the hype and it&#x27;s reputation for being aggressive.</li>
            <li> Awesome razor.  I like the blade angle as it feels aggressive enough for my tough stubble. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor a little over 2 months and have used it exclusively since it arrived.  First of all, this an aggressive razor.  However, if you use care and take your time, you will get an extremely close and comfortable shave.  Secondly, I was also concerned about the size of the razor.  It is the shortest DE razor I have ever used.  I have large hands and I thought I might find it hard to hold to shave.  Quite the contrary, the shorter handle seems to make it easier to manipulate than a longer handled razor.  IF you have the time and patience to treat this razor with respect, you will be rewarded with a great shave.</li>
            <li> After using pretty much all of the Gilette multi blades all the way up to the Fusion growing up, I finally had enough and purchased the Merkur 37c razor. I&#x27;m not sure why I waited so long for a better shave, better skin, and to save money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival I noticed that this product was made in Germany as the box was in strictly German. It&#x27;s already together and is very simple to assemble and disassemble as needed. Hold the Top and unscrew the bottom (See I told you it was easy). The entire piece feels very sturdy and has a great chrome like look. At first I was concerned about the lack of grip, but after having 30+ shaves I have had little to no problem with grip. I do suggest drying your hands/handle once or twice during your shave. I was also concerned with the \\&quot;slant\\&quot; as this was my first double edged razor and a lot of reviews said this razor was aggressive. I&#x27;m here to tell you that it&#x27;s all in your form. This is a smaller handled razor, but still carries a good weight to it. Do not press down as you would with a Gillette-esque multi razor, allow the weight of the razor to apply the pressure. This razor has worked wonderfully on my coarse beard and also my skin. After 5 days of growth this razor will easily shave through my beard with precision while leaving the irritation to the multi-blade cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first DE Razor don&#x27;t be scared, take the plunge, and good luck because you will enjoy!</li>
            <li> While the slant head is a sort of special configuration it&#x27;s somewhat irksome that the upper and lower shaving heads appear to be chrome plated diecast and may be likely to pit like the chrome plated diecast exterior parts common on the automobiles of the 1950&#x27;s.  The lower head is not finished (smooth and polished) nearly as well as the upper one.  Makes me have an even higher regard for my father&#x27;s 60+ year old gold plated brass Gillette which came in a gold plated velvet lined brass case.  Of course the Merkur stainless blades are far superior to the old Gillette blue blades; too bad I cannot say the same about the 37C.</li>
            <li> This razor has a bad reputation for being  too aggressive. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone just coming off disposable cartridges. It certainly is more aggressive than, say, a 40&#x27;s Super Speed, but if you have three, four months practice with any regular double edge razor you&#x27;ll be fine. The most important thing is that you&#x27;ve developed good lathering. I&#x27;ve been wet shaving now for a few months. I use a light touch and short strokes and this razor is joy in the hand. You can feel and hear the difference it makes with the open slicing motion as it cuts the whiskers from your face. Don&#x27;t be fooled by into cowering away from this razor. Anyone, and I mean anyone, can use it to good effect as long as you have some basic knowledge and experience with wet shaving. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my second DE razor, but my first slant razor.  My first DE razor is the Edwin Jagger 89, which is fantastic!  I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now.  I decided to try a slant razor because they are designed to be more aggressive and I have a heavy beard.  I thought why not give it a try? I am now very happy that I have both in my collection.  The Merkur HD 37C may not be my everyday razor, but it will be used frequently when I need to get through a thick beard.  It does have to used slightly more carefully then my Edwin Jagger, but it is not a vast difference.  This razor is clearly designed for the guy who has the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 3pm if he doesn&#x27;t shave correctly.  As a few others have stated, I agree that this razor is not for all, but a great addition that will last a long time. It is well made and easy to remove/add blades.</li>
            <li> Great razor, requires good technique regarding shave angle etc. but very efficient!</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried the 37G (the gold version of this razor) I was sold. While all razors, blades, and soaps/cremes are personal, I found that with the slant my choice in blade and soap now mattered far less than it did with the Merkur 34. Any blade, any cream (brushless or brushed), and in one pass I&#x27;ll be more than presentable. in my experience, the only way this razor is too aggressive is if you&#x27;re a little to cavalier with your method. Going ATG requires a little more care, but if you don&#x27;t need to be BBS, a single WTG pass should more than suffice. The slant can also chop through a week&#x27;s worth of growth far better than any of my straight bar razors as well. That being said, it might not hurt to keep a milder razor around if you want to go BBS with your final pass, but I have no problem keeping the slant as my only razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic razor, quality is top of the line as you&#x27;d expect from Merkur. Since they discontinued to gold version, I picked up the 37C for my travel razor so I don&#x27;t feel awful if I end up forgetting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with the Merkur Slant Safety Razor for several months.  I am 73 years old and have \\&quot;wet shaved\\&quot; all my life.  I have a moderate to heavy beard.  At first I also used the Merkur blades with the Merkur Slant Safety Razor.  They are excellent, but are too sharp for the slant razor.  Even shaving carefully and with minimal pressure it was diffucult not to cut myself or to irritate my face.  However, I switched to \\&quot;generic\\&quot; drug store razor blades which are good but not quite as sharp.  I find that to be a superior combination for me.  Close shaves, but no more cuts or irritations.      The best shaves for me are with soft water to maximize lather and to reduce dulling the blade, a badger brush and mug shave soap, and the Merkur Slant Razor and drug store double edged blades.  (I do like and recommend the super sharp Merkur double edged blades for a NON-slant safety razor.)      I shave down first.  After that I shave up against the grain.  Under the nose I go sideways in both directions.  Works for me, and I love the feel and cutting efficiency of this razor.  The Merkur Slant Safety Razor is highly recommended, but with my reservation as noted.</li>
            <li> This razor is very well made and gives a very close shave. It is certainly more &#x27;aggressive&#x27; than a straight-bar razor, however don&#x27;t let that deter you. It&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to the razor. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Typically excellent quality and craftsmanship from Merkur. Very efficient shave as to be expected from a slant razor. Nice weight and balance. Great bargain price especially for a slant razor. A tad aggressive though. Make sure you pair it with a blade like a Derby or a Gillette Silver Blue and a good quality soap. Slant razors take a little more patience at first but it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my thrift store purchase Weimar era Hoffritz slant blade razor which had seen better days and was truly worn out. Merkur took over Hoffritz years ago and this razor is a close version of my original. The indescribable effects of 6 or 7 decades of use aside, the two razors are indeed very similar. Like the original, this razor pivots (cantors?  not sure of how to exactly describe it) the blade maybe 5 or 10 degrees so that the sweeping motion of your hand combines with slicing secondary to the angle. Imagine a capital letter T and now tilt the top bar so that instead of pointing to 3 and 9 o&#x27;clock, it&#x27;s pointing to 3:30 and 9:30. Dig it? The outcome is a super close shave especially good for thicker, rougher stubble. It takes a little practice and inattentiveness often precedes minor nicks, but the outcome is worth the effort. Recommended but maybe not as a first safety razor.</li>
            <li> Aggressive in a nice way.  If you know how to use a safety razor (important), this doesn&#x27;t turn your face into hamburger anymore than any other razor.  The \\&quot;aggressiveness\\&quot; is related to the efficient cutting/slicing action.  Even with the relatively sharp blades I use (Astra Superior Platinum), this is a comfortable razor.  I still typically make three passes (wtg, xtg, atg) followed with an occasional water shave.  The difference ... due to my coarse facial hair ... I no longer need to buff the troubling areas (never could attain bbs before).  The Slant Bar yields a bbs with no buffing necessary.  My skin appreciates that!  Plus, when in a hurry, my daily dfs can be reached in two passes now (wtg, xtg).  YMMV  Merkur 37C  Astra Superior Platinum</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to beginners, but once you have your technique down this little baby belongs in your rotation. It&#x27;s particularly good if you&#x27;re sporting a few days&#x27; worth of stubble. I&#x27;m using it with Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock and Israeli Personnas, and am very happy with the results. Just remember that it&#x27;s an aggressive little bugger with no conscience. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was having trouble getting a close shave with my other razor, and after some research decided to try this one.  It doesn&#x27;t replace the need for good technique, but it makes the shave noticeably more efficient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a little harsh, but couples great with my favorite blade- the dull but smooth dorco 300s.  It&#x27;s currently my every day razor. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> i have 5:00 shadow after only a few hours with other type of razors. The 37 C is the right length  and weight. With the slant bar design it attacks my whiskers. Baby smooth finish...</li>
            <li> Works better than expected. A lovely, close shave that will make one look forward to the next time. Truly a delight. I am glad I chose the 37HD over the 34HD.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR,CUTS STUBBLE LIKE A HOT KNIFE CUTS THROUGH BUTTER! GIVES A VERY CLOSE AND SMOOTH SHAVE WITH JUST TWO PASSES.VERY EFFECTIVE, AND I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my father - he will not review - so please, allow me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He called to let me know that he had shaved, that his face felt boyish, and that he was feverishly waiting for four days to pass so that he could shave again. He also mentioned that the included blade was slanted, &amp;#34;like a guillotine&amp;#34;. This was a good thing, he says.</li>
            <li> Close shave and extremely agile in your hand. It does go through blades more quickly.</li>
            <li> Purchased the slant based on the hype on shaving websites.  I do not consider it to be &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; as so many enthusiasts do simply because (IMHO) the amount of &amp;#34;aggression&amp;#34; depends on the pressure applied by its user.  Having said that, the slant does offer a great advantage for people with hair that grows in swirl patterns (as mine does).  With swirls, it&#x27;s impossible to not shave against the grain (which causes irritation) unless you follow the direction of the swirl which could lead to many cuts.  With this, I get a better cutting angle and I can shave up and down without fear of cutting my throat.  I sometimes get irritation but it&#x27;s to do with the pressure that I apply (like when I&#x27;m in a hurry).</li>
            <li> I purchased the Merkur 37G In Gold .  I have been wet shaving for about 6 months and I am impressed by this razor.  It does take a little while to get used to.  The rewards are a shave that&#x27;s as close to being shaved with a straight blade. Example, with a regular safety razor I need to do 3 passes for that BBS shave.  With the slant bar I can do this with 2 passes.  Try it , I think you will like the shave you get !!</li>
            <li> I have been intimidated by the looks of this razor, but decided to give it a chance. I have returned to traditional wet shaving about two and a half years ago, so my technique was down pretty solid. Yesterday, I had my first shave with this razor and I was amazed by it. Near BBS shave in two passes and some touch ups. No irritation whatsoever. No stinging with the after shave. This razor goes to the top of my favorites list. I usually would not spend this much on a razor, but my sons gave me money for a birthday and I pulled the trigger. I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Just got the 37C and first impressions are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a good amount of heft, which is great in my opinion. The knurling on the handle provides vary good gripping of the razor even when wet and soapy. For the first shave a did not use the supplied sample blade in favor of a Derby so I could get a better comparison to my usual shavers. With the Derby blade a close and comfortable shave was delivered. Weight and slant did seem to give a better cut and very smooth finish. Depending on the user it has been said this can be a hard razor to use and can hand out nicks and cuts in abundance. I did not encounter anything like this found this to be a very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the downside and reason for one star removal, the 37C is a nice razor but is lacking in a couple of areas. First the overall finish could be a little better - for example visible machining lines can be seen. While this razor has a great weighty feel it is just as lacking that perfectly balanced feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current weapon of choice is a Edwin Jagger DE89BL truly an outstanding razor when speaking of a chrome finish, it is near flawless in its finish. If I could combine the fit, finish, and balanced feel of the Edwin Jagger DE89BL and the weight and cut of the Merkur 37C that would be an awesome razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great razor and worthy of giving it a try. It will be included in the regularly used razor list especially when a close shave is desired. Hopefully the finish stands up to time and wears well as some have reported premature degrading finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without stepping up to a higher price bracket either of these two razors are worth having. As for the 37C get one ASAP, give the slant a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: If you have the funds to blow on a razor - look at the AboveTheTie Kronos or Atlas SS models. These are truely works of art. They display the extreme quality and craftmanship and deliver an awesome shave. The mildest plate delivered a better shave than the agressive 37C. (but does cost almost 4x as much)</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading other reports about this shaver being dangerous, and as I have been shaving with a double-edged razor only about 3 months, I knew I had to be very careful. I have had no problems. As with any razor, you need to pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing. I like the time savings of only  two passes and still getting a great shave. I occasionally switch off with my Merkur 34C for a day here and there, but the Slant is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge (I tried a shavette for a while, think like a barbershop blade with a replaceable single edge). This one was far easier and gives a closer shave. I had the feather blades, and they work great with the grain, but made my face extremely raw against the grain, which I need to do due to my thick hairs. The blades I got are Rapira and they were sharp enough yet smooth enough to go against the grain. I almost wish I had 2, one to go with the grain with a feather and one against with the Rapira blade.</li>
            <li> This slant razor is super aggressive and tears up my face, but somehow doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck at all, and even does a great job of getting those hard to get hairs that every other razor seems to have trouble with.  I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as someone&#x27;s first safety razor, but it&#x27;s found a valuable place in my morning routine.</li>
            <li> It cuts better than my 34c.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after having had a really great BSS with the Merkur 37C razor. Everyone talks about how intimidating this razor can be, or how aggressive it can be. My experience with this razor is nothing but good. After I figured out how to shave my sideburns, the rest was easy. You have to ignore the safety bar angle you see against your skin. Do not try to adjust it, it&#x27;s supposed to cut like a scythe and not like an axe. The handle has a great knurling and feels almost like my [[ASIN:B004E5GV82 Feather All Stainless Steel Double Edge Shaving Razor]] in my hand. There is the larger 39C for those gents that prefer a longer handle. This is a two-piece razor, so all you have to do to change blades is to unscrew the bottom knob and the head assembly can be removed. Very easy.&lt;br /&gt;I see no reason not to try this razor as the price point is low. If you become a big fan, there is always the IKON Slant, for about 5-6 times the money.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my first slant bar razor and I love it. Size and weight are good. Been shaving on work days for 2 weeks, on the first days I had to make sure I was more careful around the jaw line but now everything is the same speed. It does feel like a closer shave than my straight bar.</li>
            <li> This slant razor does a great job taking out hair growth. The problem is you can&#x27;t shave with it the same way you shave with other razors. You have to relearn your shaving techniques for this hair muncher. I have been shaving for 3 months with my Edwin Jagger which I love. When I saw the Merkur Slant I figured I can get a razor that can reduce the number of passes I make with my Jagger. My Edwin Jagger is very forgiving and mild for me, so when I purchased this razor I used the same methods I used with the Jagger......BOY WAS I WRONG. It was a BLOOD BATH for my face. I could not stop getting nicks and weepers, something I thought I finally learned to avoid with my Jagger. The blades that worked for my Jagger DID NOT work for this razor. Shaving WTG no problem, XTG some problems, ATG major facial reconstruction! You have to relearn how to shave specifically with this razor, forget how you shaved with your other razors. You have to be very PATIENT and VERY SLOW with this face eater. I finally found 2 blades that work for this razor and my face which are FEATHER and GILLETTE SILVZER BLUES. Forget the Derbys and Chrome Sharks which worked on my Jagger. When I tore up my face I would have to wait 3 days before my face recovered enough to shave again. Even with my preshave and Tabac shaving soap this baby bites into the face when you try anything more than 2 passes. I have gotten to better with this lawn mower. But I am going to retreat to my mother Edwin Jagger and take a break from it. I can&#x27;t get a BBS shave with this without facial devastation. I will have to wait until my shaving abilities get Jedi Knight ready before I take this light saber on again.</li>
            <li> I like this razor very much! I thought that the slant would be too much for me, but it was just right!</li>
            <li> A hefty, compact, awesome razor. Certainly not for newbie wet shavers; but, once you get your technique honed try this one. Gives a very close shave with little effort. I have done a couple WTG passes and it&#x27;s a closer shave than my Edwin Jagger DE89 (which is also an awesome tool) gives when I add XTG and ATG passes. With the 37c, you really need to be careful under your nose and around your upper lip. If you&#x27;re not careful, you can get bit badly. I use Personna Red and Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock (Green and Yellow) blades in this razor. Finish your shave with a wet alum block, a cold water rinse, and a healthy handful of Clubman&#x27;s Original or Bay Rum After Shave splash...and you are go to go!</li>
            <li> Like everyone else on the planet I hated the insane pricing of cartridge razors for my Mach 3 and after reading landed on this safety razor.  I got a sample pack and think I&#x27;ve settled on the feather blades which are really nice.  I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t prefer the slant and the handle is too stubby but I like the weight and am happy otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably end up replacing this eventually but it was a nice entry into a new territory for me :)</li>
            <li> Great razor great quality every thing you come to expect from merkur. This razor is the ultimate in value and performance. If i had two lifetimes and knew id out last the one i have now id buy two just for s*** and giggles. Just remember light to no pressure  and this baby will never do you wrong.</li>
            <li> I normally shave with a straight razor, but that takes too long and can&#x27;t shave like that during work days, so I bought this as a fast alternative.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving is so close that is almost as if you were shaving with a straight, but in half the time. It takes sometime getting used to it, though, the handle is heavier and the blade still has more chance to cut you than a Gillette cheap system.</li>
            <li> Came quick and looks nice.. Until I found a little chip in the chrome on the handle. Sending it back and hopefully can change this review</li>
            <li> This with personna blades, Baum.Be soap &amp; a Plisson brush gave me best close shave ever</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have used! I had to experiment with many different blades to find the right combination that worked for my skin and beard, but since I figured that out it has been great.</li>
            <li> Go gently and the razor cuts the stubble very efficiently with a sharp smooth blade.</li>
            <li> I remember when I got my first safety razor about a year ago. I was astonished at how much closer I could shave versus an expensive cartridge razor, and believe me I tried all of them. They all worked, some better than others, and I could get a decent shave pretty quick if I had shaved in the past few days, but pretty much they were all very expensive and to me just we’re doing what I felt they should do for that kind of money. So after much research into safety razors I put down about 100 bucks on an entire set up: safety razor, a bunch of blades, soap mug, some soap, a razor and brush holder, a couple creams that I don&#x27;t use anymore, and definitely some barber alum. The first few strokes with my new safety razor were astonishing. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference between a cartridge and a safety razor. Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you that I felt that same difference when I got this slant razor. And just like the safety, after a few uses, I got the hang of it and my shaves are closer than ever. Literally, when I&#x27;m done, I wet my hand and rub my face and neck, and not one stubble. Baby’s bottom people. It&#x27;s so close, I have no problem shaving the night before and going to work the next day. In fact if I know I will be tight on time the next morning, that&#x27;s exactly what I do. Plus, I easily get that hard to reach spot right under the nose. Trimming altogether is the easiest with the slant I suppose due to the way the blade touches, is slanted, and you can easily judge where the cutting will take place…for lack of better description. Let me put it this way:  If a cartridge razor were  a BB gun, a safety razor is a .22 caliber, making a slant razor a sniper rifle. Except it&#x27;s less costly. Well, do you have to be more careful? Duh. Nonetheless I can shave now in maybe 5 min extra time than with a cartridge and, I haven&#x27;t needed barber alum since my third shave with a slant. There were several 30 minute practice shaves and a few boo boo’s no doubt though. Here&#x27;s another noteworthy point. I find that because there is more space between the blade and razor, it doesn&#x27;t clog up. So if I go a week without shaving, with the slant, no problem. The scruff comes off just about as quick. Whereas with a cartridge and even with a safety they will clog and you spend more time rinsing. Also, I don&#x27;t know if it matters, but personally I almost always shave after a shower; and after I shave I always always always wash and rub fairly vigorously my face and neck with a rag and face soap, and then another final rinse. No pimples, no irritation, no problem. (I should note that I&#x27;m a white guy with a thick beard. Think: light a match off my face) Sorry brothers, this will probably send you to the hospital if you&#x27;re a big ingrown hair guy. And if you are a young person, in general, make sure you do the face and neck wash with a rag and face soap after anytime you sweat, and always before bed, and when you wake up - and that will take care of almost all pimples. And if that isn&#x27;t enough to clear things up after a few weeks, stop eating junk food, drink a gallon of water a day, and change your pillow cases and sheets at least once a week. That said, I recommend buying a cheap safety razor, get good at shaving with it, and then buy a nice slant razor. Be manly and save money.er noteworthy point.

            <li> Melts all hair beneath its mighty bite. Just be sure your technique is on-point because the blade exposure is very prominent. Nothing to fear with it, just give it the respect it deserves and you&#x27;ll get a great shave from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed something to take down my hair (I shave my head) with as few passes as possible to avoid irritating my skin and cutting down my prep time before work. I had been using my trusty Merkur 23C I first bought at The Art of Shaving for a few years now. Not long ago, I decided to purchase the Edwin Jagger Kelvin. Due to my lurking on wet shaving forums I noticed the EJ DE89 was a popular product and the Kelvin was a shorter, knurled handle version, to all intents and purposes. It&#x27;s a nice little razor but never got me &#x27;close&#x27; close and it took way to many passes to get the job done. Even shaving the night before and taking the time to go over areas again and again, I would end up having to switch back to the 23C to clean up again in the morning. Not good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This 37C slant was a godsend. Very aggressive and efficient. Would take down even a couple days growth on the head (much thicker than my beard hairs) with no problem. Takes a steady hand, concentration, and good technique to keep it going safely. If you start daydreaming, the razor might make you pay for it. A lot more blade is exposed compared to other razors. You need to pay attention to the angle of the blade and direction of your stroke a lot more than you would with other, more mild razors. Also, do not attempt to apply pressure to this razor as you run it across your skin. More than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried, this one will make you pay for pressing it into your skin. Let the weight of the razor make the contact with the skin and allow the aggressiveness do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had the respect it for what it can do, my shaves ended up much closer. This razor doesn&#x27;t require many passes to reach the closeness desired, so my skin will tends to be less irritated (YMMV).&lt;br /&gt;Also note that there are two slants made by Merkur. This short-handled 37C and the longer-handled 39C. Even with large hands I prefer the short handles because I feel it gives me more control when working in difficult areas, like the back of my head and neck and around my ears. Though, I hear the balance of the 39C lends more weight to the head of the razor and makes for less pressure required in the pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this little razor and is now my go-to when getting ready for work or a night out.

            <li> Feels great in hand and looks great on the counter top! More agresive then the 34c</li>
            <li> For the price, this is an amazing razor. If you want a longer handle go for the 39c.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick facial hair and sensitive skin, and this does wonders for me. Definetly requires a bit of a lighter touch though.&lt;br /&gt;Technique differs slightly from a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are waiting on the razorock stealth, or ikon slant. I suggest you give this razor a shot. While those razors may be milder/smoother shavers, they are a much higher price. If you can shave comfortably with this one, which many people can. Then there may be no reason to buy another razor again &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> [Revised review:] After about four months ownership, I was first afraid of this razor a bit, then I became quite fond of it (infatuation, really), then I put it in the closet. I have a couple other DE razors that, when paired with the right blade, give consistently more comfortable shaves that can still be quite close without the potential irritation and hazard of this slant.    If you have skin that&#x27;s rather on the tougher side and need a high-capacity razor, this may do the trick. It can shave very close, baby-skin close. Just be sure to use light pressure and shave exclusively with direct strokes (that is, stroke direction parallel to the handle). Oblique strokes will either nullify the slant, or, worse, increase it, which could lead quickly to blood loss.    For shave capacity, this slant razor has plenty. In terms of harshness, however, it is only moderate. For one thing, larger capacity (larger blad-bar gap combined with neutral blade exposure) tends to correlate with increased harshness. Secondly, the slanted blade has a twist as well (which is the nature of slant-bar razors) that makes the blade edge have varied blade angles (different than the constant slant) along its length. (This is all explained in various blog articles of mine.) The varied blade angle makes the edge more face friendly at the end where the blade-bar gap is larger, but more harsh where the gap is smaller -- so the large capacity plus the varying blade angle yields the moderate harshness. So if you have sensitive skin and are determined to use this razor, be sure to use a blade that is coated for smoothness. Pick a blade just sharp enough to suit your beard, but get coated blades to suit sensitive skin.    Five stars for quality, great blade self-centering (when the proper process is used -- see my web site), heft and implementation of the general design. Three stars because *any* slant razor is kind of a specialty, niche product that is often overkill.... probably not for most shavers. Average: four stars.

            <li> Full disclosure: this is my 4th DE razor, and I only started DE shaving 2 months ago. I have a nice brush, Tribute shave cream, And Proraso preshave cream. I alternate between Personna Blues and Feather Blades, depending on beard growth and the razor that I&#x27;m using. I have fairly coarse facial hair, which is greying, and my skin is moderately sensitive. I have trouble getting a very close shave directly under my chin and on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the Edwin Jagger DE89. Good shave, but not close enough. I bought the Merkur Futur, better, but bulky and unwieldy. But better. I then bought the Muhle R41, an open comb razor which provides a very close shave, but is not comfortable to use, and tended to nick my throat area more than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the Merkur HD slant, hoping for something smoother and closer. This razor is unbelievable. Seriously. So smooth, extremely close, no nicks, neck feels great, under the chin has never been this smooth. A truly amazing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had bought this one first. :(</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for over three years now and have purchased or used more than a dozen double-edge razors.  In my experience with wet shaving, I can tell you that of the five razors I use most, Merkur holds two of the top five.  The first is my Merkur Progress (with modifications to the adjustment mechanism, making it a \\&quot;Mergress\\&quot;) and the second is this razor, the Slant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is the slant so high on my list?  First, it is agressive (i.e., effective at mowing down stubble), without any decrease in the comfort of the shave.  It is the rare shave when I experience any irritation with the Slant, and when I do, I am certain it is user error.  Don&#x27;t be scared at the slight angle of the blade when it is properly seated in the razor; if you shave normally, you won&#x27;t notice the difference (except, perhaps, in the ease in which the razor goes about its business).  Second, the manufacturing of Merkur products is top notch.  The heft and balance of the razor is spot on and the knurling makes the razor virtually slip-free.  Some razor manufacturers clearly have defective molds, resulting in pitting or imperfections with the finished product. I have never seen an obvious defect in any of the five Merkur razors that I have owned.  The two piece assembly of this product couldn&#x27;t be any easier to use; it fits together snugly and securely and is easy to clean.  Finally, I find the Slant to be flattering to MOST razor blades.  There are an awful lot of blades out there to throw in a DE razor, and most wet shavers will disagree on which is better than another.  This whole debate is moot, in my opinion, when it comes to the Slant.  I have used blades--intolerable in other razors--that work perfectly well in the Slant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to wet shaving, this is a fantastic entry level razor.  As long as you adhere to the fundamentals, this razor will not bite you.  If you have been wet shaving for years, but haven&#x27;t purchased a Slant, I truly recommend picking one up.  It is a great everyday shaver and will likely end up being one of your favorites as well.e up.  It is a great everyday shaver and will likely end up being one of your favorites as well.</li>
            <li> I paired this razor with a Derby blade and a Personna Lab Blue and both were wicked close shaves.</li>
            <li> I love the weighty heft and the simple, but extremely solid mechanism for securing the blade.  It&#x27;s heavy enough that with a good blade, the weight of the razor does all the work.  I really don&#x27;t think the slant adds or detracts much from the shave, though.  IMHO, after weight and blade-lock, the rest is up to other factors, such as sharpness of the blade and your technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur blade that comes with it is on the sharp side.  If you&#x27;re used to pressing (at all) as with a cartridge razor, don&#x27;t.  Instead go as light as you can and let the weight of the razor do the work.  Also, you might want to consider a blade variety pack to see which ones you like best.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at the differences between each brand/type.</li>
            <li> Works quite well but causes problems with TSA</li>
            <li> Pros:  I have used this razor in my rotation of razors for years.  Don&#x27;t let the looks intimidate you. A standard razor tugs.  This razor has a slicing motions that makes for a surprisingly smooth smooth shave.  Even with the sharpest blades - your shave is smooth.  And very close.  I can get away with one pass plus some touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It is not forgiving to the novice or the careless.  Out of the zillion times I have used it - I did cut myself just once.  A bit more severe that being cut with a standard razor.  As with any shaver (even a &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; one) - always have a styptic stick handy.</li>
            <li> I used this razor with a feather blade and it was the best shave I have ever had. At first it looks as if your razor was warped in production but it&#x27;s supposed to look like that.  The design angles the blade for it&#x27;s unique slicing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Faster shave than other DE razors&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave than other DE razors&lt;br /&gt;No irritation&lt;br /&gt;If bought in bulk on Amazon, blades are between 8-35 cents each.</li>
            <li> Great slant! The handle is too heavy. The lighter the handle, the better the control. I don&#x27;t know what the fascination is with 1/2 pound handles, but the lighter ones let you feel the grain better,</li>
            <li> This is the third razor I have owned in the 3 years I&#x27;ve been using DE razors, and this is the best. Currently using the Merkur platinum blade that came with it, but I will be trying feathers soon. It&#x27;s got a nice weight and a short handle. The slant makes the shave very aggressive, which is what I&#x27;ve gotten used to due to my first razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this slant razor for about a month now and am so far loving it. I&#x27;ve had over one year experience with DE razors (EJ DE 89) and have longed for a more aggressive shave. Well, I dropped my old DE razor on the tile once and chipped the edge, so that was my excuse to buy another razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research on the forums, and Amazon reviews, I settled on this two piece slant razor. Wow what a change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the razor itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me get the only negative out of the way. The plating isn&#x27;t as nice as the EJ DE 89. Specifically, the underside of the top piece isn&#x27;t smooth or well finished like the DE 89. However, The outside of the razor (top side, shaft, etc.) is plated very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the positives. I really like how well built the TTO (twist to open) mechanism is. You twist the bottom of the pole to release the top plate. The bottom plate is permanently connected to the pole (hence, two piece TTO razor). The entire center of the shaft is hollow, which is great because you can rinse it through, or stick a q-tip in there for cleaning. I like the handle a lot more than my DE 89L, the texture on the pole is much rougher and easier to grip. The weight of the razor is good and never feels too light (which is good in DE shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like the design of this razor, and having it be two piece instead of three makes such a huge difference in handling. I used to drop my 3 piece EJ DE 89 all the time, always one stray piece at a time. Now, two pieces for two hands. Makes for easy cleaning and drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the shave:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only used Gillette Silver Blues with this razor. Day 1 was really intimidating. I wasn&#x27;t used to seeing so much blade exposed (especially on the bottom of the blade). Day 2-3 was where most of the learning process took place. Now, I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with using the razor with my Gillette Silver Blues and I&#x27;ve never looked back. It&#x27;s definitely a more aggressive shave due to its slant design (which means that it cuts closer, faster, more danger of cuts if you&#x27;re not careful). But as I get used to it, I definitely noticed myself shaving a bit faster than I did with the DE 89. I like how the cream just slides through openings in the razor and lets me shave a little bit longer without rinsing the razor. Each shave pass is also closer than my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, there&#x27;s millions of combinations of DE razors, DE razor blades, shaving brushes, shaving creams and aftershaves. You&#x27;ll probably never find the perfect setup, but you can certainly find a comfortable one. The Merkur HD Slant is a fantastic second razor and is well built. I would recommend it for anyone that&#x27;s had a reasonable amount of experience with DE shaving and is looking for something more aggressive and faster to shave with.</li>
            <li> Do not fear the slant razor. Once you have a proper shaving technique, this razor will give you a very close and surprising smooth, and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This is a mildly aggressive razor, definitely not for a beginner but for someone who wants a slightly more aggressive shave then a regular Merkur 34C. The weight of the razor is nice and the chrome finish and knurling is excellent. I recommended using it with a light touch only. My beard is very straight and can get thick at times. It shaves well with 2 to 3 days of growth. I also recommend using a good slick soap or shave cream. As for blades I use persona blue or feather or Astra, all worked well.</li>
            <li> Efficient Comfortable DE.  It&#x27;s not really any closer, but i get the same shaves as with my other straight bar razors with obe less pass and no need for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I always had problems when shaving. To do it downwards left hair as if I did not shave at all and doing it upwards meant irritation  plus ingrown hairs. My dermatologist suggest me shave exclusively downwards. Something ineffective to get the clean shaving quality I want  but effective for avoding said problems. I decided to give this a try because of all the reviews and some YouTube videos on techniques that seemed to be the right ones . My shaving ended up being same as with any other safety razor. Maybe it is the flat lying hair hard to reach and remove when shaving only downwards.</li>
            <li> High quality razor. Nice finish.. Good knurling on the handle.</li>
            <li> This razor is so much smoother than my Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34c. It really pays to try 6-8 different blades with any new razor. The blades that work the best in the 34c aren&#x27;t the same as the blades that work best in this #37c. There seems to be some stigma about this razor and is frequently described as not a good razor for beginners. I don&#x27;t agree, just use a VERY light touch and if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll have no problems with this razor.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Shaves aggressively. Is heavy (which is what I was looking for). I plan to use this razor for many years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of this razor.  It&#x27;s just like any other razor, it&#x27;s just smoother because of the slanted blade.  You&#x27;ll especially notice this when you&#x27;ve not shaved for a week.  If you&#x27;re just starting out - follow the same rule you would if you were using a disposable:  DON&#x27;T PUSH.  Just let the weight of the razor do the work.  Properly lubricate and use decent shaving cream and you&#x27;ll be fine.  I would also suggest using the sharpest blades you can find, like Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back, I wish I had started with this and the Merkur adjustable razor.  This would have given me a good foundation of what is available and saved me a little money in the long-run.  These two razors do everything I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this razor is solid and will last forever if taken care of and the slant is noticeably smoother than regular straight razor design.  I just wish Merkur made an adjustable slant - THAT would be the perfect razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a double edge safety razor for about a year now. I was curious to see how this one handled compared to my others.  I can say that without a doubt that it give the closest shave. It is a more aggressive shave, but with good shaving cream it shaves very well. Other reviews say that this razor isn&#x27;t for beginning wet-shavers and I tend to agree. While this will suit you well whether it is your first razor or your one-hundredth, it will not be very forgiving of flawed technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new daily shaver!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor. I had been shaving for about two years with the Hefty Classic and decided to go with something new, I&#x27;m glad I did. As has been said before, it is a very aggressive shave which leads to amazing closeness. Should have bought this much sooner.</li>
            <li> I made the switch to this from a cheap-o $5 Chinese razor because it was too mild for my thick, dense beard and it would tug at it as I shaved. This left razor bumps and gave me many ingrown hairs. I just used the 37C for the first time and what a world of difference it made! I used the same technique and products as I did with the $5 razor, but the 37C sliced through my tough beard much more easily and without any tugging. I have a few razor bumps but not nearly as much as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell why everyone says it&#x27;s more aggressive though. It did leave a bit more razor burn on my face than the previous razor, and I cut myself a few times. I&#x27;m still a bit inexperienced, though, and I think that with some practice I&#x27;ll be getting a great shave with the 37C!</li>
            <li> This Razor is NOT overly aggressive as I&#x27;ve read everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have DE Wet Shaving for less than a month, and when I used this razor, it came VERY natural to me on how to use it, how much pressure to apply and even the angle. I have a very tough beard and a LOT of it, and the efficiency of the slant bar on this razor was pretty much what I needed to tame my beard down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reduced tugging and pulling significantly, even with my first shave with it, no nicks, not even razor burn! At least compared to other razors like the Merkur 34C (Also recommended. Mild aggressive razor, for beginners and &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34;) and Gillette Slim Adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;So in my opinion, this may be the solution for you guys out there with thick and just sort of dense beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment with this razor!</li>
            <li> The razor looks nice and does provide a close shave BUT the amount of cuts on my neck and face is forcing me back to my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Great Razor  I wish I would have started with this razor, give me the best shave</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite safety razor.  Nothing I have used can shave my difficult neck hairs like the 37c.  Good technique, very light pressure, quality lather, and the right blades make all the difference.  It&#x27;s not super aggressive, but it will let you know if your technique needs improvement...  For me, I use mostly Proraso green soap and either Feather or Astra SP blades.  Feather is my personal favorite with this razor, but the Astra&#x27;s are a close second...and 1/3 the price of the Feathers.    Update 8/17/16   I don&#x27;t use the 37c nearly as often as I used to.   I do get an amazingly close shave with each use,  just came to the conclusion that it&#x27;s too much for my face on a day to day basis.  It is my razor of choice when I have more than three days growth to hack through.   It&#x27;s design makes it nearly impossible to foul, even with the heaviest of growth.</li>
            <li> Really starting to like this razor. My first shave with it was a little intimidating. I&#x27;ve been shaving DE for a few years now, but was aware that people say it&#x27;s fairly agressive. I shaved for probably the third time with it today and didn&#x27;t even find myself trying to be more careful with this particular razor. As far as performance of the skew cut, I can&#x27;t really tell a big difference, but maybe I&#x27;m not experienced enough to be able to discern the difference. It is nice and stout with a good weight to it. It&#x27;s the shortest handle in my bunch. The chrome plating is good, but not as perfect as Muhle chroming. If you are like most people into DE shaving and like to explore new things, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this little razor. I do notice a difference in comfort of shave with regards to quality of the lather. Make sure you are getting a good thick lather on your face and not just a running soap. I was shaving for years with a running soap until I watched some youtube videos on how to lather. I wasn&#x27;t even aware of what I was missing. Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a gold Markur HD 34G for a couple years, which has been my favorite razor ... until now.  Just had my first shave with a chrome HD Slant and it&#x27;s one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  Only nicked myself 1 time, and after a few more shaves I&#x27;m sure I will master it just as well as any regular DE.  Slant is a great idea and sure to be my daily razor for a long time.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it with a Feather blade.</li>
            <li> Wow! I ordered a 15c to try out. I was using a 33c and wanted to try an open comb. I instead was shipped this. What a pleasant mistake.  I also ordered some personna blades with it. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet. Instead, to see how the razor shaved, I used a derby blade that I used all week (5 face shaves and 3 head shaves on the blade). Towards day 5 the blade usually starts tugging and pulling especially around the chin area. When I put the old blade in the 37c there was no pulling or tugging. It was almost like a brand new blade.  I find the 37c definitely does slice through hair better. Absolutely no tugging or pulling. I get a much smoother closer shave with no irritation. With my 33c the corners of my mouth were tricky. The razor would get stuck and drag. The 37c glides right over with no friction.  I&#x27;ll update when I try it on my head/with personna blades.  Update: I love this razor. There is absolutely no pulling or tugging. First shave with the personna blades on 3 days of hair felt like no blade and no hair. Amazing. 5 days of with the grain 1 pass. I&#x27;ve experience razor burn with other razors as I do shave everyday and I will say if you do get razor burn this combo will magnify the feeling. Nothing unbearable. And once I was dine shaving it was gone. (1 out of 5 and it was just my chin)  As far as my head went it works really well however I did nick myself at least once every shave. Nothing that didn&#x27;t stop bleeding on its own bedre the end of the shave.  Update 2: Well the second week of shaving with this razor wasn&#x27;t as pleasant. It was very harsh and I got a lot of razor burn. Also my face was breaking out because I think it is took close of a shave. Its still a great razor but it may not be and every day or even every week razor. I&#x27;ll try again down the road and see how it works. The first week was the best shave or my life.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a coarse beard.  This razor does an amazing job of giving me the closest of shaves with minimal irritation.  It requires a light touch to use but rewards that light touch with an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years and wish I had adopted this razor a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought the slant bar first, my other 4 razors just watch me use this one every day.  I know they claim you should call your children and tell them you love them before putting a slant to your throat but, this is the tamest razor I own and cuts my tough beard better than any other.  Grab a Feather blade and go for it !  You will be glad you did.  I will only buy slants in the future</li>
            <li> OK I bought this a few weeks ago, I was starting to become bored with the merkur 180, and figured I was a big boy so I could handle this razor. I have a fine beard and regular skin, and this razor makes short work of my stubble. some people fear the term &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; but do not buy in to that, this is not for a newbie. wait 90 days then get this.</li>
            <li> This Merkur HD Slant razor is indeed a precision and well-built shaving instrument.  Having already one Merkur razor on my bathroom shelves I decided to tackle the use of this precision instrument.&lt;br /&gt;Having been reintroduced to the uses the double edge razor for over a year now I purchased the Merkur HD Slant razor.  Using the standby rituals for a close and safe shave as described below:&lt;br /&gt;1. Use of a pre-shave lotion to soften the beard.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use of a good Shaving Cream.&lt;br /&gt;3. Shave without undue pressure letting the weight of the razor lightly.&lt;br /&gt;4. First pass with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;5. Second pass against the grain even lighter.&lt;br /&gt;6. Shave slowly without rushing to prevent razor burn and cutting one’s self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found at first use I indeed had to shave even slower.  As I cut myself on the lower left chin trying to shave below the chin line.  Hence I had my first bleeder in a year and the sound of Jaws emanated in the background.  As I returned to my gentler Merkur I healed as I contemplated the use of the slant razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I did return slowing my motion ever more carefully without a nick or a burn.  The razor will give the closest shave of your life.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice heavy DE razor.  Not realizing the standard length of these, I probably would have opted for the longer handle versions but this one definitely does the job and well.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a pretty decent razor. I don&#x27;t use it as a daily shaver yet because it seems to be a little to aggressive still. I&#x27;m still going through the process of finding the right blade to match up with it to get a good shave and not it irritate my skin. My last shave with 7 o&#x27;clock yellows was probably the best so far. Silver blues were close to the 7oclocks and Derbys tore my face up. Point is, my usual experience with the blade were thrown out the window with this razor. I think it will be great when I find the correct blade for my skin.</li>
            <li> UPDATE - 06/03/2015. I also just tried a Feather blade with this razor. The first shave was great and very smooth, the second - not so much. I am thinking that the Feathers are a one-shave blade. But if you are afraid that this razor + Feather &#x3D; suicide - relax, you&#x27;ll be fine :)  I decided to give 4 stars, because it is more expensive and I don&#x27;t see why - the machines don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s slanted or straight. The configuration gets 5 stars, but the overall value - 4.  I started getting into straight edge shaving a couple of years ago, but because it takes a bit of time and care still fell back on cartridge razors when I was in a hurry or traveling. Then I switched to DE and never went back. My first razor was a Van Der Hagen from Target. It&#x27;s just fine and if you can get it cheap it&#x27;s great. It was the perfect compromise between convenience, portability and quality - much better shave than cartridge and much easier/faster than straight edge.  Then I needed something for thicker beard. I usually shave on Mondays and Saturdays, and recently had an even longer beard, so I tried the SLANT.  Wow! It mowed right through on the first pass. I only did additional passes afterwards to make it feel smooth to touch in all directions.  I don&#x27;t know if I have a great technique, but it felt almost no different than a regular DE. Mind you, I read the scare stories and was being careful, but about as careful as I am with a regular DE anyway. They do take a touch more attention than cartridge, but that&#x27;s about it.  FWIW I used Proraso pre shave cream, then Proraso shaving soap with Astra SP blades, finished with alum and then aftershave lotion. NO irritation, no bumps, no razor burn, no nicks, no cuts - best shave I ever got! (I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve perfected the straight edge).  You may be a &amp;#34;newbie&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; with double edge, but you are not a child. This may be the last razor you need. But I know it won&#x27;t stop you from having several, guys like to have a&amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; (or a fleet, as the case may be).  (Occasionally I read comments where guys have cut themselves a lot and blaming either the razor or the blade or the soap. Yes, it may be a razor/blade combination, though I have yet to experience problems with that, but it can also be trying to use a blade beyond its useful life or not using the right angle. I did notice that my very first blade started getting a tad harsh after a few nice shaves - I just have to adjust to the idea of replacing them more often. They certainly are cheap enough.)</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a comfortable shave since I was a teenager. I switched to shaving with a DE blade a few months ago, and it was way better, but still not totally comfortable. Finally, I tried the slant bar, and I finally know what it is to enjoy shaving. I am so happy.</li>
            <li> Best razor I ever used  gets a really close shave baby face smooth but you can&#x27;t  put no pressure on the razor or it will cut you</li>
            <li> My razor is at most from the 1930s. Silver case with two razor box holders. Blue velvet lined box. Shaves great. A smooth 2 pass not as aggressive as some say. I use feather blades, derby and polisilver.&lt;br /&gt;. Great shave. Proraso red proraso preshave. Nivea balm and away I go.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RIAD0W Proraso Pre and Post Shave Cream - 3.6 oz]][[ASIN:B008G18ML4 Proraso Shaving Cream - Double Pack - Plus Free 1.29 Oz Marvis Toothpaste]]</li>
            <li> My husband could NOT line up the blades when tightening the blade. It always would stick the blade out in weird angles. He tried it, BAD idea.  USE GEL shaving cream to shave.</li>
            <li> First, I have been using DE razors for about 2 weeks as of today. I have been using an inexpensive Feather Butterfly with Feather blades and TOBS Eaton College cream and a badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the Merkur 37c. I feel the finish could be a bit better. The knurl on the handle is less like that of the 3/8 ratchet in your tool box and more like that if a surgical instrument. I like the weight of this razor, but the balance could be a bit better and I think I would enjoy the longer handle of the 39c.&lt;br /&gt;Now, the shave. Awesome! Even with the Merkur blade it came with.(felt a little tug here and there) Now, I was able to get a closer shave with 3 passed with this than I do with 4 passes of my Feather razor. This glides so smooth and I love the open comb. I have heard a lot about how &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; this razor is. I don&#x27;t agree, it&#x27;s just efficient. Nothing to worry about here if you have a basic grasp on the fundamentals of blade angle and pressure. All and all I would say this is a great razor and well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The Merkur 37c was the second razor I bought after my first one broke. I will admit, I didnt exactly know what I was doing when I bought a &amp;#34;slant&amp;#34; though after using it for a few months I am in love. Because of its design, the razor blade is twisted a bit and as a result cuts through the hair like a knife through butter. A bit aggressive, though certainly not my most aggressive razor. This is my go-to razor when I have not shaved in a few days and have some stubble that I want to chop down. Many say they use this as their daily shaver, and I have for a few weeks, but this baby really shines on multiple day beard growth.</li>
            <li> Great razor. If you already are using a safety razor with double edge blades then the slant razor shouldn&#x27;t be a problem when it comes to getting nicked .Take it slow the first few shaves. I was looking forward to trying a slant razor for their reported  close shaves with fewer passes and I was not disappointed. I have a heavy beard and after a four days growth using a Derby blade in the razor I got a very close comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt; The handle is short, but I tend to choke up on the handle in order to get the most control of the razor. If you have a large hand you might want to consider the longer handle. The Merkur  HD Slant Razor 37c is a great addition to my other safety razors and I will use it often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blown away by how fantastic the slant aspect is.  I have the Edwin Jagger razor and dropped it, breaking the head off.  I did a ton or research and landed on the 37C being my next choice.  This thing is incredible.  The finish is nowhere near as polished as the EJ, but every other aspect is better.  The feel on my face (I&#x27;m using Astra blades) is incredible, very smooth and quick across the beard.  The sound feedback is great and I can really tell when I&#x27;m down to just skin.  Nice weight in the hand and the ribbing on handle makes it easy to hold, even if some shaving cream runs down it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just about to buy your first safety razor, buy this and you&#x27;ll be happy.  If you&#x27;re new to the sport, get a sample pack of blades to see what your face will take.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s late for about about 1 week and has reached finally.</li>
            <li> I shave Friday morning, relax over the weekend, and wake up with three days of stubble on Monday morning -- this is what I grab. The slanted head creates a &amp;#34;guillotine effect&amp;#34; which slices through the hairs; you won&#x27;t feel a thing, even with significant growth. If you have been using symmetrical DEs, this is an adjustment, but an easy one. It will take some time to get used to the angles and blade exposure, but you will pick it up after a shave or two. Just hold it and angle it like your symmetrical DEs and shave normally. It is not as aggressive as advertised -- just more efficient.  The second DE razor I have bought and my first slant razor.</li>
            <li> I have been a DE convert for a few years now, and was previously using the long handled razor. In comparison, the 37C is better for me. I found the heavier weight in the head, angle of the blade and overall experience to be more pleasant. I made the switch from traditional because I had course, fast growing hair and was prone to ingrow hairs. The 37C is cuts through my thickest hair with less pressure and fewer strokes.</li>
            <li> Perfect. First shave got closer than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before. Even my wife commented and she normally couldn&#x27;t care less!</li>
            <li> I will have to sell this razor because it is too aggressive for my skin.  I also get nicks every time I use it.  I do think it might give a smoother shave, quicker, than my Merkur HD razor, but I rarely cut myself with the Merkur HD.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor. Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was given a slant edged (Hoffritz) razor by my parents in the late 1970&#x27;s and loved it. Over the years, it corroded and I lost it in moves. Seeking to re-connect with that smooth shave, and again enjoy non-plastic shaving, I sought out this model. It was everything that I wanted, and the shave is incomparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor isn&#x27;t for everyone however. Don&#x27;t buy this if you want fast shaving--this requires a process, and time must be devoted to doing this properly. Done improperly (as I was recently reminded when I did shower-shaving) will result in some skin-scraping or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important to remember is to let this razor glide over your properly-soaped face. Don&#x27;t press or pull, lightly glide. Then run your hand over your face, In the areas where you feel uneven stubble, address that with the razor on the next pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your experience should be a good one. Finish with a real after-shave (not cologne) and if you are ready for a bracing experience grab a bottle of Bay Rum and splash on!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re a man after all--take it!!!!!!!!!!!!! And enjoy.</li>
            <li> Merkur makes a beautiful razor, no doubt about it.  But in mine and literally hundreds of cases, the chrome begins to flake off very quickly and the metal corrodes.  Merkur will not stand behind the product.  When contacted, Merkur responded by blaming my water:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you very much for your email and the link to the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The corrosion your razors show is part of the normal wear and tear that occurs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;especially in areas with poor water quality and/or a high concentration of chemicals in the tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry for not being able to give you more favorable news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards....\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not expensive razors but their reputation for quality is undeserved and they don&#x27;t give a crap.</li>
            <li> Very aggressive but with a smooth hand comes a smooth shave. Not for everyday use. Overall excellent product, came on time.</li>
