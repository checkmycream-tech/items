            <li>and it worked wayyyyyyy better!</li>
            <li>We have found that this soap is amazing when it comes to taming oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I would surely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li>It worked very quickly and was effective without pain.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not terrible at all (as if cystic), but looks like pin point rashes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>hopefully it keeps working the same, it is awesome!!</li>
            <li>more quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many acne products and my skin is stil suffering.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so cheap too!</li>
            <li>It clears acne up very quickly.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a soap that would keep my face free of oil for a substantial amount of time.</li>
            <li>It provides effective yet gentle cleansing for skin and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But be aware, don&#x27;t use it more than 2-3 a week -</li>
            <li>I was using the Original bar along with Retin-A Mircro .04%</li>
            <li>This product not only works wonderful on my face, it also works on the back.</li>
            <li>gentle cleansing- Hypo-allergenic formula won&#x27;t over-dry while it gently and effectively cleanses away excess oil from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not one for writting reviews but this soap is worth it.</li>
            <li>Thank you Neutrogena for a product well worth its price.</li>
            <li>I switched to the Acne bar and this cleared my acne right up.</li>
            <li>I cannot say it really worked since I did not get much use out of it, but after using it in the shower my skin felt extremely clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>all in all my skin seems a little more red with continued use of this, but also fairly clearer.</li>
            <li>and this is the first product that works to control my breakouts.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and free of grease.</li>
            <li>Rinses completely, leaving skin free of residue which can interfere with the effectiveness of acne medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but right now with my very picky skin, ive used up almost the whole bar</li>
            <li>it minimizes my pores immediately after use, but since it does not leave skin moist (but not nearly as drying as most washes or bars ive used) it seems to contribute to oil production.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, so maybe that is my problem.</li>
            <li>can be VERY drying.</li>
            <li>and this helps my pores so much.</li>
            <li>It has done very well and seems to help control the breakouts on my face..</li>
            <li>It cuts through grime and residual sunscreen really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this acne bar cleanser bc</li>
            <li>and I had a brand new large pimple that grew fast.</li>
            <li>my face in overall is more red than it used to be, a sign of allergy to one of its ingredients.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try it</li>
            <li>this bar does not break me out, nor does it seem to magically clear up acne.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of acne on one side of my face and hoped this would clear it up</li>
            <li>, maybe 7 uses out of this before it melted completely.</li>
            <li>This product has consistently helped me to control my acne for a long time now.</li>
            <li>Im 17 years old</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve also listed ingredient in case you have any known allergies as well as 800 number for questions to can directly ask Neutrogena):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Break</li>
            <li>It has slowed down my break outs tremendously.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this facial bar soap!</li>
            <li>I first tried the regular formula which dried out my skin at first.</li>
            <li>the smell is only strong the first few uses, and its not very offensive and does not linger very long at all.</li>
            <li>I saw my face after years of acne and was like WOW  why buy proactiv for $ 20-30 bucks if I could buy this for only $5.</li>
            <li>I have been using the soap since the first week of November and so far it has definitely slowed down my break outs</li>
            <li>I have tried other salicylic-acid based bars and face washes before, but none of them have had as consistent results as this facial bar.</li>
            <li>its a basic bar that sometimes feels &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; (no other way to describe it) when i leave it on for too long so maybe not for those with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very basic bar soap and lasts for quiet some time if you don&#x27;t put it directly into the water.</li>

            <li> I live in Southern California where the sun can be harsh.</li>
            <li> But when I bought this, my face started to magically clear up and become less red!</li>
            <li> Also, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing your face immediately after/during a shower because it can burn pretty badly if your pore are super open.</li>
            <li> and i have very oily skin, but within less than a week of using this bar my face already feels healthier n less oily.</li>
            <li> Then I swichted to the dry skin formula.</li>
            <li> One thing though:  If you have dry skin, you might want to apply a non-comedogenic cream just to keep you skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To put his in perspective, the  acne is usually found in teenagers but believe it or not, it also works on old guys 89.</li>
            <li> It is not as serious as it was anymore when I was in high school</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so we&#x27;ll see how well it takes care of the acne soon</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> , hopefully it doesn&#x27;t change, it was hard enough finding this products.  </li>
            <li> It works very well especially on my back acne, it usually relieves those painful bumps in 1-2 washes for me personally.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my face acne unfortunately, so I decided to try Neutrogena Gentle Cleaner</li>
            <li> I am a black women in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> that might be the culprit as my skin is never friendly with tocopherol throughout history.  </li>
            <li> but instead, I&#x27;ve used it everyday for over a week</li>
            <li> I have no more acne and my black heads are vanishing.</li>
            <li> Not forever, but at least half a day.</li>
            <li> I usually just have \\&quot;backne\\&quot; and got this to maybe help with my problem.</li>
            <li> I recently stopped purchasing Proactive, too expensive.</li>
            <li> its hard to know what i think of this bar</li>
            <li> I still break out on my chin during that time of the month but it not that bad and so far no break outs on my cheeks at all.</li>
            <li> I use to break out on my chin and/or cheeks at least once a week.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an awful soap, but if you don&#x27;t rinse your face well enough it&#x27;ll dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 2 stars because even though I hate it, I understand from other reviews that it may benefit others and just may not be for my skin.</li>
            <li> I even have really bad dermatitis that nothing but steroid ointment will do anything to</li>
            <li> I started to get \\&quot;bacne\\&quot; in my 20s, very annoying.</li>
            <li> and I was still experiencing awful hormonal acne.</li>

            <li> I usually just have \\&quot;backne\\&quot; and got this to maybe help with my problem. It is not as serious as it was anymore when I was in high school but I really only got 6, maybe 7 uses out of this before it melted completely. I cannot say it really worked since I did not get much use out of it, but after using it in the shower my skin felt extremely clean and fresh. I usually just put the wet soap back in the box which may have been why it melted so quick.</li>
            <li> this bar does not break me out, nor does it seem to magically clear up acne. its a basic bar that sometimes feels &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; (no other way to describe it) when i leave it on for too long so maybe not for those with very sensitive skin. it minimizes my pores immediately after use, but since it does not leave skin moist (but not nearly as drying as most washes or bars ive used) it seems to contribute to oil production. all in all my skin seems a little more red with continued use of this, but also fairly clearer. its hard to know what i think of this bar but right now with my very picky skin, ive used up almost the whole bar and i would repurchase. the smell is only strong the first few uses, and its not very offensive and does not linger very long at all. i&#x27;ll eventually update this.</li>
            <li> I am not one for writting reviews but this soap is worth it. I am a black women in my 30&#x27;s and this is the first product that works to control my breakouts. I have been using the soap twice a day and once to exfoliate. It has slowed down my break outs tremendously. I use to break out on my chin and/or cheeks at least once a week. I still break out on my chin during that time of the month but it not that bad and so far no break outs on my cheeks at all. I may have gotten two pimples since I started using this soap and that was on my chin. I have been using the soap since the first week of November and so far it has definitely slowed down my break outs, hopefully it doesn&#x27;t change, it was hard enough finding this products.  I would surely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. I have a lot of acne on one side of my face and hoped this would clear it up but instead, I&#x27;ve used it everyday for over a week and I got acne all over my face!</li>
            <li> This is a very good soap in cleansing my face. Sometimes before I use the soap I would wipe my face with rubbing alcohol to get rid extra dirt. I have oily skin so I can get away with using rubbing alchol and the soap together. For me the soap is excellent, it lathers well, cleanses my face and it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This product has consistently helped me to control my acne for a long time now. I have tried other salicylic-acid based bars and face washes before, but none of them have had as consistent results as this facial bar. It leaves my skin feeling soft and free of grease. Thank you Neutrogena for a product well worth its price.</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California where the sun can be harsh. Sweat and oil &#x3D; breakouts. This product not only works wonderful on my face, it also works on the back. I started to get \\&quot;bacne\\&quot; in my 20s, very annoying. But I tried this because I got a sample in the mail. I dug it out of my cluttered closet one day and used it.  Within a week, my back was substantially clears. But be aware, don&#x27;t use it more than 2-3 a week - can be VERY drying. And get a soap tray or it&#x27;ll just melt. It&#x27;s the only product out there that has worked for me. I first tried the regular formula which dried out my skin at first. Then I swichted to the dry skin formula. Worked for about two months and I think my skin got use to it so now I&#x27;m back to the regular. I suggest switching back and forth once you feel like it&#x27;s not working. Great price too!!</li>
            <li> after using this soap for 1 week, I had breakouts in my face. they&#x27;re not terrible at all (as if cystic), but looks like pin point rashes. my face in overall is more red than it used to be, a sign of allergy to one of its ingredients. upon reading its back cover, i found vitamin e in its list. that might be the culprit as my skin is never friendly with tocopherol throughout history.  now im back to using my sulfur soap.</li>
            <li> I was using the Original bar along with Retin-A Mircro .04% and I was still experiencing awful hormonal acne. It never cleared up. I switched to the Acne bar and this cleared my acne right up. It clears acne up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It worked very quickly and was effective without pain.I recommend it to everyone that needs help with Acne or bumps.</li>
            <li> I was recommend this Neutrogena facial Bar soap from my dermatologist ten years ago and have been using it ever since! I seriously love this stuff!! It&#x27;s a very basic bar soap and lasts for quiet some time if you don&#x27;t put it directly into the water. A little goes a long ways and I&#x27;ve never had a problem taking off my eye makeup (eyeshadow/mascara/liner/etc).     I highly, highly recommend this facial bar soap!</li>
            <li> It works very well especially on my back acne, it usually relieves those painful bumps in 1-2 washes for me personally.</li>
            <li> Always a good product</li>
            <li> I love this product. I recently stopped purchasing Proactive, too expensive. The cost adds up over the months. I can get this for $3-$5, plus a $1 travel soap dish so it doesn&#x27;t melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works wonders for my acne. I even have really bad dermatitis that nothing but steroid ointment will do anything to and this helps my pores so much. I use this bar as a cleanser, plus Neutrogena 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream on the troublesome spots that were already there and my pores on my nose. I have no more acne and my black heads are vanishing.</li>
            <li> I had to find a facial soap that would work with my problem  I have been using creams and ointments that are used to treat a medical rash and psoriasis.  The ointment and cream caused acne type ulcerations on my face. .  I found this soap was good for acne and decided to give it a try.  It has done very well and seems to help control the breakouts on my face..To put his in perspective, the  acne is usually found in teenagers but believe it or not, it also works on old guys 89.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an awful soap, but if you don&#x27;t rinse your face well enough it&#x27;ll dry your skin out. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing your face immediately after/during a shower because it can burn pretty badly if your pore are super open. I have super sensitive skin, so maybe that is my problem. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so we&#x27;ll see how well it takes care of the acne soon</li>
            <li> I bought and used this as a test. I have oily skin which causes the acne so I was looking for a soap that would keep my face free of oil for a substantial amount of time. Not forever, but at least half a day. This soap did not even last an hour. And I&#x27;ve recently stopped having breakouts, but two uses of this product and I had a brand new large pimple that grew fast. I gave this product 2 stars because even though I hate it, I understand from other reviews that it may benefit others and just may not be for my skin.</li>
            <li> Im 17 years old so im still in the age where acne is a problem and i have very oily skin, but within less than a week of using this bar my face already feels healthier n less oily. i tried different products but none worked like this one! hopefully it keeps working the same, it is awesome!!</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s happened.  My baby girl is growing up.  We have found that this soap is amazing when it comes to taming oily skin.  It als.o helps with getting rid of pimples more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually started using it after I come in from gardening.  It cuts through grime and residual sunscreen really well.  One thing though:  If you have dry skin, you might want to apply a non-comedogenic cream just to keep you skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what it says on the back of the box (I&#x27;ve also listed ingredient in case you have any known allergies as well as 800 number for questions to can directly ask Neutrogena):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Break the Breakout Cycle&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Cleansing Bar, Acne-Prone Skin Formula is recommended by dermatologists.  It provides effective yet gentle cleansing for skin and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pure, gentle cleansing- Hypo-allergenic formula won&#x27;t over-dry while it gently and effectively cleanses away excess oil from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Superior rinsability- Rinses completely, leaving skin free of residue which can interfere with the effectiveness of acne medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Won&#x27;t clog pores- Clinically tested to be non-comedogenic, so it won&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine, TEA Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Glycerin, TEA-Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Cocoate, Water, Sodium Ricinoleate, Sodium Oleate, Cetyl Acetate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Stearate, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, Trisodium HEDTA, Fragrance (1347-018)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, you can call Neutrogena at 1-800-582-4048 (USA only).</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve tried so many acne products and my skin is stil suffering. But when I bought this, my face started to magically clear up and become less red! It&#x27;s not drying to my face since I have oily skin but I do put on a moisturizer after. I highly recommend you try it and it&#x27;s so cheap too!</li>
            <li> I really like this acne bar cleanser bc it actually works clearing up my face from years of acne..... I would recommend this to any one but then again no one has the same type of skin... I still would try it any way.... I saw my face after years of acne and was like WOW  why buy proactiv for $ 20-30 bucks if I could buy this for only $5.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my face acne unfortunately, so I decided to try Neutrogena Gentle Cleaner and it worked wayyyyyyy better!</li>
