            <li>Fabulous mascara!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this mascara for a while now and love it more every day.</li>
            <li>I use an eyelash curler after I apply and it curls and keeps the curl better than any mascara I have ever used</li>
            <li>I love the mascara.</li>
            <li>those light eyelashes pop!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara of all time.  </li>
            <li>Love what it does for my eye lashes.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>My lashes look longer and more defined.</li>
            <li>Mascara is important to me!</li>
            <li>I am a fan of perfekt - I love the products they have; but the mascara is a disaster....</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s so good for your lashes really shows!</li>
            <li>Your eyes will love it and it will make them very pretty !</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this formula so far.</li>
            <li>I noticed my eyes were becoming irritated by the mascara I was using.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>It also  removes really easy too.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>I got this mascara as a sample in my Birchbox and loved it so much I bought the full sized one for my wedding.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really comfortable, and everything I hoped for.</li>
            <li>It only takes seconds to apply because the great results are immediate.</li>
            <li>In always getting compliments on how long and great my lashes look.</li>
            <li>The full sized one is nothing at all like the sample though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also one of the only mascaras that applies and looks good on the bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave my lashes stiff and and keeps my lashes healthy while making them look good.</li>
            <li>The sample was nearly $13.00 and the full size is as pricey as Chanel or Dior but not only does it NOT irritate my eyes, it goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li>Worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make lashes crunchy or stiff, it has great staying power, and it seems to condition lashes.  </li>
            <li>think the brush and tube should be redesigned, as there is too much mascara on the brush and the tube doesn&#x27;t clean the brush off when you pull the brush</li>
            <li>We all know how hard it is to find a GOOD mascara, right?!  </li>
            <li>On the rare occasion that I have to use one of my other brands, I am quickly reminded of how much better the Perfekt one is.</li>
            <li>Packaging was kinda big from Amazon but love this product.</li>
            <li>I first tried it from birch box as a sample.</li>
            <li>Smudges in hot humid weather.</li>
            <li>This lash gel goes on evenly, doesn&#x27;t clump and stays on even during our hot humid Florida summers.  </li>
            <li>I tried many brands between higher end brands and drugstore and everything made my eyes irritated, red and itchy.  </li>
            <li>To me the cost is worth the value, especially since I was so close to looking into eye lash extensions which for a full set are around $250!</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high, but I think it is well worth</li>
            <li>Had to keep putting more coats and took a long time to make my lashes stand out.</li>
            <li>buy it again over Clinique or Almay, as long as I can afford to :)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do all that much to thicken and lengthen my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>will keep using it until it thickens too much, but I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, stays on all day and makes long luxuriant lashes in a couple of coats.</li>
            <li>This particular tube was clumpy and had to throw away after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have been very busy</li>
            <li>any other middle-high end mascara does that you can buy for $15-$18 instead of about $25-$28, nothing special in regards to being lightweight, curling or not lumping.  </li>
            <li>I prefer natural mascara s.  </li>
            <li>I was told that this is a &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; mascara, which will promote natural curling and that lumping isn&#x27;t an issue.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was old.</li>
            <li>I figured the culprit was a common ingredient used in most if not all mascaras.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if this product was old or expired.</li>
            <li>It makes your lashes look naturally long and dark and lovely.  </li>
            <li>It coats quickly with little effort (or product).</li>
            <li>Also, it dried out quickly.  </li>
            <li>No other comes close.</li>
            <li>It worked fantastic and was not clumpy or hard to put on.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>In the last year I have received about 6 different kinds of high end mascara from Birchbox and nothing comes close to this product.</li>
            <li>They look much longer and fuller than with any other type of mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li>I hate most mascaras available at the store, and got a sample of this in a monthly box set.</li>

            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a bit expensive, it&#x27;s very worth it!</li>
            <li> I have eyes that will attract any foreign objects and debris within a mile radius, and this gel stands up to rubbing (with tissue, of course, never touch your eyes with bare fingers!).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> When I saw that other comment about being a &amp;#34;mascara flirt&amp;#34; I recognized myself, my make-up drawer is full of all the other mascaras I have tried and not liked.</li>
            <li> so I expected the same type of product.  </li>
            <li> The gel made my eyelashes so long that when I blinked, my eyelashes rubbed on my glasses.</li>
            <li> Non clumping, no chipping, and the color is a deep black.  </li>
            <li> your eyelid gets black, it does not last even an afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> however, it seems to be getting thicker and harder to apply without having clumps.</li>
            <li> I did receive this in my birchbox  and it delivers dark, lengthy lashes with no clumps.</li>
            <li> Black buildable color.</li>
            <li> I can literally brush the mascara across my arm and not see any black.  </li>
            <li> I seem to be developing random allergies as I get older.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t break down and give me raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> The mascara is dried up.  </li>
            <li> Very little clumping, doesn&#x27;t end up ripping my eye lashes out when washed off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so ticked that I paid 3 times as much as I normally would for a mascara that looks so bad.</li>
            <li> it is very dry, very difficult to apply, it sticks to your eyelashed and forms little clogs, when you close your eyes -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced this multiple times, and have never EVER been disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumpy and worse than the cheapest drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive</li>
            <li> It is too expensive to have to repurchase that often.</li>
            <li> Obsessed!</li>
            <li> It got so bad</li>
            <li> product though was crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Packaging was kinda big from Amazon but love this product. I first tried it from birch box as a sample. This mascara is perfect. Doesn&#x27;t flake like the cheaper mascaras.</li>
            <li> I have to start with I am not a girly girl. I&#x27;m not a big makeup fan, and have no idea how to create a smokey eye. I hate most mascaras available at the store, and got a sample of this in a monthly box set. It&#x27;s great!! I love it!! Very little clumping, doesn&#x27;t end up ripping my eye lashes out when washed off. I&#x27;ve replaced this multiple times, and have never EVER been disappointed. A friend liked the look, and is now hooked on it too. It is NOT waterproof, so if you&#x27;re going to something you KNOW will bring tears, this is not the product for that day. But it&#x27;s my go to product 99.5% of the time, and I&#x27;m about to set it up on subscription.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash ever! Even better than Maybelline. The brush is perfect! One stroke is all one needs. Stays all day.</li>
            <li> Obsessed! In always getting compliments on how long and great my lashes look. This product is awesome to layer.</li>
            <li> Smudges in hot humid weather. Otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy.  Does not seem to irritate my eyes, or harm lashes at night.  I prefer natural mascara s.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do all that much to thicken and lengthen my lashes.  Had to keep putting more coats and took a long time to make my lashes stand out.</li>
            <li> Try this product! Your eyes will love it and it will make them very pretty ! Best mascara ever. Lash look fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> Fabulous mascara!  Best I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for a while now and love it more every day. The ingredients are great and the mascara is wonderful.</li>
            <li> They will have to come up with something great to beat this mascara.  Non clumping, no chipping, and the color is a deep black.  I use an eyelash curler after I apply and it curls and keeps the curl better than any mascara I have ever used and I am 63!</li>
            <li> This lash gel goes on evenly, doesn&#x27;t clump and stays on even during our hot humid Florida summers.  I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t break down and give me raccoon eyes! A wonderful product over all!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the mascara. I had to buy on line because Sephora no longer carries it. Great stuff , No flaking..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really comfortable, and everything I hoped for. Worth the price tag. I have eyes that will attract any foreign objects and debris within a mile radius, and this gel stands up to rubbing (with tissue, of course, never touch your eyes with bare fingers!).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again over Clinique or Almay, as long as I can afford to :)</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara when I purchased this in a retail makeup botique store.  This particular tube was clumpy and had to throw away after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Does not leave my lashes stiff and and keeps my lashes healthy while making them look good.</li>
            <li> The mascara weeps after just a short time frame. It isn&#x27;t as comprehensive coverage as was anticipated.</li>
            <li> We all know how hard it is to find a GOOD mascara, right?!  This is a really nice mascara that doesn&#x27;t go on clumpy and makes those light eyelashes pop!</li>
            <li> I got this mascara as a sample in my Birchbox and loved it so much I bought the full sized one for my wedding. The full sized one is nothing at all like the sample though. The sample mascara was the smoothest, silkiest mascara I&#x27;d ever used. It separated all my lashes and made them gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product though was crap. It&#x27;s clumpy and worse than the cheapest drugstore mascara. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re not even the same product. I can&#x27;t put it on without getting clumps in my lashes. I&#x27;m so ticked that I paid 3 times as much as I normally would for a mascara that looks so bad. Total waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time.  It makes your lashes look naturally long and dark and lovely.  It&#x27;s so great I will actually skip eyeliner.  It&#x27;s also one of the only mascaras that applies and looks good on the bottom lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t make lashes crunchy or stiff, it has great staying power, and it seems to condition lashes.  I love it, and I would highly recommend it!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my eye lashes. It also  removes really easy too. Goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I was told that this is a &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; mascara, which will promote natural curling and that lumping isn&#x27;t an issue.  However, it performed just like any other middle-high end mascara does that you can buy for $15-$18 instead of about $25-$28, nothing special in regards to being lightweight, curling or not lumping.  Also, it dried out quickly.  It underperformed for the price.  I&#x27;ll go back to MAC or Smashbox from now on.</li>
            <li> The results are truly impressive. Goes on easily, stays on all day and makes long luxuriant lashes in a couple of coats. This mascara actually makes a noticeable difference. I will buy it again and soon, because I don&#x27;t ever want to run out.  When I saw that other comment about being a &amp;#34;mascara flirt&amp;#34; I recognized myself, my make-up drawer is full of all the other mascaras I have tried and not liked. Now I just want this one. Yes, it is expensive but I love it.</li>
            <li> I revieved this in a Birchbox as a trial and I could not get enough of it. The fact that it&#x27;s so good for your lashes really shows! It seems like mascara but it&#x27;s not! My lashes look longer and more defined. Even though it&#x27;s a bit expensive, it&#x27;s very worth it!</li>
            <li> I did receive this in my birchbox  and it delivers dark, lengthy lashes with no clumps. I am a mascara flirt but I am definitely sticking with one. No other comes close. It only takes seconds to apply because the great results are immediate. I am getting the larger size soon. I can&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> I really liked this gel mascara when I got it. It worked fantastic and was not clumpy or hard to put on.&lt;br /&gt;Now however, it seems to be getting thicker and harder to apply without having clumps. There is still a lot of mascara in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it daily for about 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I think the brush and tube should be redesigned, as there is too much mascara on the brush and the tube doesn&#x27;t clean the brush off when you pull the brush out.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it until it thickens too much, but I will not be buying it again. It is too expensive to have to repurchase that often.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have found and makes a noticeable difference to my lashes. They look much longer and fuller than with any other type of mascara I have tried. On the rare occasion that I have to use one of my other brands, I am quickly reminded of how much better the Perfekt one is. The price is a bit high, but I think it is well worth it given the results.</li>
            <li> Finally no crispy lashes.  Easy to remove.  Black buildable color.</li>
            <li> The mascara is dried up.  I tried this mascara through Birch Box so I expected the same type of product.  So I really liked it.  I have been very busy and I didn&#x27;t have time to send it back.  I can literally brush the mascara across my arm and not see any black.  Maybe it was old. None.</li>
            <li> I also received this as a Birchbox sample. In the last year I have received about 6 different kinds of high end mascara from Birchbox and nothing comes close to this product. It coats quickly with little effort (or product). The gel made my eyelashes so long that when I blinked, my eyelashes rubbed on my glasses. Definitely will have this is a staple.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this formula so far. I seem to be developing random allergies as I get older. Allergies to gluten in my twenties and at the end of last year I noticed my eyes were becoming irritated by the mascara I was using. It got so bad I stopped wearing mascara. Mascara is important to me! It is the one thing I would never go without. I even wear it camping! I tried many brands between higher end brands and drugstore and everything made my eyes irritated, red and itchy.  I figured the culprit was a common ingredient used in most if not all mascaras. I researched some brands and just as I was leaving a beauty store one of the sales associates ran up to give me a sample of this. The sample was nearly $13.00 and the full size is as pricey as Chanel or Dior but not only does it NOT irritate my eyes, it goes on beautifully. To me the cost is worth the value, especially since I was so close to looking into eye lash extensions which for a full set are around $250!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of perfekt - I love the products they have; but the mascara is a disaster.... it is very dry, very difficult to apply, it sticks to your eyelashed and forms little clogs, when you close your eyes - your eyelid gets black, it does not last even an afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this product was old or expired. It came unsealed. Do not recommend</li>
