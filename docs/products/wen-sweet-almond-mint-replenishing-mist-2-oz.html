            <li> I liked this. I used it to detangle my wavy hair. It was a nice change from my usual brands but very not economical for long hair.  Will try again once I cut my hair for donation</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It is just like a bottle of watered down WEN. You could make your own much cheaper.</li>

            <li> Wen products are by far the best hair care products, I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It would be absolutely the only hair care products I would ever use.&lt;br /&gt;If only I could afford it.
