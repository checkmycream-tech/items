            <li>I don&#x27;t use all their products, but have been very happy with cucumber eye gel (more of a cream) and their chamomile cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I still feel it may not be perfect at removing all of my makeup, so I have tried it in the morning and gone for a deeper clean at night.  </li>
            <li>The calming line is one of those exceptional things.  </li>

            <li>It feel nice on the skin, but is more like a moisturizer than a cleanser.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for sensitive skin/rosacea.</li>

            <li>shipping without the pump in the bottle would work better.</li>

            <li>Within a week my skin was clear, the redness was gone, and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy/milky and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the face very well.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that works as promised.</li>
            <li>i would definitely buy more of this brand from this vendor.</li>

            <li>I have never been able to find cleanser that does not irritate or dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>After months of continuous redness and pimples on my nose, which I never had even in high school or during pregnancy, I was fortunate to have a facial by a provider who used and recommended Eminence Calm Skin.  </li>
            <li>for the price and delivery is fast.</li>

            <li> this leaves my skin clean and soft.  buy at&lt;br /&gt;amazon for the price and delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> Packaging leaves something to be desired.  When I received the bottle it had the cleanser all over the outside from the bottle leaking in transit.  It just takes a tiny bit to use and the  pump actually sends out too much.  The product works great and I like it,&lt;br /&gt;Maybe shipping without the pump in the bottle would work better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item assuming it would smell similar to the toner, but it smells nothing like it. It&#x27;s very creamy/milky and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the face very well. It feel nice on the skin, but is more like a moisturizer than a cleanser. I LOVE eminence products, but this is definitely NOT one of their best!</li>
            <li> Nice product, enjoyed it very much</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but this is the only one to help with my redness. My skin is softer and clearer.</li>
            <li> After months of continuous redness and pimples on my nose, which I never had even in high school or during pregnancy, I was fortunate to have a facial by a provider who used and recommended Eminence Calm Skin.  Within a week my skin was clear, the redness was gone, and it&#x27;s been fine ever since.  When I stopped using it for a couple of days, thinking the problem was solved, it started again.  But a return to the use of Eminence Calm Skin cleared it right up again.  Even my husband noticed!  For my very sensitive skin, this is a keeper!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> A great cleanser for sensitive, dry skin.  Smells nice and the pump bottle is convenient!  I use this during warmer months and when I breakout and there is no problem.  I&#x27;m sticking with this one!</li>
            <li> I love love love Eminence..if I could I would sell it</li>
            <li> I have used this and other eminence products for several years now after a visit it a Nashville spa. Great product. Like a face wash and moisturiser all in one. Plus loves my sensitive skin!!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly. This product is excellent for sensitive skin/rosacea. Calming and rich but not drying. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Perfect cleanser. Non-irritating.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my sensitive, easily inflamed skin! It&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> I was a stanch Philosophy user until the spa I go to turned me on to Eminence.  What a FANTASTIC product!!  This cleanser actually feels silky smooth and hydrates your skin as it cleans.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle on my skin. I have sensitive skin and most other  products cause acne breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year. My skin feels smoother and looks great. There has been some reduction in redness, but nothing super dramatic. The product smells great and it is soothing during use.</li>
            <li> love this product. arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find cleanser that does not irritate or dry my skin out. This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that works as promised. There is a noticeable difference since I&#x27;ve started using it, no red or irritated skin. Great product!!</li>
            <li> This is great! 1 pump is sufficient! Non-drying or irritating!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Eminence.  I found them in a spa in Colorado and started using their products.  I have switched around quite a bit with face care products, trying to find the most natural.  I don&#x27;t use all their products, but have been very happy with cucumber eye gel (more of a cream) and their chamomile cleanser.  I also like that their products appear to be all natural.</li>
            <li> A great light weight cleanser</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It&#x27;s so gentle.  My skin tone is more even and smooth.  The bottle size is also generous</li>
            <li> Product came in good time but personally this is not my favorite cleanser by eminence..</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended  this product. It is very concentrated so  last a long time. Great to calm rosacea.</li>
            <li> i love the product and it arrived as expected. i would definitely buy more of this brand from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have very sensitive skin. I have to be very careful what I put on my skin. I love this cleanser. It cleanes my skin without drying it out or causing irritation. Very soothing. I also love that it is made with natural ingredients. I usually like to try new things but this is something that I don&#x27;t change. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin at all.  I don&#x27;t have nearly as many break outs as before.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The cleanser has the feels of a moisturizer rather than a cleanser.  It has a very subtle scent.  An effective cleanser and has helped reduce the redness of rosasia.</li>
            <li> Everything I have tried from eminence has been amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the Eminence line of skin care products.  While I don&#x27;t use it exclusively, there are a few things I feel they do exceptionally well.  The calming line is one of those exceptional things.  During the winter, my skin tends to be irritable and have a few red areas.  After successfully​ trying the calming moisturizer at night, I took a chance and tried the cleanser.  I love it!  I still feel it may not be perfect at removing all of my makeup, so I have tried it in the morning and gone for a deeper clean at night.  My skin is nice and calm and ready for my serum and moisturizer.. then makeup.  I love starting the day with a happy face!!</li>
