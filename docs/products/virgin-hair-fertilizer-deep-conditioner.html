            <li>It also does not have good &#x27;slip.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>it would be a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try for those that are looking for a Great Conditioner!</li>
            <li>i love it, it,s a great product.</li>
            <li>Allow me to say this I love my Hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure if it does include growing abilities.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>It really makes your scalp feel great.</li>
            <li>I love it and believe in it.</li>
            <li>I did not see any outstanding improvement after the trtmnt.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am like most</li>
            <li>I love my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling sensation my scalp has.  </li>
            <li>My hair is healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the stimulation that it gives when you put it on your hair&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>and I think the product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love the awesome products and the package came sooner than I expected it.</li>
            <li>I can tell my hair is growing faster, and it&#x27;s easy to comb through after showering.</li>
            <li>it does make the hair feel like that cool and refreshing tingle</li>
            <li>has a great smell and within 2wks i could see a difference in my hair, hair was very easily to manage while wet.</li>
            <li>just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Im pretty sure that it will because it opens up your hair follicles and if you use a growth aid to oil your scalp after a wash then your scalp will automatically take in that product.</li>
            <li>I know that I like the smell, it has a wonderful smell of peppermint and with that as part of the ingredients how could I not love it.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that both deep conditioners contain Dimethicone which is not the greatest ingredient for hair health, however I&#x27;ve noticed that most conditioners contain that ingredient, so I guess I can work with that.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product especially for natural hair.</li>
            <li>It reads it contains penetrating proteins - The price is very reasonable!</li>
            <li>I love the tingle and it leaves your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I have my own little enhancements that I think added &#x27;fuel to the fire&#x27;, but over all love this product.</li>
            <li>Week one and so far... I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought the person that was doing my twists wasn&#x27;t doing a good job....switched stylists twice and came to terms (along with my current styler) that my hair is just growing like wild flowers.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever do a review on anything.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>basically my hair is growing fast!</li>
            <li>What I love the most is that it really breaks the hair down making it extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My niece whose just 10 years old and has always been natural (has never hasd a relaxer or chemical of any kind) in her hair and this really makes her hair awfully soft and detangles her hair and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really do a length check before</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>No, I am not paid reviewer (as I&#x27;ve seen on many other products) and I will be posting a 5-star review (copy, paste and replace-lol) on the virgin fertilizer as well</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and it makes your hair grow fast and thick.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my hair, wet a towel with super hot water and cover my head with a plastic bag and HONEY CHILD..</li>
            <li>This is my new product must have.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product for the first time</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner really makes my hair soft, shiny and managable.</li>
            <li>my hair was so silky and so flipping shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a bit too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>Going natural...</li>
            <li>well...went all natural</li>
            <li>My hair is detangled and soft.</li>
            <li>this leaves my niece really nice and soft, we have a really hard time with detangling and combing her hair when its wet.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I use this on my ten year old also.</li>
            <li>Of course I did have chop off the chemically enhanced hair, but did not have to deal with the really short hair phase of going natural....</li>
            <li>If you are an African American woman using this product and you have a lot of new growth....</li>
            <li>It helps make the new growth soft and it breaks it down.</li>

            <li> I am trying to &amp;#34;go natural&amp;#34; and so far, the Virgin Hair Fertilizer Deep Conditioner and Miss Jessie&#x27;s Sweetback Deep Conditioner are my favorites (I rotate between both products during every other hair wash).  </li>
            <li> The bottle says &amp;#34;Results in Two Weeks&amp;#34; and so far I definitely noticed a lot less hair breakage within a very short time period of using the product</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to know if its helps aid in hair growth just yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and I want to use as few chemicals as possible.</li>
            <li> I love the cold chill and tingle</li>
            <li> I went from no hair to long hair!</li>
            <li> The only reason why i gave it 4 stars is that it can be a little drying because it is protein based.</li>
            <li> I used this product, the &#x27;virgin fertilizer&#x27; in the tube (hate the tube material - love the product).</li>
            <li> (no relaxer, no keratin straightening) less than 7 months.</li>
            <li> It feels tickling when is apply and hurts a little bit but hair doesn&#x27;t grow ..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure about the hair growth yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing twists (extensions), doing co wash majority of the time, and didn&#x27;t have to do the frightening &#x27;big chop&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say that my hair has felt softer and healthier since I&#x27;ve started using this product. I love the cold chill and tingle it gives my scalp with I apply it. I&#x27;m not too sure if it does include growing abilities. I didn&#x27;t really do a length check before or after I started using this product. However I have used the Virgin Hair Fertilizer in the lube (They&#x27;re from the same company/maker) and I will say that product has growing abilities so one would assume they both do.</li>
            <li> I love this item. It really makes your scalp feel great. What I love the most is that it really breaks the hair down making it extremely soft and manageable. If you are an African American woman using this product and you have a lot of new growth.... This is for you!!! It helps make the new growth soft and it breaks it down. There is no puffiness which is a plus for me especially when you&#x27;re trying to stretch your relaxer. The only reason why i gave it 4 stars is that it can be a little drying because it is protein based. I recommend that you mix some oils with it so that you would not have the drying effect to occur. I have not used it long enough to know if its helps aid in hair growth just yet. Im pretty sure that it will because it opens up your hair follicles and if you use a growth aid to oil your scalp after a wash then your scalp will automatically take in that product. I love it and believe in it. From here on out I will add some olive oil or grapeseed oil for moisture!!! This will be a staple product for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of shedding, so I&#x27;m experimenting with diff trtmnts...ie..conditioners. I endured the smell of this conditioner for my breakage prob. I did not see any outstanding improvement after the trtmnt. It also does not have good &#x27;slip.&#x27;  I dc for 30 mins with a plastic cap. Like the balm,  I ll revisit this another time, this time using some essential oil added.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work ... It feels tickling when is apply and hurts a little bit but hair doesn&#x27;t grow ..</li>
            <li> this product claime to grow hair i used it the feeling of peppermint when you leave it in your hair after shampoo it does make the hair feel like that cool and refreshing tingle it would be a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I just received this product today, will give it a different rating once I have used it. I know that I like the smell, it has a wonderful smell of peppermint and with that as part of the ingredients how could I not love it.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle and it leaves your hair very soft. I will buy this again and recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever do a review on anything. I love this product. After a month of using this product my hair stop breaking and my hair grew about 2 inches! I used it as a deep conditioner or Co wash.</li>
            <li> Horrible! It caused my hair  to come out in bundles! I will never use again. I would suggest  you run!</li>
            <li> Week one and so far... I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m natural and I want to use as few chemicals as possible. This deep conditioner really makes my hair soft, shiny and managable. I apply it to my hair, wet a towel with super hot water and cover my head with a plastic bag and HONEY CHILD..my hair was so silky and so flipping shiny and soft.  It works for me my hair type is kinky curly.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for the first time and I think the product is pretty good. The bottle says &amp;#34;Results in Two Weeks&amp;#34; and so far I definitely noticed a lot less hair breakage within a very short time period of using the product but I&#x27;m not sure about the hair growth yet.  My guess is that if the breakage has stopped then the next step is hair growth but it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks so it&#x27;s a bit too early to tell.  I am trying to &amp;#34;go natural&amp;#34; and so far, the Virgin Hair Fertilizer Deep Conditioner and Miss Jessie&#x27;s Sweetback Deep Conditioner are my favorites (I rotate between both products during every other hair wash).  Overall, I would purchase both products again and I would recommend either of the products. The only downside is that both deep conditioners contain Dimethicone which is not the greatest ingredient for hair health, however I&#x27;ve noticed that most conditioners contain that ingredient, so I guess I can work with that.</li>
            <li> I love the awesome products and the package came sooner than I expected it. Kudos to mixed roots I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because of the ingredients and I am very happy with it. I am like most I love my hair. This Product has Tea Tree (great ingredient)!Castor Oil (proven tried ingredient)! It reads it contains penetrating proteins - The price is very reasonable! I will be using this product for years to come. Allow me to say this I love my Hair! It is worth a try for those that are looking for a Great Conditioner!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says. This is my second time ordering.  This is my new product must have.</li>
            <li> I went from no hair to long hair! I found out about this while in CA . I use this on my ten year old also. This is a must by if you want you hair to grow</li>
            <li> has a great smell and within 2wks i could see a difference in my hair, hair was very easily to manage while wet.</li>
            <li> i love it, it,s a great product. would reccommend to any and everyone. just fantastic.You should try this product it brillaint.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product especially for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Going natural...well...went all natural (no relaxer, no keratin straightening) less than 7 months. My hair has grown over 11\\&quot; in 7 months! Yes, you read it correctly. I&#x27;ve been wearing twists (extensions), doing co wash majority of the time, and didn&#x27;t have to do the frightening &#x27;big chop&#x27;! Of course I did have chop off the chemically enhanced hair, but did not have to deal with the really short hair phase of going natural.... basically my hair is growing fast! At first, I thought the person that was doing my twists wasn&#x27;t doing a good job....switched stylists twice and came to terms (along with my current styler) that my hair is just growing like wild flowers. I used this product, the &#x27;virgin fertilizer&#x27; in the tube (hate the tube material - love the product). I have my own little enhancements that I think added &#x27;fuel to the fire&#x27;, but over all love this product. No, I am not paid reviewer (as I&#x27;ve seen on many other products) and I will be posting a 5-star review (copy, paste and replace-lol) on the virgin fertilizer as well...toodles!</li>
            <li> I use this on my niece hair. My niece whose just 10 years old and has always been natural (has never hasd a relaxer or chemical of any kind) in her hair and this really makes her hair awfully soft and detangles her hair and this leaves my niece really nice and soft, we have a really hard time with detangling and combing her hair when its wet. So recently I started sitting her under my hair dryer with plastic caps and under my hair steamer with this conditioner and it has been so helpful.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I can tell my hair is growing faster, and it&#x27;s easy to comb through after showering.</li>
            <li> I love the tingling sensation my scalp has.  My hair is detangled and soft. This helps your hair grow.  My hair is healthy looking.  I love this product.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love the stimulation that it gives when you put it on your hair&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell that it has also</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It has a nice scent and it makes your hair grow fast and thick. Great product to use</li>
