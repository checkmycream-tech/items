    <ol>
            <li>These work great!</li>
            <li>These have been perfect and as described.  </li>
            <li>Rec&#x27;d item on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li>pleasently surprised!&lt;br /&gt;quality is just as good as well.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m happy to find that they fit perfectly, are nice and soft, feel great and do a great job cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li>Maybe there is some kind of &amp;#34;work-around,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lesson: stick with authentic Sonicare products.</li>
            <li>Much better value than the the branded brush heads and seem otherwise identical.  </li>
            <li>Soft, good feel, good cleaning and much better value.  </li>
            <li>I chose this replacement brush mostly for price...</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Sonicare heads for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one worked out OK; wore out faster than an authentic Sonicare replacement, the bristles were not quite as fine, but still OK.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even fit..</li>
            <li>These, although they may fit on your unit, pop off while you are brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The product does fit the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Even fit into the travel case the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit at all</li>
            <li>They fit just as well.</li>
            <li>Granted, these were inexpensive, but they weren&#x27;t free.  </li>
            <li>I was worried if they would be a soft, fit right and feel as good.  </li>
            <li>they vibrate right off!</li>
            <li>I went ahead and paid more for the REAL thing.</li>
            <li>but they fit the toothbrush &amp; work very well.  </li>
            <li>ones!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I can still get heads that work on my old sonicare.</li>
            <li>Well, the price was right, and so I gave these a</li>
            <li>This thing bounced right off my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you turn the toothbrush on they vibrate right off.</li>
            <li>but I guess in this situation paying a little more is worthwhile.</li>
            <li>was trying to avoid paying the high cost of the original Sonicare heads</li>
            <li>Fit the electric brush handle the same and fit the travel case</li>
            <li>They keep vibrating off after the first week.  </li>
            <li>Overall, pleased with this replacement brush head.  </li>
            <li>I;m using the brush and will order order more later.</li>
            <li>After the first use, falls off the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These brush heads do just fine, way worth going with the generic brand over the costly Sonicare ones.  </li>
            <li>These work as well as the brand name and at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>this is a real review, not some generated bs.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$ !!!  </li>
            <li>I see no difference between the generic &amp; the original Sonic brushes I was using.</li>
            <li>Brush itself is fine, but the brush head connection to the toothbrush became extremely loose after just a couple of weeks usage.</li>
            <li>Not an issue if a single person uses the sonic toothbrush, but a fairly important for families.</li>
            <li>I did&#x27;t expect much but was pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t worth saving a few bucks to have a brush head full of toothpaste fall out of your mouth three times a week.  </li>
            <li>The first one broke after the third use.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried a generic brush head.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t come with the clear plastic cover you get with the oem toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t have bought generic -- very loose fit on the handle.  </li>
            <li>no issues of them coming off so far as noted in another review.  </li>
            <li>These are much cheaper than the actual Philips brand replacement brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Spend the extra $25 for the real ones, and skip these generic ones.</li>
            <li>They did not fit and came right off.</li>

            <li> Complete waste of money..</li>
            <li> The life of the product was as long as the originals.  </li>
            <li> So loose that the head vibrates itself off of the brush while trying to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> They could be a little smaller than Sonicare&#x27;s</li>
            <li> So, it is not a straight up replacement.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try these even though I also ordered the more expensive set that is not generic copy since the compact heads are difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I am more than disappointed.</li>
            <li> The regular size Sonicare&#x27;s  are too large for my mouth &amp; difficult to brush in hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> : These occasionally detach from the brush handle (usually while you&#x27;re brushing!)</li>
            <li> Too bad because they are significantly cheaper than the branded ones</li>
            <li> It causes an uncomfortable sensation against my teeth when using; not a smooth vibrating sensation like the REAL product.  </li>
            <li> but these are just SO not worth it!</li>
            <li> These were a total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> They did not fit well on the brush handle, after turning it on after a few seconds they worked themselves off the brush and flew across the bathroom.</li>
            <li> These do not fit my DiamondClean or my husband&#x27;s Flexcare+</li>
            <li> and the bristles are not as stiff as the Philips brush heads.</li>
            <li> They are a little softer which I have grown to prefer but its something to consider if you like a very firm bristle.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a viable generic alternative to the expensive brush heads, but this product is not it.</li>
            <li> It seems crazy that the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ones are so expensive or that a generic brand doesn&#x27;t fit, but at least the expensive ones work.</li>
            <li> Not nice at all.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase them as they are less expensive.</li>
            <li> These brush heads do not fit tightly on the base and keep falling off while brushing.</li>
            <li> total crap.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have pointed out, they would periodically slip off the base unit and that proved a deal-breaker.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!!</li>
            <li> Horrible replacement.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> although I have not used them yet, they are compatible and so will work as well as the phillips brand ones!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I can still get heads that work on my old sonicare.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a cheaper alternative to for our Pro Results brush and regretted it. They did not fit well on the brush handle, after turning it on after a few seconds they worked themselves off the brush and flew across the bathroom.</li>
            <li> These work as well as the brand name and at a much lower price.  They do a terrific job cleaning teeth.  I would buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> Generic - never again.  It causes an uncomfortable sensation against my teeth when using; not a smooth vibrating sensation like the REAL product.  I went ahead and paid more for the REAL thing.</li>
            <li> Well, the price was right, and so I gave these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one worked out OK; wore out faster than an authentic Sonicare replacement, the bristles were not quite as fine, but still OK. However the second brush didn&#x27;t make it; about halfway into week three, something in the interior gave way and then the brush would no longer stay on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson: stick with authentic Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> total crap.  The first one broke after the third use.  Threw them both away.  Spend the extra $25 for the real ones, and skip these generic ones.</li>
            <li> Horrible!! They don&#x27;t even fit.. They vibrate off.. Complete waste of money..this is a real review, not some generated bs. It would not allow me to give it no stars!</li>
            <li> Visually they look the same as the original.&lt;br /&gt;When installing them you notice the difference.&lt;br /&gt;They neither snap nor stay in place firmly.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> These brush heads do just fine, way worth going with the generic brand over the costly Sonicare ones.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  These, although they may fit on your unit, pop off while you are brushing your teeth.  Not nice at all.</li>
            <li> I see no difference between the generic &amp; the original Sonic brushes I was using.It feels &amp;works the same as the originals</li>
            <li> The product does fit the toothbrush.  However, the brush head is perhaps 1/3 smaller than that on the standard Philips toothbrush.  So, it is not a straight up replacement.</li>
            <li> These will not stay on the handle.  They keep vibrating off after the first week.  Never again will I try a generic brand toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> this brush seems to work as well as the original&lt;br /&gt;Philips Soni care Proresults Compatible GENERIC Brush Head, COMPACT&lt;br /&gt;PAZ Generix</li>
            <li> These brush heads do not fit tightly on the base and keep falling off while brushing. If you put the head on backwards it somewhat stays on but I would not buy these again nor would I recommend them to anyone. Too bad because they are significantly cheaper than the branded ones but I guess in this situation paying a little more is worthwhile.</li>
            <li> They did not fit and came right off. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> These do not work!! they vibrate right off! Wish I had read reviews before ordering. amazon refunded my purchase price--but I wonder why they recommend them?</li>
            <li> Overall, pleased with this replacement brush head.  Stays mounted - no issues of them coming off so far as noted in another review.  Feels and looks like OEM except for one thing -  can&#x27;t use the color rings that are used to identify which brush head belongs to which family member.  After a couple of minutes of trying to pry the default &#x27;white ring&#x27; off the brush head, I realized that the &#x27;rings&#x27; were actually part of the mold which was made to look like it was there.  Not an issue if a single person uses the sonic toothbrush, but a fairly important for families.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d item on time and in good shape. Item was as expected. I;m using the brush and will order order more later.</li>
            <li> This thing bounced right off my toothbrush. It worked for about 2 days. It also doesn&#x27;t come with the clear plastic cover you get with the oem toothbrushes.  These were a total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try these even though I also ordered the more expensive set that is not generic copy since the compact heads are difficult to find in stores. I am more than disappointed. These do not fit my DiamondClean or my husband&#x27;s Flexcare+ Sonicare. They do not snap on like they should. If you turn the toothbrush on they vibrate right off. I&#x27;ve already requested a refund. I wish I could give these ZERO stars.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t have bought generic -- very loose fit on the handle.  Returned them and will spend extra to get Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried a generic brush head. I was worried if they would be a soft, fit right and feel as good.  Well, I&#x27;m happy to find that they fit perfectly, are nice and soft, feel great and do a great job cleaning teeth.  No complaints at all. Much better value than the the branded brush heads and seem otherwise identical.  Even fit into the travel case the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Seem identical to the branded heads but without the name on them. Soft, good feel, good cleaning and much better value.  Fit the electric brush handle the same and fit the travel case just perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None.</li>
            <li> I chose this replacement brush mostly for price... I did&#x27;t expect much but was pleasantly surprised...I&#x27;ll reorder/recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Horrible replacement. Didn&#x27;t fit at all</li>
            <li> Works as it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> After the first use, falls off the electric toothbrush. The official Philips heads are 3 for about the same price now too.</li>
            <li> Brush itself is fine, but the brush head connection to the toothbrush became extremely loose after just a couple of weeks usage. So loose that the head vibrates itself off of the brush while trying to brush my teeth. I was looking for a viable generic alternative to the expensive brush heads, but this product is not it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about trying a generic version.  Sometimes it works out.  Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  These heads look the same, feel the same, but don&#x27;t adhere the same.  As other reviewers have pointed out, they would periodically slip off the base unit and that proved a deal-breaker.  It just isn&#x27;t worth saving a few bucks to have a brush head full of toothpaste fall out of your mouth three times a week.  I&#x27;ll stick to the OEM version, thank you.</li>
            <li> they work! and work just like the name brand - will definately buy again and save the money! pleasently surprised!&lt;br /&gt;quality is just as good as well.</li>
            <li> These work great! The ones in stores are too expensive, so love the generic ones.  You should try these items.</li>
            <li> They could be a little smaller than Sonicare&#x27;s but they fit the toothbrush &amp; work very well.  The regular size Sonicare&#x27;s  are too large for my mouth &amp; difficult to brush in hard to reach places.  I will continue to purchase them as they are less expensive.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Sonicare heads for much cheaper. They fit just as well. They are a little softer which I have grown to prefer but its something to consider if you like a very firm bristle.</li>
            <li> Granted, these were inexpensive, but they weren&#x27;t free.  They don&#x27;t stay on.  Maybe there is some kind of &amp;#34;work-around,&amp;#34; but I just threw mine in the trash.  It seems crazy that the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ones are so expensive or that a generic brand doesn&#x27;t fit, but at least the expensive ones work.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$ !!!  Lesson learned on this one!&lt;br /&gt;Pro: 1) way cheaper than official replacement heads and 2) come in the compact size.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1) these generic replacements heads will not stay on the handle and 2) they do not come with a brush cover.&lt;br /&gt;I was trying to avoid paying the high cost of the original Sonicare heads but these are just SO not worth it!</li>
            <li> These have been perfect and as described.  The life of the product was as long as the originals.  Used each brush for 90 days.  Ordering second pair now.</li>
            <li> Pros : These are much cheaper than the actual Philips brand replacement brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Cons : These occasionally detach from the brush handle (usually while you&#x27;re brushing!) and the bristles are not as stiff as the Philips brush heads.</li>
