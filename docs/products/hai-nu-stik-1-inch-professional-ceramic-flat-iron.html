    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is excellent.</li>
            <li>I have used it for 6 months and very happy with the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>HAI truly makes the best iron ever!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely great!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li>IT HAS TO BE THE BEST THING I&#x27;VE</li>
            <li>It is wonderful</li>
            <li>so you get a very good press from the scalp up.</li>
            <li>This straightener is very good, but I did have an issue with it.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with how great it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and works great.</li>
            <li>I was just using it for about the 8th time, it was working great, then it just stopped working.</li>
            <li>For months, this iron worked GREAT.</li>
            <li>Great product for great price.</li>
            <li>This is the best flatiron I like it better than the CHI brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is, they work great if you get a good one.</li>
            <li>The Amazon price was so good compared to the retail store price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good at shaping the ends of your hair if you want it to.  </li>
            <li>love this iron!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice travel size too.</li>
            <li>I can get my hair to frame my face nicely.</li>
            <li>it was the brand she liked the most (Chi).</li>
            <li>Because of the way you can customize the settings, this straightener is suitable for all hair types.  </li>
            <li>I own one,and love it.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>This is great for the hair, and irons pretty well.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The plates are thinner than most</li>
            <li>THEY ALL LOVE IT, AND</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t take any moisture out of my hair, so i guess it&#x27;s better to still have moisture and frizz than frizz and fried hair.    </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I plan on doing more research before dropping a ton of money again.</li>
            <li>I felt so good that i had made the right choice</li>
            <li>Best flat iron out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very effective, high quality product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, packing was ample and need I saw the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product that makes my hair feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li>She tried it and loved it and now has a new   favorite brand.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it does a WONDERFUL job on my hair and doesn&#x27;t damage it</li>
            <li>or hair that breaks easily).</li>
            <li>Worth the price because afterall this is for our hair to look nice and beautiful in the longer run and not get damaged by some cheap flat irons.</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness were the results remarkable and the unit was clearly hotter than mine.</li>
            <li>(and I have fine hair-</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but curly and somewhat intractable.  </li>
            <li>and it was fine, but it was humid out</li>
            <li>Suggest using with Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray for best results.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It heats fast - cools quickly and provides consistant results that I can accomplish on my own without having my kid do my hair every day (which as a college student she doesn&#x27;t have time for when we&#x27;re not on a cruise).</li>
            <li>You will definitely not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Other wise it had been working for 6 years!</li>
            <li>I would recommend going to a beauty salon and paying full price.  </li>
            <li>This iron has a temperature control, soft and flexible rotating cord, comfortable shape (easy to hold on to), strategically placed on/off switch (you won&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while using it!), no place for your hair to snag, and it heats up almost instantly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it heated up fairly quickly, and it didn&#x27;t snag my hair or anything.     </li>
            <li>Yes, HAI products are normally very good, but just be aware that it could be defective (as all things can be) and that this particular seller only has a 15 day return policy!</li>
            <li>Good Luck getting results on the 1 year limited warranty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used GHDs and even though they&#x27;re pricier they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>still well worth it.</li>
            <li>I was careful to take good care of it</li>
            <li>get&#x27;s hot quickly.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this flat iron being a woman of color, those  department store brand flat iron&#x27;s are a waste of good money after i chose this iron based on the reviews i read</li>
            <li>I purchased my first one 6 years ago and never had a problem, it leaves my hair soft and shiny and I love that I can also curl my hair with it...</li>
            <li>:) i&#x27;d definately recommend this product over ones that will fry your hair, it&#x27;s worth the extra bucks.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron so much!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>i decided to take a chance and spend more money on a non-walmart flat iron, and i bought the hai stick ceramic iron.</li>
            <li>The HAI Stik is by far the best flat iron I have ever used - and I have been purchasing pricey professional irons for the last 8 years!</li>
            <li>It heats up in seconds and tells you it&#x27;s hot with a flashing red light.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market you really should get this one.</li>
            <li>It is a reasonable price for what it does.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well , heats up fast.</li>
            <li>all in all, my hair is straight</li>
            <li>The lowest setting was not sufficient, but I found a setting about halfway up the dial (260) that works very well.  </li>
            <li>and it got my obnoxious, curly hair (bordering on afro) really straight.</li>
            <li>wish the wand slats were a little wider but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a few months, I love it, use it just about every day.</li>
            <li>So I set out to get a new hair straightener.</li>
            <li>I was going to have to lay out some bucks for the new one.</li>
            <li>That happens, so I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>After a looong process (approx 2 weeks) of trying to reach HAI and paying to ship the product to CA, I just received a new HAI straightener from the company itself today.     </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The first only lasted 2.5 months.</li>
            <li>The warranty only lasts a year and the product will surely break down before then.</li>
            <li>This is my first flat iron and it works like a dream.  </li>
            <li>While on a Mexico cruise with my mother and adult daughters</li>
            <li>The professional shop recommended this one - the reviews online agreed.</li>
            <li>I had no idea that with my naturally wavy hair I could get that straight-hair look...</li>
            <li>I HAVE GIVEN AWAY 4 OF THESE SO FAR.</li>
            <li>They told me I should contact HAI directly instead.</li>
            <li>I asked her about hair straighteners, she showed me the one she uses professionally, and used it to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and only costs about $8.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This flat iron works really well</li>
            <li>I visited high end salons and learned about what they used and what they sold in the retail area, stopped by big box stores to price shop and the professional beauty supply shop.</li>
            <li>I had a different flat iron before (much cheaper than this!), and I could find the difference what money can buy for you.</li>
            <li>it usually takes me a half hour to straighten my hair, but i&#x27;m pretty sure it only took fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li>Had to replace the old one only because I stepped on it and broke it.</li>
            <li>but it only takes 10 minutes as opposed to 30 with my old straightner.  </li>
            <li>Heats up extra fast and has a long cord!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does a lot despite taking up very little space.  </li>
            <li>So what if i had to drop a few bucks, right?</li>
            <li>The first one&#x27;s cord gave out after a few years.</li>
            <li>I would get another one of these, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive than the offerings at Target or Wal-Mart, but she said, \\&quot;You have to have the right tools.\\&quot;  </li>

            <li> I got this flat iron as a 2009 Christmas gift from my sister.</li>
            <li> The HAI Nu-Stik Flat Iron is a joke!  </li>
            <li> (I placed a square of toilet paper between the irons.</li>
            <li> I got this iron in August because I was tired of the crappy ones you can buy anywhere-they didn&#x27;t last long, didn&#x27;t do a decent job, and took FOREVER.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell burnt like other flat irons.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it has definately paid for itself several times over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron almost everyday since then</li>
            <li> unfortunately I came back to amazon to re-buy this flatiron again because I accidently dropped it and it finally gave up on me after the 500th time!</li>
            <li> Hair half done.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair</li>
            <li> After a month and a half it suddenly stopped working, which was extremely frustrating.</li>
            <li> my wavy hair is extremely frizzy and very difficult to keep straight.</li>
            <li> and I usually went through 3 or 4 Conair ceramic straightners a year</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used four flat irons; a remington wet2straight, a revlon, a conair infiniti, and another random conair.</li>
            <li> and I cannot flatten those hard to reach areas.</li>

            <li> I got this flat iron as a 2009 Christmas gift from my sister. I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron almost everyday since then and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with how great it works. It&#x27;s affordable and works great. You will definitely not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron and it works like a dream.  Heats up extra fast and has a long cord!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used GHDs and even though they&#x27;re pricier they are worth every penny. After using the Hai Stick just one time, I had terrible split ends, and the stick did not &#x27;glide&#x27; over my hair in the same way but seemed to tear. Terrible! I think I&#x27;ll upgrade!</li>
            <li> This is the fourth one I have bought. I bought one for myself and two of my daughters. Then I bought another one when I burned one up in Israel. Don&#x27;t travel with them. I had all the converters and plugs but it still burned up.  I just recommended it to a friend and will probably buy another for a Christmas present for another daughter.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.I had a different flat iron before (much cheaper than this!), and I could find the difference what money can buy for you. This is great for the hair, and irons pretty well. Worth the price because afterall this is for our hair to look nice and beautiful in the longer run and not get damaged by some cheap flat irons.</li>
            <li> I would not have waited 2 weeks if someone had emailed and said this item is on backorder! this was supposed to be a gift! now I can&#x27;t get another in time . my advice to this seller, drop a note I still would have cancelled the order which I did bur&#x3D;t I may have purchased in the future which I won&#x27;t now!</li>
            <li> I had a hair straighten - an inexpensive Conair one - I knew it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted my hair to look like but assumed it was my hair. While on a Mexico cruise with my mother and adult daughters my younger daughter did my hair every day (what a treat!) and she used her hair straightener. Oh my goodness were the results remarkable and the unit was clearly hotter than mine. So I set out to get a new hair straightener. Since I realized that my inexpensive one didn&#x27;t cut it I was going to have to lay out some bucks for the new one. I visited high end salons and learned about what they used and what they sold in the retail area, stopped by big box stores to price shop and the professional beauty supply shop. The professional shop recommended this one - the reviews online agreed. The Amazon price was so good compared to the retail store price so I bought it. Shipping was quick, packing was ample and need I saw the results were amazing. I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a few months, I love it, use it just about every day. It heats fast - cools quickly and provides consistant results that I can accomplish on my own without having my kid do my hair every day (which as a college student she doesn&#x27;t have time for when we&#x27;re not on a cruise). If you&#x27;re in the market you really should get this one.</li>
            <li> Great product that makes my hair feel silky and soft. It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell burnt like other flat irons.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and great product. I bought this as a gift for my daughter thinking  it was the brand she liked the most (Chi). She tried it and loved it and now has a new   favorite brand.</li>
            <li> WOW! I am really impressed with this flat iron being a woman of color, those  department store brand flat iron&#x27;s are a waste of good money after i chose this iron based on the reviews i read i noticed it was the same one being used at the salon i go to. I felt so good that i had made the right choice i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The HAI Nu-Stik Flat Iron is a joke!  It worked for 5 months and then quit!  Good Luck getting results on the 1 year limited warranty.</li>
            <li> I do not regret buying this product. It is a reasonable price for what it does. It heats up fast and is very easy to use.  I set mine on the highest speed after doing a test. (I placed a square of toilet paper between the irons. Because it was not brown or burned, I knew the setting would not damage my hair). I have used it for 6 months and very happy with the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product through Amazon.  Prices are low for a reason.  I would recommend going to a beauty salon and paying full price.  This item arrived broken . . . and would not even turn on.  When you return an item you have to pay for shipping and some sort of restocking fee.  Outrageous!!!</li>
            <li> I really like it. get&#x27;s hot quickly. has range of heat temperature to choose from. has not burned my hair!</li>
            <li> The HAI Stik is by far the best flat iron I have ever used - and I have been purchasing pricey professional irons for the last 8 years! This iron has a temperature control, soft and flexible rotating cord, comfortable shape (easy to hold on to), strategically placed on/off switch (you won&#x27;t accidentally turn it off while using it!), no place for your hair to snag, and it heats up almost instantly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this iron! Solano and Babyliss look out! HAI truly makes the best iron ever!!!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much! I purchased my first one 6 years ago and never had a problem, it leaves my hair soft and shiny and I love that I can also curl my hair with it... unfortunately I came back to amazon to re-buy this flatiron again because I accidently dropped it and it finally gave up on me after the 500th time! This is the best flatiron I like it better than the CHI brand.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  It heats up in seconds and tells you it&#x27;s hot with a flashing red light.  It is stream-lined, not bulky and has a temperature dial so you can choose the amount of heat you want to apply to your hair.  It&#x27;s absolutely great!  I had no idea that with my naturally wavy hair I could get that straight-hair look...even on muggy days.  I wish I had discovered this years ago! It&#x27;s wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought an even nicer version than this one for $120 at a store. I bought the Copper-T and had 2 stop working on me in the span of 7 months. The first only lasted 2.5 months. The third one I got through the warranty was not put together correctly and ripped out my hair. The warranty only lasts a year and the product will surely break down before then. I was told I could not have a refund because \\&quot;the store I bought it from is the company that took my money.\\&quot; I have never been so frustrated with a company.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for almost a year now and it does wonders for my hair and styling. The plates are thinner than most so you get a very good press from the scalp up. I have used larger plates and I cannot flatten those hard to reach areas. And I have dropped in on several occasions and it&#x27;s still kicking. I totally recommend this product.     Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my second Hai. The first one&#x27;s cord gave out after a few years. That happens, so I bought a new one. I was just using it for about the 8th time, it was working great, then it just stopped working. No rhyme or reason. Just stopped. Hair half done. Totally unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, they work great if you get a good one.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works really well but i&#x27;m african american and when it get&#x27;s closer to the time that I need a perm, this doesn&#x27;t seem to straigten the roots that well anymore- or it straightens it for the day then the roots get puffy the next day.  But other than that, it does a WONDERFUL job on my hair and doesn&#x27;t damage it (and I have fine hair- or hair that breaks easily).</li>
            <li> I HAVE GIVEN AWAY 4 OF THESE SO FAR. IT HAS TO BE THE BEST THING I&#x27;VE EVER GIVEN TO THE WOMEN IN MY LIFE. THEY ALL LOVE IT, AND ALL THEIR FRIENDS NOW WANT ONE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron out there. Love it! wish the wand slats were a little wider but that&#x27;s okay. still well worth it.</li>
            <li> This straightener is very good, but I did have an issue with it. After a month and a half it suddenly stopped working, which was extremely frustrating. I contacted the seller and their return policy states that you can&#x27;t return defective products after 15 days. They told me I should contact HAI directly instead. After a looong process (approx 2 weeks) of trying to reach HAI and paying to ship the product to CA, I just received a new HAI straightener from the company itself today.     Yes, HAI products are normally very good, but just be aware that it could be defective (as all things can be) and that this particular seller only has a 15 day return policy! (Wish I read that earlier)</li>
            <li> Always like this brand. Seems to work well , heats up fast. Nice travel size too. Had to replace the old one only because I stepped on it and broke it. Other wise it had been working for 6 years!</li>
            <li> my wavy hair is extremely frizzy and very difficult to keep straight. i&#x27;ve used four flat irons; a remington wet2straight, a revlon, a conair infiniti, and another random conair. some of them left my hair frizzy and fried, despite the product i used to keep that from happening.    i decided to take a chance and spend more money on a non-walmart flat iron, and i bought the hai stick ceramic iron. i got it in the mail today and tried it out. it usually takes me a half hour to straighten my hair, but i&#x27;m pretty sure it only took fifteen minutes. it heated up fairly quickly, and it didn&#x27;t snag my hair or anything.     the only issue is that my hair is still sort of frizzy, maybe it&#x27;s just the summer humidity. it didn&#x27;t take any moisture out of my hair, so i guess it&#x27;s better to still have moisture and frizz than frizz and fried hair.    all in all, my hair is straight and i&#x27;m satisfied. :) i&#x27;d definately recommend this product over ones that will fry your hair, it&#x27;s worth the extra bucks.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing the same stylist for ten years.  I adore her and I trust her implicitly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I asked her about hair straighteners, she showed me the one she uses professionally, and used it to style my hair.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than the offerings at Target or Wal-Mart, but she said, \\&quot;You have to have the right tools.\\&quot;  Not only does she use the HAI stick at work, but her daughters use it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HAI stick has multiple settings for different hair types.  My hair is fine but curly and somewhat intractable.  The lowest setting was not sufficient, but I found a setting about halfway up the dial (260) that works very well.  Because of the way you can customize the settings, this straightener is suitable for all hair types.  It heats up in about ten seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  As with all heat styling, my stylist recommended using a thermal protectant.  I bought TRESemme Thermal Creations Straightening gel.  It works very well and only costs about $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very effective, high quality product.</li>
            <li> I got this iron in August because I was tired of the crappy ones you can buy anywhere-they didn&#x27;t last long, didn&#x27;t do a decent job, and took FOREVER. For months, this iron worked GREAT. I was careful to take good care of it and it got my obnoxious, curly hair (bordering on afro) really straight. So what if i had to drop a few bucks, right? Well, today it stopped working. I used it in the morning and it was fine, but it was humid out and I&#x27;d been working out. So I turned it on to touch up my hair, and nothing happened. I&#x27;ve tried everything to make it work, and it just won&#x27;t. I would get another one of these, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth it. I plan on doing more research before dropping a ton of money again.</li>
            <li> Great product for great price. Salon results. Suggest using with Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray for best results.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and I usually went through 3 or 4 Conair ceramic straightners a year, I figured I should try something else. I read the reveiws and decided on this one.  It is wonderful, I was kinda worried that it was too thin and it would take forever to do my hair but it only takes 10 minutes as opposed to 30 with my old straightner.  I use it everyday and it has definately paid for itself several times over.</li>
            <li> I own one,and love it.  So my daughter had to have one so I bought this for her for Christmas!!!!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does a lot despite taking up very little space.  It&#x27;s also good at shaping the ends of your hair if you want it to.  I can get my hair to frame my face nicely.</li>
