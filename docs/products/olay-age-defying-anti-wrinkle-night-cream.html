            <li>very good cream.  </li>
            <li>Both price and quality for this item are very good.</li>

            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great night cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great or it would have been if they had sent me what I ordered.</li>
            <li>another great product by Olay..</li>
            <li>This cream is just great.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>It feels good</li>
            <li>(I have acne prone skin), but I find it helpful to do a good exfoliating before apply it</li>
            <li>Might be good for drier skin types.</li>
            <li>My face is a bit oily but this cream is light but moisturizers perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Good product, and good price my wife always tell me me to buy.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and keep my face hydrated all night, can&#x27;t say for sure if it will help with wrinkles etc but keeps your face hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love the musky smell and it makes your skin feel refreshed!  </li>
            <li>I always love my Olay products!</li>
            <li>but sure has helped!</li>
            <li>and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>The absolute best night cream.  </li>
            <li>This is a very strong smelling cream.</li>
            <li>as soon as I find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li>oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and would probably be great for someone with drier skin, but definitely not for me.</li>
            <li>so I was sure to pamper it with thorough cleansing and continued to use this about 2-3 more times and each time I saw more of the suspicious bumps</li>
            <li>me wanted to be SURE</li>
            <li>and I must say, I do look better.</li>
            <li>I believe it makes my complexion glow, as, I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>and I always make sure to wash my face again in the morning.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I love going to bed with this on my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I have clearer more radiant skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product, use it on face and throat area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it.ladies go out and purchase this cream&lt;</li>
            <li>This is my favorite night cream</li>
            <li>Was great to get them in the mail, ready to go.</li>
            <li>I am 62 and not too many wrinkles anywhere on my face.  </li>
            <li>I love using this during the winter nights, to prevent dryness.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Ok stuff.</li>
            <li>rated this high because of the great quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was perfect and the product was not old or expired.</li>
            <li>But, you really have to take care of your skin even if you are gifted with good genes.  </li>
            <li>Real Olay cream, good price</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see wrinkles disappear, but skin does feel good.</li>
            <li>It arived fast, and it had a good price.</li>
            <li>Cool beans!</li>
            <li>When applied the product felt lightweight and non-greasy, had a light, sweet, vanilla kind of scent, and my skin felt immediately smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent of the lotion is kinda strong but not over bearing.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for about a month and have seen no visible reduction in my fine lines, so I will probably discontinue to use it.</li>
            <li>Very strong scent, pretty, but strong.</li>
            <li>it does have kind of a strong fragrance, so \\&quot;scent\\&quot;-sitive types may want to steer clear!  :)</li>
            <li>Rich moisture and easy application of the night cream.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a huge difference between this and the cheaper Night of Olay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oil free</li>
            <li>It is a light weight face cream</li>
            <li>frangrance free, you dont need it on your face</li>
            <li>smooth and creamy not greasy.</li>
            <li>Though I have some redness, primarily on my nose, my skin tone has evened out dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so called (turkey neck), smooth skin and not so baggy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the really heavy creams that can block your pores so this one is just perfect.</li>
            <li>This night cream goes on smoothly and feels rich (but not greasy) on my combination skin.  </li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t mistake me past my golden girl age,  and I credit it of course to my parents&#x27; genes since we are Chinese and Chinese are gifted with fair, beautiful and flawless skin.  </li>
            <li>but when I checked the box, they put a sticker on the original bar code and changed it to the Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream bar code.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother me, but for those who are sensitive to that kind of thing</li>
            <li>Loved the smell of the Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream before it was repackaged.</li>
            <li>Bought this at Wal-Mart and really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>but this one is safe and really helps the skin.</li>
            <li>At first it felt fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent night cream, but I will keep looking for one that is more aggressive in its anti-aging benefits.  </li>
            <li>The cream soaked in quickly and didn&#x27;t seem greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>I love Oil of Olay and they always seem to come up with new products that cater to the special needs of women regarding skin.</li>
            <li>This cream has a strong fragrance, very perfumy.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth on my face and neck and really lives up to its word.  </li>
            <li>have oily skin and since it said oil free on the back, I figured I might be ok...</li>
            <li>But the products I use are definately worth the price.</li>
            <li>Other than that,  good cream.</li>
            <li>right?)</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m just using it on my neck and hands</li>
            <li>and I used it right away .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so nice to be able to get things in the mail that I usually h ave to go out for</li>
            <li>so 2 days ago I smeared some more of this stuff on and when I woke up the next morning...</li>
            <li>Has the image shown been what i received there would have been a much higher rating.</li>
            <li>I did like it at first but dont like the burning&lt;br /&gt;and redness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently still looking for what I like the most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just now needing to buy more, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Been using this for a few years and love it!  </li>
            <li>Just like the day cream, it&#x27;s fine but nothing terrific.</li>
            <li>It feels non greasy but it causes my face to produce so much</li>
            <li>Fast forward</li>
            <li>I really needed this.</li>
            <li>I guess they thought I wouldn&#x27;t notice or wouldn&#x27;t care or maybe that it would be too much hassle to do anything about.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, goes on smoothly, &amp; will definitely make your skin smoother.</li>
            <li>, I used the whole container, and my skin was softer in the mornings, didn&#x27;t break me out...</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3-star rating because I am very scent-sensitive.</li>
            <li>I just turned 24, so I&#x27;m not very old, but I&#x27;m starting to see the first signs of fine lines around my eyes and a smile line on one side of my face</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually have this kind of response to skin care products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting some deeper wrinkles now that I am older and have not found a product that smooths deep wrinkles, but oil of olay does leave my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oil free and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin too dry.</li>
            <li>I def recommend this for anyone of any age who wants to keep their skin looking young!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fragranced and it bothers my boyfriend who&#x27;s sensitive to scented creams.</li>
            <li>This product reminds me of an 60+ year old woman who sprays on too much musky perfume.</li>
            <li>I washed it off and put on my normal cream.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream here because it was on sale for $9.64 (normally $12.27 in wal-mart).</li>
            <li>Only comment is it leaves a greasy film on my face and doesn&#x27;t seem like it gets absorbed...</li>
            <li>and it certainly helps retain moisture at night when a person&#x27;s skin loses the most.</li>
            <li>I put it on and it made my face hot and red.</li>
            <li>With in I&#x27;d say 3-4 days the bumps were completely gone!</li>
            <li>Overpaying for products like these drives me crazy so this was a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It may clear wrinkles off ...</li>
            <li>If your skin is at all sensitive do not use this.  </li>
            <li>but I see no visible effects from using it for nearly 2 months--no wrinkle reduction or skin firming benefits.  </li>
            <li>It does not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin and it does not make my face feel greasy either .</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel overly soft or velvety with this cream at all.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product and being in my early fifties now, I still have yet to find a wrinkle on my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for years &amp; this is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Noticed a complete transformation on&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised amazon would fulfill items from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will probably use as hand cream as to not waste it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>there they were, more of the same small, iritating bumps.</li>

            <li> , I used the whole container, and my skin was softer in the mornings, didn&#x27;t break me out...</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3-star rating because I am very scent-sensitive.</li>
            <li> I just turned 24, so I&#x27;m not very old, but I&#x27;m starting to see the first signs of fine lines around my eyes and a smile line on one side of my face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have this kind of response to skin care products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting some deeper wrinkles now that I am older and have not found a product that smooths deep wrinkles, but oil of olay does leave my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil free and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> I def recommend this for anyone of any age who wants to keep their skin looking young!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fragranced and it bothers my boyfriend who&#x27;s sensitive to scented creams.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of an 60+ year old woman who sprays on too much musky perfume.</li>
            <li> I washed it off and put on my normal cream.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream here because it was on sale for $9.64 (normally $12.27 in wal-mart).</li>
            <li> Only comment is it leaves a greasy film on my face and doesn&#x27;t seem like it gets absorbed...</li>
            <li> and it certainly helps retain moisture at night when a person&#x27;s skin loses the most.</li>
            <li> I put it on and it made my face hot and red.</li>
            <li> With in I&#x27;d say 3-4 days the bumps were completely gone!</li>
            <li> Overpaying for products like these drives me crazy so this was a great deal.  </li>
            <li> It may clear wrinkles off ...</li>
            <li> If your skin is at all sensitive do not use this.  </li>
            <li> but I see no visible effects from using it for nearly 2 months--no wrinkle reduction or skin firming benefits.  </li>
            <li> It does not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin and it does not make my face feel greasy either .</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel overly soft or velvety with this cream at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product and being in my early fifties now, I still have yet to find a wrinkle on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for years &amp; this is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Noticed a complete transformation on&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised amazon would fulfill items from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will probably use as hand cream as to not waste it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> there they were, more of the same small, iritating bumps.</li>
            <li> My 40 year old plus skin is pretty tough and this got me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely absorb so your face is left feeling slightly sticky and is that way even the next morning.</li>
            <li> I ordered my usual oil of Olay age defying anti-wrinkle cream and got the much cheaper oil of Olay firming cream.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how anti-wrinkle this product really is but I like the feel of it</li>
            <li> So far, its kept my skin smooth and helped to repair my cheeks that were starting to show aging signs from my bad habit.</li>
            <li> That same day the irritating feeling and bumps slowly but surely started to go away.</li>
            <li> I have dry / combination skin.  </li>
            <li> , my skin tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I normally do not need a night cream</li>
            <li> I washed my face tonight and put this cream on just around the upper half of my face...</li>
            <li> What I received is Night of Olay Firming Cream (which is $5.94 in wal-mart) in a pink box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten really partial to Olay products now.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why a facial cream needs to smell like perfume?</li>
            <li> Have tried other stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 and active</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it seems lately, now that I am almost 32, tightness and dryness has become and issue and is pretty uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> However, I assumed that little \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; was an effect for the retinoids, but turned out to be an allergic response.</li>
            <li> After a little while I kinda got a raw, rashy kinda feeling around my eyes and cheek bones.  </li>
            <li> When I 1st used this I got small, irritating bumps that were the same color as my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it caused little red bumps on my forehead and breakouts on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to be brighter and less dull.</li>
            <li> (so weird it&#x27;s only one side,</li>
            <li> I woke up with basically an oil slick on my face.</li>
            <li> about 1 month later silly</li>
            <li> Hard to find, though.  </li>
            <li> so I would at least get something out of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather thick and leaves an oily residue.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t mean this won&#x27;t work well for someone else.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used product much due to long-lingering unpleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay</li>
            <li> I would understand if they made a mistake and sent me the wrong item</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I found an article that said the form of retinol found in this product (retinyl palmitate, I believe) works well for acne, not for photo-damage/aging.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try, it wasn&#x27;t terrible, but didn&#x27;t work on my skin like I was hoping.</li>

            <li> I just turned 24, so I&#x27;m not very old, but I&#x27;m starting to see the first signs of fine lines around my eyes and a smile line on one side of my face (so weird it&#x27;s only one side, right?) so I decided to give this night cream a shot. It&#x27;s very fragranced and it bothers my boyfriend who&#x27;s sensitive to scented creams. Doesn&#x27;t bother me, but for those who are sensitive to that kind of thing this isn&#x27;t the best option. It doesn&#x27;t completely absorb so your face is left feeling slightly sticky and is that way even the next morning. I used this product for about a month and have seen no visible reduction in my fine lines, so I will probably discontinue to use it. Overall I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Account holders wife here. This is a very strong smelling cream. I put it on and it made my face hot and red. It may clear wrinkles off ... I&#x27;m not chancing another adventure with it. If your skin is at all sensitive do not use this.  My 40 year old plus skin is pretty tough and this got me.</li>
            <li> and she loves it.  i buy it by the case for her.  I use it also and its great.  Moisturizes without the grease.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and keep my face hydrated all night, can&#x27;t say for sure if it will help with wrinkles etc but keeps your face hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products, including this one, for decades. You don&#x27;t need to spend all kinds of money on chi chi department store products.</li>
            <li> This night cream goes on smoothly and feels rich (but not greasy) on my combination skin.  I was looking for a nourishing, anti-aging moisturizer for my 40-ish face but I see no visible effects from using it for nearly 2 months--no wrinkle reduction or skin firming benefits.  It&#x27;s a decent night cream, but I will keep looking for one that is more aggressive in its anti-aging benefits.  P.s. it does have kind of a strong fragrance, so \\&quot;scent\\&quot;-sitive types may want to steer clear!  :)</li>
            <li> Very nice. Not greasy at all.just moisture. I feel and see the difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;Oil free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Way too hydrating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and since it said oil free on the back, I figured I might be ok... I woke up with basically an oil slick on my face. I used it for about a week and it&#x27;s just way too hydrating. It feels non greasy but it causes my face to produce so much oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and would probably be great for someone with drier skin, but definitely not for me. Right now I&#x27;m just using it on my neck and hands so I would at least get something out of it lol</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years and love it!  I love the musky smell and it makes your skin feel refreshed!  I often use it as a hand lotion too!</li>
            <li> I have dry / combination skin.  When I 1st used this I got small, irritating bumps that were the same color as my skin. I thought that my skin was just breaking out so I was sure to pamper it with thorough cleansing and continued to use this about 2-3 more times and each time I saw more of the suspicious bumps appear. They didn&#x27;t look like acne to me, they looked like my skin was having a allergic reaction to something I put on it and the pharmacist at CVS agreed with that notion. I stopped using this and kept treating my skin with the addition of topical cortisone and a oral anti-histamine to my routine. That same day the irritating feeling and bumps slowly but surely started to go away. With in I&#x27;d say 3-4 days the bumps were completely gone! Fast forward about 1 month later silly me wanted to be SURE this was what caused my reaction (and not a cheaper detergent I started using around the same time I initially broke out) so 2 days ago I smeared some more of this stuff on and when I woke up the next morning...whoomp there they were, more of the same small, iritating bumps. I have never had a problem with beta hhydroxy acid  and wanted to like this product but my skin just won&#x27;t accept it.</li>
            <li> rated this high because of the great quality of the product.  Rich moisture and easy application of the night cream.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and I used it right away . It does not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin and it does not make my face feel greasy either . It is a light weight face cream and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I am looking for a night cream to help with dryness around my eyes and upper cheeks.  I normally do not need a night cream but it seems lately, now that I am almost 32, tightness and dryness has become and issue and is pretty uncomfortable.  I went to walmart and was looking at both neutrogena night cream and oil of olay night creams.  I settled on this cream because it was anti-wrinkle and I didn&#x27;t see the neutrogena cream I had wanted to try.  I washed my face tonight and put this cream on just around the upper half of my face...upper cheek bones, around my eyes and forehead.  At first it felt fine.  The scent of the lotion is kinda strong but not over bearing.  The cream soaked in quickly and didn&#x27;t seem greasy or oily.  After a little while I kinda got a raw, rashy kinda feeling around my eyes and cheek bones.  My skin didn&#x27;t feel overly soft or velvety with this cream at all.  I washed it off and put on my normal cream.  I will return this tomorrow and try the neutrogena cream or maybe another oil of olay cream.</li>
            <li> Great night cream. Not greasy, absorb quickly. My skin seems to be brighter and less dull. I couple this with the Olay Age Defying lotion for the morning.  Great products!</li>
            <li> I love Oil of Olay and they always seem to come up with new products that cater to the special needs of women regarding skin. I have used this product and being in my early fifties now, I still have yet to find a wrinkle on my face.  Yes, that&#x27;s how young-looking I am.  You wouldn&#x27;t mistake me past my golden girl age,  and I credit it of course to my parents&#x27; genes since we are Chinese and Chinese are gifted with fair, beautiful and flawless skin.  But, you really have to take care of your skin even if you are gifted with good genes.  So I use this product and it never gave me any rash or allergies.  It feels smooth on my face and neck and really lives up to its word.  Anti-wrinkle!</li>
            <li> I really needed this. It feels good and I must say, I do look better.</li>
            <li> Overpaying for products like these drives me crazy so this was a great deal.  Packaging was perfect and the product was not old or expired.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay since I was 20. I turned 63 this month. My doctor says I look 53! Cool beans! this is a very good buy.</li>
            <li> The absolute best night cream.  Hard to find, though.  Get it while you can!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my Mom.  She swears by it.  I&#x27;ve bought it as a repeat order to keep her stocked.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great or it would have been if they had sent me what I ordered. I ordered my usual oil of Olay age defying anti-wrinkle cream and got the much cheaper oil of Olay firming cream. My cream is around $15 dollars in store and since it was the same price here I though... Why not? I guess they thought I wouldn&#x27;t notice or wouldn&#x27;t care or maybe that it would be too much hassle to do anything about. Oh and by the way once you order it, the product is non-returnable. This was sold by vCommerce and to amazons credit they refunded my money. I guess I&#x27;m off to the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I always love my Olay products! I have used it for years and will continue to use forever. I believe it makes my complexion glow, as, I get many compliments on it. At age 69 I can tell compared to others my age and skin type it is a winner. I will recommend to friends when they ask me what I use.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used product much due to long-lingering unpleasant fragrance.  resembles some fragrance in tanning lotions that I no longer use</li>
            <li> Wrinkles seem just as defined as ever.</li>
            <li> Has the image shown been what i received there would have been a much higher rating. The product i received was the pink/black paged night cream not the purple antiwrinkle shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how anti-wrinkle this product really is but I like the feel of it and it certainly helps retain moisture at night when a person&#x27;s skin loses the most. I have been buying the same product for several years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year. I&#x27;m just now needing to buy more, it lasts a long time. I do break out from time to time using it (I have acne prone skin), but I find it helpful to do a good exfoliating before apply it and I always make sure to wash my face again in the morning. I&#x27;m only 23, but I smoke, so that is why I chose an anti-wrinkle cream. So far, its kept my skin smooth and helped to repair my cheeks that were starting to show aging signs from my bad habit. The smell is wonderful, like roses, and it feels like silk on your skin. I def recommend this for anyone of any age who wants to keep their skin looking young! Love love love.</li>
            <li> Works well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I found an article that said the form of retinol found in this product (retinyl palmitate, I believe) works well for acne, not for photo-damage/aging. But I also have breakouts, so I thought this would still be helpful. When applied the product felt lightweight and non-greasy, had a light, sweet, vanilla kind of scent, and my skin felt immediately smooth. However, I assumed that little \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; was an effect for the retinoids, but turned out to be an allergic response. I had hives on my lower face and neck by morning. I don&#x27;t usually have this kind of response to skin care products. But it doesn&#x27;t mean this won&#x27;t work well for someone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for years &amp; this is by far one of my favorites. It&#x27;s not greasy, goes on smoothly, &amp; will definitely make your skin smoother. You&#x27;ll notice a difference immediately.  It also smells wonderful. I love going to bed with this on my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> Just like the day cream, it&#x27;s fine but nothing terrific.</li>
            <li> I used this for 3 months and was fine&lt;br /&gt;one day I woke up and had scarring by&lt;br /&gt;my cheekbones, I think all face creams should&lt;br /&gt;be frangrance free, you dont need it on your face&lt;br /&gt;shame I did like it at first but dont like the burning&lt;br /&gt;and redness</li>
            <li> smooth and creamy not greasy. perfect night cream, my skin tends to be on the dry side. but you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay</li>
            <li> very good cream.  like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only two weeks and I have seen an improvement. Though I have some redness, primarily on my nose, my skin tone has evened out dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have clearer more radiant skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it on face and throat area.  Noticed a complete transformation on&lt;br /&gt;my so called (turkey neck), smooth skin and not so baggy.  Olay age defying night cream has&lt;br /&gt;not totally erased years of sun but sure has helped!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years of age and am trying to start taking care of my skin, by using anti-wrinkle night creams after I cleanse everynight. My skin is combination, and prone to dryness. I decided to give this a try, because it was affordable and it said it did what I needed. This cream has a strong fragrance, very perfumy. I&#x27;m not sure why a facial cream needs to smell like perfume? I only used it once, I used the whole container, and my skin was softer in the mornings, didn&#x27;t break me out...I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, so can&#x27;t comment about that. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again, just because I&#x27;m looking for something that will give my face a noticable dose of moisture, not just overnight...but all the time!! I&#x27;m currently still looking for what I like the most. I gave this a try, it wasn&#x27;t terrible, but didn&#x27;t work on my skin like I was hoping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this night cream for years, and I refuse to use anything else.  For me, it is the best!</li>
            <li> another great product by Olay..&lt;br /&gt;use as directed and you simply cannot go wrong&lt;br /&gt;i love it.ladies go out and purchase this cream&lt;br /&gt;as it will be recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Real Olay cream, good price</li>
            <li> I have no complaints on how it feels. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy which is a big plus. I gave it a 3-star rating because I am very scent-sensitive. This product reminds me of an 60+ year old woman who sprays on too much musky perfume. The smell is enough to make me pitch it...as soon as I find a suitable replacement. Loved the smell of the Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream before it was repackaged. I will take the leap and hope it has the same formula and scent!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite night cream</li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay for almost sixty years.  I&#x27;m getting some deeper wrinkles now that I am older and have not found a product that smooths deep wrinkles, but oil of olay does leave my skin soft and smooth.  I wish they had a product that fixes deep wrinkles since my wrinkles aren&#x27;t \\&quot;fine\\&quot; anymore. But the products I use are definately worth the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go back to CVS. Was great to get them in the mail, ready to go.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so nice to be able to get things in the mail that I usually h ave to go out for</li>
            <li> I ordered Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream here because it was on sale for $9.64 (normally $12.27 in wal-mart). This comes in a purple box. What I received is Night of Olay Firming Cream (which is $5.94 in wal-mart) in a pink box. I would understand if they made a mistake and sent me the wrong item but when I checked the box, they put a sticker on the original bar code and changed it to the Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream bar code. They are obviously deceiving their buyers. The seller is vCommerce -- beware. I&#x27;m surprised amazon would fulfill items from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream for years. There&#x27;s a huge difference between this and the cheaper Night of Olay. I&#x27;m asian and I&#x27;ve used a lot of night creams but this is the only budget-friendly night cream that won&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> Both price and quality for this item are very good. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Wal-Mart and really wanted to love it. Unfortunately it caused little red bumps on my forehead and breakouts on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve never had acne on my cheeks. It&#x27;s rather thick and leaves an oily residue. Might be good for drier skin types. Very strong scent, pretty, but strong. Will probably use as hand cream as to not waste it.</li>
            <li> I am 62 and not too many wrinkles anywhere on my face.  This cream is just great.  My face is a bit oily but this cream is light but moisturizers perfectly.  I don&#x27;t like the really heavy creams that can block your pores so this one is just perfect.</li>
            <li> this item was shipped promptly.  this item was packaged well.  this was cheaper than what i can buy it for locally.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this cream as an all day cream and it works wonders on his skin. I will keep buying for him. I wanted something that fights all the signs of aging and that worked beautifully on him.</li>
            <li> Good product, and good price my wife always tell me me to buy.</li>
            <li> I love using this during the winter nights, to prevent dryness. I can&#x27;t really see wrinkles disappear, but skin does feel good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells wonderful and it&#x27;s perfect for nights. It&#x27;s oil free and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin too dry. It&#x27;s just perfect and I will definitely buy it again. It arived fast, and it had a good price.</li>
            <li> Ok stuff. No breakouts because of this. Only comment is it leaves a greasy film on my face and doesn&#x27;t seem like it gets absorbed... Other than that,  good cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.I&#x27;m 62 and active and It&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve used. Have tried other stuff but this one is safe and really helps the skin. I&#x27;ve gotten really partial to Olay products now. A little goes a long way. Lasts for quite a while. I get a lot of compliments on how my face never changes so that says something for it! Helps with the aging process. I won&#x27;t buy anything else but this.I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
