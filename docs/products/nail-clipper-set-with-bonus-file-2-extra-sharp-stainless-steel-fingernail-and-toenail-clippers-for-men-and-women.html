            <li> Nice set to have. Only thing missing is a good pair of tweazers which is what kept me from giving this a 5 start rating.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for nail clippers such as these. I am beside myself that I have finally found them. They gives a sharp smooth precise cut. After using these clippers I know I could never go back to using those dull clippers.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with this product. Having clippers that were two sizes is great, one for feet and one for hands. The blade was sharp and cut through the nail easily. My nails didn&#x27;t crack. The nail file is a really good texture, its fine enough to get a more detailed shape and tough enough to file a good amount of the nail. Great set of products, now I just need to get better at applying polish!</li>

They seem to be high quality, and have the appearance of lasting a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I had to change my 5 star rating to 2 stars.  After a bit of use they no longer cut smoothly.  I guess they are cheap after all.</li>
            <li> The clippers are so much easier to use than scissors!  Very precise clipping and they have a comfortable width lever for easy handling. They will be great for traveling.  They seem to be a very good quality material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to receive an email from the supplier before receiving the item.  It explained the package backing was a folded piece with information inside.  Otherwise I might have discarded it after opening the package.</li>
            <li> I’m very happy with this nail clipper set. The clippers are sharp and durable. Love the bonus file!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service! Super sharp!</li>
            <li> These are the best bang for your buck.  I have serious nails and they made short work effortlessly with these clippers.  Arrived on time is a plus.</li>

            <li> High quality; I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I would buy from them again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> I am over 60 years old and I have used many different clippers in my lifetime. These are the best clippers that I have ever used. The leverage is good and they feel stable in your hand. The blades are sharp and can cut through tough finger and toe nails like butter. They are more expensive than the drugstore clippers, but they are absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> Would not cut my nails so they were returned.</li>

            <li> Missing File from package</li>
            <li> The clippers in this set are good and are a better set than just going to the local mega store. They are very smooth metal and I would like to see some sort of grip on the end of the clippers. They work well.  The packaging on these clippers is cheap.  When you order if one of your clippers are missing in the package check out the box, they are probably in there.  Mine had slipped out, but there was no damage.</li>
