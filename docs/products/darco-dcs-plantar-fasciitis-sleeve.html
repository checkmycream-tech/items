    <ol>
            <li> Good support. Relieved some pain prior to my surgical date.</li>
            <li> Bought size L for my dad because he&#x27;s a size 13. He can&#x27;t get it over his foot. Should have gotten the XL. Mom threw out the shipping pprwk so it can&#x27;t be returned. I bought a pair for myself and they fit and help with my foot pain. I suggest if you&#x27;re borderline on the size chart, go to the next size up.</li>
            <li> Not positive if it actually helps- but it was what it said it was. It&#x27;s uncomfortable to wear after a while but i think that is the point to compress so i guess you just have to bear thru that.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> The product that I received is not what was pictured, I was hoping they would still work, they do not.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 months and got no relief. Vendor said they only take returns when &amp;#34;unused&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on, I had instant relief from the pain! It was incredible. I have a big (size 12) wide foot and it isn&#x27;t easy to get on but it isn&#x27;t supposed to be loose or it wouldn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> After wearing this sleeve for only one week the material started to fall apart. Tears starting occurring in the blue heel portion of the sleeve after only wearing it 5-6 times. I would definitely not buy another one of these.</li>
            <li> Works  well. Keeps my arch protected while playing tennnis.</li>
            <li> Well made, but, the sock (just one to order) did not fit my husbands foot.  Had no problem returning and receiving an immediate refund from vendor.  Would do business with them again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is just too tight.  I bought a size larger than was recommended and it&#x27;s still just too tight to wear all day.  If you have skinny ankles, it would probably work great; but if you have larger ankles like I do, you may want to try something else.</li>
            <li> They work!  And unlike other brands, these don&#x27;t roll up when you put socks on.</li>
            <li> I have a size 11 foot. The large size was way to small.</li>
            <li> Provided good support would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner. It was for my husband who said it was helping his heel within the first 1/2 hour of wearing. It does say that it is too tight in the white area in the toe area.</li>
            <li> Very good product, exceeded my expectations it&#x27;s really got my feet feeling great! !</li>
            <li> This is not a Darco sleeve. This is a Dr. Comfort FS6 from Rikco International (company has some medicare fraud history). Images were of real thing when purchased, changed now to what you will actually receive. The UPC matched the Darco so I thought it was going to be Darco. Items returned and we went to get real ones. 2 Stars because it would still probably work for a bit. Poor stitch finishing on the inside, material did not have the same elasticity as the real one. Only leaving feedback so I&#x27;ll stop getting emails about it.</li>
            <li> Made an immediate impact on my injured foot. I use it still when playing tennis to support my injury recovery.</li>
            <li> The size is not true tobsize.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up my issues within 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter who has an issue with her instep.  She does not have plantar fasciitis, but pain in the instep region of her foot.  She needed something that would give her some support and this really helps.  My best friend does have the plantar fasciitis and has been suffering for 5 years with it.  She got these supports and after two weeks has NO MORE PAIN!!  I highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this sleeve gives me support and confidence.  I wear it at night also so that I have that support in the morning when I first get up.  You can also wear it under socks, etc.  Measuring is important to find the right size and the large seems just right.</li>
            <li> works very well for heal pain.</li>
            <li> I will say that this sleeve has helped my PF 75%.  I do quite a bit of cardio at the gym which can be very high impact but this product gives me the right amount of support that my pain and symptoms have been reduced by 75%.  A life saver...I can go to the gym without worry about re-injuring.  Many thanks!</li>
