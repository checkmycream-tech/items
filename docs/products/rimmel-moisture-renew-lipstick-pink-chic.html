            <li>Not a bad product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very nice color/shade of pink.</li>
            <li>While this shipped quickly and the product was well protected, the color did not match what I ordered online</li>
            <li>but it runs out quickly</li>
            <li>Beautiful color after you apply a few times.</li>
            <li>The color comes on exactly as it is displayed!</li>
            <li>I wanted a bright pink lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a bright pink lipstick.</li>
            <li>I wish it is the bright pink as I showed...</li>
            <li>Good quality, but not the &amp;#34;shocking&amp;#34; pink I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>do plan to buy a couple more of this Pink Chic by Rimmel and also more colors in this brand.  </li>
            <li>I hope it lasts other wise</li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this because I thought the color looked so pretty.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried this brand of lipstick and I like it.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick, have being using it daily since it arrives.</li>
            <li>It was more darker sheer rosey color</li>
            <li>it so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty nice shade of pink that looks natural imo.  </li>
            <li>This is a very light pink.</li>
            <li>My lips always feel so soft and moisturized, I love this lipstick and it&#x27;s almost become an everyday color for me since it just easy to use</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really bummed out about it because I was looking forward to this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried four or five different pink lipsticks looking for that perfect pink for this spring/summer.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t beat the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped very quick, creamy and high quality but the color is DIFFERENT from what it looks as the pick.</li>
            <li>The color is very pink, almost pepto colored, which can be cute during the day.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to have to buy another one by th time summer approaches in New York!</li>
            <li>My lips are very sensitive to any added perfumes, etc in beauty products, but this color/brand caused no itching or burning!  </li>
            <li>Verrrrry high quality, gorgeousssss color,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It needed to be brighter and not blend in so much with the natural color of the lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light pink...</li>
            <li>After about an hour the color completely fades!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I couldnt find this true pink color anywhere.  </li>
            <li>make it look bright neon and is a pale soft pink!</li>
            <li>I returned to my old faithful, Amazon, and there it was.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised about this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve finally found it after much trial and error.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lips look soft and it stays on for hours.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also smooth, luscious and not dry or flat as were some of the other brands I tried:  </li>
            <li>More of a pale pink.</li>
            <li>the only lipstick ill keep purchasing, very creamy, just love the way it looks.</li>
            <li>Nice color, pink with a slight touch of coral, subtle, and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>If it was light pink it usually was a gloss.  </li>

            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of Rimmel Makeup products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those brands were way too dry and made my lips looking brittle.  </li>
            <li> You never really know what it will look like with your skin tone until you try it on.</li>
            <li> When I put it on, it was a brighter pink than I expected, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> you want a baby pink lip look</li>
            <li> Wet</li>
            <li> not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> The color does well with clients of all complexions and I look forward to using other colors from Rimmel&#x27;s line.</li>
            <li> very light boring pink is what you get not bright pink as the picture falsely shows and it smells old!</li>
            <li> &#x27;N Wild&#x27;s Dollhouse Pink (#967), NYX&#x27;s Shocking Pink Matte, or Maybelline&#x27;s New York Superstay Perpetual Peony.  </li>
            <li> Sucks to not get what you thought you wer looking for and is not!</li>
            <li> Definitely not happy.</li>
            <li> NOT happy about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to buy lipstick whether its in person or online for me.</li>

I will definitely try different colors of this brand.</li>
            <li> Item was as described! Would recommend to anyone!If you want a baby pink lip look this is a must have item.</li>
            <li> Nice product and was as described</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the longest lasting prestige lipstick, you probably didn&#x27;t intend to land on this page. This is a great drugstore lipstick for those of us who don&#x27;t want to cry if we lose a lipstick or a friend nabs it. The color is very pink, almost pepto colored, which can be cute during the day. Not as drying as a matte, and doesn&#x27;t wash you out. Did I mention it smells like baby powder? I plan on buying more from this line.</li>
            <li> While this shipped quickly and the product was well protected, the color did not match what I ordered online and I&#x27;m really bummed out about it because I was looking forward to this lipstick. Definitely not happy.</li>
            <li> My lips always feel so soft and moisturized, I love this lipstick and it&#x27;s almost become an everyday color for me since it just easy to use and I dont have to put on any chapstick for my lips to feel great</li>
            <li> It definitely is a popular item with my clients they love the color. The color does well with clients of all complexions and I look forward to using other colors from Rimmel&#x27;s line.</li>
            <li> Nice color, pink with a slight touch of coral, subtle, and very moisturizing.  I use a neutral lip liner and then fill in with this.  My lips are very sensitive to any added perfumes, etc in beauty products, but this color/brand caused no itching or burning!  It also has an SPF to protect lips from  sun damage.  Love the product and the price!</li>
            <li> I couldnt find this true pink color anywhere.  If it was light pink it usually was a gloss.  I wanted a bright pink lipstick.  Not purple, which I kept finding.  I returned to my old faithful, Amazon, and there it was.  With free shipping!  2 thumbs up</li>
            <li> Good quality, but not the &amp;#34;shocking&amp;#34; pink I was hoping for. It needed to be brighter and not blend in so much with the natural color of the lips.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color after you apply a few times. However it doesn&#x27;t stay on long. After about an hour the color completely fades! It&#x27;s a matte finish &amp; doesn&#x27;t apply well &amp; the coverage isn&#x27;t great. Rimmel is usually pretty good with their products. I&#x27;m surprised about this lipstick. I won&#x27;t give up on Rimmel yet. However this lipstick gets 2 stars because of the color. They could have done way better!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of Rimmel Makeup products.&lt;br /&gt;They never disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;And they are great on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>

Those brands were way too dry and made my lips looking brittle.  I&#x27;ll use them mixed with some lip gloss, but I&#x27;ll never buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do plan to buy a couple more of this Pink Chic by Rimmel and also more colors in this brand.  It&#x27;s one of the best quality lipsticks I&#x27;ve had in many years and you can&#x27;t beat the reasonable price.  It makes my lips look soft and it stays on for hours.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is not the same color as advertised. It&#x27;s a light pink...not at all what I expected. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Its is n ok t even vlose to what the picture shows. The al ter the volor shown on the picture make it look bright neon and is a pale soft pink! Sucks to not get what you thought you wer looking for and is not!</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick, have being using it daily since it arrives. Is very soft and moisturizing and the color is a soft and delicate pink that can be wear at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast but when I opened the lipstick it look nothing like the color online. It was more darker sheer rosey color but it felt good on my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a bright pink lipstick. It was shipped very quick, creamy and high quality but the color is DIFFERENT from what it looks as the pick. This is a very light pink. NOT happy about this product. I wish it is the bright pink as I showed...</li>

            <li> Not the same color very light boring pink is what you get not bright pink as the picture falsely shows and it smells old!</li>
            <li> great lipstick, great color, if you are looking for a very pretty pink!&lt;br /&gt;it goes on smooth, last, doesn&#x27;t smear, and feels great on your lips!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lipstick, it is my favorite that I have!!!</li>

            <li> Love this nice bright pink lipstick, the only lipstick ill keep purchasing, very creamy, just love the way it looks.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice color/shade of pink. I don&#x27;t get where others think this is a &amp;#34;Neon Pink&amp;#34; because no where in the ad does it claim it to be a neon color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty nice shade of pink that looks natural imo.  Not a bad product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied here.</li>
            <li> Lik the color but doesn&#x27;t appear as shown on lips. More of a pale pink. Great moisture. Lips feel great and doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
