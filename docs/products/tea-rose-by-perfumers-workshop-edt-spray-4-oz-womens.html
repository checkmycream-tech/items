            <li>Always a favorite my signature scent</li>
            <li>OK to use before I walk the dogs in the park.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I  really LOVE this</li>
            <li>I purchased the spray for myself last year and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, and it my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>Love wearing it.</li>
            <li>a ROSE in their description, but none of them really has the scent of sitting in a rose garden but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: this stuff is strong.</li>
            <li>A perfect scent of fresh roses that lingers all day long.</li>
            <li>However, use lightly as it can be strong.  </li>
            <li>Tea Rose is a lovely single-flower scent, reminiscent of a rose garden in full bloom on a summer&#x27;s afternoon.  </li>
            <li>a huge bottle for the value....</li>
            <li>Even though I love so many scents, every time I wear this I remember that if I had to live the rest of my life with only one, it would have to be this beautiful oldie-but-goodie.</li>
            <li>litterly just like fresh roses!</li>
            <li>Does not smell like original scent...</li>
            <li>Along with the original, \\&quot;Mystere de Rochas\\&quot; &amp; unspoiled&lt;br /&gt;(by heat)bottles of \\&quot;Il</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Okay, it never cost much.</li>
            <li>guess its true that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like stepping into a walk in fridge full of roses at a florist shop.</li>
            <li>this is my number one favorite perfume no joke :) will always buy this as long as it is available</li>
            <li>OK but simply too overwhelmingly strong.</li>
            <li>Roses really don&#x27;t cost much if you think about it, most roses are not the kind&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Just  ok,next  time I would prefer the real perfume</li>
            <li>Now you are talking to a girl, who drops as much cash on Givenchy, Jean Patou, etc as she likes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This seller may be a wee bit more expensive than some, but the product is genuine, delivered quickly and is well packaged.</li>
            <li>I only experience one thing when I spray on this classic:</li>
            <li>there is none of that artificial rose musk to it!</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE perfume and it is hard to find!!.</li>
            <li>I had years ago was much more subtle and I expected this to be the same.</li>

            <li> My absolute favorite perfume. Difficult to find at times. Awesome scent of roses....</li>
            <li> My wife loves this!  Great natural smelling rose smell.</li>
            <li> Just  ok,next  time I would prefer the real perfume</li>
            <li> loved the perfume, price and lighning quick shipping.  thank you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume!  I only experience one thing when I spray on this classic: an overwhelming enveloping of the most succulent, indulgent, decadent, delicious, luxurious roses I&#x27;ve ever smelled. This, surely, must be what heaven smells like. I have kept this beauty in my collection since I was a teenager, and can&#x27;t imagine going without it. Ever. Even though I love so many scents, every time I wear this I remember that if I had to live the rest of my life with only one, it would have to be this beautiful oldie-but-goodie.</li>
            <li> smells really good love it smells just like a rose.</li>
            <li> This is what roses are supposed to smell like.  I have had so many compliments, when I wear it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Always a favorite my signature scent</li>
            <li> It was perfect and arrived very quick. Thank you for everything.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Great price as well.</li>
            <li> OK but simply too overwhelmingly strong. The tea rose I had years ago was much more subtle and I expected this to be the same. OK to use before I walk the dogs in the park.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume and it is hard to find!!. So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> smells so good! litterly just like fresh roses! there is none of that artificial rose musk to it! and the price was amazing!!! I will deffintaly buy again!</li>
            <li> Smells like a grandma, not a great smell. Does not smell like original scent...</li>
            <li> The very best rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> I  really LOVE this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I meant to put 5 stars, not one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beryl Nyre-Thomas</li>
            <li> Love love love my Tea Rose</li>
            <li> Okay, it never cost much. Roses really don&#x27;t cost much if you think about it, most roses are not the kind&lt;br /&gt;the florist has, they are in gardens all over the world, and they smell and taste great. When I cannot find this&lt;br /&gt;perfume I buy high quality rose-water (edible)not expensive either. I have tried all the pricey designer fragrances&lt;br /&gt;with a ROSE in their description, but none of them really has the scent of sitting in a rose garden but Tea Rose by&lt;br /&gt;The Perfumers Workshop does. Now you are talking to a girl, who drops as much cash on Givenchy, Jean Patou, etc as she likes.&lt;br /&gt;I still feel that this is the best ROSE Perfume (one-note, just rose, but my how beautiful!) By the way if anyone has a&lt;br /&gt;bottle of \\&quot;Benandre\\&quot; squirlled away, I am looking for it. Along with the original, \\&quot;Mystere de Rochas\\&quot; &amp; unspoiled&lt;br /&gt;(by heat)bottles of \\&quot;Il Bacio\\&quot; by Princesse Borghese ( I am using a spoiled bottle as a bathroom spray currently.)</li>
            <li> I feel bad for only giving this 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;although a huge bottle for the value....&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with the smell and that it had no lasting stay.&lt;br /&gt;I guess its true that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! A perfect scent of fresh roses that lingers all day long. My husband loves it on me too!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! I always get compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is a present for my daughter.  I purchased the spray for myself last year and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I wore this fragrance several years ago.  Forgot about it - though I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;A friend was wearing it - smelled so heavenly - asked what it was.&lt;br /&gt;It was!!! Tea Rose!! I had to get some immediately.&lt;br /&gt;If you like roses, it is unbelievably beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> i love it. smells perfect. this is my number one favorite perfume no joke :) will always buy this as long as it is available</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife. She loved it.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery of an excellent item</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and it my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! And so inexpensive for what you&#x27;re getting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes it so brilliant is it&#x27;s simplicity. It&#x27;s like stepping into a walk in fridge full of roses at a florist shop. Just dewy heavenly rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: this stuff is strong. A dab will do you.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, men can rock this. It&#x27;s not just for women.</li>
            <li> I really love Rose scents and this one is about as close as I think you can get.  However, use lightly as it can be strong.  I actually spray it on a handkerchief and run it on my wrists and shoulders.  After airing awhile, it becomes a very nice fragrance.  Love wearing it.</li>
            <li> Tea Rose is a lovely single-flower scent, reminiscent of a rose garden in full bloom on a summer&#x27;s afternoon.  This seller may be a wee bit more expensive than some, but the product is genuine, delivered quickly and is well packaged.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent and get many compliments when wearing it.</li>
