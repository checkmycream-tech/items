            <li>she uses it and very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>My son has been diagnosed with severe eczema and this stuff is the very best.</li>
            <li>This company has great sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>And a great price compared to dermatologist office who recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 10% zinc, so that&#x27;s great protection.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Working great.</li>
            <li>I have been really happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job of protecting my skin from the sun.</li>
            <li>Simply a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Feels great on your skin.  </li>
            <li>it blends into skin easily and had excellent sunblock ingredients</li>
            <li>Just a perfect and quick make up substitute for me!</li>
            <li>All in all, still a good product.</li>
            <li>I still need to cover my face with something, though, and need a good sunblock as well.</li>
            <li>I wear it running and gardening, and my fair skin has never gotten a burn.</li>
            <li>top of the line, its great.</li>
            <li>nice coverage for a sunscreen and feel good on the skin not greasy</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has just the right amount of coverage as well as great SPF number, 47!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell how much I love this product!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and a great price.</li>
            <li>It soaks in easily!</li>
            <li>The great thing about this sunscreen is that it dries very fast, and stays put during activities.  </li>
            <li>it works better than most sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love Elta MD products.  </li>
            <li>I use, and love, EltaMD Sport, but that is a mostly chemical sunscreen, so I was looking for an alternative.  </li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by my aesthetician and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the top sunscreens on the Cosmetics Database.  </li>
            <li>This is the best physical sunscreen I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the coverage, and ensures that my kids shower well after a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>so it was important to me to find something that offered better protection.  </li>
            <li>And this more than fit the bill.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has a great texture, rubs in totally dry, no weird smell or anything, and it&#x27;s got great ingredients.</li>
            <li>This product gives full coverage without being greasy feeling or streaky!</li>
            <li>, I will probably try something else in my endless pursuit of the perfect sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Blends in easily and does not feel greasy or cause break outs.</li>
            <li>has a strong odor to it</li>
            <li>I had a laser procedure on my face and needed a strong non greasy sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been fine.  </li>
            <li>But this works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>My little one is extremely fair skinned and this protected her beautifully in the hot Hawaii sun.  </li>
            <li>Feels light on the face</li>
            <li>Important to me</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and love to spend time outside</li>
            <li>It looked like it was heated up in a hot area and exploded!!</li>
            <li>This is great for outdoor, sweaty, long day wear.  </li>
            <li>Safe and effective, but it is very white and needs to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li>The texture is amazingly light on the skin, it dries quickly, and leaves no greasy feeling or shine.  </li>
            <li>I like this physical sunscreen a lot, it is one of the best I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>: Paints your skin bright white.</li>
            <li>Full coverage</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it at a reasonable rate.</li>
            <li>So lucky Amazon had this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly considering its higher SPF.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care because Im already super white and pasty, but Im extremely happy with how non-irritating this product has been on my sensitive lupus skin.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used the other Elta MD products and have generally found them to be excellent.</li>
            <li>This one has a scent, not beachy at all (that&#x27;s good!), kind of medicinal (that&#x27;s bad), but not too strong in any way.  </li>
            <li>Zinc Oxide based, fragrance free, no stimulants to cause break outs, very even texture and not even greasy.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It might show more on naturally darker skin.  </li>
            <li>However I never have that white cast problem because I make sure to use the right amount and blend it well!</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say I love Elta MD UVA clear 46.</li>
            <li>not sure how anything is chemical free since our universe is made of chemicals, that said, it goes on very nicely and the zinc/titanium doesn&#x27;t leave much residue.</li>
            <li>I use the clear face formula which I love, this not so much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it for more frequent use &amp; wanted the water resistance for cardio use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy mom staying home with three kids, and I rarely need full make up.</li>
            <li>I wanted a higher SPF</li>
            <li>In all honesty Olay&#x27;s facial moisturizer SPF15 feels better and never causes skin irritation</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a quarter of the price, but I want a higher SPF for heavier outdoor days.</li>
            <li>Elta MD is my favorite facial sunscreen of all time!</li>
            <li>We live in an area where the UV index is 11-Extreme every day in the summer, and we go to the pool almost daily, but no one in our family has had a sunburn of any kind using this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the price, but all of the best rated sunscreens are pricey, so I&#x27;m willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, but needs to be rubbed in well to get ride of the white color.  </li>
            <li>it has 9% zinc compared to the 10% with the SPF 47 Pure.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am super happy with this because it has the zinc-based physical protection unlike other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>It really protects my skin from the sun and it does&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It stayed very water resistant as we were in the water for about two hours</li>
            <li>if you really tan, that might be a drawback.  </li>
            <li>but it does its job very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible to get a similar sized product by a well advertised brand for $3 at a local drugstore; but if it&#x27;s going to do more harm than good (e.g. with chemicals that may damage skin), it&#x27;s not worth even that much.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on and does not feel greasy, but it will make ur skin look super white and pasty.</li>
            <li>My kids laughed themselves silly making fun of me.</li>
            <li>Good thing is that is was highly water resistant even in salt water and was long lasting w/o a 2nd application...  </li>
            <li>Yes it does leave a white cast if you put on to much and don&#x27;t blend it right.</li>
            <li>We tried this because of the high rating in the EWG 2012 report but my experience is the following:&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff helps me lead a normal life.  </li>
            <li>Have to be more careful next time.</li>
            <li>I will need to switch back to the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 which has high-purity niacinamide in this oil-free sunscreen helps calm and protect sensitive skin types prone to acne, rosacea and discoloration</li>
            <li>I meant to purchase UV Clear.</li>
            <li>This is actually one of the few products that I have been able to find that offers these ingredients.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face  and chest( I am 42 years old)</li>
            <li>I purchase it directly at Kaiser now.</li>
            <li>It stays on incredbley well but is difficult to remove in the shower without a good scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>I came across a recommendation of this product for it&#x27;s overall protectant power (overall grade for helping without hurting) and never expected it to cure me of my dread for sunscreen (face and body) but that&#x27;s exactly what it did!  </li>
            <li>Purchased for backpacking and hiking in high mountains, knowing that it may leave some white residue on my face.</li>
            <li>I wanted the other kind by the same company, which is thinner and has less chemicals.</li>
            <li>So, why spending a lot of money on this sunblock when a much cheaper one can do the same thing: make your face white and NOT prevent sunburns?</li>
            <li>it is a broad spectrum sunblock.  </li>
            <li>If you dread wearing sunscreen because it feels heavy and sticky, makes your face appear oily or white, requires multiple re-applications, or the like, you might be in for a surprise with your first try of EltaMD SPF 47.  </li>

            <li> it is a broad spectrum sunblock.  </li>

            <li> I already used three tubes, and I still live on this thing everyday.</li>
            <li> I use my basic skin care products, then put this on, and finish with loose powder.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a pale, sensitive skin kid.</li>
            <li> I still wear a hat and avoid the sun whenever possible, but it&#x27;s impossible to avoid the sun altogether and this keeps me safe.  </li>
            <li> It does, however, leave a slight but noticeable white cast when used on the face so I will be using this on my neck, decolletage, and hands on a daily basis and find another formula for the face.</li>
            <li> It does show up a little white after you jump in water, but not enough to bother me overmuch.  </li>
            <li> The white-ness is not apparent but I have a very pale complexion naturally.  </li>
            <li> It irritated my skin so much, it was horrible, especially because I was supposed to be enjoying my vacation.</li>
            <li> Not like having a heavy make up, but not like bare face, either.</li>
            <li> It leaves a little more of a white cast than the other EltaMD sunscreens (the rest of the line leaves zero white cast), but it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin on face, neck and chest very dry and rough and increased clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> They said I looked like I just came back from the dead.</li>
            <li> I am not a very tan person, however, so</li>
            <li> The order came sooner than expected</li>
            <li> This product is too white for me to use on my face and I am pale skinned.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a dud, but I&#x27;m not willing to try again.</li>
            <li> For the face, if you mix in a little concealer the sunscreen is barely noticeable visually, and does not feel icky in the least (in fact, you don&#x27;t feel this sunscreen on your skin at all).</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that there is not a face stick for the face.</li>
            <li> If you rub it in very very thoroughly it&#x27;s not as bad but still a bit whitish.</li>
            <li> I also think it&#x27;s a little too thick for face application even though is says for face and body.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get off</li>
            <li> I prefer physical sunscreens because they seem less greasy and don&#x27;t stain clothes that horrible yellow color.  </li>
            <li> no icky, dangerous, weird ingredients.</li>
            <li> That would have been not good but acceptable on the trail in the wilderness.</li>
            <li> Not good for anything</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) difficult to absorb&lt;br /&gt;2) dries skin out&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;3) difficult to wash out later&lt;</li>
            <li> It will be very difficult to make it disappear from of anything with hair (eyebrows, beard, etc) and difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> Disappointing given the cost of this one.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning without fail!</li>
            <li> Too bad this product clogged my pores...</li>
            <li> It also burns really bad when I exercise</li>
            <li> It smells so bad.</li>
            <li> It feels awful on my skin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> literally recommended by my dermatologist. not sure how anything is chemical free since our universe is made of chemicals, that said, it goes on very nicely and the zinc/titanium doesn&#x27;t leave much residue. seems to keep the sunburn away too.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly! Too bad this product clogged my pores...</li>
            <li> I chose this product because my dermatologist sells it in his office. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. It irritated my skin so much, it was horrible, especially because I was supposed to be enjoying my vacation. I would recommend getting a sample before purchasing the actual product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, and she can only apply this on her body, although it said &amp;#34;face and body&amp;#34;.  The white film does not disappear.  It just stays white on the face.  Yuck!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was &amp;#34;UV Pure&amp;#34;...I meant to purchase UV Clear. This goes on a bit thicker, but it still provides the protection I was looking for. All in all, still a good product.</li>
            <li> nice coverage for a sunscreen and feel good on the skin not greasy</li>
            <li> My Immunologist recommended this sunscreen to me when I was having severe skin issues. I bought this sunscreen and like 4 others from Amazon and the Elta MD was the only one that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out and flare up. This sunscreen goes on and does not feel greasy, but it will make ur skin look super white and pasty. I don&#x27;t care because Im already super white and pasty, but Im extremely happy with how non-irritating this product has been on my sensitive lupus skin. U got urself a customer for life!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible to get a similar sized product by a well advertised brand for $3 at a local drugstore; but if it&#x27;s going to do more harm than good (e.g. with chemicals that may damage skin), it&#x27;s not worth even that much. If you dread wearing sunscreen because it feels heavy and sticky, makes your face appear oily or white, requires multiple re-applications, or the like, you might be in for a surprise with your first try of EltaMD SPF 47.  I know I was.  After trying myriad brands and types, I resigned myself to the dread.  I came across a recommendation of this product for it&#x27;s overall protectant power (overall grade for helping without hurting) and never expected it to cure me of my dread for sunscreen (face and body) but that&#x27;s exactly what it did!  For the face, if you mix in a little concealer the sunscreen is barely noticeable visually, and does not feel icky in the least (in fact, you don&#x27;t feel this sunscreen on your skin at all).</li>
            <li> Purchased for backpacking and hiking in high mountains, knowing that it may leave some white residue on my face. That would have been not good but acceptable on the trail in the wilderness. What is not acceptable that it actually did not work as advertised: I got sunburns on my face, arms and hands. So, why spending a lot of money on this sunblock when a much cheaper one can do the same thing: make your face white and NOT prevent sunburns?</li>
            <li> Pros: Can&#x27;t feel it on your skin, no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Paints your skin bright white. If you rub it in very very thoroughly it&#x27;s not as bad but still a bit whitish. It will be very difficult to make it disappear from of anything with hair (eyebrows, beard, etc) and difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell how much I love this product! I already used three tubes, and I still live on this thing everyday. I&#x27;m a busy mom staying home with three kids, and I rarely need full make up. I still need to cover my face with something, though, and need a good sunblock as well. This sunscreen has just the right amount of coverage as well as great SPF number, 47! Zinc Oxide based, fragrance free, no stimulants to cause break outs, very even texture and not even greasy. I use my basic skin care products, then put this on, and finish with loose powder. Not like having a heavy make up, but not like bare face, either. Just a perfect and quick make up substitute for me!</li>
            <li> This company has great sunscreens.  Although you do need to rub it in so it&#x27;s not so white it works better than most sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. I am fair skinned and love to spend time outside so it was important to me to find something that offered better protection.  This product contains zinc oxide and titanium dioxide which is key to protect against UVA rays which will cause wrinkles.  This is actually one of the few products that I have been able to find that offers these ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was trying to save some money by using this product on my face and body since its got the highest SPF.  Only issue I have with is that I am breaking out after using it.  Seems to be clogging my pores.  I will need to switch back to the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 which has high-purity niacinamide in this oil-free sunscreen helps calm and protect sensitive skin types prone to acne, rosacea and discoloration it has 9% zinc compared to the 10% with the SPF 47 Pure.</li>
            <li> no icky, dangerous, weird ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen.  And a great price compared to dermatologist office who recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. Yes it does leave a white cast if you put on to much and don&#x27;t blend it right. However I never have that white cast problem because I make sure to use the right amount and blend it well!</li>
            <li> I love Elta MD products.  I wanted a higher SPF so I tried the 47.  It made my skin on face, neck and chest very dry and rough and increased clogged pores.  It also burns really bad when I exercise and it gets into my eyes.  Will be trying the formula SPF specifically for face.  In all honesty Olay&#x27;s facial moisturizer SPF15 feels better and never causes skin irritation and it&#x27;s a quarter of the price, but I want a higher SPF for heavier outdoor days.</li>
            <li> Elta MD is my favorite facial sunscreen of all time!</li>
            <li> I use, and love, EltaMD Sport, but that is a mostly chemical sunscreen, so I was looking for an alternative.  This is great for outdoor, sweaty, long day wear.  It leaves a little more of a white cast than the other EltaMD sunscreens (the rest of the line leaves zero white cast), but it&#x27;s not too bad.  The great thing about this sunscreen is that it dries very fast, and stays put during activities.  It&#x27;s 10% zinc, so that&#x27;s great protection.  I wear it running and gardening, and my fair skin has never gotten a burn.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say I love Elta MD UVA clear 46. It&#x27;s my go-to for my face. But I bought this in a moment of cheapness, and had to return it. It smells so bad. Not fragrance-y, unless &amp;#34;butt&amp;#34; counts as a fragrance these days. These products are not interchangeable! Maybe I got a dud, but I&#x27;m not willing to try again. Caveat emptor!</li>
            <li> love this product.  it blends into skin easily and had excellent sunblock ingredients</li>
            <li> went on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;effective sun block-  will repurchase !</li>
            <li> Works great. Full coverage and it&#x27;s very it is a broad spectrum sunblock.  I wear it when I play tennis.</li>
            <li> Just what the Doctor ordered and was&lt;br /&gt;able to have them&lt;br /&gt;Delivered to my vacation location&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a pale, sensitive skin kid. Working great. Neutrogena was not working at all. Only complaint is that there is not a face stick for the face.</li>
            <li> It was purchased for my wife. she uses it and very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years.  My Doctor recommended it and sold it out of her office.  Naturally at a more expensive price.  I was glad to find it at a reasonable rate.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my aesthetician and I absolutely love it.  It really protects my skin from the sun and it does&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> My son has been diagnosed with severe eczema and this stuff is the very best. worth every penny.  I also use it on my face  and chest( I am 42 years old) and it does not cause breakouts.  is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m giving this a 1 star rating is do to the condition the bottle was delivered. It looked like it was heated up in a hot area and exploded!! The bottle was streaked all over from the leaked sun screen. I purchase it directly at Kaiser now.</li>
            <li> I have skin lupus and I have to avoid the sun.  This stuff helps me lead a normal life.  Because it provides a PHYSICAL barrier, it has protected me on the times when I have to go out in the sun and I&#x27;ve been fine.  I still wear a hat and avoid the sun whenever possible, but it&#x27;s impossible to avoid the sun altogether and this keeps me safe.  I have been really happy with this product.  I use this one for my body and another Elta MD for my face.  I just got the lotion which moisturizes and provides SPF.  Overall, I am super happy with this because it has the zinc-based physical protection unlike other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of protecting my skin from the sun. Safe and effective, but it is very white and needs to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a combination lotion and sunscreen.  It feels awful on my skin so I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li> On a recent vacation,my family took surfing lessons. I used the Elta 47 sunblock and the product worked as advertised. I purchased it because I wanted a safer sunscreen. It stayed very water resistant as we were in the water for about two hours and I did not burn. The problem with the product is that it goes on very white and does&lt;br /&gt;not sink into the skin so you look like a spirit. My kids laughed themselves silly making fun of me. They said I looked like I just came back from the dead. Ha Ha</li>
            <li> This product gives full coverage without being greasy feeling or streaky! It soaks in easily! I will repurchase this product!</li>
            <li> I wanted the other kind by the same company, which is thinner and has less chemicals. Have to be more careful next time.</li>
            <li> Simply a great sunscreen. Blends in easily and does not feel greasy or cause break outs. I use it every morning without fail!</li>
            <li> I use the clear face formula which I love, this not so much. Disappointing given the cost of this one.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a great texture, rubs in totally dry, no weird smell or anything, and it&#x27;s got great ingredients. It&#x27;s one of the top sunscreens on the Cosmetics Database.  We live in an area where the UV index is 11-Extreme every day in the summer, and we go to the pool almost daily, but no one in our family has had a sunburn of any kind using this sunscreen.  It definitely works!  It does show up a little white after you jump in water, but not enough to bother me overmuch.  I am not a very tan person, however, so if you really tan, that might be a drawback.  My only complaint is the price, but all of the best rated sunscreens are pricey, so I&#x27;m willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li> Feels light on the face</li>
            <li> This is the best physical sunscreen I have ever tried.  The texture is amazingly light on the skin, it dries quickly, and leaves no greasy feeling or shine.  On a recent vacation I used this on both myself and my toddler.  My little one is extremely fair skinned and this protected her beautifully in the hot Hawaii sun.  It does, however, leave a slight but noticeable white cast when used on the face so I will be using this on my neck, decolletage, and hands on a daily basis and find another formula for the face.</li>
            <li> This product is too white for me to use on my face and I am pale skinned.  Not good for anything but the pool or lake.  I really wanted it for more frequent use &amp; wanted the water resistance for cardio use.  It is hard to get off but I did find that putting some olive oil on my face, with a square cotton piece, before my facial cleanser gets it off. The container states &#x27;transparent zinc oxide&#x27; but it is anything but transparent.  I also think it&#x27;s a little too thick for face application even though is says for face and body.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> top of the line, its great. Its a must have!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorit sunscreen, it was recommended by my kids Dermatologist because the over-the-counter brands gave them a rash.  It goes on easily, but needs to be rubbed in well to get ride of the white color.  It stays on incredbley well but is difficult to remove in the shower without a good scrubbing.  I love the coverage, and ensures that my kids shower well after a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used the other Elta MD products and have generally found them to be excellent. We tried this because of the high rating in the EWG 2012 report but my experience is the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) difficult to absorb&lt;br /&gt;2) dries skin out&lt;br /&gt;3) difficult to wash out later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to give something else a shot.</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen I use!</li>
            <li> This is one of the cleanest UV products on the market. Goes on smoothly considering its higher SPF. Only problem is that it clung to my eyebrows and facial stubble unknowingly and made me look ghostly in all of my recent Hawaii vacation photos.  Good thing is that is was highly water resistant even in salt water and was long lasting w/o a 2nd application...  Important to me considering that I have Vitiligo.  No scent, another plus!</li>
            <li> I love this.  Feels great on your skin.  I am allergic to suncreen and any product that says SPF# on it.  But this works just fine.  Fantastic product and a great price.</li>
            <li> has a strong odor to it but it does its job very well would buy again</li>
            <li> The order came sooner than expected a plus. I had a laser procedure on my face and needed a strong non greasy sunscreen. And this more than fit the bill. In order for any sunscreen product to  work the zinc oxide has to be over 4% this was told to me by a dermatologist . So lucky Amazon had this product.</li>
            <li> I like this physical sunscreen a lot, it is one of the best I have tried so far.  I prefer physical sunscreens because they seem less greasy and don&#x27;t stain clothes that horrible yellow color.  This one has a scent, not beachy at all (that&#x27;s good!), kind of medicinal (that&#x27;s bad), but not too strong in any way.  It does leave a whitish cast to your skin.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face for that reason.  I use it on my upper chest and back of my neck every day.  The white-ness is not apparent but I have a very pale complexion naturally.  It might show more on naturally darker skin.  I don&#x27;t think it fully functions as spf 47 on me, but I might not apply enough because of the whiteness.  I don&#x27;t know if I will order it again, I will probably try something else in my endless pursuit of the perfect sunscreen.</li>
