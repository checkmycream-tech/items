            <li> Best product in the market. Saw results instantaneously. Hair became strong, Shiny thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> Great product! I don&#x27;t like to put a lot of stuff in my hair, but I was getting a lot of split ends.  It was recommended to me by the lady that cuts my hair.  Works great!  No split ends so far!  It&#x27;s been over 6 months since my last hair cut!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used,my hair used to break and I had lots of spilt ends. Now my hair is healthy,no more split ends and growing very beautifully. I recommend this product to anyone and everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> leaves my hair very soft and moisturizes , protects my hair</li>
            <li> It works wonders for my hair. It restored it back to the way I had it. A must have for anyone with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I am seeing some results but I have only used it for a couple of weeks.  Let&#x27;s see how it continues to work!  I use it 2 x a week.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product smells. Not sure if it is working because I haven&#x27;t been using it that long. It&#x27;s kind of oily when you first apply but it absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This whole product line is good. It does wonders for your hair and scalp. I love UNA, especially their Oxygenating Drops.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for few years now</li>
            <li> Product was expired ..I have use this . Product for few year...this is the first time I order this product online...didnt even smell like usual ..smelled like nothing</li>
            <li> The first I used this product  I was amazed. My hair looks nice n shiny. I intend to use more of it now n in the future.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me through my hair stylist and I&#x27;ve never stopped using it between hair washes.&lt;br /&gt;It burns a little when you apply it at first but then it subsides and becomes rather soothing. Best results would be to towel dry and set your hair with rollers then a few drops directly to the scalp.  You&#x27;ll see a difference in less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> This has helped my hair so much! I wash my hair, towel dry it, then I put five drops of this to the left and right of my hair (parted down the middle). Right after I blow dry it and if feels so healthy and nourished. Who knew a few drops could make so much difference.</li>
            <li> Dont be fool people , ive tried this producy before and this is not the real one .</li>
            <li> I have used these products for years and they are still great products</li>
            <li> I have try several different hair products and this has been the best one so far!, I almost cut my hair do to the dry ends and after using this product for two weeks I had no need anymore :)</li>
            <li> My family and I love the UNA products</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It does strenghten brittle hair but it also has protein in it which can cause your hair to break if used too often without a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Did not se any results, sorry waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great seller, no problems</li>
