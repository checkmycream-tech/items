            <li> Was extremely disappointed in the size of the products I ordered. They appeared much, much larger in the photos, when in reality, the products are actually so small that it&#x27;s inconvenient to use them for their intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as if this gives me as much coverage as using a brush does, maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly.. does leave a more natural look though</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these! Best beauty blenders I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> Love the soft feeling of this sponge and how flawless it makes my foundation and concealer look. I use it damp to blend my liquid foundation and my concealer.</li>
            <li> My order was correct but a little disappointed with the outcome. I did exactly as the directions say for best results and it still doesn&#x27;t make my foundation look smooth(flawless). I was expecting it to cover much better.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new beauty products. I love trying new things on my face. When I found this Beauty Sponge Blender Duo by Flawless Face Art, I knew that it was something that I had to try out. These sponges are amazing, they are so soft yet sturdy and firm. They are the perfect combo for putting your makeup on. The softness of the sponge makes for a smooth finish on your makeup with no spots that are uneven. I have never used a sponge that worked as well as this one did. This would make for an amazing gift for that girl starting college, or for any woman that wears makeup for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>

            <li> These are the best beauty blenders I have purchased! They are smaller and perfect to blend in your T-zone area. They&#x27;re also very soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> In my pictures I&#x27;m showing how much I love these sponges! A couple differences from others I&#x27;ve used I noticed right off the bat are-- 1/. They are soft like a pillow 2/. They are pounced as opposed to rubbed. 3/. They feel like they&#x27;ll last even with rinsing and mild soap cleaning. 4/. The shape. The point gets into tight spaces like around my eyes easily. 5/. 2 sizes-- small for concealer and larger for foundation blending perfectly without imperfections. A great set of sponges I highly recommend for any makeup artist -- home use of professional use they are wonderful. Great quality and price too&lt;br /&gt;My honest review</li>
            <li> These are fantastic Sponge Blenders!  I rinse out the sponge with water, squeeze out the excess water, and pat dry on  hand towel.  I use the black one for apply my foundation by lightly tapping on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any streaking or make my face feel like or have appearance of the my makeup being caked on.  The pink one I use for concealer and contouring.  Flawless Face Art created two very good sponges.  The sponges are soft, the shapes are fantastic to get in small areas around the eyes, and it leaves a perfect matte finish.  The clean up is easy.  I just use water and a little antibacterial soap, rinse thoroughly, and leave them out to dry.  #1 Best Beauty Sponges Blenders and truly what the name says.  This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided.   All thought and opinions are my own and are not influenced by anyone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these sponges! Let me begin by saying that I was a little skeptical about purchasing beauty blenders online because I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the quality of them, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance. These sponges blend my liquid foundation and concealer so well! They&#x27;re great quality for less $$. I do wish they were a bit larger in size for a faster application but the small size helps with the smaller angles on my face. I use an old perfume bottle filled with water to spray/wet the sponges for a flawless application. I recommend this product. Worth every penny :)</li>
            <li>  I chose to go with a brand-name because I believed that the good quality will pay off. But to my dissatisfaction, it turned out to be a piece of junk — had torn after its very first cleaning</li>

This little set has a large and small size sponge, for concealer or foundation, contouring, or anything you could possibly need to blend to a flawless finish. They feel silky and of great quality, and they are easy to wash out with bar soap or makeup remover. I would recommend anyone add this to their beauty routine! I received this product in exchange for my honest review, all thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> Very good product and the delivery time was as promised.  Keep up the good work!</li>
