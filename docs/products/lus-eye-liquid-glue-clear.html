            <li>Best lash glue of them all</li>
            <li>The BEST discovery I made.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I cant read the writing on the packaging as it is from another country, however this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>holds up for 8 hours and then washed it off when I came home, great buy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>This one good for repairs because it&#x27;s almost invisible but on its own</li>
            <li>Thank you for making it available!!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>it works great ty holds very well good product for price will buy again happy my lashes look gorgeous :)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Have used this glue for years and have not found a better glue.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love love love this product</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY eyelash glues and NONE have worked as well as LUS, including DUO, Revlon, STAR, Darkness, Kiss, Ardell, etc.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Duo is a much better product than Lus.</li>
            <li>Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Hands down best eyelash glue ever.</li>
            <li>good thing is that it will last all day and all night.</li>
            <li>The black one is good for eyeliner use, not so much for eye lid or eyelashes in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for both putting on false eyelashes and create perfect double eye</li>
            <li>but what a differance this makes hooded lids dissapear when applied right.</li>
            <li>It might hurt if you use it for your eyelid so be aware of the stickiness.</li>
            <li>Spend a bit more for another brand that actually works.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than 4 years (it was called Sunku before, and the packaging was almost the same except it was in Korean).</li>
            <li>Either of these products will make removing the glue very easy and both products are cheap, lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li>It is also hard to get off with water, which is good, but it comes off correctly with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>really do hope they never discontinue this product because I will die!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff is light-weight but very durable and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Works great for false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this happened, but when I finally was able to unscrew the top off</li>
            <li>I used to be a long time user of clear eye glue because i have hooded eyes on just my left eye, so I&#x27;m pretty experienced in different brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was extremely fast, it only took 2 business days for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s my favorite makeup tool for daily use.</li>
            <li>glue is SUPER sticky, now this is a good and bad thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it dries clear.  </li>
            <li>This product has no odor and dries quickly to CLEAR.</li>
            <li>The stuff is a translucent (bluish) when applied then dries clear.</li>
            <li>it is VERY sticky but that should be expected from a high quality adhesive.</li>
            <li>I used to get mine in Taiwan, which is where I&#x27;m from, but since I&#x27;ve moved to New York for college I&#x27;ve been trying out different brands.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of eye lid glue in the past (koki eyetalk, darkness, etc.), for some reason only this one will hold my double eyelids in place!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kind of difficult to take off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before, takes a little practice to get it right</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not long lasting try it yourself.</li>

            <li> Well it is super sticky but of course it&#x27;s for false lashes</li>
            <li> ; turns into white goo when dry; hard to clean off; I am completely not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to try it because when I opened it, 90% of the glue was dried.</li>
            <li> so I could see the brush, the product was all dried and the brush didn&#x27;t pull out any of the liquid glue.</li>
            <li> Do not use often because it&#x27;s a small amount.</li>
            <li> used to buy it in the focus plaza in San Gabriel, but unfortunately they were sold out when I need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really difficult when trying to get it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and this was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> bad thing is that it is difficult to remove without oil based products.</li>

            <li> Well it is super sticky but of course it&#x27;s for false lashes so I could see why. It might hurt if you use it for your eyelid so be aware of the stickiness. The shipping was arrived on time. Do not use often because it&#x27;s a small amount. It&#x27;s also kind of difficult to take off. Use makeup remover! Overall just reapply every 5 hours of your using it for your eyelid. It was an okay but for me.</li>
            <li> Hands down best eyelash glue ever.</li>
            <li> It lasts and stays sticky all day. It is also hard to get off with water, which is good, but it comes off correctly with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Have used this glue for years and have not found a better glue.&lt;br /&gt;This glue is SUPER sticky, now this is a good and bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that it will last all day and all night. I have even gone to the waterpark with falsies on and the stayed on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is that it is difficult to remove without oil based products. The solution to this problem is simple, use BABY OIL or VASELINE. Either of these products will make removing the glue very easy and both products are cheap, lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product</li>
            <li> Does not stick well; turns into white goo when dry; hard to clean off; I am completely not satisfied with this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money here. Spend a bit more for another brand that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 4 years (it was called Sunku before, and the packaging was almost the same except it was in Korean).

            <li> i&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of eye lid glue in the past (koki eyetalk, darkness, etc.), for some reason only this one will hold my double eyelids in place!!  it dries clear.  i do need to have an oil based eye makeup remover in order for it to come off though.  I&#x27;ve been using Lus eye liquid glue for almost 3 years now.</li>
            <li> Works great for false eyelashes. Lashes stay on all day with no lifting or touch ups needed.</li>
            <li> Best lash glue of them all and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product lol</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!! I have tried MANY eyelash glues and NONE have worked as well as LUS, including DUO, Revlon, STAR, Darkness, Kiss, Ardell, etc. This product has no odor and dries quickly to CLEAR. I wore my eyelashes in the pool and they didn&#x27;t even budge! PRE-WARNING it is VERY sticky but that should be expected from a high quality adhesive. To remove I use eyelash glue remover or makeup remover oil/wipes (Neutrogena works best).&lt;br /&gt;I really do hope they never discontinue this product because I will die!!&lt;br /&gt;I will repeat order again and again and again for this product! Thank you for making it available!!</li>
            <li> Love this! My favorite brand. Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> This one good for repairs because it&#x27;s almost invisible but on its own it&#x27;s not long lasting try it yourself.</li>
            <li> I cant read the writing on the packaging as it is from another country, however this stuff is great. The stuff is a translucent (bluish) when applied then dries clear. It has an applicator brush.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Did not return.</li>
            <li> it works great ty holds very well good product for price will buy again happy my lashes look gorgeous :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to try it because when I opened it, 90% of the glue was dried. I&#x27;m not sure why this happened, but when I finally was able to unscrew the top off so I could see the brush, the product was all dried and the brush didn&#x27;t pull out any of the liquid glue.

            <li> Duo is a much better product than Lus.</li>
            <li> I used to be a long time user of clear eye glue because i have hooded eyes on just my left eye, so I&#x27;m pretty experienced in different brands. I used to get mine in Taiwan, which is where I&#x27;m from, but since I&#x27;ve moved to New York for college I&#x27;ve been trying out different brands. This glue does the job but it&#x27;s really difficult when trying to get it off. I&#x27;ve used both oil and water based eye makeup remover to take it off but it leaves residue and often leaves my eyelids irritable and red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, takes a little practice to get it right but what a differance this makes hooded lids dissapear when applied right. holds up for 8 hours and then washed it off when I came home, great buy.</li>
            <li> The BEST discovery I made. This stuff is light-weight but very durable and lasts all day. I love it!</li>
