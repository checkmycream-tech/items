            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The lotion has a nice feel to it, however, for the price I need to see some advantage.  </li>
            <li>If you are really concerned with taking the best care of your skin that you can, this is not a product to skip.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t shop around to really know better because I was very satisfied!!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, amazing</li>
            <li>My under eye area is naturally blueish because of my fair skin and this helped a LOT, and I am not a smoker, but had fine lines around my lips and corners of the eyes (smiling a LOT!!!)</li>
            <li>Love this product and this far Amazon has the best price !!!</li>
            <li>I will note, I have spoken to others who have used this product and have been pleased....</li>
            <li>are better but still have the rash.  </li>
            <li>After reading more about vit c</li>
            <li>I also feel it does brighten the skin and contribute to better texture.  </li>
            <li>Revision&#x27;s 30% Vitamin C Lotion is the next best thing out there and does not have the drawbacks of hydroquinone.</li>
            <li>Unlike hydroquninone, Revision&#x27;s Vitamin C lotion is safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, during summer months, for people who are out in the sun a lot, does not require a prescription, and can be used without having to take time off.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist  sells this for a lot more</li>
            <li>, I was totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I think i like liquid vit c better as i have used that for years.</li>
            <li>And love what it does for my complexion.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will continue to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 5/21/15&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that after 6 months of continuous use I can see the difference in my skintone and firmness of my skin, this product has improved my skin so much that I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup anymore</li>
            <li>I really really love this stuff</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have heard about this product</li>
            <li>I have used Brands of Vitamin C Lotion from the grocery store that are much better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times that happens.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to absorb it better than the Obagi serum.</li>
            <li>As for effectiveness, I am 62 and receive many compliments on my skin&#x27;s smoothness.</li>
            <li>I do love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li>and I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>My skin looks bright and fresh.</li>
            <li>Got our first bottle from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office and got more to replenish supply!  </li>
            <li>It works very well ion my completion and noticeably reduces the appearances of lines and wrinkles and my completion looks smooth, clear and great!</li>
            <li>The price here at amazon is fantastic compared to what I paid at the derm.</li>
            <li>Too early to see any difference, but will it is a good quality product.</li>
            <li>I am 45, fair skinned and have never worn makeup, my skin is not sensitive to most products</li>
            <li>It needs to be used for more than a week, even better if more than two, but it seems to do what the aesthetician says - actually enable skin to boost collagen production.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!  </li>
            <li>First I just love the way it has corrected my tone</li>
            <li>It was originally @$55 and has increased to $77.</li>
            <li>Im pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I put it on a clean face before anything else.</li>
            <li>This is a particularly high concentration of a stable form vitamin C, which is helpful for evening out skin tone and discoloration and most importantly (to me) protecting the skin from sun damage and premature aging.</li>
            <li>2x per day REALLY improved the appearance of my skin, more glow, tighter, diminished wrinkles &amp; plumper.....especially around lips and under eyes.  </li>
            <li>This product absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and has not clogged my pores.  </li>
            <li>It has lightened my acne scars dramatically, improved the look of my pores and my skin looks more soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The price seems high, but it is a 30% concentrate, most are 10% to 15%.  </li>
            <li>There is no need to put it in a bigger bottle and justify charging more money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>I feel it is worth having.  </li>
            <li>So many Vitamin C&#x27;s are sold in clear containers which damages the anti-oxidant chemicals.</li>
            <li>The airless pump combined with the encapsulation of the vitamin C ensures that your last use is as effective as your first.</li>
            <li>and this really helped!  </li>
            <li>Much safer to use than hydroquinone!</li>
            <li>Just started using for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I first used LaRochey Posse vitamin C at 30% and the company stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>I cannot comment on the product&#x27;s ability to reverse wrinkles, as I&#x27;m only on my second bottle of it and my skin is in pretty good condition right now (in my 30s).</li>
            <li>and it really has improved the quality and health of my skin.</li>
            <li>product was recommended &amp; it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I cant really tell at the moment because i have not see any change on my skin having said that</li>
            <li>, i believe its early days and as times go on, i might be able to tell what the cream actually do for me.</li>
            <li>He also told me this product has the highest percentage for vitamin C most other products are lower.  </li>
            <li>You only use a small amount but feels great.</li>
            <li>My main problem was knocking over the bottle and having the serum run out.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps, my expectations were too high, but I am not seeing the results.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using a vitamin C Lotion on your skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered from Amazon because it was simply more convenient and the price was a little lower.</li>
            <li>you should wait about a week before using Vit c or any new product.  </li>
            <li>The technology Revision uses provides one of the highest concentrations of vitamin C available, and uses a delivery system that maintains the efficacy of the vitamin C for far longer than any other vitamin C product out that.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for at least 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li>I use revision produts regularly and really like.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling nourished and soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve saw my tone this even since my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I recently did a glycolic peel 20% on my face one evening and then applied this the next 3 mornings (first time user).  </li>
            <li>It a light cream with a pump (no more spills).</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years and only recently found that I could purchase it through Amazon for much less cost!  </li>
            <li>Just bought some Kinearase Extreme Lift Eye (expensive, but rated one of the best) to try along with this, if that doesn&#x27;t pan out, the other highly rated product is only $18-ish Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle, Eye, 0.5 Ounce.</li>
            <li>I expected more results from a 30% Vitamin C product, compared to other lines, such as PCA&#x27;s 20%, this falls short on performance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since learned you should increase percentage slowly to your skin and 30% is pretty high also after doing any peel</li>
            <li>, I realize that is not long</li>
            <li>I am in my late 20&#x27;s, black and I have mild to moderate pigmentation issues with oily skin and large pores.</li>

            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s, black and I have mild to moderate pigmentation issues with oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li> I have normal to slightly oily skin with occasional hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> By the third night I developed an itchy, red rash w little bumps.  </li>
            <li> Kept my melasma away during my 2nd pregnancy &amp; got rid of old melasma from my previous pregnancy.</li>
            <li> and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this particular product though.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C  oxidizes the moment it hits air, rendering it all but useless after a few months, so any jar or serum bottle will deteriorate the vitamin C from the very first time you open it.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product daily for a few years.</li>
            <li> You use very little and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, so one star down for that.</li>
            <li> so be careful!!  </li>
            <li> It goes on very dry and one pump hardly covers half your face.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not uncommon for people to develop a rash w topical Vit c</li>
            <li> It has helped even out my skin tone, helps keep it firm and minimise wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Using just a small amount</li>
            <li> I do think it helps with my melasma or at least evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous</li>
            <li> I will finish the bottle and if there is a dramatic change, I will repost.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not see any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a bad product</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in Revision Vitamin C Lotion 30%.</li>

            <li> Love this product and this far Amazon has the best price !!!</li>
            <li> Got our first bottle from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office and got more to replenish supply!  Using just a small amount 2x per day REALLY improved the appearance of my skin, more glow, tighter, diminished wrinkles &amp; plumper.....especially around lips and under eyes.  I am 45, fair skinned and have never worn makeup, my skin is not sensitive to most products but I cannot get a result from a lot of products.  My under eye area is naturally blueish because of my fair skin and this helped a LOT, and I am not a smoker, but had fine lines around my lips and corners of the eyes (smiling a LOT!!!) and this really helped!  It needs to be used for more than a week, even better if more than two, but it seems to do what the aesthetician says - actually enable skin to boost collagen production.  I do also use a retinol product in the evenings 2-3x per week which likely helped aid in the effectiveness of this product.  Just bought some Kinearase Extreme Lift Eye (expensive, but rated one of the best) to try along with this, if that doesn&#x27;t pan out, the other highly rated product is only $18-ish Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle, Eye, 0.5 Ounce.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about two months ago and it really has improved the quality and health of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great addition to the skin care line!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a wonderful product. I ordered 2 and when I opened the 2nd bottle, it was smashed.  I will return it next week.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and I have used it for almost 4 weeks and I do not see any difference in my skin.  Perhaps, my expectations were too high, but I am not seeing the results.  The lotion has a nice feel to it, however, for the price I need to see some advantage.  I will finish the bottle and if there is a dramatic change, I will repost.  I will note, I have spoken to others who have used this product and have been pleased....</li>
            <li> Superb product to diminish fine lines or wrinkles .  I have used it for many years and only recently found that I could purchase it through Amazon for much less cost!  This product has 30% Vitamin C.  I have not seen another product on the market with 30% Vitamin C !!!!!</li>
            <li> I recently did a glycolic peel 20% on my face one evening and then applied this the next 3 mornings (first time user).  By the third night I developed an itchy, red rash w little bumps.  I&#x27;ve stopped using it for 2 days now and redness and itchiness are better but still have the rash.  I&#x27;m assuming I have contact dermatitis and am calling my dermatologist today.  After reading more about vit c I&#x27;ve since learned you should increase percentage slowly to your skin and 30% is pretty high also after doing any peel you should wait about a week before using Vit c or any new product.  Also it&#x27;s not uncommon for people to develop a rash w topical Vit c so be careful!!  Just hoping these bumps go away soon!!  Giving it just 3 stars bc obviously my skin does not like it!!</li>
            <li> The 30% Revision Vitamin C lotion helps brighten my skin and I would like to see how it looks after 60 days of use.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!  Kept my melasma away during my 2nd pregnancy &amp; got rid of old melasma from my previous pregnancy. Much safer to use than hydroquinone!</li>
            <li> I started using this product at the reference of my dermatologist.  I was told that vitamin C helps with building collegen and over time will help minimize the aging process.  He also told me this product has the highest percentage for vitamin C most other products are lower.  I didn&#x27;t shop around to really know better because I was very satisfied!!  However, there is research out there regarding the benefits of applying vitamin C.  I started using this when I was 46 and I have been using it for about one year.  This product absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and has not clogged my pores.  I use it before moisturizer in the morning.  I don&#x27;r use it at night because I use a retinol product (same company) before moisturizer as an evening routine.  I also feel it does brighten the skin and contribute to better texture.  I ran out for a while and noticed a difference.  I ordered from Amazon because it was simply more convenient and the price was a little lower. If you are really concerned with taking the best care of your skin that you can, this is not a product to skip.  Do the research on vitamin C, read the info from the company on product and even the reviews, talk to your dermatologist...but get it!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is intended to be used as a treatment, to supplement your existing skin care routine, not as a moisturizer like another reviewer implies.  Hydroquinone is the gold standard for skin lightening ingredients, but many people shy away from using it for a variety of reasons. Revision&#x27;s 30% Vitamin C Lotion is the next best thing out there and does not have the drawbacks of hydroquinone. Unlike hydroquninone, Revision&#x27;s Vitamin C lotion is safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, during summer months, for people who are out in the sun a lot, does not require a prescription, and can be used without having to take time off.  The technology Revision uses provides one of the highest concentrations of vitamin C available, and uses a delivery system that maintains the efficacy of the vitamin C for far longer than any other vitamin C product out that. Vitamin C  oxidizes the moment it hits air, rendering it all but useless after a few months, so any jar or serum bottle will deteriorate the vitamin C from the very first time you open it. The airless pump combined with the encapsulation of the vitamin C ensures that your last use is as effective as your first.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist  sells this for a lot more so I decided to buy it here. It seems to be a very good product</li>
            <li> Just started using for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended &amp; it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 2 years and love it. It is rated the highest concentration of vitamin C lotion at 30%.  It works very well ion my completion and noticeably reduces the appearances of lines and wrinkles and my completion looks smooth, clear and great! I first used LaRochey Posse vitamin C at 30% and the company stopped making it.  When I was introduced to this product and began using it I could a while, I was totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the best Vitamin C Lotion I have ever used.  The price seems high, but it is a 30% concentrate, most are 10% to 15%.  It feels great under a moisturizer.  It does last quite a while.  One short pump is enough to cover your face.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist for use in the morning underneath my SPF. This is a particularly high concentration of a stable form vitamin C, which is helpful for evening out skin tone and discoloration and most importantly (to me) protecting the skin from sun damage and premature aging. I have normal to slightly oily skin with occasional hormonal acne. Although this is a lotion (vs. gel product which I have tried), it absorbs well and does not contribute to acne or oiliness. I cannot comment on the product&#x27;s ability to reverse wrinkles, as I&#x27;m only on my second bottle of it and my skin is in pretty good condition right now (in my 30s). The price here at amazon is fantastic compared to what I paid at the derm. If you are looking for a quality vitamin C product this is a good one to try.</li>
            <li> An estatician recommended this product.  I feel it is worth having.  I was glad to be able to purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I expected more results from a 30% Vitamin C product, compared to other lines, such as PCA&#x27;s 20%, this falls short on performance.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, so one star down for that. But it is very, very good. AND it is packaged properly in a darkened container. So many Vitamin C&#x27;s are sold in clear containers which damages the anti-oxidant chemicals.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a bad product but I just didn&#x27;t see enough results to warrant spending the money on it again.</li>
            <li> I use revision produts regularly and really like. I was not satisfied with this particular product though. It goes on very dry and one pump hardly covers half your face.I think i like liquid vit c better as i have used that for years.</li>
            <li> Item came before stated. You have to love that!  I have been using revision for 2 years now. And love what it does for my complexion. This was the second order through Amazon and will continue to order from them</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Leaves my skin feeling nourished and soft.  I highly recommend using a vitamin C Lotion on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and is nothing short of amazing. I am in my late 20&#x27;s, black and I have mild to moderate pigmentation issues with oily skin and large pores. First I just love the way it has corrected my tone I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve saw my tone this even since my early 20&#x27;s. It has lightened my acne scars dramatically, improved the look of my pores and my skin looks more soft and smooth. As oily as my face is this vitamin c lotion does not clog my pores and I&#x27;ve had no breakouts. It goes great under makeup and makes my makeup glowww I love this stuff and will continue to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/21/15&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that after 6 months of continuous use I can see the difference in my skintone and firmness of my skin, this product has improved my skin so much that I don&#x27;t like to wear makeup anymore and I get compliments on my skin all the time which never happened before. I really really love this stuff I am so glad to have heard about this product</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in Revision Vitamin C Lotion 30%. I have used Brands of Vitamin C Lotion from the grocery store that are much better and cheaper. I have used this product for a week, I realize that is not long but it doesn&#x27;t even moisturize my skin so I have been putting a moisturizer over it. Also, it feels sticky after you put it on your skin and takes a while to absorb into your skin. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamin C serums for 5 - 6 years. I always used the Obagi Professional-C Serum 20%.  It is an oil in a glass bottle with a dropper. It works very well. My main problem was knocking over the bottle and having the serum run out.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times that happens. The last time I visited my Dermatologist they recommended the Revision Vitamin C. It a light cream with a pump (no more spills). You use very little and it lasts a long time. My skin seems to absorb it better than the Obagi serum. As for effectiveness, I am 62 and receive many compliments on my skin&#x27;s smoothness. It has helped even out my skin tone, helps keep it firm and minimise wrinkles. This is a great price.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C lotion rocks!  I am a believer in using vitamin C daily. Revision&#x27;s vitamin C is excellent and price is good.</li>
            <li> I do love this cream. I have been using it for years. It was originally @$55 and has increased to $77. Same amount, taller bottle. Why? Now I can&#x27;t even use a qtip to get it all out. There is no need to put it in a bigger bottle and justify charging more money! Ridiculous</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my skin look years younger!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks now. Too early to see any difference, but will it is a good quality product. The only 30% vitamin C I could find.</li>
            <li> Is a great moisturizer! Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not see any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels.  Great product recommended by my esthetician and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Moisturizes, softens and evens out skin tone. I use it everyday.  Best price than anywhere else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Love this product and arrived as promised.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Recently my dermatologist recommended this and I am so pleased. I put it on a clean face before anything else. You only use a small amount but feels great. My skin looks bright and fresh.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years .... and yes it does work</li>
            <li> I cant really tell at the moment because i have not see any change on my skin having said that, i believe its early days and as times go on, i might be able to tell what the cream actually do for me.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product daily for a few years. Im pretty pleased with it. I do think it helps with my melasma or at least evens out my skin tone.</li>
