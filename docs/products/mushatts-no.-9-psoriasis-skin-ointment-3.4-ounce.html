            <li>It is good in between prescription refills.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>So its best to apply the ointment when the skin is mildly damp.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Ideally so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use as much hydrocortisone as often.</li>
            <li>I like it better than anything else</li>
            <li>:  Not as greasy as many coal tar ointments.  </li>
            <li>If one has many affected areas</li>
            <li>I was glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it was more like a lotion and better smelling.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t go on as easily.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of using the product twice daily, I noticed remarkable improvements.</li>
            <li>The order was shipped quickly and I would order this item again.</li>
            <li>she can go through the container fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>- My Psoriasis has gone 90%+ , Super product</li>
            <li>The odor is not entirely unpleasant however so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>the best stuff for psoriasis.does not clear it up yet,but shows a big improvement.try a lot of ointments.</li>
            <li>My quality of life is far better than before .</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price if you can pay it.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>It also became significantly thinner, and has restored my skin to that of a normal person in some areas.</li>
            <li>So far it has done a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>its Gone totally :)</li>
            <li>Love this product haven&#x27;t itch since use of it,I mixed it w/</li>
            <li>and they said most people can get to the bottom of the container using their middle finger...</li>
            <li>Mushatt&#x27;s No. 9 Psoriasis Skin Ointment cleared it up in the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently this product has been around for a long time for  good reason...</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Very soothing, when I first apply it, it has a warming sensation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, when I came to Georgia to visit family, I ran out of Doak Oil and couldn&#x27;t find anything over the shelf strong enough to treat my skin.</li>
            <li>(psoriasis is on the soles of my feet) but doesn&#x27;t help much with itching and peeling.</li>
            <li>I have recurring bouts of psoriasis, comes and goes, and this ointment worked very well to get the bout under control.  </li>
            <li>really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it worked really well to start off with, but my skin got used to it</li>
            <li>But it works better than other OTC products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Have tried it on three such spots and while it temporarily relieved the itching/burning, it did not stop the patch from going full tilt.</li>
            <li>and it stopped working about a little more than a month into using it, and its very oily</li>
            <li>It did more for me than any prescription ever did, but I also actually applied it as directed, and was religious about the application of it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you try this ointment.</li>
            <li>pressure sore,from Parkinson...recommended highly</li>
            <li>The other con I have is that this product doesn&#x27;t qualify for Amazon Prime&#x27;s free 2 day shipping, which is why I&#x27;m not purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>Would rather live with the psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I used a product available over the counter in Canada, called Doak Oil, and that eliminated all Psoriasis from my skin over the course of one year, using it religiously twice daily.</li>
            <li>This one is less greasy than others I have tried but it does have a strong odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some success with Mushatt&#x27;s but not complete...</li>
            <li>I could see this as possibly a way to alternate with a prescription medication to stretch it out if you were running low, but given the price I suspect you are much better off going with an HC cream or ointment.</li>
            <li>and I control it naturally by food and diet .</li>
            <li>I am sure they have heard this complaint before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line...due to the expense I am going to shift back to Elta Tar for awhile even though it is much greasier than Mushatt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I selected the free standard shipping, and it arrived later than the last estimated arrival day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>On a patch that I would normally put my prescription medication on it would also temporarily relieve the symptoms, but did not seem to actually treat the problem.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s mostly because I became quite discouraged with the slow acting results of any medication.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other brands of skin ointment, and this one works as well or better than any other.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks of twice daily application, my psoriasis/eczema funk on the tops of my hands is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Because I have Psoriasis in large patches covering about 40-65% of my skin, it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>: Just really three...1) it is kind of expensive as compared to some other similar coal tar products.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and it seemed to work a little better than it has this time.  </li>

            <li> I have used this product in the past and it seemed to work a little better than it has this time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other treatments and my psoriasis never cleared up or got worse.  </li>
            <li> I was given half a dozen or so different ointments/salves and told to apply them on different days at different times....</li>
            <li> After more than 20 years trying different approaches and with disappointed results, finally found the solution.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having tried three or four other skin ointments and none working, I&#x27;ve finally found one that clears up my skin.</li>
            <li> Since I have a relatively low intensity dermatitis, few applications was enough in my case.</li>
            <li> this is my main complaint.  </li>
            <li> Getting some limited clearing in my patches (I&#x27;ve used about three containers of this ointment).&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This stuff smells, is greasy if your hands are wet when applying or its sticky if your hands are dry when applying.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it as much now for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> Too much medication sometimes make it actually worse</li>
            <li> Even my dermatologist was amazed and is going to tell other patients about it.</li>
            <li> About once every other day is all thats needed to prevent the extreme redness/dryness/cracks/bleeding on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little pink  on some of my  spots......</li>
            <li> In my case I was hoping to find something I could pick up at the first sign of a flare up and knock it out before it got bad enough to need the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> The areas affected by my Psoriasis was much less red, stopped scaling and hardly itched at all.</li>
            <li> In that respect this is a total failure.</li>
            <li> Mushatt&#x27;s cleared my skin of plaque psoriasis on legs and arms in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I have heavy psoriasis on my palms and this helps keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this complaint posted in the past on other reviews</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis from past 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> Mushatt&#x27;s is smelly, but thick and soothing.</li>
            <li> I use it with a thick layer of Aquaphor over it and then cotton socks at night for an occlusion effect.</li>
            <li> It is thick, so it doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li> I start using the oinment, very quickly, usually with in 24 hours, the redness begins to lessen and it does not get any worse.  </li>
            <li> The container in which it comes can be difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely difficult to get to the bottom of the jar.  </li>
            <li> I find it expensive for the quantity of ointment given.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the best stuff for psoriasis.does not clear it up yet,but shows a big improvement.try a lot of ointments.</li>
            <li> After more than 20 years trying different approaches and with disappointed results, finally found the solution. Only 3 or 4 days of consecutive application and the problem was gone for weeks. After Im just keeping a maintenance application when a fill the skin is getting affected again. Since I have a relatively low intensity dermatitis, few applications was enough in my case.</li>
            <li> So far it has done a fantastic job. As soon as the area starts to redden I start using the oinment, very quickly, usually with in 24 hours, the redness begins to lessen and it does not get any worse.  Very good product for me.</li>
            <li> I bought Mushatt&#x27;s No. 9 Psoriasis Skin Ointment because I ran out of prescription ointment from my doctor. Mushatt&#x27;s is smelly, but thick and soothing. I joke that I smell like a telephone pole when I use it. I use it with a thick layer of Aquaphor over it and then cotton socks at night for an occlusion effect. The Mushatt&#x27;s takes the pain and swelling away (psoriasis is on the soles of my feet) but doesn&#x27;t help much with itching and peeling. I like it better than anything else over-the-counter I have tried. It is good in between prescription refills. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Did not open the jar after reading that coal tar ingredients can cause cancer.  Would rather live with the psoriasis.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The only oinment that works</li>
            <li> Mushatt&#x27;s cleared my skin of plaque psoriasis on legs and arms in less than a month. Still have the discoloration - a little pink  on some of my  spots...... but who  cares!  This stuff is great.  I have used everything out there including prescription ointments and nothing can compare to Mushatts.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended the product to numerous people.  Even my dermatologist was amazed and is going to tell other patients about it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands of skin ointment, and this one works as well or better than any other.  I have recurring bouts of psoriasis, comes and goes, and this ointment worked very well to get the bout under control.  The order was shipped quickly and I would order this item again.</li>
            <li> Works great and relives itching and keeps my skin hydrated really good.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is kinda off-putting, but it is coal-tar based product...</li>
            <li> Apparently this product has been around for a long time for  good reason...it works! Not greasy. Smells good. Try it!</li>
            <li> Love this product !! My quality of life is far better than before . I have psoriasis from past 15 yrs. and I control it naturally by food and diet . I applied this and it kind of reduced scales drastically and no itch at all ! its Gone totally :)</li>
            <li> I have heavy psoriasis on my palms and this helps keep it under control. Too much medication sometimes make it actually worse so I use the tar ointment instead. This one is less greasy than others I have tried but it does have a strong odor. The odor is not entirely unpleasant however so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of twice daily application, my psoriasis/eczema funk on the tops of my hands is completely gone. This stuff smells, is greasy if your hands are wet when applying or its sticky if your hands are dry when applying. So its best to apply the ointment when the skin is mildly damp. I&#x27;ve got no complaints about this product. Stopped using it as much now for the past few weeks. About once every other day is all thats needed to prevent the extreme redness/dryness/cracks/bleeding on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried three or four other skin ointments and none working, I&#x27;ve finally found one that clears up my skin. Highly recommend you try this ointment.</li>
            <li> Love this product haven&#x27;t itch since use of it,I mixed it w/Dr Blaine RevitaDermthe best every I give both products 10+++++</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Never cleared any of my psoriasis spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a myriad of ointments, etc. for my psoriatic patches...some work, some don&#x27;t...some work for awhile and then stop working.  I stopped going to the dermatologist because what was being given to me didn&#x27;t work....I was given half a dozen or so different ointments/salves and told to apply them on different days at different times....I&#x27;ve had some success with Mushatt&#x27;s but not complete...I don&#x27;t give this four stars only because of the cons listed below.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Not as greasy as many coal tar ointments.  Getting some limited clearing in my patches (I&#x27;ve used about three containers of this ointment).&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Just really three...1) it is kind of expensive as compared to some other similar coal tar products. 2) I wish it came in a larger container than it does...If one has many affected areas he/she can go through the container fairly quickly.  3) The container in which it comes can be difficult to use.  It is definitely difficult to get to the bottom of the jar.  I&#x27;ve seen this complaint posted in the past on other reviews and I have to agree...this is my main complaint.  I contacted Mushatt&#x27;s and they said most people can get to the bottom of the container using their middle finger...they also suggested I use a spoon to get to the bottom.  I am sure they have heard this complaint before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line...due to the expense I am going to shift back to Elta Tar for awhile even though it is much greasier than Mushatt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> works wonderful ...healed my elbow up in 3 weeks great ...pressure sore,from Parkinson...recommended highly</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it seemed to work a little better than it has this time.  The consistency seems different than it has in the ones I&#x27;ve used before.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be mixed as well and it doesn&#x27;t go on as easily.  But it works better than other OTC products I have tried.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been treating my psoriasis without the assistance of a dermatologist for some time now. That&#x27;s mostly because I became quite discouraged with the slow acting results of any medication. But, because family and friends kept encouraging me to try to resolve my psoriasis, after resigning to the fact that I&#x27;ll always have it, I continued to treat it occassionally and inconsistantly over the last 15 years. I used a product available over the counter in Canada, called Doak Oil, and that eliminated all Psoriasis from my skin over the course of one year, using it religiously twice daily. I only used it because it eliminated the itch entirely, I didn&#x27;t realize it was reducing my psoriasis until 3 months after I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, when I came to Georgia to visit family, I ran out of Doak Oil and couldn&#x27;t find anything over the shelf strong enough to treat my skin. So, after some online searching, I selected Mushatt&#x27;s no. 9 Psoriasis Skin Ointment. I was glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS- Within 2 weeks of using the product twice daily, I noticed remarkable improvements. The areas affected by my Psoriasis was much less red, stopped scaling and hardly itched at all. It also became significantly thinner, and has restored my skin to that of a normal person in some areas. But, if I skipped it even once, I did see that the progress that was made didn&#x27;t entirely stay, so please don&#x27;t skip even one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS- I find it expensive for the quantity of ointment given. Because I have Psoriasis in large patches covering about 40-65% of my skin, it didn&#x27;t last very long. At that rate, it&#x27;s the same price as some Prescriptions I&#x27;ve had. But, if you have it on a smaller scale, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it. The other con I have is that this product doesn&#x27;t qualify for Amazon Prime&#x27;s free 2 day shipping, which is why I&#x27;m not purchasing it again. Last time I purchased it, I didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg on shipping. I selected the free standard shipping, and it arrived later than the last estimated arrival day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price if you can pay it. It did more for me than any prescription ever did, but I also actually applied it as directed, and was religious about the application of it. To all those of you out there that are struggling with Psoriasis, don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li> cleared up patches of psoriasis in one day.</li>
            <li> Excellent results - My Psoriasis has gone 90%+ , Super product</li>
            <li> This is THE best.  I&#x27;ve been to several doctors for a problem on my legs and nobody knew what it was.  I found this online and thought I&#x27;d try it.  WOW...within 2 weeks my legs were clearing up.  I was embarrassed to wear shorts or skirts, so went out and bought a bunch of maxis.  Now my legs are cleaned up and I can wear shorts again.  I continue to use it so whatever I have stay gone.  The docs think it&#x27;s either excema or psoriasis, but all the meds they gave me - and they cost a lot of money - none worked.  THIS WORKED and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product does what it promises and I do like that&lt;br /&gt;but I wish it was more like a lotion and better smelling.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other treatments and my psoriasis never cleared up or got worse.  Mushatt&#x27;s No. 9 Psoriasis Skin Ointment cleared it up in the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Very soothing, when I first apply it, it has a warming sensation.&lt;br /&gt;- It is thick, so it doesn&#x27;t rub off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- It does have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use again if needed.</li>
            <li> I wonder what the folks who have given this glowing reviews were looking for from their OTC product. In my case I was hoping to find something I could pick up at the first sign of a flare up and knock it out before it got bad enough to need the prescription stuff. Ideally so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use as much hydrocortisone as often. In that respect this is a total failure. Have tried it on three such spots and while it temporarily relieved the itching/burning, it did not stop the patch from going full tilt. On a patch that I would normally put my prescription medication on it would also temporarily relieve the symptoms, but did not seem to actually treat the problem. I could see this as possibly a way to alternate with a prescription medication to stretch it out if you were running low, but given the price I suspect you are much better off going with an HC cream or ointment.</li>
            <li> it worked really well to start off with, but my skin got used to it and it stopped working about a little more than a month into using it, and its very oily</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! Worth a try.</li>
