            <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>but the product was amazing!</li>
            <li>They both smell really good.</li>
            <li>Kay Von D is my very very favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Love this ring and scent!</li>
            <li>The ring is metal or some sort of metal...very nice ring,scents and packaging.</li>
            <li>Fragrances are really nice.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and the original retail value is $30.00.</li>
            <li>The perfume smells seductive and attractive, but Im more interested in the ring than the smell.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more items from this seller.</li>
            <li>but it needs a more lightweight form factor.</li>
            <li>Love this ring and the TWO perfumes that come with it.</li>
            <li>But, you get both Sinner and Saint solid perfumes and they both smell wonderful!</li>
            <li>I love that the perfume lasts all day, you can tell which one is sinner and which one is saint.</li>
            <li>was glad to get a 2 perfume scents in one.</li>
            <li>Love both of sinner and saint.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s an excellent steal!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and high quality crafted, but I don&#x27;t blame others who choose to store it in a purse or for display.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the huge ring is really fun</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price :)</li>
            <li>Sinner has a more powerful sent.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t fit me</li>
            <li>Sooo cool.</li>
            <li>I feel the ring looks a lot better in real life than the picture.</li>
            <li>Thank you sooo much!!</li>
            <li>Oh and one more thing this ring...the top turns one way to reveal the scent and it comes with a closed up scent of saint that u can drop in when sinner is finished.</li>
            <li>It is elegant and pretty to wear, but even for large statement rings it is large and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes in a higher quality velvet bag to protect the intricately engraved surface.</li>
            <li>This ring Is a giant that can&#x27;t even fit on my daughters fingers!</li>
            <li>It is heavy, it twists open so you will never worry about losing the rose top</li>
            <li>There is a pen-type hole underneath that will let you push it up, making it much easier to change.</li>
            <li>Big heavy gorgeous ring.  </li>
            <li>Its heavy, metal and huge but worth getting.</li>
            <li>Not only a great looking ring (though a bit heavy) but also a delughtfull scent on the same purchase.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine with me because its to heavy to wear.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clearly used because one of the fragrance chargers is in the ring and has completely lost its scent.</li>
            <li>This cocktail ring is not black.</li>
            <li>It is in original packaging (unlike several other sellers who try and pass of used testers.</li>
            <li>First of all this ring comes with BOTH Sinner and Saint perfume solids, and this picture does it absolutely NO JUSTICE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m essentially reiterating what others have said, but this ring is far heavier than my key ring with all of my keys.</li>
            <li>Such a neat but pretty heavy ring</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too small for the middle finger on my left hand and too big for my right ring finger.</li>

            <li> The box was a bit crushed but what to be expected at postal delivery</li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t specify a size and ended up being too small for my finger</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> First of all this ring comes with BOTH Sinner and Saint perfume solids, and this picture does it absolutely NO JUSTICE! It&#x27;s gorgeous and the original retail value is $30.00. This cocktail ring is not black. It is a beautiful gunmetal and the quality is superb. It is made out of metal and twists open. It is a size 7... (too big for my tiny size 5 finger), BUT WHO CARES!!! It is in original packaging (unlike several other sellers who try and pass of used testers. It comes in a higher quality velvet bag to protect the intricately engraved surface. The box is beautiful and it makes a wonderful addition to my Kat Von D collection. It is heavy, it twists open so you will never worry about losing the rose top and the hinging does not appear to be one that would loosen after time. I will be purchasing more items from this seller. Thank you sooo much!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and it&#x27;s clearly used because one of the fragrance chargers is in the ring and has completely lost its scent. It&#x27;s too small for the middle finger on my left hand and too big for my right ring finger. I think it&#x27;s an awesome idea but it needs a more lightweight form factor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really big but my son&#x27;s girlfriend loved it! It&#x27;s one of those things that will get lots of complements!</li>
            <li> I cant give a 0 it came in peaces...</li>
            <li> Love the Saint part - sad they stopped selling the perfume at Sephora</li>
            <li> Love this ring and the TWO perfumes that come with it. The only thing that&#x27;s a bummer is you can&#x27;t chose the size you want nor was I told what size I was getting. Needless to say, the ring doesn&#x27;t fit any of my fingers except for my pinky, but the ring is so huge and heavy, it&#x27;s uncomfortable on my pinky. Other than that, it&#x27;s an excellent steal!</li>
            <li> Love love love it! Best part was the price. Kay Von D is my very very favorite scent. Thank u</li>
            <li> The ring is pretty but very heavy and big. Fits only on my ring finger :/  But, you get both Sinner and Saint solid perfumes and they both smell wonderful! For the price, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> Love this ring and scent!</li>
            <li> This is awesome! Totally worth the price :)</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the huge ring is really fun but it broke almost immediately!  :(  I don&#x27;t know if I can fix it but it&#x27;s not worth it to send it back for an exchange.</li>
            <li> I love that the perfume lasts all day, you can tell which one is sinner and which one is saint. Sinner has a more powerful sent. Saint has a sweeter smell to it. They both smell really good.</li>
            <li> This ring is very heavy</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping. Great price</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Not only a great looking ring (though a bit heavy) but also a delughtfull scent on the same purchase. Certainly a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> I already had sinner in a travel size glass tube in my purse.....that I bought at Sephora...was glad to get a 2 perfume scents in one. Love both of sinner and saint. Such a neat but pretty heavy ring and it doesn&#x27;t fit me but that&#x27;s fine with me because its to heavy to wear. The ring is metal or some sort of metal...very nice ring,scents and packaging. Oh and one more thing this ring...the top turns one way to reveal the scent and it comes with a closed up scent of saint that u can drop in when sinner is finished. Sooo cool. Love it!!</li>
            <li> It is a heavy ring, but Im accustomed to such weighty jewelry. The perfume smells seductive and attractive, but Im more interested in the ring than the smell. All in all I am very happy with the product. I feel the ring looks a lot better in real life than the picture.</li>
            <li> Big heavy gorgeous ring.  Fragrances are really nice.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t specify a size and ended up being too small for my finger so I can&#x27;t wear it now</li>
            <li> This ring Is a giant that can&#x27;t even fit on my daughters fingers! It is not both sinner and saint unless they are blended together as one in a pasty like balm! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Got my ring today and I loved it! Its heavy, metal and huge but worth getting. The box was a bit crushed but what to be expected at postal delivery but I didn&#x27;t care about the box litterly but the product was amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m essentially reiterating what others have said, but this ring is far heavier than my key ring with all of my keys. It is a lot of weight to carry. It&#x27;s gorgeous and high quality crafted, but I don&#x27;t blame others who choose to store it in a purse or for display. It is elegant and pretty to wear, but even for large statement rings it is large and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with one perfume in it, with the other to switch out for.
