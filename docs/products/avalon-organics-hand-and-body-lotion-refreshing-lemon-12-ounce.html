    <ol>
            <li>Great product for the price!</li>
            <li>best is to educate yourself and switch to Avalon organic products.  </li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>this is the best unscented lotion i&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>great organic lotion!  </li>
            <li>I have just bought a bottle of the aloe lotion and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Swanson also has some of the best shipping via Amazon, so I appreciate that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years, very happy to have found it online since it&#x27;s not sold in my home town.</li>
            <li>good product!</li>
            <li>Great economy size that lasts about three months with one application per day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great; non-greasy and softening --</li>
            <li>Avalon Organic products are great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li>:) hope this helps someone!!</li>
            <li>For example, if using to replenish dry/cracked feet, it isn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found an unscented that I&#x27;ve loved before....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as good as the lotion</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do much good.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizing without greasy</li>
            <li>lilac AND my hair and skin has never been better (shinier, healthier, more even toned, everything)!!</li>
            <li>so glad I ordered this!</li>
            <li>NOW I can use amazing scented lotions like lavender, rose,</li>
            <li>Amazing lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have a scent if you are using it all over, and you can wear whatever scent you like with it.</li>
            <li>Amazon had the best price because I use to get it at whole foods and they  went up $7.00 a bottle(ouch).</li>
            <li>Okay, so aloe isn&#x27;t a very lovely scent, but it dissipates and doesn&#x27;t linger all day, infusing your clothes.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and cannot handle stuff that is scented like perfume so this is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and all awesome!</li>
            <li>Liked Avalon Organics liquid hand soap so well, I immediately ordered more and just started a subscribe and save on their Lavender Bath &amp; Shower Gel.</li>
            <li>I love the non scent factor because I wear a vanilla mist and wouldn&#x27;t want clashing scents.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to purchase and use.</li>
            <li>{REVIEW MADE BY MY WIFE:}</li>
            <li>(hypoallergenic) Moisturizer when I want heavier hydration or (my favorite)</li>
            <li>I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well, and has a lovely list of ingredients that don&#x27;t cause me to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li>I love this company&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>But this aloe has too many ingredients for me.  </li>
            <li>I love Avalon Organics.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really like perfumes and scents, you will be happy with this lotion.</li>
            <li>I prefer all ingredients to be healthy.  </li>
            <li>I applied some to my hands and face, it seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li>my new favorite lotion!!</li>
            <li>This is best lotion I have used for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>even appears to help with fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, skin absorbs it well.  </li>
            <li>oil free) moisturizer.    </li>
            <li>I like a lotion that soaks in well, leaves you smooth, and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate off during the day (probably not the correct way to use &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; but hopefully you get the idea.</li>
            <li>Had it been fabulous</li>
            <li>I prefer a straightforward aloe alone.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is very light, I only use organic, Glad to see this is paraben and chemical free.</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of slimy residue.  </li>
            <li>This quickly turned to feeling like it was on fire.</li>
            <li>I used this product all the time,very good for dry skin without any irritation and a non scent.</li>
            <li>BUT I went from the stresses of oily pimple/black head ridden, rash prone skin to radiant and smooth skin with much fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li>, I felt it would have been worth it.</li>
            <li>Talk about your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shopped many places and on-line, and spent literally hundreds of dollars in the past five years trying to find the perfect all-over body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a replacement, and it was also leaking inside the bag, but not as much lotion lost, so I will clean up and keep it.</li>
            <li>I also wish they did not upgrade to the new version, the older one was better.</li>
            <li>I work at a natural foods store and was able to take products home to really test stuff out.</li>
            <li>Certainly am getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Perfect - non-greasy, a little goes a long way, no fragrance, etc. ...</li>
            <li>Really like this lotion!</li>
            <li>I really liked the idea of this lotion, because of its minimal use of synthetic chemicals, and perfumes.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a unscented (to use with my essential oils) with the feel of the St. Ives which I love.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty neutral too.</li>
            <li>I think some have been changed since I first started using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love the price because a tiny bottle at the grocery store costs about $10.</li>
            <li>I have tattoos and I use lotion to keep them looking fresh and bright, but this lotion makes ALL OF MY SKIN LOOK DULL.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH but HYDRATES and lasts until my next shower ALL while sinking in FAST even when I use to much!!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, not too overpowering but sort of bland, again didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle too.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine by me, because I never intended it to be a deep moisturizing</li>
            <li>The large plastic container that was shipped to me reminds me of the huge bottles of value brand of lotion you would pick up at a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>This lotion works very well on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and calming to irritated skin.</li>
            <li>and this is never irritating to me.</li>
            <li>70% Organic content, 100% Vegetarian, environmentally responsible packaging and no animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>Soaks in well, gentle on skin and smells like ALOE ...</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added a picture of the real ingredient list in the photos for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband commented that my skin felt softer, but I found I had to use alot more lotion for my skin to feel like it did with my previous lotion (St. Ives Shea Butter)</li>
            <li>Despite not being organic, I like Lubriderm way better for the way it actually works and actually hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>My Routine for CLEAR SKIN!!</li>
            <li>The lotion is nice and thick</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I have no problem.  </li>
            <li>Natural products have come a looooong way baby, I even have an organic salicylic acid blemish gel from Alba Botanica!    </li>
            <li>SO just putting this out there for anyone who is suffering like I was with crazy sensitive skin BUT still wants to use fun AND good products on your face and body, go to your local health food store and take a look!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin (rosacea, non-malignant skin cancers, and folliculitis).  </li>
            <li>LADIES W SENSITIVE SKIN:</li>
            <li>Makes the skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is a workout to put the lotion on!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not for busy morning body moisturizer</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>Its a good lotion, but expensive, of course.</li>
            <li>I do normally take a shower daily, so my skin is usually dryer but my old lotion worked fine.</li>
            <li>I use a simple and natural astringent: witch hazel!!</li>
            <li>I prefer the unscented personally since I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, usually everything and anything</li>
            <li>Then I use a PURE vitamin C serum (NuFountain C20 20% vitamin Cserum) which has COMPLETELY revived the youthful glow and tone of my skin (as well as brightening dark spots).</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft and instantly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>As a male customer, I don&#x27;t want skin products that smell a lot, while still using things that are natural in ingredients.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin problems.</li>
            <li>As an all-around body lotion -- same thing -- non-greasy, acts as an anti-inflammatory and stops dry skin and itching.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert and my skin is DRY.</li>
            <li>Other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and so-called &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; soaps have been very drying and/or burned my skin; no such problems with any of the Avalon Organics soap/lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> What I do not like is that even the smallest amount on my skin takes a long time to rub in.</li>
            <li> This not only leaves my normal to slightly dry skin SILKY (seriously silky)</li>
            <li> Plus I find this lotion too expensive, so can&#x27;t give the full five stars.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with extremely dry skin on my legs due to grave&#x27;s disease.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to poison your body with chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice in a way but sometimes annoying that I have to rub and rub and rub before it soaks into my skin.</li>
            <li> and it often left my skin with a very tight feeling within minutes after application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I thought zinc oxide was one of ingredients due to pale white streaks.&lt;br /&gt;Tried using a small amount at a time; still white all over--- not for brown color skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way; this bottle size lasts about 4 to 5 months</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> down</li>
            <li> I use an activated charcoal soap, or black charcoal soap to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I was a little shook when I read the label and it said &amp;#34;contains 70% organic&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I put lavendar oil in it for a little aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> I mean my skin gets so dry the skin is flaking off.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll mix a few drops of lavender oil and rosemary oil with the witch hazel in a separate little bottle if I want to get fancy.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Massage that into my skin followed by either Alba Botanica Aloe and Green Tea</li>
            <li> I know some people say they had trouble with  shipment.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about any sort of nasty chemicals in this lotion.</li>
            <li> Sits on tops of the skin!; need heavy massaging&lt;br /&gt;Absorption; not much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> few minutes after applying the lotion I noticed</li>
            <li> It will also help with repairing excessive sun exposure and sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus I added in sesame oil for added moisturizer and I can hardly tell it&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> But this lotion just did not moisturize my skin, at least in any way that I could feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but not too thick.</li>
            <li> not too appalling but not pleasant.</li>

            <li> Sorry :(</li>
            <li> I ordered one that was leaking BADLY all over the bag it was in.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed and it was not inexpensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this lotion! I&#x27;ve never found an unscented that I&#x27;ve loved before....so glad I ordered this! It&#x27;s a large bottle too.</li>
            <li> Used this for years. Well formulated organic skin moisturizer. Soaks into skin in just a couple of minutes. Not greasy. Also comes in lavender scent. Your skin is the largest organ in your body. What you put on your skin goes into your body. Be careful not to poison your body with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was a little shook when I read the label and it said &amp;#34;contains 70% organic&amp;#34;.  Why is there ANY non-organic in it?  And why are they marketing it as organic if it&#x27;s not ALL organic?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the mini-panic over I will say . . . it&#x27;s not as good as the lotion it&#x27;s replacing (no longer in production) and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out . . . but I&#x27;m still panicking a bit over the labeling.</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  Smooth, skin absorbs it well.  No greasy or filmy residue.  Skin is so soft and instantly moisturized.  Great economy size that lasts about three months with one application per day.  A little goes a long way.  I love the non scent factor because I wear a vanilla mist and wouldn&#x27;t want clashing scents.  I use this as a body and face lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for a number of years.  A little goes a long way.  My skin is very sensitive and I have no problem.  Love it and will continue to purchase and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped many places and on-line, and spent literally hundreds of dollars in the past five years trying to find the perfect all-over body lotion.  This product fits the bill.  I have sensitive skin (rosacea, non-malignant skin cancers, and folliculitis).  I use this on my face, under my sunscreen and makeup.  It&#x27;s great; non-greasy and softening -- even appears to help with fine lines.  As an all-around body lotion -- same thing -- non-greasy, acts as an anti-inflammatory and stops dry skin and itching.  My skin soaks it up, even my feet and heels!  A little bit goes a long way; this bottle size lasts about 4 to 5 months and I use it everyday.  Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I have problems with extremely dry skin on my legs due to grave&#x27;s disease. I mean my skin gets so dry the skin is flaking off. Within just two applications of this lotion I had already noticed a difference. My skin is softer and between applications my skin doesn&#x27;t start flake again as seemed to always happen no matter what non-organic product I used. I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> {REVIEW MADE BY MY WIFE:} I have super sensitive skin, usually everything and anything makes me break out in hives!! This not only leaves my normal to slightly dry skin SILKY (seriously silky) SMOOTH but HYDRATES and lasts until my next shower ALL while sinking in FAST even when I use to much!! Thank you Avalon Organics!    LADIES W SENSITIVE SKIN: DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY YOU&#x27;RE BREAKING OUT IN HIVES/RASH??? Try organic products!! Before I made the dedicated switch to organic face and body products, I was constantly suffering from hives, rashes, raised tonal bumps, redness etc etc! I longed to use scented lotions and perfumes, I even broke out in rashes on my scalp! NOW I can use amazing scented lotions like lavender, rose, lilac AND my hair and skin has never been better (shinier, healthier, more even toned, everything)!! I work at a natural foods store and was able to take products home to really test stuff out. SO just putting this out there for anyone who is suffering like I was with crazy sensitive skin BUT still wants to use fun AND good products on your face and body, go to your local health food store and take a look! Natural products have come a looooong way baby, I even have an organic salicylic acid blemish gel from Alba Botanica!    &gt;&gt;If you want to know about my skin: oily + very sensitive, prone to black heads, hormonal cysts on chin and occasional acne type cystic pimple in some conspicuous spot (like the one smack dab in the middle of my forehead).  &gt;&gt;My Routine for CLEAR SKIN!! (Everything organic!) I use an activated charcoal soap, or black charcoal soap to wash my face. This removes the sebum and clears my pores so well that my astringent doesn&#x27;t pick anything up!! I use a simple and natural astringent: witch hazel!! Why be complicated when it works so well! Sometimes I&#x27;ll mix a few drops of lavender oil and rosemary oil with the witch hazel in a separate little bottle if I want to get fancy. Then I use a PURE vitamin C serum (NuFountain C20 20% vitamin Cserum) which has COMPLETELY revived the youthful glow and tone of my skin (as well as brightening dark spots). Massage that into my skin followed by either Alba Botanica Aloe and Green Tea (hypoallergenic) Moisturizer when I want heavier hydration or (my favorite) Andalou Naturals Acai + White Tea Clarifying (oil free) moisturizer.    SO sorry to dump that down BUT I went from the stresses of oily pimple/black head ridden, rash prone skin to radiant and smooth skin with much fewer breakouts. Just want to help and provide my POV and experience :) hope this helps someone!! Check out my YouTube if you want to ask me any questions!! https://m.youtube.com/user/uschilou</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of this lotion, because of its minimal use of synthetic chemicals, and perfumes. The lotion is nice and thick which is what I was looking for as I wanted to use it for the winter months. The smell is nice, not too overpowering but sort of bland, again didn&#x27;t bother me. But this lotion just did not moisturize my skin, at least in any way that I could feel. My husband commented that my skin felt softer, but I found I had to use alot more lotion for my skin to feel like it did with my previous lotion (St. Ives Shea Butter) and it often left my skin with a very tight feeling within minutes after application. I do normally take a shower daily, so my skin is usually dryer but my old lotion worked fine. I switched because I was trying to decrease my exposure to synthetic chemicals, and will use up the rest of it but I will not be spending the extra money for this lotion again.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion. It moisturizes well, and has a lovely list of ingredients that don&#x27;t cause me to break out in a rash. Ymmv.</li>
            <li> This lotion works very well on my skin.  I know some people say they had trouble with  shipment.  I am on my second bottle and I have not had any problems.  I recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Avalon Organic products are great.  It&#x27;s organic and not harmful to your body.  Products out in the market have a lot of toxic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The best is to educate yourself and switch to Avalon organic products.  Trust me I&#x27;m so happy I got rid of all my toxic products and now I&#x27;m a faithful user of Avalon products.  Try them - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Compare the ingredients to the &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34; brands. I believe its healthier.</li>
            <li> my new favorite lotion!! I am pregnant and cannot handle stuff that is scented like perfume so this is great. Plus I added in sesame oil for added moisturizer and I can hardly tell it&#x27;s in there. I will def buy again when I run out!!</li>
            <li> I love this company&#x27;s products.  The lavender facial cleansing gel is terrific.  But this aloe has too many ingredients for me.  I prefer a straightforward aloe alone.  Plus I find this lotion too expensive, so can&#x27;t give the full five stars.  Sorry :(</li>
            <li> Makes the skin soft and supple. I put lavendar oil in it for a little aromatherapy. Would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I like a lotion that soaks in well, leaves you smooth, and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate off during the day (probably not the correct way to use &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; but hopefully you get the idea. I was looking for a unscented (to use with my essential oils) with the feel of the St. Ives which I love. I was disappointed and it was not inexpensive. Had it been fabulous, I felt it would have been worth it.</li>
            <li> For an organic and fragrance free lotion you can&#x27;t go wrong with Avalon. My hands get very dry and crack from fall to spring, this lotion helps me immensely.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to receive this lotion. I like the consistency and the way it feels on my skin. The smell of the lotion is very light, I only use organic, Glad to see this is paraben and chemical free.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion. I use it every day on my entire body, even my face. It&#x27;s non-greasy and absorbs well. It&#x27;s thick but not too thick. It is very moisturizing and calming to irritated skin. It&#x27;s nice to not have a scent if you are using it all over, and you can wear whatever scent you like with it. It&#x27;s pricey but a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about any sort of nasty chemicals in this lotion. It&#x27;s all natural and all awesome!</li>
            <li> I love Avalon Organics. I have really sensitive skin and this is never irritating to me. It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and goes on nicely. It smells pretty neutral too. If you don&#x27;t really like perfumes and scents, you will be happy with this lotion. This big bottle lasts me a couple of months with every day use.</li>
            <li> I prefer all ingredients to be healthy.  I think some have been changed since I first started using this lotion.  My skin doesn&#x27;t seem to respond as well as it did.</li>
            <li> I used this product all the time,very good for dry skin without any irritation and a non scent. Amazon had the best price because I use to get it at whole foods and they  went up $7.00 a bottle(ouch).</li>
            <li> Its a good lotion, but expensive, of course. I also wish they did not upgrade to the new version, the older one was better.</li>
            <li> Sits on tops of the skin!; need heavy massaging&lt;br /&gt;Absorption; not much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I thought zinc oxide was one of ingredients due to pale white streaks.&lt;br /&gt;Tried using a small amount at a time; still white all over--- not for brown color skin. It is a workout to put the lotion on!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not for busy morning body moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent changes shortly after opening. not too appalling but not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Liking Avalon Organics. 70% Organic content, 100% Vegetarian, environmentally responsible packaging and no animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;Got the Avalon Organics Hand and Body Lotion, Aloe Unscented (32 oz). Soaks in well, gentle on skin and smells like ALOE ... Okay, so aloe isn&#x27;t a very lovely scent, but it dissipates and doesn&#x27;t linger all day, infusing your clothes. And if you want scent, you can add a couple drops of whatever essential oil you have on hand (bergamot, rosemary, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;Avalon Organics has a vast array of products that have scent, but strictly essential oils like Rosemary &amp; Lavender, no perfumes. Have tried Avalon Organics Lavender Glycerin Hand Soap, and their Rosemary hand soap. Liked Avalon Organics liquid hand soap so well, I immediately ordered more and just started a subscribe and save on their Lavender Bath &amp; Shower Gel. Other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and so-called &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; soaps have been very drying and/or burned my skin; no such problems with any of the Avalon Organics soap/lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> this is the best unscented lotion i&#x27;ve ever used.  i have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  in fact, it has some healing properties for minor scratches apparently. it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of slimy residue.  good product!</li>
            <li> Perfect - non-greasy, a little goes a long way, no fragrance, etc. ... great organic lotion!  Certainly am getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this I scented aloe lotion but sadly I hate it. To begin with the photo of this product is a lot different than what I received. The bottle in the picture appears to be a glass bottle but it is not. The large plastic container that was shipped to me reminds me of the huge bottles of value brand of lotion you would pick up at a local pharmacy. Since I know looks can be deciving I decided to give it a try. I applied some to my hands and face, it seemed to work ok. The strange odor of this \\&quot;odorless\\&quot; lotion was off putting but it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few minutes after applying the lotion I noticed my face felt like it was tingling. This quickly turned to feeling like it was on fire. I rushed to the bathroom and washed my face. This didn&#x27;t do much good. As of now I have a red rash that is still burning all over my face. I can actually see where the lotion was applied because the rash is only in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased this item I had read the ingredient list so I rushed to reread it. The ingredients listed on the bottle are a lot longer than the ones listed on Amazon. There are several different types of alcohol and it is only 70% organic. I&#x27;ve added a picture of the real ingredient list in the photos for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and stay away from this horrible product. I wish I had. It will be going back tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and my skin is DRY. I love the price because a tiny bottle at the grocery store costs about $10. A little bit goes a long long way with this stuff. It&#x27;s nice in a way but sometimes annoying that I have to rub and rub and rub before it soaks into my skin. I like it. And people have told me it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over a month now. I do not mind that not all of the ingredients are organic (I read that in the reviews before purchasing). What I do not like is that even the smallest amount on my skin takes a long time to rub in. There is ALWAYS A WHITE RESIDUE ON MY SKIN. I have tattoos and I use lotion to keep them looking fresh and bright, but this lotion makes ALL OF MY SKIN LOOK DULL. Despite not being organic, I like Lubriderm way better for the way it actually works and actually hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> As a male customer, I don&#x27;t want skin products that smell a lot, while still using things that are natural in ingredients. I have just bought a bottle of the aloe lotion and am very happy with it. Swanson also has some of the best shipping via Amazon, so I appreciate that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion&#x27;s a daily moisturizer, but it isn&#x27;t an intensive one. For example, if using to replenish dry/cracked feet, it isn&#x27;t very effective. That&#x27;s fine by me, because I never intended it to be a deep moisturizing kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aloe is an added (scent-less, mind you) bonus which reduces redness in some problem areas of the skin. It will also help with repairing excessive sun exposure and sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 2 adults who moisturize different parts of the body each day, a 32oz bottle of this lotion lasts us well over a year. Talk about your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This is best lotion I have used for very dry skin.  I prefer the unscented personally since I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, very happy to have found it online since it&#x27;s not sold in my home town.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion a LOT.  Good moisturizing without greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;BUT they need to work on delivery.  I ordered one that was leaking BADLY all over the bag it was in.  I am returning it.  I ordered a replacement, and it was also leaking inside the bag, but not as much lotion lost, so I will clean up and keep it.</li>
