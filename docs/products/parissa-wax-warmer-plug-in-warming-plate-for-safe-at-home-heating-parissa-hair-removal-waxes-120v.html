            <li>it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>

            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>good.....</li>
            <li>Also doubles as a cup warmer which is super awesome.</li>
            <li>Very important if you&#x27;re waxing..!</li>
            <li>This is a great warmer with a price at a fraction of the others I considered - I&#x27;m so glad that I chose it.</li>
            <li>works great, just like the ones in the salon, a MUCH better alternative than the honeybee wax warmer containers at sallys beauty supply.</li>
            <li>I just ended up microwaving my wax, with caution, but this is a good product for keeping the wax nice and warm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both the Parissa wax and the Sally Hansen wax, and despite my own ineptitude at keeping the wax from getting all over my bathroom, have been able to successfully use this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>not working doesnt warm the wax</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know what I will do with this nice warmer now.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own) and</li>
            <li>It does take a while for the wax to warm up.</li>
            <li>Now it doesn&#x27;t keep my wax warm.</li>
            <li>then I liked</li>
            <li>Between waxings I also use it to keep my tea cup warm.</li>
            <li>waxing, I still warm my wax in the microwave, give it a stir, and then stick it on the warming unit to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>It does not heat wax up, so that has to be done by another method to prep the wax; but it also does not keep the wax warm once it has been melted by an alternative method.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does take time to warm up</li>
            <li>To warm up the 6 ounce bottle, it took close to an hour.</li>
            <li>in all, a nice product.</li>
            <li>good for many use , thakyou</li>
            <li>Great service and quick shipping.     </li>
            <li>Not all wax comes in a suitable container to work on this heater.</li>
            <li>Heats the wax appropriately, more effective than microwave heating.</li>
            <li>This item is a great idea and is much better than heating hot wax on a stove and pan.</li>
            <li>the product looks nice and probably easy to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this warmer quite some time back (not at Amazon) and it was excellent.</li>
            <li>Your better off using the stove in your kitchen.</li>
            <li>It works OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this warmer.</li>
            <li>this is the ONLY place i could find the warming plate, and for a great price!</li>
            <li>I Like the flexibility of being able to set any jar of wax on top.  </li>
            <li>I purchased with the Moom brand wax and have been pleased.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my Parissa wax warmer.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you set a timer.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this warmer, hope it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li>It keeps wax at good warm-&gt;hot temperature (not too hot and not too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good quality too, I&#x27;ve had mine for years</li>
            <li>I am new to waxing and have been pleased with the efficiency, cost effectiveness and ability to wax on my own schedule and in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li>Something to keep in mind, but for regular waxes it should be ideal.</li>
            <li>If you do not wax much this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that someone might get burned by mistake, while I was not around waiting for it to warm the wax.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it warms up the wax to the right &#x27;spreadable&#x27; consistency and temperature (it does not burn my skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aahhh.. so easy.</li>
            <li>Thus, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the wax tempreture easily.</li>
            <li>Warmer scratches easily</li>
            <li>If you give it about an hour, it will work fine.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fine with me since I&#x27;m always multitasking.     </li>
            <li>This works fine and is safer but takes longer.</li>
            <li>However, this one is just fine for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this works just fine</li>
            <li>This warmer works fine.  </li>
            <li>But, it does control the temperature well, and it&#x27;s light and easy to store without being flimsy.</li>
            <li>Also, it may seem weired to put the plastic tub on the warmer, but it really is fine.</li>
            <li>and it still works fine.</li>
            <li>Perfect little warmer for a less than perfect wax!</li>
            <li>Just plug it in and put the wax container on it, while I do my morning routine, by the time I&#x27;m done and ready nice smooth wax is waiting for me.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much of a pain to warm the wax over a gas burner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wax is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>For me, that is no big deal for getting a great warmer at this price.</li>
            <li>I got it at a great price and it actually makes waxing effortless.</li>
            <li>Compact, doesn&#x27;t take up much counter room which is great because I don&#x27;t have much.</li>
            <li>You might even be able to buy one of those coffee warmers right here on amazon...</li>
            <li>The cool thing is that if wax gets on the surface, it easily comes off with vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Very economical for home use.</li>
            <li>I thought it to be a decent deal, but wish I would have purchased something a bit more stylish...</li>
            <li>I agree with my fellow reviewer, this is a good warmer if you&#x27;re willing to give it enough time to warm up.  </li>
            <li>but it makes sure the wax stays at a consistent tempurature while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>If this one dies someday I WILL buy another right away!</li>
            <li>It is also pretty easy to clean after your done using it and it stores well in its original box.</li>
            <li>Works well to heat the Parissa Hard Wax (great stuff!!)</li>
            <li>Turn it on and in about an hour with a really full thing of wax it will be melted.</li>
            <li>Even good for my teen.</li>
            <li>I just plug in the wax warmer in my bathroom and let it sit for a bit, and then it&#x27;s ready :)</li>
            <li>warms up quickly and holds the temperature</li>
            <li>Very simple and convenient to use, works well, on most days does not take more than 15 mins to heat up.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick and as described.</li>
            <li>I just thought you should be aware that this is a commonly available product, in case yours burns out and you need to replace it quicker than quick.</li>
            <li>Bought this item with two other Parissa waxes, quick to warm up and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it enough but pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful, and easy to store, plus it really works.</li>
            <li>I have used Parissa Studio Warm Wax on my upper lip and the peach fuzz on my face for years</li>
            <li>The heating temp is not sufficient enough to heat any kind of wax.</li>
            <li>Not even worth the money.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than the old one.</li>
            <li>The only reason I use it anymore is to warm candles...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment, trust me.</li>
            <li>It took about 30 min to get the wax at the right consistency, it made waxing a breeze.  </li>
            <li>get the warmer, and melt your wax the right way.</li>
            <li>the warmer kept it at the right temperature while I was waxing.</li>
            <li>I could never get it just right.</li>
            <li>It does the job, it may take longer than you wish but its the right consistency and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to warm the wax up to a useable temperature, however it does keep it at the right heat.</li>
            <li>It does warm the wax, it just takes an incredibly long time.</li>
            <li>It takes at least 45 minutes to warm up if you use the Parissa wax, so make sure you plan ahead.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it works well enough.</li>
            <li>This is the first time, I am waxing at home</li>
            <li>This wax warmer works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It melts the wax without getting it too hot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry about burning myself with wax that&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to melt but that ensures its not too hot.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Parissa!</li>
            <li>It has pretty design</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty flimsy, too.</li>
            <li>This thing is SLOW to heat up (1+ hours), but works great after that.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get overly hot and it melts the wax without any problems.</li>
            <li>does everything it is suppose to was delivered quickly im overall satisfied</li>
            <li>Heats my wax and keeps it hot while I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty flimsy, too.</li>
            <li>It does get hot and takes awhile to heat your wax but it works.</li>
            <li>You do have to unplug it so it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get too hot and seems well made with an inline on/off switch.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to buy the hot wax, you may as well purchase this as well.</li>
            <li>THis is great-takes about a half hour to warm the wax to the right temperature.  </li>
            <li>This warmer worked very well, and I found it to heat up very fast.  </li>
            <li>It did not keep it at a good temperature, the wax was not thick enough to stay on the stick very well and it definitely felt too hot for my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this product with the Parissa hot wax, this little warmer takes up little space and keeps the wax at a nice, warm temperature for use.</li>
            <li>I bought this instead of getting a Gigi wax warmer because it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t care too much about the price, except my tin of wax (Cirepil)</li>
            <li>was too big to fit on the heating plate.</li>
            <li>it makes it so much easier.  </li>
            <li>This product has made my home waxing sessions so much easier,</li>
            <li>I really thought that this would make it so the wax was the correct temperature</li>
            <li>It was a whole 30 minutes of waiting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for home waxing!</li>
            <li>Works very well with sugar scrub wax.  </li>
            <li>I really like this warmer.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the easiest wax warmer.</li>
            <li>I put mine a stainless steel bowl/pot and set it on the warmer.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>only possible use: put the wax in the micro and then use this  jst to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>Very cheap compared to other wax warmers.</li>
            <li>I bought this warmer mainly to keep the wax warm while I was working with it, so I popped my wax in the microwave for a few seconds (after waiting 30 minutes for the warmer to heat it up on</li>
            <li>I myself have been getting my brows done for years at various salons, and most recently started at a waxing-only place that taught me that the wax does not have to be quite as hot in order to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this takes entirely too long to warm up wax.  </li>
            <li>Mind you, it takes about an hour and a half to get the wax to the right temperature but it is just right and stays just right.</li>
            <li>Spend a little bit more money and buy the real deal, not this crappy non-functioning thing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommanded.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hot enough to keep anything warm.</li>
            <li>I only wish there were a temperature regulator because after a certain amount of time, I have to take the jar off of the warmer to keep it from getting too hot.</li>
            <li>had a professional warmer before, but this one is much much easier to transport, since I tend to move alot.</li>
            <li>A few times I had to microwave my wax because the top wax on the sides got cooler</li>
            <li>Overall it was worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The only thing it is good for is sitting in my closet for the past 4 years collecting dust.</li>
            <li>The temperature thing is probably just a personal preference, but something worth considering.</li>
            <li>Even at the lowest possible setting, sometimes it would get much too hot.</li>
            <li>It is also nice because it heats the wax slowly.  </li>
            <li>For the casual home waxer this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>It takes about 20-30 minutes to warm up and only warms up the bottom half of my wax container.</li>
            <li>Then this warmer is essential to keep the wax at the right temp while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>--licensed nail technician/brand new salon owner</li>
            <li>I ordered a new product</li>
            <li>I should have gotten a new product because I paid for new.</li>
            <li>, no plug cover our any signs of a brand new package.</li>
            <li>I heat the wax in the microwave first, because this warmer does take longer to melt the wax initially.</li>
            <li>but the fact is that if you buy one of those \\&quot;coffee warmers\\&quot; from Walmart, it does the EXACT SAME THING.</li>
            <li>(Sally Hansen and one other popular one that I can&#x27;t remember) and even though the containers are made of slightly different material and shaped slightly differently, the warmer works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus the black part had light marks on it.</li>
            <li>(it was back in Mexico), and it took me just as long to melt the wax appropriately over a gas burner anyway, and it was a bigger pain.  </li>
            <li>and I still have some trouble with applying precisely</li>
            <li>It takes about an hour to completely the wax up to the working temperature.</li>
            <li>and you can see white marks on the black surface, but it doesn&#x27;t stop the warmer from working optimally! :)</li>
            <li>The warmer is small enough to store almost anywhere and keeps the wax consistently warm enough to use.</li>
            <li>The size is exactly the same,the plug looked the same, was mounted in the same place on the unit, etc...</li>
            <li>While my husband has never complained about it being too hot, I prefer slightly cooler temps for myself.  </li>
            <li>Besides, you know it&#x27;s going to cool down eventually and unless you want to wax in the kitchen, you&#x27;re going to have to keep running back and forth to reheat it.</li>
            <li>It is also smaller then the usual warmers so easy to store.</li>
            <li>It is a little on the hot side.</li>
            <li>Parissa does have a product with a wide flat base that works the best of those I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it works pretty well.</li>

            <li> It does take a while for the wax to warm up.</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t keep my wax warm.</li>
            <li> then I liked</li>
            <li> Between waxings I also use it to keep my tea cup warm.</li>
            <li> waxing, I still warm my wax in the microwave, give it a stir, and then stick it on the warming unit to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> It does not heat wax up, so that has to be done by another method to prep the wax; but it also does not keep the wax warm once it has been melted by an alternative method.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does take time to warm up</li>
            <li> To warm up the 6 ounce bottle, it took close to an hour.</li>
            <li> in all, a nice product.</li>
            <li> good for many use , thakyou</li>
            <li> Great service and quick shipping.     </li>
            <li> Not all wax comes in a suitable container to work on this heater.</li>
            <li> Heats the wax appropriately, more effective than microwave heating.</li>
            <li> This item is a great idea and is much better than heating hot wax on a stove and pan.</li>
            <li> the product looks nice and probably easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this warmer quite some time back (not at Amazon) and it was excellent.</li>
            <li> Your better off using the stove in your kitchen.</li>
            <li> It works OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this warmer.</li>
            <li> this is the ONLY place i could find the warming plate, and for a great price!</li>
            <li> I Like the flexibility of being able to set any jar of wax on top.  </li>
            <li> I purchased with the Moom brand wax and have been pleased.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my Parissa wax warmer.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you set a timer.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this warmer, hope it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> It keeps wax at good warm-&gt;hot temperature (not too hot and not too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good quality too, I&#x27;ve had mine for years</li>
            <li> I am new to waxing and have been pleased with the efficiency, cost effectiveness and ability to wax on my own schedule and in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li> Something to keep in mind, but for regular waxes it should be ideal.</li>
            <li> If you do not wax much this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that someone might get burned by mistake, while I was not around waiting for it to warm the wax.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it warms up the wax to the right &#x27;spreadable&#x27; consistency and temperature (it does not burn my skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aahhh.. so easy.</li>
            <li> Thus, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the wax tempreture easily.</li>
            <li> Warmer scratches easily</li>
            <li> If you give it about an hour, it will work fine.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s fine with me since I&#x27;m always multitasking.     </li>
            <li> This works fine and is safer but takes longer.</li>
            <li> However, this one is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this works just fine</li>
            <li> This warmer works fine.  </li>
            <li> But, it does control the temperature well, and it&#x27;s light and easy to store without being flimsy.</li>
            <li> Also, it may seem weired to put the plastic tub on the warmer, but it really is fine.</li>
            <li> and it still works fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect little warmer for a less than perfect wax!</li>
            <li> Just plug it in and put the wax container on it, while I do my morning routine, by the time I&#x27;m done and ready nice smooth wax is waiting for me.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much of a pain to warm the wax over a gas burner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wax is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> For me, that is no big deal for getting a great warmer at this price.</li>
            <li> I got it at a great price and it actually makes waxing effortless.</li>
            <li> Compact, doesn&#x27;t take up much counter room which is great because I don&#x27;t have much.</li>
            <li> You might even be able to buy one of those coffee warmers right here on amazon...</li>
            <li> The cool thing is that if wax gets on the surface, it easily comes off with vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> Very economical for home use.</li>
            <li> I thought it to be a decent deal, but wish I would have purchased something a bit more stylish...</li>
            <li> I agree with my fellow reviewer, this is a good warmer if you&#x27;re willing to give it enough time to warm up.  </li>
            <li> but it makes sure the wax stays at a consistent tempurature while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> If this one dies someday I WILL buy another right away!</li>
            <li> It is also pretty easy to clean after your done using it and it stores well in its original box.</li>
            <li> Works well to heat the Parissa Hard Wax (great stuff!!)</li>
            <li> Turn it on and in about an hour with a really full thing of wax it will be melted.</li>
            <li> Even good for my teen.</li>
            <li> I just plug in the wax warmer in my bathroom and let it sit for a bit, and then it&#x27;s ready :)</li>
            <li> warms up quickly and holds the temperature</li>
            <li> Very simple and convenient to use, works well, on most days does not take more than 15 mins to heat up.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and as described.</li>
            <li> I just thought you should be aware that this is a commonly available product, in case yours burns out and you need to replace it quicker than quick.</li>
            <li> Bought this item with two other Parissa waxes, quick to warm up and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it enough but pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful, and easy to store, plus it really works.</li>
            <li> I have used Parissa Studio Warm Wax on my upper lip and the peach fuzz on my face for years</li>
            <li> The heating temp is not sufficient enough to heat any kind of wax.</li>
            <li> Not even worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than the old one.</li>
            <li> The only reason I use it anymore is to warm candles...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment, trust me.</li>
            <li> It took about 30 min to get the wax at the right consistency, it made waxing a breeze.  </li>
            <li> get the warmer, and melt your wax the right way.</li>
            <li> the warmer kept it at the right temperature while I was waxing.</li>
            <li> I could never get it just right.</li>
            <li> It does the job, it may take longer than you wish but its the right consistency and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to warm the wax up to a useable temperature, however it does keep it at the right heat.</li>
            <li> It does warm the wax, it just takes an incredibly long time.</li>
            <li> It takes at least 45 minutes to warm up if you use the Parissa wax, so make sure you plan ahead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it works well enough.</li>
            <li> This is the first time, I am waxing at home</li>
            <li> This wax warmer works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It melts the wax without getting it too hot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about burning myself with wax that&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to melt but that ensures its not too hot.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and Parissa!</li>
            <li> It has pretty design</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty flimsy, too.</li>
            <li> This thing is SLOW to heat up (1+ hours), but works great after that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get overly hot and it melts the wax without any problems.</li>
            <li> does everything it is suppose to was delivered quickly im overall satisfied</li>
            <li> Heats my wax and keeps it hot while I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty flimsy, too.</li>
            <li> It does get hot and takes awhile to heat your wax but it works.</li>
            <li> You do have to unplug it so it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get too hot and seems well made with an inline on/off switch.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy the hot wax, you may as well purchase this as well.</li>
            <li> THis is great-takes about a half hour to warm the wax to the right temperature.  </li>
            <li> This warmer worked very well, and I found it to heat up very fast.  </li>
            <li> It did not keep it at a good temperature, the wax was not thick enough to stay on the stick very well and it definitely felt too hot for my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the Parissa hot wax, this little warmer takes up little space and keeps the wax at a nice, warm temperature for use.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of getting a Gigi wax warmer because it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t care too much about the price, except my tin of wax (Cirepil)</li>
            <li> was too big to fit on the heating plate.</li>
            <li> it makes it so much easier.  </li>
            <li> This product has made my home waxing sessions so much easier,</li>
            <li> I really thought that this would make it so the wax was the correct temperature</li>
            <li> It was a whole 30 minutes of waiting.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for home waxing!</li>
            <li> Works very well with sugar scrub wax.  </li>
            <li> I really like this warmer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the easiest wax warmer.</li>
            <li> I put mine a stainless steel bowl/pot and set it on the warmer.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> only possible use: put the wax in the micro and then use this  jst to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> Very cheap compared to other wax warmers.</li>
            <li> I bought this warmer mainly to keep the wax warm while I was working with it, so I popped my wax in the microwave for a few seconds (after waiting 30 minutes for the warmer to heat it up on</li>
            <li> I myself have been getting my brows done for years at various salons, and most recently started at a waxing-only place that taught me that the wax does not have to be quite as hot in order to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this takes entirely too long to warm up wax.  </li>
            <li> Mind you, it takes about an hour and a half to get the wax to the right temperature but it is just right and stays just right.</li>
            <li> Spend a little bit more money and buy the real deal, not this crappy non-functioning thing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommanded.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hot enough to keep anything warm.</li>
            <li> I only wish there were a temperature regulator because after a certain amount of time, I have to take the jar off of the warmer to keep it from getting too hot.</li>
            <li> had a professional warmer before, but this one is much much easier to transport, since I tend to move alot.</li>
            <li> A few times I had to microwave my wax because the top wax on the sides got cooler</li>
            <li> Overall it was worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The only thing it is good for is sitting in my closet for the past 4 years collecting dust.</li>
            <li> The temperature thing is probably just a personal preference, but something worth considering.</li>
            <li> Even at the lowest possible setting, sometimes it would get much too hot.</li>
            <li> It is also nice because it heats the wax slowly.  </li>
            <li> For the casual home waxer this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> It takes about 20-30 minutes to warm up and only warms up the bottom half of my wax container.</li>
            <li> Then this warmer is essential to keep the wax at the right temp while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> --licensed nail technician/brand new salon owner</li>
            <li> I ordered a new product</li>
            <li> I should have gotten a new product because I paid for new.</li>
            <li> , no plug cover our any signs of a brand new package.</li>
            <li> I heat the wax in the microwave first, because this warmer does take longer to melt the wax initially.</li>
            <li> but the fact is that if you buy one of those \\&quot;coffee warmers\\&quot; from Walmart, it does the EXACT SAME THING.</li>
            <li> (Sally Hansen and one other popular one that I can&#x27;t remember) and even though the containers are made of slightly different material and shaped slightly differently, the warmer works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus the black part had light marks on it.</li>
            <li> (it was back in Mexico), and it took me just as long to melt the wax appropriately over a gas burner anyway, and it was a bigger pain.  </li>
            <li> and I still have some trouble with applying precisely</li>
            <li> It takes about an hour to completely the wax up to the working temperature.</li>
            <li> and you can see white marks on the black surface, but it doesn&#x27;t stop the warmer from working optimally! :)</li>
            <li> The warmer is small enough to store almost anywhere and keeps the wax consistently warm enough to use.</li>
            <li> The size is exactly the same,the plug looked the same, was mounted in the same place on the unit, etc...</li>
            <li> While my husband has never complained about it being too hot, I prefer slightly cooler temps for myself.  </li>
            <li> Besides, you know it&#x27;s going to cool down eventually and unless you want to wax in the kitchen, you&#x27;re going to have to keep running back and forth to reheat it.</li>
            <li> It is also smaller then the usual warmers so easy to store.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the hot side.</li>
            <li> Parissa does have a product with a wide flat base that works the best of those I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is also very small so people with limited space, it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> This wax warmer does not work and is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t careful you could end up with red swollen skin for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> but, when i heat my honey it take a long time around 45</li>
            <li> As a result, I haven&#x27;t had any skin flare ups from overheated wax or leftover hairs from not hot enough wax.</li>
            <li> Only down side is the amount of time it takes to heat - about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> does the job as expected</li>
            <li> Does not heat as expected.</li>
            <li> it works exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> It looked suspicious because the box wasn&#x27;t taped, the wrap around the device wasn&#x27;t tape closed</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it takes soooo long for the wax to melt.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by the other reviewers, this product needs time to heat up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) Works on other wax containers too</li>
            <li> I think you could heat up the was in other ways beside having to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase sometime ago have used on several occasions works well ability to find in superstores is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again because the alternative is far worse.</li>
            <li> not too hot, not too cold.  </li>
            <li> no more running back and forth to the microwave, less wax wasted when it gets too thick to spread well.    </li>
            <li> It works well, you just need to have a little patience.</li>
            <li> Moom sugar wax and from experience this plate gets the sugar wax a few degrees hotter than what it should.  </li>
            <li> I usually turn it on a half hour before use or boil my wax for a minute or two before I use it.</li>
            <li> I waste less wax that way because it never globs up of goes on too thick.</li>
            <li> arrived in time  ..heats up a little slowly, but guess, this is how it should be.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the small wax pots for years and had gotten used to putting a triple layer of tin foil under my wax pot on the stove so that I didn&#x27;t end up with wax on my burner.  </li>
            <li> No more worries.  </li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is now 2015, it is too late.</li>
            <li> Works but really slow to heat</li>
            <li> I mean, look</li>
            <li> The product I ordered to use with it was not good (to me)</li>
            <li> But I MUST share a secret I learned about this...</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than heating wax and running to the bathroom with it.  </li>
            <li> I do like that you can use virtually any wax you want so long as it fits on the base.  </li>
            <li> sorry Parissa company</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally useless, could wait  for hours</li>
            <li> Waste of $$$$$ and time, so disappointing :-(</li>
            <li> but it left a horrible residue all over the base.</li>
            <li> and I was so angry when this never even turned on!</li>
            <li> and I was so angry when this never even turned on!  </li>
            <li> If you spill on the warmer or the plastic surface, the wax (just like any kitchen/bathroom surface) will stick and is impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This was turned out to be horrible purchase.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it enough but pretty good</li>
            <li> I heat the wax in the microwave first, because this warmer does take longer to melt the wax initially. Then this warmer is essential to keep the wax at the right temp while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> not working doesnt warm the wax</li>
            <li> This warmer worked very well, and I found it to heat up very fast.  The product I ordered to use with it was not good (to me) so I don&#x27;t know what I will do with this nice warmer now.  Maybe use it for a scented candle.  Good buy!                                                       Toni</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of getting a Gigi wax warmer because it was much cheaper. It took about 30 min to get the wax at the right consistency, it made waxing a breeze.  I like how its not big and bulky so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. I am very happy with this warmer, hope it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this warmer quite some time back (not at Amazon) and it was excellent. But I MUST share a secret I learned about this...sorry Parissa company but the fact is that if you buy one of those \\&quot;coffee warmers\\&quot; from Walmart, it does the EXACT SAME THING. Then it occurred to me, it IS the same thing. I compared the two items side-by-size and they are alike in every way. The size is exactly the same,the plug looked the same, was mounted in the same place on the unit, etc... The one difference was that the Parissa item says \\&quot;Parissa\\&quot; on it, and the coffee warmer from Walmart does not. I just thought you should be aware that this is a commonly available product, in case yours burns out and you need to replace it quicker than quick. You might even be able to buy one of those coffee warmers right here on amazon...</li>
            <li> I have been using the small wax pots for years and had gotten used to putting a triple layer of tin foil under my wax pot on the stove so that I didn&#x27;t end up with wax on my burner.  This product is fantastic.  No more worries.  It is also nice because it heats the wax slowly.  I find the the wax isn&#x27;t getting as brittle over time.</li>
            <li> This is the same thing as a mug warmer or candle warmer. The instructions even say \\&quot;mug warmer.\\&quot; I saw some on sale at Michael&#x27;s craft store for just $3 or $4. I wouldn&#x27;t care too much about the price, except my tin of wax (Cirepil) was too big to fit on the heating plate. I think Gigi wax tins are the same size.</li>
            <li> If you are going to get the Parissa wax, get the warmer.  It&#x27;s too much of a pain to warm the wax over a gas burner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it takes awhile to melt the wax.  Start melting the wax and go work on the computer for awhile.  In this day and age, I think that we can all find something to do while we wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is fantastic.  I was without my warmer in the states (it was back in Mexico), and it took me just as long to melt the wax appropriately over a gas burner anyway, and it was a bigger pain.  Melting the wax inappropriately and faster is not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get the warmer, and melt your wax the right way.</li>
            <li> This warmer is a joke. Your better off using the stove in your kitchen.</li>
            <li> It makes waxing a breeze. Just plug it in and put the wax container on it, while I do my morning routine, by the time I&#x27;m done and ready nice smooth wax is waiting for me. Aahhh.. so easy.</li>
            <li> I have used Parissa Studio Warm Wax on my upper lip and the peach fuzz on my face for years but I dreaded the process of heating the wax.  Using this warmer it makes it so much easier.  It takes longer to heat up but I can turn it on and leave it without worrying about it burning or overheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats the wax up to the perfect temperature so I don&#x27;t burn myself.  If this one dies someday I WILL buy another right away!</li>
            <li> The warmer takes awhile to heat the wax to a usable temperature (45 minutes) but once it is warmed up the wax stays at an ideal temperature.  This product has made my home waxing sessions so much easier, no more running back and forth to the microwave, less wax wasted when it gets too thick to spread well.    For the casual home waxer this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> the product looks nice and probably easy to use. didn&#x27;t try it yet though. I&#x27;m pretty sure it works well enough.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by the other reviewers, this product needs time to heat up. If you give it about an hour, it will work fine. I bought this warmer mainly to keep the wax warm while I was working with it, so I popped my wax in the microwave for a few seconds (after waiting 30 minutes for the warmer to heat it up on it&#x27;s own) and the warmer kept it at the right temperature while I was waxing.</li>
            <li> Great service and quick shipping.     The wax warmer works veryyyyy well. It&#x27;s amazing. It does take a while for the wax to warm up. But it&#x27;s fine with me since I&#x27;m always multitasking.     Definitely a recommendation</li>
            <li> perfect for warming my parissa wax</li>
            <li> This was turned out to be horrible purchase. The heating temp is not sufficient enough to heat any kind of wax. Returned the item to amazon and waiting for confirmation. Just dont go for it.</li>
            <li> I really thought that this would make it so the wax was the correct temperature and so that I didn&#x27;t have to run back and forth to the stove… but I was disappointed. I would have been just as well of as buying a candle warmer! It did not keep it at a good temperature, the wax was not thick enough to stay on the stick very well and it definitely felt too hot for my skin. I have to keep turning the warmer on and off and worry about the temperature of the wax. This is NOT why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this. Worked well for about 3 uses. Now it doesn&#x27;t keep my wax warm. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> arrived in time  ..heats up a little slowly, but guess, this is how it should be.  This is the first time, I am waxing at home and I still have some trouble with applying precisely, it&#x27;ll take some time to get &#x27;good at it&#x27;, and I will keep on trying</li>
            <li> This wax warmer works pretty well. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it works pretty well. A few times I had to microwave my wax because the top wax on the sides got cooler then I liked but it wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. It is also pretty easy to clean after your done using it and it stores well in its original box. Overall it was worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> It does warm the wax, it just takes an incredibly long time. When ever I need to wax something or someone, I have to turn it on hours before I can use it. Not even worth the money. Save it and buy a good warmer.</li>
            <li> I received a unit that is different from the one pictured. It works OK so I kept it. Between waxings I also use it to keep my tea cup warm. The cord is annoyingly short and an extension cord is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For waxing, I still warm my wax in the microwave, give it a stir, and then stick it on the warming unit to keep it warm. My house is cold in the winter and without microwaving, the warming unit along doesn&#x27;t ever get the wax warm enough. For this price it should get hotter than that and maybe include a variable temperature control. And, of course, be the product pictured!</li>
            <li> Bought this product expecting it to be labeled as &amp;#34;Parissa&amp;#34; instead what I got was an item labeled &amp;#34;Candle Warmers.&amp;#34;  Sending it back.</li>
            <li> This wax warmer does not work and is a complete waste of money. I would return it, but seeing how I bought it in 2011 and it is now 2015, it is too late. The only thing it is good for is sitting in my closet for the past 4 years collecting dust. It does not heat wax up, so that has to be done by another method to prep the wax; but it also does not keep the wax warm once it has been melted by an alternative method. Waste of $$$$$ and time, so disappointing :-(</li>
            <li> This item is a great idea and is much better than heating hot wax on a stove and pan. The only complaint is that it takes soooo long for the wax to melt. It was a whole 30 minutes of waiting. I would buy it again because the alternative is far worse. This is also very small so people with limited space, it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Unit arrived in a box that looked opened. Quality was fair.&lt;br /&gt;Would not have purchased had I seen it in person.</li>
            <li> I know the item from my friend. it realy works. This product is perfect to use. I highly recommanded. Thus, it is easy to use. You can adjust the wax tempreture easily.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to warm the wax up to a useable temperature, however it does keep it at the right heat. Not all wax comes in a suitable container to work on this heater. Parissa does have a product with a wide flat base that works the best of those I have tried.</li>
            <li> If you give this warmer enough time it&#x27;s a very good product. Mind you, it takes about an hour and a half to get the wax to the right temperature but it is just right and stays just right. Very important if you&#x27;re waxing..!</li>
            <li> This works fine and is safer but takes longer. I tend to use the microwave though.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than the old one. Turn it on and in about an hour with a really full thing of wax it will be melted.</li>
            <li> I usually turn it on a half hour before use or boil my wax for a minute or two before I use it. It does take a while to heat up but it makes sure the wax stays at a consistent tempurature while I&#x27;m using it. I waste less wax that way because it never globs up of goes on too thick. It is a little on the hot side. Also doubles as a cup warmer which is super awesome. Coffee that stays warm while I&#x27;m drinking it! Yes.</li>
            <li> Perfect little warmer for a less than perfect wax! We will find a solution for the wax but it left a horrible residue all over the base.</li>
            <li> does the job as expected</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Works on other wax containers too (Sally Hansen and one other popular one that I can&#x27;t remember) and even though the containers are made of slightly different material and shaped slightly differently, the warmer works.&lt;br /&gt;2) It keeps wax at good warm-&gt;hot temperature (not too hot and not too thick).&lt;br /&gt;3) Small, lightweight, affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) If you spill on the warmer or the plastic surface, the wax (just like any kitchen/bathroom surface) will stick and is impossible to remove. There are tricks to removing this wax but they work on hardwood surfaces; but not on plastic (and definitely not on the warmer/black surface. That will scratch.)&lt;br /&gt;2) Warmer scratches easily and you can see white marks on the black surface, but it doesn&#x27;t stop the warmer from working optimally! :)</li>
            <li> Does not heat as expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Parissa wax and wanted the wax warmer. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. I suppose you could purchase a regular wax warmer and get the same results. However, this one is just fine for me. It melts the wax without getting it too hot. I don&#x27;t worry about burning myself with wax that&#x27;s too hot. It takes a while to melt but that ensures its not too hot.</li>
            <li> This is a great warmer with a price at a fraction of the others I considered - I&#x27;m so glad that I chose it. Yes, it does take time to warm up - simply start it 45 minutes to one hour before you plan to use the wax. For me, that is no big deal for getting a great warmer at this price. Thanks Amazon and Parissa!</li>
            <li> I made this purchase sometime ago have used on several occasions works well ability to find in superstores is hard to find. But I have no complaints with it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I use M4Men Moom sugar wax and from experience this plate gets the sugar wax a few degrees hotter than what it should.  Not enough to cause a 2nd or 3rd degree burn but if you aren&#x27;t careful you could end up with red swollen skin for a couple of days.  Something to keep in mind, but for regular waxes it should be ideal.</li>
            <li> I love this warmer. It did the job as it indicated. Good choice.</li>
            <li> Perfect with Parissa wax.  warms up quickly and holds the temperature so you don&#x27;t have to keep warming it up and risk overheating.</li>
            <li> Excellent, save yourself money wax at home!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very simple and convenient to use, works well, on most days does not take more than 15 mins to heat up. Very economical for home use. Good buy.</li>
            <li> works great, just like the ones in the salon, a MUCH better alternative than the honeybee wax warmer containers at sallys beauty supply. this is the ONLY place i could find the warming plate, and for a great price! --licensed nail technician/brand new salon owner</li>
            <li> It has pretty design but, when i heat my honey it take a long time around 45-60mins i don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> This item was a repackaged generic wax warmer, not a parissa warmer (as pictures and described)</li>
            <li> THis is great-takes about a half hour to warm the wax to the right temperature.  not too hot, not too cold.  Even good for my teen. I Like the flexibility of being able to set any jar of wax on top.  I purchased with the Moom brand wax and have been pleased.  I am new to waxing and have been pleased with the efficiency, cost effectiveness and ability to wax on my own schedule and in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li> Works but really slow to heat</li>
            <li> Great product thank you.  Nothing worse than heating wax and running to the bathroom with it.  Arrived quick and as described.</li>
            <li> Bought this item with two other Parissa waxes, quick to warm up and easy to clean. It is also smaller then the usual warmers so easy to store.</li>
            <li> This never worked. So disappointed. I need a wax warmer for my bathroom and I was so angry when this never even turned on! It&#x27;s pretty flimsy, too.</li>
            <li> This thing is SLOW to heat up (1+ hours), but works great after that.</li>
            <li> I bought this so my husband could avoid going to the salon to wax his chest.  I myself have been getting my brows done for years at various salons, and most recently started at a waxing-only place that taught me that the wax does not have to be quite as hot in order to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this works just fine, I prefer one that has multiple settings so you can adjust to your needs.  While my husband has never complained about it being too hot, I prefer slightly cooler temps for myself.  I do like that you can use virtually any wax you want so long as it fits on the base.  I&#x27;ve used both the Parissa wax and the Sally Hansen wax, and despite my own ineptitude at keeping the wax from getting all over my bathroom, have been able to successfully use this.  The temperature thing is probably just a personal preference, but something worth considering.</li>
            <li> This warmer works fine.  I thought it to be a decent deal, but wish I would have purchased something a bit more stylish... The only reason I use it anymore is to warm candles... It&#x27;s just a regular warmer.</li>
            <li> Heated the wax in the wax holder just great and seemed to be the perfect temp for using the wax.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly! It doesn&#x27;t get overly hot and it melts the wax without any problems. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent and affordable!!</li>
            <li> does everything it is suppose to was delivered quickly im overall satisfied</li>
            <li> It works great! I don&#x27;t have to put the wax pot on the stove anymore and wax in the kitchen! I just plug in the wax warmer in my bathroom and let it sit for a bit, and then it&#x27;s ready :)</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my Parissa wax warmer. I got it at a great price and it actually makes waxing effortless. I would use the microwave to heat my wax up before. I could never get it just right. This warmer gets the wax at the perfect heat and consistency in just under 30 minutes. As a result, I haven&#x27;t had any skin flare ups from overheated wax or leftover hairs from not hot enough wax. Highly recommend for home waxing!</li>
            <li> I bought the Parissa wax warmer to pair up with the Moom organic wax product. To warm up the 6 ounce bottle, it took close to an hour. That is the only con of this product. I was concerned that someone might get burned by mistake, while I was not around waiting for it to warm the wax.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it warms up the wax to the right &#x27;spreadable&#x27; consistency and temperature (it does not burn my skin)&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a nice product.</li>
            <li> It takes about 20-30 minutes to warm up and only warms up the bottom half of my wax container. I just ended up microwaving my wax, with caution, but this is a good product for keeping the wax nice and warm. Very cheap compared to other wax warmers. If you do not wax much this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally useless, could wait  for hours and it wouldn&#x27;t warn up the wax. only possible use: put the wax in the micro and then use this  jst to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> there is no need for running to the oven or microwave in the middle of waxing, I like this product.</li>
            <li> Left it on for around 15 mins and the heater plate was steaming and its sides had melted into the plastic outside! Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Works very well with sugar scrub wax.  You do not have to go back and forth between the microwave.  It heats the wax to the perfect temperature.  It takes about an hour to completely the wax up to the working temperature.</li>
            <li> good.....but heat control is not present....We need to check before applying the wax</li>
            <li> I really like this warmer. It&#x27;s small and compact.&lt;br /&gt;I had a professional warmer before, but this one is much much easier to transport, since I tend to move alot.</li>
            <li> I agree with my fellow reviewer, this is a good warmer if you&#x27;re willing to give it enough time to warm up.  It takes at least 45 minutes to warm up if you use the Parissa wax, so make sure you plan ahead.  But, it does control the temperature well, and it&#x27;s light and easy to store without being flimsy.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new product but I received a used and open one. I should have gotten a new product because I paid for new.</li>
            <li> Dunno what else to say besides it works exactly as I expected. Heats my wax and keeps it hot while I use it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the easiest wax warmer. Compact, doesn&#x27;t take up much counter room which is great because I don&#x27;t have much.</li>
            <li> This never worked.  So disappointed.  I need a wax warmer for my bathroom and I was so angry when this never even turned on!  It&#x27;s pretty flimsy, too.</li>
            <li> For years I heated wax on the stove. Even at the lowest possible setting, sometimes it would get much too hot. I also tried the microwave with the same result. With this wax warmer the wax is melted and held at the perfect temperature to get the job done.</li>
            <li> this takes entirely too long to warm up wax.  i would not buy this product again or recommend it just because the delay makes it unusable.</li>
            <li> It does the job, it may take longer than you wish but its the right consistency and it doesn&#x27;t burn. Just make sure you set a timer. I put mine a stainless steel bowl/pot and set it on the warmer.  I time mine for about 20-40 minutes depending on the newness of the wax. It works well, you just need to have a little patience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hot enough to keep anything warm. It can&#x27;t even fulfill its only job! Spend a little bit more money and buy the real deal, not this crappy non-functioning thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the Parissa hot wax, this little warmer takes up little space and keeps the wax at a nice, warm temperature for use.</li>
            <li> good for many use , thakyou</li>
            <li> It looked suspicious because the box wasn&#x27;t taped, the wrap around the device wasn&#x27;t tape closed, no plug cover our any signs of a brand new package. Plus the black part had light marks on it. It does get hot and takes awhile to heat your wax but it works. You do have to unplug it so it doesn&#x27;t get too hot. You basically get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> it works as designed. I think you could heat up the was in other ways beside having to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I only wish there were a temperature regulator because after a certain amount of time, I have to take the jar off of the warmer to keep it from getting too hot.</li>
            <li> If you are buying the wax this is a must. The cool thing is that if wax gets on the surface, it easily comes off with vegetable oil. Also, it may seem weired to put the plastic tub on the warmer, but it really is fine.</li>
            <li> use to heat up shave cream</li>
            <li> Heats the wax appropriately, more effective than microwave heating. I was heating wax in microwave before I bought this, and it was over heating wax resulting in burning my skin. Only down side is the amount of time it takes to heat - about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Works well for the No-Tweeze hair remover wax.</li>
            <li> Works well to heat the Parissa Hard Wax (great stuff!!) Doesn&#x27;t get too hot and seems well made with an inline on/off switch.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy the hot wax, you may as well purchase this as well. It&#x27;s useful, and easy to store, plus it really works. I mean, look--we could heat it over the stove, in the microwave, whatever, but why risk it? Besides, you know it&#x27;s going to cool down eventually and unless you want to wax in the kitchen, you&#x27;re going to have to keep running back and forth to reheat it. The warmer is small enough to store almost anywhere and keeps the wax consistently warm enough to use. It&#x27;s pretty good quality too, I&#x27;ve had mine for years and it still works fine. It&#x27;s worth the investment, trust me.</li>
