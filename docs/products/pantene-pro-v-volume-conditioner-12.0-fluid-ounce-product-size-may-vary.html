    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>thing I like best about this conditioner is that it leaves my hair tangle-free after conditioning.</li>
            <li>The Pantene Pro-V line is quite impressive and an affordable price.</li>
            <li>The best part about this conditioner is that it doesnâ€™t make your hair oily.  </li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>This is another great Pantene product.</li>
            <li>They always use a conditioner, and this works great for them too.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Good option when looking for an inexpensive drugstore conditioner.</li>
            <li>I also loved that there are no sodium laurel sulfates in this Pantene Pro-V Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Pantene products are always dependably good.</li>
            <li>the price, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This conditioner did a good job of conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve just tried it once, it looks like this will be a good conditioner for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Pantene&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is really nice.</li>
            <li>There is a pronounced sweet berry fragrance that may or may not be too your liking but all told, its fairly pleasant and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>The product easily rinses out and does leave a nice, silky finish that holds up for hours on untreated hair.  </li>
            <li>Pantene has always been a favorite.  </li>
            <li>The end result is a well performing weightless conditioner that does add tangible volume and lift and becomes even more pronounced if blow drying is performed immediately</li>
            <li>This would be a good conditioner to use every day as it rinses cleanly but leaves the hair shiny and easy to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out various Pantene conditioners and am impressed by their effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I like them both, but the Volume conditioner provides a bit more bounce and smells nicer than the hydrating variety.</li>
            <li>For me, the main selling point of Pantene is how great the shampoos and conditioners smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got to say, this conditioner does a pretty good job of that.  </li>
            <li>Once dry, my hair looks great!</li>
            <li>It is a nice, mild scent.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>But it seems as it is easy to rinse off, and it leaves my hair softer and silkier out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This conditioner comes out of the bottle really easily.</li>
            <li>She reports to me that this does a fine job for what it says it can do - providing volume as it conditions her hair.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>All in all, though, it&#x27;s a decent product (one of the better ones from Pantene that I&#x27;ve ever used), so anyone who&#x27;s looking for a pretty good volumizing conditioner might want to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>This is nice, rich conditioner and great for detangling, though I would prefer less fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells great, just light and sort of spring fresh to me, not a heavy perfume.</li>
            <li>started using their Volume shampoo a while back, and decided to give the conditioner a try - and I&#x27;m happy that I did.  </li>
            <li>It is light but gets out tangles.  </li>
            <li>That said, the volume isn&#x27;t exactly spectacular, and as far as detangling, imparting shine, and things of that nature, the conditioner is just okay.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend it, but I do think it&#x27;s good to try out locally first if you can.</li>
            <li>It coats my hair well and rinsed out clean leaving a nice soft, shiny texture.</li>
            <li>But this conditioner works very well yet more unobtrusively.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad, by any means.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea why other companies don&#x27;t follow this great design.</li>
            <li>in all, I think this is a pretty good conditioner, but it may work better for someone with younger hair who doesn&#x27;t need so much in the way of shine enhancement.</li>
            <li>I have straight baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Mine is fine and really curly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not only surprised, I am really happy.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>I only had to use a slight amount to get the tangles out and the price is excellent for this type of quality.</li>
            <li>At first the conditioner left my hair flyaway &amp; full of static.</li>
            <li>I like that this conditioner does not weigh down my hair, or make it feel dirtier faster, and yet does a good job of conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I think the scent is too strong, and what it does for my short hair is nothing special.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft with good bounce without feeling greasy at the roots or flat in volume.  </li>
            <li>stars because it works well, but not appreciably better than similarly priced products I have used.</li>
            <li>After a short time, the static went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay, it was thinning ten years ago...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Pantene products before with reasonable success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is not overwhelming and is pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this conditioner didn&#x27;t have collagen in it.  </li>
            <li>While I did not especially notice more \\&quot;volume\\&quot; to my hair, the conditioning aspect is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it pretty much does what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair easy to comb, but I don&#x27;t notice any extra &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34;, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for me, it&#x27;s certainly five stars.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, and you do need to rinse well.</li>
            <li>This Pantene Volume version may very well be the answer.</li>
            <li>Nobody wants that.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, floaty and looks like I spent more than three minutes brushing it this morning.</li>
            <li>floral fragrance is very noticeable but fades.</li>
            <li>Either way, it left my hair smooth, silky and sleek.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t add too much time to a shower, and it doesn&#x27;t cost all that much.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice big bottle that should last you quite a bit of time as well.</li>
            <li>Recently, I have been using Nexxus, so it was really nice to switch off and go back to Pantene for a change.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh sort of scent that I can&#x27;t quite name, however, it is not super strong.</li>
            <li>I tried it myself and did not find that it had much impact on my own hair, which is pretty thick already.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance that I would call &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; that leaves behind a mild fragrance after drying.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel pretty soft, while leaving it bouncy.  </li>
            <li>I used this with the classic Pantene Shampoo.</li>
            <li>My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s occurred to me, shopping for conditioner, that all the many varieties of Pantene may all be the same product, in different bottles.</li>
            <li>I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top.</li>
            <li>This Volume Conditioner shampoo by Pantene does a nice job of conditioning my shoulder length, fine textured hair without weighing it down like some conditioners I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves it feeling smooth even when it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s designed to be a &#x27;thin&#x27; conditioner that feels good in your hair and creates</li>
            <li>On the other hand, my scalp appreciated the hydrating quality more in the dry desert air.</li>
            <li>Not crazy expensive, and an overall good product.  </li>
            <li>Looks like I have to use  a lot of it, certainly more then other conditioners I used, and still have hard time making sure it covers my entire head.</li>
            <li>conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair.</li>
            <li>With barely a scent, this rich white conditioner is lovely, leaving thin hair unweighted.</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is a pleasant, but not overpowering floral fragrance that is pretty typical for Pantene products (I&#x27;ve found), but what isn&#x27;t typical is that this conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave a coating on my hair as other Pantene products have done in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to spend as little as possible on shampoo and conditioner, so this is better</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised that this conditioner added volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it</li>
            <li>As far as the claim that it gave volume without weighing your hair down, I found that to be true.  </li>
            <li>I may still have a hard time choosing from among the many Pantene conditioners, depending on what mood my hair and scalp are in, but it seems as if Pantene has enough varieties to provide me with a solution for whatever follicular condition I have at the moment.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out clean, but my very thick hair was still tangle free while wet.</li>
            <li>I only use a conditioner when I have a new perm because they tend to dry out my hair, and this really helps.  </li>
            <li>Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I&#x27;m 50).</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, however, I have a lot of it, so it almost looks thick.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent, daily conditioner from Pantene.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works well (though no miracles should be expected) and, importantly for me, smells fine with a reasonably faint scent.</li>
            <li>small dab is all that is needed to adequately work through the hair.</li>
            <li>Lately, her hair has been looking better than ever, and this is certainly due in part to the product.</li>
            <li>My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product added much needed volume to my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>This is a normal thick conditioner, smells really floralish.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to write a review on conditioner - I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and think that it&#x27;s good - not great.</li>

            <li> I may still have a hard time choosing from among the many Pantene conditioners, depending on what mood my hair and scalp are in, but it seems as if Pantene has enough varieties to provide me with a solution for whatever follicular condition I have at the moment.</li>
            <li> It rinsed out clean, but my very thick hair was still tangle free while wet.</li>
            <li> I only use a conditioner when I have a new perm because they tend to dry out my hair, and this really helps.  </li>
            <li> Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I&#x27;m 50).</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, however, I have a lot of it, so it almost looks thick.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent, daily conditioner from Pantene.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well (though no miracles should be expected) and, importantly for me, smells fine with a reasonably faint scent.</li>

            <li> This is a normal thick conditioner, smells really floralish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review on conditioner - I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and think that it&#x27;s good - not great.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m never sure how much of a difference these items make (volume vs thickness vs whatever), but it seems to have improved my hair volume.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Admission - I obtained this for my wife who loves the brand. She reports to me that this does a fine job for what it says it can do - providing volume as it conditions her hair. Lately, her hair has been looking better than ever, and this is certainly due in part to the product. I like the scent, which is not overpowering. I tried it myself and did not find that it had much impact on my own hair, which is pretty thick already.</li>
            <li> Good option when looking for an inexpensive drugstore conditioner. It works just as well as the Tresemme conditioner I have been using. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in volume. For me, the main selling point of Pantene is how great the shampoos and conditioners smell.</li>
            <li> I like that this conditioner does not weigh down my hair, or make it feel dirtier faster, and yet does a good job of conditioning.  My hair is not color-treated or permed, but I do use curing irons on it.  While I did not especially notice more \\&quot;volume\\&quot; to my hair, the conditioning aspect is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not overwhelming and is pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this conditioner didn&#x27;t have collagen in it.  That is not an ingredient I like having in the products I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because it works well, but not appreciably better than similarly priced products I have used.</li>
            <li> This is nice, rich conditioner and great for detangling, though I would prefer less fragrance. It did not interfere with my curls, either. You don&#x27;t need to use much, and you do need to rinse well.</li>
            <li> This has a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; feel.  In other words it does not feel like a heavy grease in the hair and it seem to wash out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does seem to and some volume (the hair looks thicker) but flattens the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the product is that by the end of the day my hair appeared very flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> This Volume Conditioner shampoo by Pantene does a nice job of conditioning my shoulder length, fine textured hair without weighing it down like some conditioners I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It has a nice fragrance that I would call &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; that leaves behind a mild fragrance after drying. I&#x27;ve always liked Pantene&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like best about this conditioner is that it leaves my hair tangle-free after conditioning. If I don&#x27;t use a conditioner at all, my hair is just a tangled mess that is very difficult to comb out. The texture even feels different. This conditioner leaves it feeling smooth even when it&#x27;s still wet. It&#x27;s a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> With barely a scent, this rich white conditioner is lovely, leaving thin hair unweighted. The Pantene Pro-V line is quite impressive and an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I used this with the classic Pantene Shampoo. It coats my hair well and rinsed out clean leaving a nice soft, shiny texture. It kept my hair sleek even after blow drying. It smells great. Overall, this is a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the Pantene Color protect shampoo, but the conditioner that goes with it is not a great match with my hair. Tends to leave me looking flat and a feeling a little dry, so I use a couple of other brands in rotation. This Pantene Volume version may very well be the answer. It smells great, just light and sort of spring fresh to me, not a heavy perfume. It rinsed out clean, but my very thick hair was still tangle free while wet. Once dry, my hair looks great! I have thick, lush hair that reaches the middle of my back in a blunt cut - no layers here. The wrong conditioner can make my hair look like a curtain. Nobody wants that. My hair is shiny, floaty and looks like I spent more than three minutes brushing it this morning. I did not. I&#x27;m not only surprised, I am really happy. I&#x27;ll totally buy this in the future.</li>
            <li> This is another great Pantene product. I only use a conditioner when I have a new perm because they tend to dry out my hair, and this really helps.  My granddaughters have long hair.  They always use a conditioner, and this works great for them too.  The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Pantene has always been a favorite.  Not crazy expensive, and an overall good product.  This one is no exception. . . but. . . . not that fond of the scent, but it&#x27;s not bad, by any means.  A little extra volume. . . and it goes a long way.  Just as a side-note, I also like the fact that you open it from the bottom.  I have no idea why other companies don&#x27;t follow this great design.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does add volume, but it also somewhat dulls my hair. It smells nice. It is rather hard to spread over my hair, Looks like I have to use  a lot of it, certainly more then other conditioners I used, and still have hard time making sure it covers my entire head. But it seems as it is easy to rinse off, and it leaves my hair softer and silkier out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is from the Volume line of Pantene products (there is also a shampoo and a gel as well in the same &#x27;line&#x27;).  It&#x27;s designed to be a &#x27;thin&#x27; conditioner that feels good in your hair and creates volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience using this it was a non-greasy and non-glue like conditioner that made me (admittedly thinning) hair feel a bit fuller.  I&#x27;m never sure how much of a difference these items make (volume vs thickness vs whatever), but it seems to have improved my hair volume.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent, daily conditioner from Pantene. The signature feature with this product is its &#x27;sheer volume&#x27; aspect carried out by a &#x27;collagen plumping effect.&#x27; The end result is a well performing weightless conditioner that does add tangible volume and lift and becomes even more pronounced if blow drying is performed immediately after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small dab is all that is needed to adequately work through the hair. The product easily rinses out and does leave a nice, silky finish that holds up for hours on untreated hair.  There is a pronounced sweet berry fragrance that may or may not be too your liking but all told, its fairly pleasant and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is pretty long; consequently, it can look (and feel) really flat and weighed down sometimes.  Conditioners are an absolute necessity, as my hair desperately needs moisture, but that&#x27;s a catch-22, as that moisture also contributes to weighing it down.  So I was looking for a product that would provide some moisture, while not taking away any volume and making my hair look lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got to say, this conditioner does a pretty good job of that.  It makes my hair feel pretty soft, while leaving it bouncy.  Regardless of whether I straighten my hair or leave its natural curls/wurls alone, it doesn&#x27;t look as flat and weighed down.  Also, the scent is a pleasant, but not overpowering floral fragrance that is pretty typical for Pantene products (I&#x27;ve found), but what isn&#x27;t typical is that this conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave a coating on my hair as other Pantene products have done in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it pretty much does what it claims to do.  That said, the volume isn&#x27;t exactly spectacular, and as far as detangling, imparting shine, and things of that nature, the conditioner is just okay. All in all, though, it&#x27;s a decent product (one of the better ones from Pantene that I&#x27;ve ever used), so anyone who&#x27;s looking for a pretty good volumizing conditioner might want to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I have straight baby fine hair. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that will add body &amp; volume to my hair. I had the opportunity to test Pantene Pro-V Volume Conditioner...but was not offered the companion Pantene Pro-V Volume Shampoo to test. At first the conditioner left my hair flyaway &amp; full of static. After a short time, the static went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that this conditioner added volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> This would be a good conditioner to use every day as it rinses cleanly but leaves the hair shiny and easy to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floral fragrance is very noticeable but fades.</li>
            <li> This conditioner comes out of the bottle really easily. You do not have to shake and shake and shake the bottle to get conditioner out. The smell is not overwhelming. It has a fresh sort of scent that I can&#x27;t quite name, however, it is not super strong. You can put this conditioner on your hair in the shower and either leave it on for a little bit or immediately wash it off. Either way, it left my hair smooth, silky and sleek. I have fine hair, however, I have a lot of it, so it almost looks thick. This product added much needed volume to my hair without weighing it down. I also loved that there are no sodium laurel sulfates in this Pantene Pro-V Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair so weightless conditioner is what I was waiting for. This is a normal thick conditioner, smells really floralish.  Did make my hair easier to manage after the shower. when I dried my hair this helped control the flying aways, also when I curled my hair they did not flatten out that can happen if the conditioner is too heavy.</li>
            <li> The only reason I cannot give this a five star is because I do not like the scent.  It just has a smell that is typical of basic hotel shampoos.  As far as the claim that it gave volume without weighing your hair down, I found that to be true.  My hair felt soft with good bounce without feeling greasy at the roots or flat in volume.  It is a nice big bottle that should last you quite a bit of time as well.</li>
            <li> While the label on this has changed slightly over the years, from \\&quot;Volume\\&quot; to \\&quot;Sheer Volume\\&quot; (and maybe some others in between), I think it&#x27;s the same formula.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and like it quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using their Volume shampoo a while back, and decided to give the conditioner a try - and I&#x27;m happy that I did.  My hair is thinning...okay, it was thinning ten years ago...now it&#x27;s just thin.  Moving on - my hair is thin, and I keep it short, but I can still tell a difference in how soft it is after using this.  I don&#x27;t use this every day, but almost.  It doesn&#x27;t add too much time to a shower, and it doesn&#x27;t cost all that much.  I think it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have remarked about not liking the smell.  Like any hair product, that&#x27;s all personal preference, and you may or may not like it.  If you can, go to the local store and check out the smell for yourself.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit, but I also like the smell of the Volume shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, it&#x27;s certainly five stars.  I&#x27;ve been buying it for years and will probably continue to do so because (a) I like it and (b) I&#x27;m nothing if not a creature of habit.  I certainly recommend it, but I do think it&#x27;s good to try out locally first if you can.</li>
            <li> Pantene products are always dependably good. This conditioner is no exception. It indeed does creat a bit of a volume, although sometimes this volume presents itself as fuzziness. This conditioner comes in a bottle of a generous size. The scent, again, the usual Pantene smell. I&#x27;ve always bought Pantene products and will probably always will buy them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review on conditioner - I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and think that it&#x27;s good - not great. My hair is typical for a guy - just past the collar, a little over the ears.  Mine is fine and really curly.  I&#x27;ve found that some conditioners enhance the curls - I hate that.  This leaves my hair easy to comb, but I don&#x27;t notice any extra &amp;#34;bounce&amp;#34;, etc. Probably because it&#x27;s short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s good. I tend to spend as little as possible on shampoo and conditioner, so this is better than I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall opinion: I like it, but would probably not use it again. I think the scent is too strong, and what it does for my short hair is nothing special.</li>
            <li> The best part about this conditioner is that it doesnâ€™t make your hair oily.  When I use conditioners, by the second day I have to wash my hair, or even on the very next day or it is stringy with oil.  Not good.  But this conditioner works very well yet more unobtrusively.  It is light but gets out tangles.  As far as extra volume, it is equal to other more expensive conditioners - and I have at least 10 of them in my cabinet.  It is now my go-to conditioner!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really nice. I like the fragrance it has. It is a nice, mild scent. This conditioner is thick and creamy My hair is dry, curly,and color-treated. This conditioner did a good job of conditioning my hair. I did not feel it was too heavy or weighed it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pantene products before with reasonable success. This conditioner works well (though no miracles should be expected) and, importantly for me, smells fine with a reasonably faint scent. While I&#x27;ve just tried it once, it looks like this will be a good conditioner for me.</li>
            <li> Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I&#x27;m 50). It is not color treated. I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It&#x27;s creamy and thick so you don&#x27;t need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn&#x27;t do too much to enhance shine, it didn&#x27;t dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top. It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this is a pretty good conditioner, but it may work better for someone with younger hair who doesn&#x27;t need so much in the way of shine enhancement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s occurred to me, shopping for conditioner, that all the many varieties of Pantene may all be the same product, in different bottles. But that is not so. I&#x27;ve been trying out various Pantene conditioners and am impressed by their effectiveness. This Pro-V Volume Conditioner feels, smells, and acts different on my hair than the hydrating Pantene I used last month. I like them both, but the Volume conditioner provides a bit more bounce and smells nicer than the hydrating variety. On the other hand, my scalp appreciated the hydrating quality more in the dry desert air. I may still have a hard time choosing from among the many Pantene conditioners, depending on what mood my hair and scalp are in, but it seems as if Pantene has enough varieties to provide me with a solution for whatever follicular condition I have at the moment.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Pantene conditioners for years.  Recently, I have been using Nexxus, so it was really nice to switch off and go back to Pantene for a change.  I have long wavy hair and some conditioners really make my hair so heavy that it goes flat.  That is not the case with this one.  While it is a thick and body conditioner, it didn&#x27;t make my hair heavy.  I only had to use a slight amount to get the tangles out and the price is excellent for this type of quality.</li>
