            <li>didn&#x27;t work for me, but I found a great product for my boys:)</li>
            <li>May be great for some, but I should have done more research.</li>

            <li>Smells nice, no frizzies, no crunchy hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of flaky.</li>
            <li>Just a nice moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>I put it in my hair after I wash it, kind of as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>This stuff works just as well and at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it.      </li>
            <li>I love this brand</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products.  </li>
            <li>I just LOVE this hair cream.</li>
            <li>The end result is much better than having that crunchy perm-look.</li>

            <li>It leaves my curls feeling and looking moisturized and healthy.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since :)</li>
            <li>It moisturizes better than even Giovanni leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I think they advertise this oil in many products now</li>
            <li>I love Argan oil</li>
            <li>-in-all, yes, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>my hair looks sooo healthy and shine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>IS OK</li>
            <li>AND I WILL ORDER MORE, PROBABLLY NOT FROM AMAZON</li>
            <li>I will give it time and maybe a can give a better review.</li>
            <li>I love the texture that it gives to my hair.</li>
            <li>Love their shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
            <li>I love my hair just as it is, but to make it more manageable to put into a ponytail each day, this is the product that eases the kink just a bit.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling cream.</li>
            <li>I love this curl cream.</li>
            <li>It does have a fragrance, which I love, but if you don&#x27;t like scent, this would be overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love this product don&#x27;t know how I got by without this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, more manageable than the oil version of it, best for curly short or long hair, will buy more</li>
            <li>smells amazing so excited to try this product</li>
            <li>Product smells good and the price was great, but my hair is way to long to for the curl to hold.</li>
            <li>and it feels like a nice cool minty feeling in my scalp</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and manageable and it smells great</li>
            <li>It smells great and gives my hair a soft, somewhat oily feel that I had always craved before finding this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and makes my curls look great.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell that is not overtly powerful.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I found it was good for was a leave-in !</li>
            <li>This product does have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>I needed a new product to keep the frizz at bay and it works amazingly, smells great, and my hair is SOOOO soft!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s perfect for my son&#x27;s hair, but my hair is a little more coarse than theirs...but STILL a great buy...</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair this is the best thing you can buy hands down.</li>
            <li>And is smells wonderful unlike other hair creams!</li>
            <li>I think the build up of the creme is healing and provides thickness to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>After using this I decided to pay the extra money and buy Wen Styling Cream and got exactly what I wanted, curly, wonderful feeling hair.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, and find that on the washing day I still need to apply some light gel to assist with hold.</li>
            <li>and it looks great using the same process.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Great once i used it properly</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love how it makes my hair feel nice and mositurized, just wish it was bigger, but overal I would repurchase.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>My experience with the seller has been problem - free.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t using the cheap stuff either.  </li>
            <li>I have use one&#x27;n one products this I am still trying to get the use of it to fit my hair.</li>
            <li>Just like the oil, this is to me the cheap alternative to Moroccan Oil products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and it lingers a bit after using the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the aroma so much that I searched the company for a hand/body cream that would allow me to use it more often than when I washed my hair.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Best product I have found in 40 years to tame my frizzy curls.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when my hair came out is well formed curls that were touchable and smooth, love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it makes me feel so pretty.</li>
            <li>kind, frizzy and unmanageable with strands and curls poking out in the least attractive places.</li>
            <li>just a silver dollar sized dot on my palm makes my hair really super soft and not greasy in the slightest, it controls my uncontrollable frizz and keeps my curls nice and bouncy all day rain or shine.</li>
            <li>and I love this new cream!</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>the smell is just so mild and addicting.</li>
            <li>This product protects my hair and makes the small waves look very good.</li>
            <li>What my daughters fine hair needed, highly recomended!</li>
            <li>I use one pump mixed with a drop of Argan Oil and my hair feels amazing and touchable all day, no crunchiness.</li>
            <li>it is perfect if you want curly/waves weird how I sound like a girl</li>
            <li>so far, I love it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price and beats the price of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34</li>
            <li>actually curls but does leave the hair soft and happy</li>
            <li>but kind of made my hair flat</li>
            <li>But I found that it looks a lot better if you flip your hair upside down &amp; use your hair dryer while applying, gives you more volume &amp; speeds up the drying process.</li>
            <li>All the One and Only products have been wonderful for my naturally curly hair which I have finally allowed to be itself.  </li>
            <li>I have natural wavy hair and this product is so nice and smell amazing but is too heavy for my curl.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on my hair, no more frizzes</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s seems to be good if I have to wear my hair back in a pony tail to keep hair in place.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how it holds up during the hot humid summer months.</li>
            <li>In fact, first couple times I used it</li>
            <li>First of all, I purchased this elsewhere.</li>
            <li>We are a family with diverse hair needs and this product can be used for all of us - curly, wavy and straight!  </li>
            <li>Might be better for a different hair type.</li>
            <li>Even as I started applying it, even with my hair wet, I could feel how smooth and velvety my hair was becoming.</li>
            <li>I use this right when I get out of the shower, then about 2 more pumps on the curls around my face once it&#x27;s almost dry.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much, I&#x27;m going to buy out the local store</li>
            <li>I really like this curl cream because it is moisturizing but not too heavy or sticky and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>It conditioned so well, but also left my hair light enough for it to curl and look so healthy.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft, cool to the touch, moisturized and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing that they managed to work in flexibility for bounce, smoothness with the Argan oil and some agents in there to hold and control the curl, WITHOUT weighing your hair down, whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>The product is great right after shampooing, but applying, for instance, the next day to (as per the instructions) dampened hair results in rather stiff (as opposed to &#x27;bouncy&#x27;) textured curls.</li>
            <li>Also, if I don&#x27;t use a strong product, it&#x27;s a toss up as to what it will look like the next day.</li>
            <li>Just a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s good for my  hair!  </li>
            <li>Product makes my hair super soft and silky...but doesn&#x27;t do much for my curls...</li>
            <li>afterwards it gives a decent amount of shine I use this for my waves on hot sunny days you have to try this product</li>
            <li>gives a good hold without being hard textured..</li>
            <li>It is very smoothing.</li>
            <li>It seemed very industrial or chemical in nature.  </li>
            <li>Most products make my hair crunchy, or always look like it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>It smells HEAVENLY, but for my 4c hair, didn&#x27;t really do much in terms of holding a curl.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It really defines my hair also.</li>
            <li>So I really needed something to define my curls while smoothing-out the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I use this product since i have lost alot hair.so i dont use so much chemicals on my hair to get restore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  have to spend as much time straightening my hair, which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>This cream really softens and strengthens the hair.</li>
            <li>Really desapointed.</li>
            <li>It seem to work better on my hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>but I find that it is very creamy</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t do much for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I also really like the smell.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hold, though.</li>
            <li>just kind of makes my hair fluffy.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed my already slightly curly hair becoming curlier, but that wasn&#x27;t exactly why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>For natural black hair it gves a natural curl and beautiful shine at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I received a small bottle at Christmas time and liked what it did for my hair</li>
            <li>They work fine when washing and styling my hair for a day, but I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair everyday just to maintain a fresh look.</li>
            <li>my daughter&#x27;s hair look less frizzy and is more manageable</li>
            <li>To use the remainder, you must bang it out of the top of the bottle&#x27;s nickel-size opening, blob by tiny blob, until you get enough to style your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, even the high end salon products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using Nexxus Frizz Control Shampoo and Humectress Moisturizing shampoo, plus the simply-amazing Argan Oil Curl Cream.  </li>
            <li>I am really liking this product thus far.  </li>
            <li>It not only conditions my semi-course Italian thick hair beautifully, but it smells divine.</li>
            <li>Normally I style my hair with redken ringley 07, so I have high expectations for a curl cream to perform near to redken.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both use this LIC and our curls are so soft and springy!</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy and leaves your hair feeling hydrated, your curls look and feel exactly the same as with the more expensive cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a very short period of time, but it can only get better.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use something a little bit strong</li>
            <li>I have fine but naturally curly hair, and have been looking for that miracle product that provides hold, takes away frizz and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls.</li>
            <li>With a long lasting all-day hold (a shine from Agadir oil treatment)  and a subtle beautiful fragrance, this is a product I intend to use again and again.</li>
            <li>The Argan Oil has definitely made my hair more shiny, soft, moisturized, and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this item to use in MY hair, I am black and filipino so I have a lot of S curls going on</li>
            <li>I began growing my hair naturally over a year ago</li>
            <li>Essentially there&#x27;s wavy/loose curls on the top, big curls in the middle ad spirals in the back.  </li>
            <li>This cream softened my curls to a soft and touchable curl.</li>
            <li>My curls are now soft, shiny, and managable.</li>
            <li>It keeps curls soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Besides leaving a white ugly residue that just sits on your hair until it drys, it does not do one doddley for your curls definition more than make it smell nice .</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to any natural ,besides it is loaded with mineral oil</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a build up like gel did, and my curls look and feel soft.</li>
            <li>And leaves my hair feeling soft makes also</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly so this and frizz buster is enough to keep it my hair in line.</li>
            <li>Hair is healthier and soft.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this to anyone thats going natural</li>
            <li>it keeps my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and when it grows, my curls some time sag and get wavy in spots.  </li>
            <li>My hair has it&#x27;s natural curl</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>This one is reasonably priced and actually did what it says it would do.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re natural curls.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and has some movement to it.</li>
            <li>My curls feels so soft</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This product smells good but is too heavy, dried my natural hair out and caused breakage</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and less fly-aways</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy like other products do &amp; it gives me a beautiful tight fluffy curl.</li>
            <li>No crunch, no wet look, Just soft, shiney, touchable curls.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my sopping wet 4a/4b hair and apply a little bit of aloe vera gel on top.</li>
            <li>maybe I have to have my hair a little more wet when I apply it?</li>
            <li>Wash your hair, then pat it dry GENTLY with a towel, so it&#x27;s still dripping a</li>
            <li>The curling cream left my curls soft and bouncy and, not to mention, completely  frizz-free.</li>
            <li>This is the only combination that I have found that works to give me very soft and defined curls.</li>
            <li>At first, and really dry next day.</li>
            <li>I pull it through my hair, let it dry or blow dry it and then add a tiny bit more when it&#x27;s dry to cut the frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had my hair natural for 2 or 3 months, I was about to give up because my hair was not responding to anything.  </li>
            <li>It sets the stage for a very defined curl enhancement, when used in conjunction with a gel or other curling product.</li>
            <li>This did not give me any extra curl and seemed to weigh my hair down making it more limp than without it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, about 2c or 3a, and it&#x27;s cut very short, if it lays flat</li>
            <li>I find that it is very thick and doesn&#x27;t go through her hair easy, instead it sits in white clumps, by the end of the day</li>

            <li> I originally use Redken ringlet which is AWESOME, but pricey</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me, but I found a great product for my boys:)</li>
            <li> May be great for some, but I should have done more research.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s great on my hair.  </li>

            <li> This product is nice in one way-the silkiness.it leaves just after washing.</li>
            <li> nice stuff... not sureit</li>
            <li> Smells nice, no frizzies, no crunchy hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of flaky.</li>
            <li> Just a nice moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair after I wash it, kind of as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff works just as well and at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it.      </li>
            <li> I love this brand</li>

            <li> is the product Im going to make sure I have one for my gym bag just in case and one in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melinda</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products.  </li>
            <li> I just LOVE this hair cream.</li>
            <li> The end result is much better than having that crunchy perm-look.</li>
            <li> After my sisters introduced me to argan oil, i&#x27;m in love with anything argan.</li>
            <li> It leaves my curls feeling and looking moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product for my twists and twist-outs.!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since :)</li>
            <li> It moisturizes better than even Giovanni leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I think they advertise this oil in many products now</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil</li>
            <li> -in-all, yes, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> my hair looks sooo healthy and shine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> IS OK</li>
            <li> AND I WILL ORDER MORE, PROBABLLY NOT FROM AMAZON</li>
            <li> I will give it time and maybe a can give a better review.</li>
            <li> I love the texture that it gives to my hair.</li>
            <li> Love their shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I love my hair just as it is, but to make it more manageable to put into a ponytail each day, this is the product that eases the kink just a bit.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling cream.</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream.</li>
            <li> It does have a fragrance, which I love, but if you don&#x27;t like scent, this would be overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this product don&#x27;t know how I got by without this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, more manageable than the oil version of it, best for curly short or long hair, will buy more</li>
            <li> smells amazing so excited to try this product</li>
            <li> Product smells good and the price was great, but my hair is way to long to for the curl to hold.</li>
            <li> and it feels like a nice cool minty feeling in my scalp</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and manageable and it smells great</li>
            <li> It smells great and gives my hair a soft, somewhat oily feel that I had always craved before finding this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and makes my curls look great.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell that is not overtly powerful.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I found it was good for was a leave-in !</li>
            <li> This product does have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> I needed a new product to keep the frizz at bay and it works amazingly, smells great, and my hair is SOOOO soft!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s perfect for my son&#x27;s hair, but my hair is a little more coarse than theirs...but STILL a great buy...</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair this is the best thing you can buy hands down.</li>
            <li> And is smells wonderful unlike other hair creams!</li>
            <li> I think the build up of the creme is healing and provides thickness to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> After using this I decided to pay the extra money and buy Wen Styling Cream and got exactly what I wanted, curly, wonderful feeling hair.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, and find that on the washing day I still need to apply some light gel to assist with hold.</li>
            <li> and it looks great using the same process.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Great once i used it properly</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love how it makes my hair feel nice and mositurized, just wish it was bigger, but overal I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> My experience with the seller has been problem - free.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t using the cheap stuff either.  </li>
            <li> I have use one&#x27;n one products this I am still trying to get the use of it to fit my hair.</li>
            <li> Just like the oil, this is to me the cheap alternative to Moroccan Oil products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and it lingers a bit after using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the aroma so much that I searched the company for a hand/body cream that would allow me to use it more often than when I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found in 40 years to tame my frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when my hair came out is well formed curls that were touchable and smooth, love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes me feel so pretty.</li>
            <li> kind, frizzy and unmanageable with strands and curls poking out in the least attractive places.</li>
            <li> just a silver dollar sized dot on my palm makes my hair really super soft and not greasy in the slightest, it controls my uncontrollable frizz and keeps my curls nice and bouncy all day rain or shine.</li>
            <li> and I love this new cream!</li>
            <li> super</li>
            <li> the smell is just so mild and addicting.</li>
            <li> This product protects my hair and makes the small waves look very good.</li>
            <li> What my daughters fine hair needed, highly recomended!</li>
            <li> I use one pump mixed with a drop of Argan Oil and my hair feels amazing and touchable all day, no crunchiness.</li>
            <li> it is perfect if you want curly/waves weird how I sound like a girl</li>
            <li> so far, I love it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price and beats the price of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34</li>
            <li> actually curls but does leave the hair soft and happy</li>
            <li> but kind of made my hair flat</li>
            <li> But I found that it looks a lot better if you flip your hair upside down &amp; use your hair dryer while applying, gives you more volume &amp; speeds up the drying process.</li>
            <li> All the One and Only products have been wonderful for my naturally curly hair which I have finally allowed to be itself.  </li>
            <li> I have natural wavy hair and this product is so nice and smell amazing but is too heavy for my curl.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my hair, no more frizzes</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s seems to be good if I have to wear my hair back in a pony tail to keep hair in place.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how it holds up during the hot humid summer months.</li>
            <li> In fact, first couple times I used it</li>
            <li> First of all, I purchased this elsewhere.</li>
            <li> We are a family with diverse hair needs and this product can be used for all of us - curly, wavy and straight!  </li>
            <li> Might be better for a different hair type.</li>
            <li> Even as I started applying it, even with my hair wet, I could feel how smooth and velvety my hair was becoming.</li>
            <li> I use this right when I get out of the shower, then about 2 more pumps on the curls around my face once it&#x27;s almost dry.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much, I&#x27;m going to buy out the local store</li>
            <li> I really like this curl cream because it is moisturizing but not too heavy or sticky and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li> It conditioned so well, but also left my hair light enough for it to curl and look so healthy.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft, cool to the touch, moisturized and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing that they managed to work in flexibility for bounce, smoothness with the Argan oil and some agents in there to hold and control the curl, WITHOUT weighing your hair down, whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> The product is great right after shampooing, but applying, for instance, the next day to (as per the instructions) dampened hair results in rather stiff (as opposed to &#x27;bouncy&#x27;) textured curls.</li>
            <li> Also, if I don&#x27;t use a strong product, it&#x27;s a toss up as to what it will look like the next day.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s good for my  hair!  </li>
            <li> Product makes my hair super soft and silky...but doesn&#x27;t do much for my curls...</li>
            <li> afterwards it gives a decent amount of shine I use this for my waves on hot sunny days you have to try this product</li>
            <li> gives a good hold without being hard textured..</li>
            <li> It is very smoothing.</li>
            <li> It seemed very industrial or chemical in nature.  </li>
            <li> Most products make my hair crunchy, or always look like it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> It smells HEAVENLY, but for my 4c hair, didn&#x27;t really do much in terms of holding a curl.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It really defines my hair also.</li>
            <li> So I really needed something to define my curls while smoothing-out the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I use this product since i have lost alot hair.so i dont use so much chemicals on my hair to get restore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  have to spend as much time straightening my hair, which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> This cream really softens and strengthens the hair.</li>
            <li> Really desapointed.</li>
            <li> It seem to work better on my hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> but I find that it is very creamy</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t do much for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I also really like the smell.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hold, though.</li>
            <li> just kind of makes my hair fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my already slightly curly hair becoming curlier, but that wasn&#x27;t exactly why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> For natural black hair it gves a natural curl and beautiful shine at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I received a small bottle at Christmas time and liked what it did for my hair</li>
            <li> They work fine when washing and styling my hair for a day, but I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair everyday just to maintain a fresh look.</li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s hair look less frizzy and is more manageable</li>
            <li> To use the remainder, you must bang it out of the top of the bottle&#x27;s nickel-size opening, blob by tiny blob, until you get enough to style your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, even the high end salon products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using Nexxus Frizz Control Shampoo and Humectress Moisturizing shampoo, plus the simply-amazing Argan Oil Curl Cream.  </li>
            <li> I am really liking this product thus far.  </li>
            <li> It not only conditions my semi-course Italian thick hair beautifully, but it smells divine.</li>
            <li> Normally I style my hair with redken ringley 07, so I have high expectations for a curl cream to perform near to redken.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this LIC and our curls are so soft and springy!</li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy and leaves your hair feeling hydrated, your curls look and feel exactly the same as with the more expensive cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a very short period of time, but it can only get better.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use something a little bit strong</li>
            <li> I have fine but naturally curly hair, and have been looking for that miracle product that provides hold, takes away frizz and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls.</li>
            <li> With a long lasting all-day hold (a shine from Agadir oil treatment)  and a subtle beautiful fragrance, this is a product I intend to use again and again.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil has definitely made my hair more shiny, soft, moisturized, and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item to use in MY hair, I am black and filipino so I have a lot of S curls going on</li>
            <li> I began growing my hair naturally over a year ago</li>
            <li> Essentially there&#x27;s wavy/loose curls on the top, big curls in the middle ad spirals in the back.  </li>
            <li> This cream softened my curls to a soft and touchable curl.</li>
            <li> My curls are now soft, shiny, and managable.</li>
            <li> It keeps curls soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Besides leaving a white ugly residue that just sits on your hair until it drys, it does not do one doddley for your curls definition more than make it smell nice .</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to any natural ,besides it is loaded with mineral oil</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a build up like gel did, and my curls look and feel soft.</li>
            <li> And leaves my hair feeling soft makes also</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly so this and frizz buster is enough to keep it my hair in line.</li>
            <li> Hair is healthier and soft.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to anyone thats going natural</li>
            <li> it keeps my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and when it grows, my curls some time sag and get wavy in spots.  </li>
            <li> My hair has it&#x27;s natural curl</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> This one is reasonably priced and actually did what it says it would do.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re natural curls.</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and has some movement to it.</li>
            <li> My curls feels so soft</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This product smells good but is too heavy, dried my natural hair out and caused breakage</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and less fly-aways</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy like other products do &amp; it gives me a beautiful tight fluffy curl.</li>
            <li> No crunch, no wet look, Just soft, shiney, touchable curls.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my sopping wet 4a/4b hair and apply a little bit of aloe vera gel on top.</li>
            <li> maybe I have to have my hair a little more wet when I apply it?</li>
            <li> Wash your hair, then pat it dry GENTLY with a towel, so it&#x27;s still dripping a</li>
            <li> The curling cream left my curls soft and bouncy and, not to mention, completely  frizz-free.</li>
            <li> This is the only combination that I have found that works to give me very soft and defined curls.</li>
            <li> At first, and really dry next day.</li>
            <li> I pull it through my hair, let it dry or blow dry it and then add a tiny bit more when it&#x27;s dry to cut the frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had my hair natural for 2 or 3 months, I was about to give up because my hair was not responding to anything.  </li>
            <li> It sets the stage for a very defined curl enhancement, when used in conjunction with a gel or other curling product.</li>
            <li> This did not give me any extra curl and seemed to weigh my hair down making it more limp than without it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, about 2c or 3a, and it&#x27;s cut very short, if it lays flat</li>
            <li> I find that it is very thick and doesn&#x27;t go through her hair easy, instead it sits in white clumps, by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair (and I mean</li>
            <li> and it is hard to find the right product that won&#x27;t make my hair oil, but also adds enough moisture.</li>
            <li> Using more could mean annihilating the few uncooperative hairs.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Overall I plan to use this for my wash n gos as long as it&#x27;s being made.</li>
            <li> so not many products work without using half a damn bottle and making it super greasy an yucky but</li>
            <li> I have black people briollo texture hair and is natural</li>
            <li> I have dry, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Smells fine but not very effective for thick course hair</li>
            <li> I always blow dry my hair and then straighten with a flat iron, so I don&#x27;t know about the \\&quot;defines curl\\&quot; part of product.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is so long and dry, I only wash it every other day, or even every 3rd day.</li>
            <li> suggest this product, I was desperate and tried anything anyone suggested \\&quot;I LOVE</li>
            <li> I have long curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It has seemed to make my girlfriend&#x27;s long wavy hair curlier.</li>
            <li> When I wear my twist-outs without this product, they are dry and the curls don&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Conditioner was making my hair too oily and going without made it dry-</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Still leaves hair looking dry and frizzy didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I tried One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Curl Cream last night, air dried it, and went to bed in a satin cap.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Braid up all of my hair and let air dry !</li>
            <li> On the UPSIDE, i used this product in my son&#x27;s hair; they are black, filipino, columbian, white, and panamanian</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the super expensive wen products.</li>
            <li> The only product I have found to tame my son&#x27;s unruly long spiral-curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is wavy all over with a tendency to tight curl almost to kink in the back.</li>
            <li> On the second day I just dampen, add a little curling creme, and ....perfection.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t work the way I had expected in my hair.</li>
            <li> You can put this on after a twist out and 3 mins later fluffy curls</li>
            <li> I have crayz-curly hair with absolutely no direction.  </li>
            <li> so no thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this product and returned it  because it was not what I was looking for, it was not pure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products, one would work for one part of my hair, while the other parts looked atrocious.     </li>
            <li> But its not strong enough for everything else I want.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I only use HALF of a pump or less of the Argan Oil, apply it to the ends of my hair, and then brush&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I actually prefer products on the heavier side, but this is way too heavy and weighs my hair down to the point it feels greasy.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick and coarse curly/wavy hair...</li>
            <li> I plan on trying the entire product line to see if the shampoo and conditioner will replace my usual Paul Mitchell favorites.</li>
            <li> I thought the Argan Oil would be prevalent but when reading the label I found tons of other stuff included.  </li>
            <li> I got a day before expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> I went thru t.j.maxx and smelled other products with this oil in them</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I ordered the curl cream but got the other one instead.</li>
            <li> I scrunched it a little and let it dry, and when I went to check how it worked</li>
            <li> This one have nothing in common with the traditional argan oil .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is thick - similar to a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I hate how most curl products either weigh my hair down or make it look greasy or crunchy.</li>
            <li> BUT IT CAN WEIGH DOWN THE CURLS</li>
            <li> Also smooths the hair down.</li>
            <li> I usually apply the product after I towel dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> and after you get thru about half the bottle, it WILL NOT come out thru the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> I have to use it with a few other products to get the tight curls I want.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have a hard time finding products that do not contain alcohol in them to help tame my curls and cut back frizz.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a mess after sleeping on it one night.</li>
            <li> Works well with thick frizzy long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick, curly hair and</li>
            <li> and this makes it feel not sticky but heavy, weighted down and like a knotted mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy in texture, weighed down my hair, increased hair fall.</li>
            <li> I just add a little to the palm of my hand and after I wash my hair</li>
            <li> I work it into the ends and a little on the rest of my hair as well.</li>
            <li> On my non-wash days, I just spritz a little water in my hair, and use this stuff.</li>
            <li> before trying this item, my curls were very dry and hard.</li>
            <li> IF USED WITH A HEAVY HAND</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll give it a few points for that, although there are products out there specifically designed for that.</li>
            <li> Never used again, it was waste for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I should point out a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair, heavy</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL TO TAME FRIZZ</li>
            <li> it holds my curls doesn&#x27;t really tame my frizz but does wonders to my hair..</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to hair gel to try to tame my curls.</li>
            <li> But I was looking for a curl cream that could tame my head of wavy/curly hair and help it keep its shape and not frizz.</li>
            <li> After it dries there is very little crunch</li>
            <li> I bought this as a small 3 oz to see if I would like it.</li>
            <li> No more Keri tan treatments  or straighteners.</li>
            <li> :\)</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream , it seems like it would weigh down curls</li>
            <li> I have really thin and slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 8-10 curling products, all producing a sticky, gluey feeling, weighing down my curls.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still on the fence about this, you&#x27;re thinking way too hard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product because it makes your hair hard.</li>
            <li> it is not sticky or greasy in the least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick that the pump won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just too thick.</li>
            <li> Other products claim to make hair shiny and curly, but are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Stay clear of this product unless you like you hair to feel like a gooey, nasty mess of knots.</li>
            <li> This one is too weak to do that.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I like the curl cream, but it is very thick</li>
            <li> I actually dread washing day because that&#x27;s the day my hair looks the worst.</li>
            <li> Needless to say if you are looking for a product that can do this</li>
            <li> This makes me sad.</li>
            <li> My hair is the crazy curls in all directions</li>
            <li> but isn&#x27;t impossible to work with.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what possessed me because I think this brand of Argan Oil stinks!</li>
            <li> I thought it was crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hated my hair since I can remember, and nothing I used ever made me like it.</li>
            <li> i have 3b and 3c curly hair and this product was the worst product i have ever brought.</li>
            <li> and i broke out horribly from it on my neck.</li>
            <li> The worst cream ever..</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  </li>
            <li> I cannot even explain how awful this product is.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this almost daily. It&#x27;s texture is thick - similar to a leave-in conditioner.  It works well to texture the hair without making it all crunchy.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase the Morroccan Curl Cream.  This stuff works just as well and at a much better price.  Highly recommend for those with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine but naturally curly hair, and have been looking for that miracle product that provides hold, takes away frizz and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls. This product is pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, and find that on the washing day I still need to apply some light gel to assist with hold. On the second day I just dampen, add a little curling creme, and ....perfection. I can even go two days (gasp!!) without washing and it looks great using the same process. I actually dread washing day because that&#x27;s the day my hair looks the worst. I think the build up of the creme is healing and provides thickness to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Makes hair look amazing!</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL TO TAME FRIZZ BUT IT CAN WEIGH DOWN THE CURLS IF USED WITH A HEAVY HAND</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the super expensive wen products. Love</li>
            <li> I began growing my hair naturally over a year ago and I&#x27;ve been searching for a product which would allow me to wash and go.  My hair type ranges from from 3a to 3b.  Essentially there&#x27;s wavy/loose curls on the top, big curls in the middle ad spirals in the back.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products, one would work for one part of my hair, while the other parts looked atrocious.     I tried One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Curl Cream last night, air dried it, and went to bed in a satin cap.  When I woke up, all the curls were still intact and there was no dryness, or stiffness to my hair.  I can&#x27;t stop touching it.      I usually only use the oil, which does wonders when I straighten my hair the a blow dryer.  I plan on trying the entire product line to see if the shampoo and conditioner will replace my usual Paul Mitchell favorites.</li>
            <li> It WORKS...it holds my curls doesn&#x27;t really tame my frizz but does wonders to my hair..like keeps my curls there gives a good hold without being hard textured..</li>
            <li> I have been using the One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil treatment and decided to give this a try. I have curly hair and have a hard time finding products that do not contain alcohol in them to help tame my curls and cut back frizz. I live in Arizona so we have wierd weather and that entails a lot of frizz for me. This cream softened my curls to a soft and touchable curl. I love this brand and I love this new cream!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Curl Cream 10 oz. I was amazed that it smells so good, and how creamy it is. It made my hair feel like silk when I applied it- then even after two days I still could feel the softness in my curls. Needless to say if you are looking for a product that can do this I suggest you buy this item.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed. It&#x27;s so thick that the pump won&#x27;t work. I have really thick, curly hair so I actually prefer products on the heavier side, but this is way too heavy and weighs my hair down to the point it feels greasy.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this product thus far.  Although I discovered it does have alcohol in it, I like using a variety of products and so I throw this in from time to time.  It is very smoothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a small 3 oz to see if I would like it. Normally I style my hair with redken ringley 07, so I have high expectations for a curl cream to perform near to redken. I was pleasantly surprised when my hair came out is well formed curls that were touchable and smooth, love it!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item to use in MY hair, I am black and filipino so I have a lot of S curls going on and it is hard to find the right product that won&#x27;t make my hair oil, but also adds enough moisture. This product smells wonderful however, it doesn&#x27;t work the way I had expected in my hair. I originally use Redken ringlet which is AWESOME, but pricey so I was hoping THIS would do the same amount of wonders for a lesser price. On the UPSIDE, i used this product in my son&#x27;s hair; they are black, filipino, columbian, white, and panamanian~i know WHAT a mix...but it defines their curls and they walk around with their curls looking like shirley temple!!~LOL maybe I have to have my hair a little more wet when I apply it? but it&#x27;s perfect for my son&#x27;s hair, but my hair is a little more coarse than theirs...but STILL a great buy...didn&#x27;t work for me, but I found a great product for my boys:)</li>
            <li> Omg! This stuff is amazing! before trying this item, my curls were very dry and hard. After trying this item, I noticed a big change. My curls are now soft, shiny, and managable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell nor the consistency.  It seemed very industrial or chemical in nature.  I thought the Argan Oil would be prevalent but when reading the label I found tons of other stuff included.  If you are looking for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product this is not it.</li>
            <li> I like this curl cream. All the One and Only products have been wonderful for my naturally curly hair which I have finally allowed to be itself.  No more Keri tan treatments  or straighteners.</li>
            <li> I love this product it smells so damn good it&#x27;s like having body spray for my hair and it feels like a nice cool minty feeling in my scalp it&#x27;s like eating a mint and drinking water afterwards it gives a decent amount of shine I use this for my waves on hot sunny days you have to try this product it is perfect if you want curly/waves weird how I sound like a girl even doe I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair cream. It keeps curls soft and bouncy.  It has a nice smell that is not overtly powerful.</li>
            <li> A product I can use to maintain my curly hair between shampoos.  I&#x27;ve tried them all, even the high end salon products. They work fine when washing and styling my hair for a day, but I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair everyday just to maintain a fresh look. This is the stuff. it leaves my hair soft, cool to the touch, moisturized and shiny.  I use one pump mixed with a drop of Argan Oil and my hair feels amazing and touchable all day, no crunchiness. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it holds up during the hot humid summer months. so far, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have kinky curly hair ! 4A curls and waves ! It smells great, just like the restorative mask ! The only thing that I found it was good for was a leave-in ! I put it in, and brush it through ! Braid up all of my hair and let air dry ! I can&#x27;t use it for wash and go&#x27;s ! It a huge no no !!!</li>
            <li> i have 3b and 3c curly hair and this product was the worst product i have ever brought.Besides leaving a white ugly residue that just sits on your hair until it drys, it does not do one doddley for your curls definition more than make it smell nice . I would not recommend this to any natural ,besides it is loaded with mineral oil big no no</li>
            <li> its perfect came in 2 days smells amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that this product produced any results. wish I could return it but I opened and used the product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, about 2c or 3a, and it&#x27;s cut very short, if it lays flat it&#x27;s about to my nose. This stuff is amazing! I needed a new product to keep the frizz at bay and it works amazingly, smells great, and my hair is SOOOO soft!! It&#x27;s also shinier than it has been, and there&#x27;s no frizz whatsoever! Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had my hair natural for 2 or 3 months, I was about to give up because my hair was not responding to anything.  I was in the beauty supply looking for a product to use after co-washing the lady suggest this product, I was desperate and tried anything anyone suggested \\&quot;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT\\&quot;  You can put this on after a twist out and 3 mins later fluffy curls and they last all day I was caught in the rain yesterday and didn&#x27;t even wanna look in the mirror but to my surprise my curls looked even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the product Im going to make sure I have one for my gym bag just in case and one in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melinda</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair this is the best thing you can buy hands down. I use it and it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Had to return could not handle the odor!</li>
            <li> Works well with thick frizzy long hair.  A little bit goes a long way.  No sticky residue.  Acts as a conditioner to detangle (even after you shampoo and condition).  I&#x27;ve tried many products.  None compare to getting the job done as this one does.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this hair cream. It not only conditions my semi-course Italian thick hair beautifully, but it smells divine. It conditioned so well, but also left my hair light enough for it to curl and look so healthy. It helped with the tangles also. I&#x27;m enjoying the aroma so much that I searched the company for a hand/body cream that would allow me to use it more often than when I washed my hair. Hey, &#x27;One &#x27;n Only&#x27; manufacturers out there &#x3D; time for making a hand cream - you will sell out!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to hair gel to try to tame my curls. Most products make my hair crunchy, or always look like it&#x27;s wet. I use this right when I get out of the shower, then about 2 more pumps on the curls around my face once it&#x27;s almost dry. That&#x27;s all I need! It doesn&#x27;t leave a build up like gel did, and my curls look and feel soft. I&#x27;m very happy with this product! Very moisturizing and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Great once i used it properly</li>
            <li> This works great for natural curl, it took me a while to figure out the best way though. I pull it through my hair, let it dry or blow dry it and then add a tiny bit more when it&#x27;s dry to cut the frizz. The end result is much better than having that crunchy perm-look.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would be good. In fact, first couple times I used it I thought it was crap. But I gave it longer to impress me and it did! Great stuff! Makes your hair soft and manageable and it smells great I think! Definitely worth it for the price and beats the price of the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; competitors.</li>
            <li> Loved it n will continue to use it ðŸ’•</li>
            <li> First of all, I purchased this elsewhere. I don&#x27;t know what possessed me because I think this brand of Argan Oil stinks! But I was looking for a curl cream that could tame my head of wavy/curly hair and help it keep its shape and not frizz. This one is too weak to do that. It does leave my hair silky, which is nice. But its not strong enough for everything else I want. My hair is wavy all over with a tendency to tight curl almost to kink in the back. If I don&#x27;t use something a little bit strong it&#x27;s a mess after sleeping on it one night. Also, if I don&#x27;t use a strong product, it&#x27;s a toss up as to what it will look like the next day. And, with this product, it never looks the same way two days in a row.This product is nice in one way-the silkiness.it leaves just after washing. So I&#x27;ll give it a few points for that, although there are products out there specifically designed for that.</li>
            <li> I received a small bottle at Christmas time and liked what it did for my hair so I bought a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> It smells HEAVENLY, but for my 4c hair, didn&#x27;t really do much in terms of holding a curl. I use it as a daily moisturizer though, mixed in with some olive/macadamia nut oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Just a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s good for my  hair!  We are a family with diverse hair needs and this product can be used for all of us - curly, wavy and straight!  I just add a little to the palm of my hand and after I wash my hair I work it into the ends and a little on the rest of my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome!!! And leaves my hair feeling soft makes also my daughter&#x27;s hair look less frizzy and is more manageable</li>
            <li> not a fan, did not see any change in my hair I have black people briollo texture hair and is natural, I thought it would be like wen hair product, I have not use wen so I cant compare</li>
            <li> too greasy for my hair and i broke out horribly from it on my neck. def won&#x27;t be using it anymore</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love how it makes my hair feel nice and mositurized, just wish it was bigger, but overal I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have 3b hair and this made it very oily and heavy. I do like it for use before swimming and possibly as a deep conditioner...definitely not for daily use, though.</li>
            <li> nice stuff... not sureit actually curls but does leave the hair soft and happy</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! The curling cream left my curls soft and bouncy and, not to mention, completely  frizz-free. Thank you!</li>
            <li> After my sisters introduced me to argan oil, i&#x27;m in love with anything argan. It leaves my curls feeling and looking moisturized and healthy. My hair is very curly so this and frizz buster is enough to keep it my hair in line.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect curl cream. It smells awesome, it&#x27;s light weight and controls the frizz.</li>
            <li> The worst cream ever..my hair was like a broom..  And heavy!,beside the mask work so well, this cream is a waist of money...terrible..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! But I found that it looks a lot better if you flip your hair upside down &amp; use your hair dryer while applying, gives you more volume &amp; speeds up the drying process. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy like other products do &amp; it gives me a beautiful tight fluffy curl. I use the entire One N Only Argan Oil set &amp; I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> so far so good. waiting for humid weather to see how it reacts</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product for my twists and twist-outs.!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides shine and definition to my curls.  When I wear my twist-outs without this product, they are dry and the curls don&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> smells amazing so excited to try this product</li>
            <li> I have really thin and slightly wavy hair. This product protects my hair and makes the small waves look very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy in texture, weighed down my hair, increased hair fall. Never used again, it was waste for me.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair (and I mean super :\) so not many products work without using half a damn bottle and making it super greasy an yucky but about 2 years ago my grandma showed me this and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since :) just a silver dollar sized dot on my palm makes my hair really super soft and not greasy in the slightest, it controls my uncontrollable frizz and keeps my curls nice and bouncy all day rain or shine. And is smells wonderful unlike other hair creams! I definitely adore the argan curl cream and will use it for years to come!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and less fly-aways</li>
            <li> Smells great, but not moisturizing on my 4b hair</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this LIC and our curls are so soft and springy! This is one of our must have products!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. I have long curly frizzy hair. This product tames my frizz and now I have gorgeous ringlets. Hair is healthier and soft. A must for the curly crowd.</li>
            <li> awesome product for the curly haired girls!  Smells nice, no frizzies, no crunchy hair.  Just a great product.</li>
            <li> I am so exited to use. I got a day before expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It moisturizes better than even Giovanni leave in conditioner. It really defines my hair also. Smells great! All around god product.</li>
            <li> It has mineral oil in it and acts as such. I thought this would be good because it says it contains argan oil but I couldn&#x27;t tell. Its just sticky and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair or enhance the curl pattern. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is corkscrew curly. I find that it is very thick and doesn&#x27;t go through her hair easy, instead it sits in white clumps, by the end of the day it&#x27;s kind of flaky. I think it&#x27;s just too thick. Might be better for a different hair type.</li>
            <li> FINALLY! I&#x27;ve tried at least 8-10 curling products, all producing a sticky, gluey feeling, weighing down my curls.  It is absolutely amazing that they managed to work in flexibility for bounce, smoothness with the Argan oil and some agents in there to hold and control the curl, WITHOUT weighing your hair down, whatsoever.  Seriously.  I have crayz-curly hair with absolutely no direction.  Ringlets in the middle and frizzed-ends.  So I really needed something to define my curls while smoothing-out the frizz.  This, people, covers it all.  So this is my routine now. I highly recommend using Nexxus Frizz Control Shampoo and Humectress Moisturizing shampoo, plus the simply-amazing Argan Oil Curl Cream.  There is no need to shop anymore ladies (or gents).  This stuff has it all.  It smells great and works miracles on out-of-control curly, frizzy hair.  LOOOOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> For natural black hair it gves a natural curl and beautiful shine at the same time.  Love it.I would recomend this to anyone thats going natural</li>
            <li> The product is great right after shampooing, but applying, for instance, the next day to (as per the instructions) dampened hair results in rather stiff (as opposed to &#x27;bouncy&#x27;) textured curls. My experience with the seller has been problem - free.</li>
            <li> Product makes my hair super soft and silky...but doesn&#x27;t do much for my curls...just kind of makes my hair fluffy.  May be great for some, but I should have done more research.</li>
            <li> The only product I have found to tame my son&#x27;s unruly long spiral-curly hair.  He loves it too and actually uses it!</li>
            <li> its not edible.. it is for your hair. I have used it also as a body lotion it smells so good. it is not sticky or greasy in the least. I don&#x27;t know if it curls your hair but I use it in my hair and as a body lotion. the smell is just so mild and addicting. I think they advertise this oil in many products now and I see why.  I went thru t.j.maxx and smelled other products with this oil in them but they are not this good.</li>
            <li> I use this product since i have lost alot hair.so i dont use so much chemicals on my hair to get restore. I love Argan oil cuz it&#x27;s so productive on the hair and on the skin.and this cream it really.does do the curls on my hair and.also to style my hair too...everything depends your purpose for it. I use it in a daily basis. Im a female.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month and I love it!  The Argan Oil has definitely made my hair more shiny, soft, moisturized, and less frizzy. Best of all, it hasn&#x27;t made my hair oily. I usually apply the product after I towel dry my hair.  I actually started using this after a hair cut.  Conditioner was making my hair too oily and going without made it dry- and I wasn&#x27;t using the cheap stuff either.  I still use conditioner- just a smaller amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should point out a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This product does have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;2. I always blow dry my hair and then straighten with a flat iron, so I don&#x27;t know about the \\&quot;defines curl\\&quot; part of product.  However, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;  have to spend as much time straightening my hair, which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;3. So does it get rid of all the frizz? Well, no but almost!  Keep in mind that I only use HALF of a pump or less of the Argan Oil, apply it to the ends of my hair, and then brush&lt;br /&gt;  it through.  Using more could mean annihilating the few uncooperative hairs.&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t use it on dry hair.  I made that mistake once and the product left a sticky residue on my hair, which made it oily.  Follow the instructions and use on damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, yes, I love this product.  It&#x27;s the only one I use!</li>
            <li> I have long thick, curly hair and this stuff works great. It&#x27;s the only product I put in my hair and it keeps my curls soft and bouncy. It&#x27;s a must buy for your curls!</li>
            <li> my hair looks sooo healthy and shine. my curls are so neat. doesnt make my hair damp or saggy,</li>
            <li> Product smells good and the price was great, but my hair is way to long to for the curl to hold.</li>
            <li> Smells fine but not very effective for thick course hair</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and when it grows, my curls some time sag and get wavy in spots.  I just used this cream this morning and couldn&#x27;t believe it was all it said it would be!  My hair has it&#x27;s natural curl and it&#x27;s so soft I can&#x27;t stop touching it.  It also made my hair shiny; no stiffness at all.  Other products claim to make hair shiny and curly, but are so expensive.  This one is reasonably priced and actually did what it says it would do.  Thrilled with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It sets the stage for a very defined curl enhancement, when used in conjunction with a gel or other curling product.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED IT ESPECIALLY FOR MY HAIR-PERFECT FOR ME-PRICE IS OK AND I WILL ORDER MORE, PROBABLLY NOT FROM AMAZON</li>
            <li> I have use one&#x27;n one products this I am still trying to get the use of it to fit my hair. So far it&#x27;s seems to be good if I have to wear my hair back in a pony tail to keep hair in place. I think this would go well in a child hair that you want to keep under control. I bought this and I will use it. I will give it time and maybe a can give a better review.</li>
            <li> This cream really softens and strengthens the hair. I love the texture that it gives to my hair. Not too oily. Just a nice moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> Really desapointed. This one have nothing in common with the traditional argan oil . Leaves your hair, heavy At first, and really dry next day. In my home, we are 3 women, different type of hait, and was the same thing for the 3 of us</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy hair and this product is so nice and smell amazing but is too heavy for my curl.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s great on my hair.  Love their shampoo and conditioner too. AMAZING</li>
            <li> It seem to work better on my hair when it is wet. I really like the smell. 4 stars because I ordered the curl cream but got the other one instead. But it works well enough.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick and coarse curly/wavy hair... it always looks frizzy and unkept. I hate how most curl products either weigh my hair down or make it look greasy or crunchy. This stuff does none of that! Absolutely perfect curls, touchable, shiny... NOT FRIZZY!! Because my hair is so long and dry, I only wash it every other day, or even every 3rd day. On my non-wash days, I just spritz a little water in my hair, and use this stuff. My curly hair has NEVER been happier. I love this stuff so much, I&#x27;m going to buy out the local store so I won&#x27;t be lacking for quite awhile!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the argon  oil but I find that it is very creamy and it doesn&#x27;t do much for curly hair. Still leaves hair looking dry and frizzy didn&#x27;t work for me. Also the smell is not so great.</li>
            <li> This makes me sad. I like the curl cream, but it is very thick and after you get thru about half the bottle, it WILL NOT come out thru the pump dispenser. To use the remainder, you must bang it out of the top of the bottle&#x27;s nickel-size opening, blob by tiny blob, until you get enough to style your hair. Ridiculous. This product belongs in a tube, where it can be squeezed out. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I love my hair just as it is, but to make it more manageable to put into a ponytail each day, this is the product that eases the kink just a bit.  With a long lasting all-day hold (a shine from Agadir oil treatment)  and a subtle beautiful fragrance, this is a product I intend to use again and again. Everything Agadir always works for me.</li>
            <li> Just like the oil, this is to me the cheap alternative to Moroccan Oil products. And it works just the same. It is rich and creamy and leaves your hair feeling hydrated, your curls look and feel exactly the same as with the more expensive cream.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Best product I have found in 40 years to tame my frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I apply it to my sopping wet 4a/4b hair and apply a little bit of aloe vera gel on top. This is the only combination that I have found that works to give me very soft and defined curls. After it dries there is very little crunch and my curls have lots of movement that lasts for a week. I also really like the smell. It&#x27;s light and it lingers a bit after using the product. Overall I plan to use this for my wash n gos as long as it&#x27;s being made.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, more manageable than the oil version of it, best for curly short or long hair, will buy more</li>
            <li> I have been using this Argan oil cream for a couple years now. I put it in my hair after I wash it, kind of as a leave in conditioner. It smells great and gives my hair a soft, somewhat oily feel that I had always craved before finding this stuff. I haven&#x27;t noticed my already slightly curly hair becoming curlier, but that wasn&#x27;t exactly why I bought it in the first place. It has seemed to make my girlfriend&#x27;s long wavy hair curlier. Using this product spurred my girlfriend and I to start using Argon oil shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hated my hair since I can remember, and nothing I used ever made me like it. My hair is the crazy curls in all directions kind, frizzy and unmanageable with strands and curls poking out in the least attractive places. This is LITERALLY my miracle in a bottle when it comes to my hair. If you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re probably not using it correctly. Wash your hair, then pat it dry GENTLY with a towel, so it&#x27;s still dripping a but isn&#x27;t impossible to work with. THEN apply. Even as I started applying it, even with my hair wet, I could feel how smooth and velvety my hair was becoming. I scrunched it a little and let it dry, and when I went to check how it worked I almost cried it was so amazing. It makes my curls almost perfect ringlets, I can even RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH IT!!! It doesn&#x27;t get rid of ALL the frizz, but come on... they&#x27;re natural curls. it&#x27;s about 10 percent as frizzy as it was before. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a very short period of time, but it can only get better. I love this stuff, it makes me feel so pretty. If you&#x27;re still on the fence about this, you&#x27;re thinking way too hard. Get it. Now. Trust me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would have enhanced my curls and control the frizz but kind of made my hair flat</li>
            <li> I love this curling cream. It makes my hair soft and makes my curls look great.</li>
            <li> I love this curl cream. It provides some hold and definition, but isn&#x27;t sticky once it&#x27;s in. My hair stays soft and has some movement to it. It does have a fragrance, which I love, but if you don&#x27;t like scent, this would be overpowering. I notice a big difference when I don&#x27;t use this product. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue.</li>
            <li> My curls feels so soft I want to touch them all the time! This product smells really good. The price was excellent also.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells wonderful.  It is a very thick cream , it seems like it would weigh down curls but it lifts them beautifully!  No crunch, no wet look, Just soft, shiney, touchable curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product don&#x27;t know how I got by without this product. Smell great and. Does a great job on my hair, no more frizzes</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  I have naturally curly hair and this makes it feel not sticky but heavy, weighted down and like a knotted mess.  I cannot even explain how awful this product is.  After using this I decided to pay the extra money and buy Wen Styling Cream and got exactly what I wanted, curly, wonderful feeling hair.  Stay clear of this product unless you like you hair to feel like a gooey, nasty mess of knots.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and returned it  because it was not what I was looking for, it was not pure.</li>
            <li> This smells good. Also smooths the hair down.</li>
            <li> What my daughters fine hair needed, highly recomended!</li>
            <li> I really like this curl cream because it is moisturizing but not too heavy or sticky and it smells really good.  I get really good definition in my curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product because it makes your hair hard. I don&#x27;t like crispy hear and that&#x27;s what I get with this. The best product to use if you want curls and not the crispy hair use Kukui oil! Makes your hair sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> This product smells good but is too heavy, dried my natural hair out and caused breakage so no thanks</li>
            <li> This did not give me any extra curl and seemed to weigh my hair down making it more limp than without it. Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I have dry, coarse, curly hair. Argan oil is great for it. This doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hold, though. I have to use it with a few other products to get the tight curls I want.</li>
