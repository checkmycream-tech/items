            <li>they smell nice and lather well!</li>
            <li>awesome shampoos, enjoying all of them.</li>
            <li>They all smell great, and it was a good way for my family to see which one they liked.  </li>
            <li>A good time to find out if the product works for you or</li>
            <li>They all lather gorgeously and leave you hair with a lot of body.</li>
            <li>I loved trying all of them out before settling on our favorites.</li>
            <li>My hair LOVED the beer shampoo.</li>
            <li>(Good by me.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 7: &amp;#34;I am having Withdrawls from my Beloved Hair Conditioner...</li>
            <li>Have not tried it yet it seems nice and smells great</li>
            <li>A good starter kit to try</li>
            <li>Still couldn&#x27;t get a good result.  </li>
            <li>No conditioner needed.&lt;br /&gt;The bars I liked best for my hair were Beer, Lemon-Chamomile and the Hemp Seed (unscented), my latest favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I tried the samples.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and a good start to a toxic free lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>Lovely earthy smells!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Beauty and the Bees is the first brand of shampoo bar that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I received the box, it was nice and when I opened it, most of the soaps were melted and sticking to another!</li>
            <li>Oh and this company has amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re money also its nice</li>
            <li>Nice sampler.</li>
            <li>It all smells so good, and lathers better than almost anything.</li>
            <li>Yes, these considerations are great, but the shampoo won&#x27;t actually clean your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would be purchasing the shampoo I liked the most</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>I cured it with awesome non toxic products like this and eating an organic, whole food, gluten free diet.  </li>
            <li>I know chamomile is great for hair, so I tried that one first.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying the full size bar, but maybe they&#x27;ll be good for business trips.</li>
            <li>have untreated, healthy, silver, very fine hair and a super-sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>I like it, very smooth texture.</li>
            <li>So glad for the sample size bars.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Lovely product, lovely scents.  </li>
            <li>After noticing that my hair is much more manageable on days when I do not shampoo it, I started to look into shampoo alternatives.</li>
            <li>am yet to decide which of these bars I would eventually buy after running out of these samples, but for now, I love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have lasted me more than 2 washes each.</li>
            <li>I love all of them.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so shiny and healthy since I started using the shampoo bars.</li>
            <li>This produced more lather than in my hands.  </li>
            <li>I use more soap on the more tangled areas.  </li>
            <li>I was able to rake my fingers through it and the smell was</li>
            <li>and I love them even more as the ones sold in this set are not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about them until I tried the others.</li>
            <li>you get more for</li>
            <li>top picks are the Egg, Beer and mud shampoo bars and the beer and  honey silk conditioning bars</li>
            <li>I love the Beauty and the Bees shampoo bars, and I came to love them through this sample pack.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t take it any more....</li>
            <li>I feel sure</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>i have waist length hair and have started washing twice with the shampoo to be able to go 3 to 4 days before needing to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li>The different smells were wonderful.</li>
            <li>We enjoyed the scents.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I am happy to have 2 less bottles, I am happy with how my hair feels and looks</li>
            <li>You should add conditioner samples with the bundle, I have fine hair and sometimes conditioners are too heavy, it would be nice to try those as well.&lt;br /&gt;All over great product!</li>
            <li>tried 2 of these bars so far and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a favorite because they&#x27;re all fabulous.</li>
            <li>These really smell good.  </li>
            <li>Specially, Rosemary Mint and Voodoo!</li>
            <li>It is not an easy transition</li>
            <li>I use apple-cider vinegar rinse after shampooing to remove any residue and make my hair shiny and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product came very quick, in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>The conditioner bar is the best, The Honey Coconut Protective Creme is my new most favorite thing ever, and the only tragedy is that the Tasmania Honey and Herb Polish shattered in its glass jar before I could give it a try</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair with a flatiron and fine tooth comb.  </li>
            <li>These bars are 100% natural and they clean hair very well without drying and stripping the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been doing the ACV rinse, but my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>4: Didn&#x27;t wash my hair, but I unbraided it, to re-braid it and noticed it was Super Shiny!  </li>
            <li>I am super happy with the product because it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok if you do because it&#x27;s so natural and creates amazing lather.</li>
            <li>a huge favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I great way to test out all the different varieties and see which ones you like.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this bars to be a bit bigger, but I would have to say that all in all I was happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Light was glistening from my hair.  </li>
            <li>6: Didn&#x27;t wash my hair, still looked nice and very</li>
            <li>Realizing that I sound like a lunatic.  </li>
            <li>I try to keep a plastic free house and this means a lot to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got rid of the easy stuff first..</li>
            <li>I wish so much I could write a good review of these, I really do!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to look anywhere else now for shampoo and conditioning top quality products with amazing scent not over powering fresh and natural Beauty and the Bees</li>
            <li>I was so excited to order them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Living in San Diego, it is easy to slip into Hippie-Hood pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>I like squeaky clean</li>
            <li>My scalp stays clean for a longer period of time and my hair has lots of body.  </li>
            <li>But I had read so many positive reviews online</li>
            <li>All natural, more manageable hair, and doesn&#x27;t trigger my husband&#x27;s chemical sensitivities!</li>
            <li>Lathers beautifully, smells great (natural, subtle)...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft, but it does have a nice scent.</li>
            <li>All 6 samples combined are about the size of one full bar</li>
            <li>Ordered the sample pack for my girlfriend and received just the Rosemary Mint in a full sized bar.  </li>
            <li>I use sooo much shampoo and even more conditioner just to get the tangles</li>
            <li>, I have bought the egg and beer shampoo bars in full sizes that this kit does not include</li>
            <li>Product itself is good but find I need to use ACV afterwards, I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet and with no poo I only have to wash my hair every 3 to 4 days, so</li>
            <li>but who prefer handmade naturals to the stuff the stores sell, thank you so much will order 3 more when  my budget allows,</li>
            <li>Lathers quickly and rinses out quickly.  </li>
            <li>this will still last me almost 3 months :) I do like the bars I&#x27;ve tried, but another bar I really love has ACV in the bar</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great, the small size of the bars are easy for him to handle by himself, and he loves the smell of each one.</li>
            <li>I always make sure to have back ups stored away to never run out, I have tried many products and it is rare</li>
            <li>My hair has always been flat and fine and prone to stringiness, but for the first time in my life it has a little body to it now... very healthy &amp; happy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other natural shampoos, but this is by far the best, I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>Loved every single one.</li>
            <li>Very good sampler, the bars lasted for a couple of weeks at least depending on</li>
            <li>and I hope to see them extent their product line in the future its like these products are not from earth because they are so amazing</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say the bars are relatively economical too (</li>
            <li>It was fun to have samples to try.</li>
            <li>Try this first before committing to a full size bar.</li>
            <li>These are lovely and work better than I ever expected.  </li>
            <li>I was supposed to get the sample pack that had 6 shampoo bar samples, each of a different kind</li>
            <li>I love the products so far, haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet.  </li>
            <li>tried this sampler and after having tried most of the samples ended up buying full size bars of the Beer and the Lemon-Chamomile Bar, which made my hair soft and shiny, produce a nice creamy lather, and don&#x27;t dry my scalp.</li>
            <li>Once this happens the scalp has the right amount of oils and wont be greasy anymore.  </li>
            <li>But I really am missing the nice smooth brushing that comes with conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have now is I love them all.</li>
            <li>This year is the first year without it.</li>
            <li>At first I thought a mistake had been made like one reviewer mentioned:I got a box advertising a sample</li>
            <li>/&gt;Further details:&lt;br /&gt;These samples are about 20g each and would certainly last more than a couple of washes.</li>
            <li>I was so accustomed to regular shampoo and wasn&#x27;t sure I could give up conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been able to go an extra day between washings.</li>
            <li>I rinsed until the hot water gave out...</li>
            <li>Glad I only got the samples of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better for use as a body wash only.</li>
            <li>No big bottles spilling  that have mostly water and chemicals that ruin hair and scalp</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t leave them in the hot water they will melt</li>
            <li>If you are used to using solid shampoo then you will be pleased.  </li>
            <li>I recommend buying if you are interested in switching shampoos.</li>
            <li>I will try to support more local business next time but this sampler did put me on the bar shampoo train, so if you aren&#x27;t sure if you want to do it</li>
            <li>I basically wasted my money because I can&#x27;t really use these and get good results</li>
            <li>As with shampoos I find (I have very fine natural curly hair and enough hair for 2 people) that I can&#x27;t us the same bar more then 3 times in a row, so I do really like the mix of bars.</li>
            <li>an unwelcome experience.&lt;br /&gt;Someone else could easily have a different experience.  </li>
            <li>It was a tough choice, but my favorites were the Tasmanian Beer, Moroccan Mud (both were very moisturizing) and Lemon and Chamomile (great for my blond hair).</li>
            <li>It rinses well and fast</li>
            <li>My hair was really greasy</li>
            <li>they are the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband has volunteered to try the Real Beer sample and seems to like it so far.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the sampling, because now I know what bars I want to buy.</li>
            <li>Here is my real experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: &amp;#34;Gotta Style this Mess&amp;#34</li>
            <li>( I was very nervous. )  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Bar shampoo lasts much longer than liquid shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have blonde color treated hair but very rarely use heated tools on it.</li>
            <li>Well not completely gluten free</li>
            <li>These clean the hair so well and are a economical, less wasteful way to use shampoo.</li>
            <li>I finally got to the end of the products, I washed my hair with a cheap but natural supermarket shampoo followed by a rinse with apple cider vinegar to get rid of the build up from the shampoo bars.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I am  more than a little worried.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has ever left my hair so clean soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been so happy to have been sent the wrong thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will take a week or two of use before you are totally adjusted, but it is so worth</li>
            <li>Will update once I&#x27;ve tried it a few more times.</li>
            <li>My hair was straighten and moved and flowed like normal, which made me realize</li>
            <li>However, it can make my hair feel really thick and kind of oily/heavy (though it doesn&#x27;t look oily).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did Beauty and the Bees send me the correct shampoo box, but they sent me a WHOLE BOX of other goodies, all of which I love.</li>
            <li>It just smells heavenly and lively.</li>
            <li>clarification I need to add that I have very soft water at home.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was particularly glad to see this product line and anxious to try it.  </li>
            <li>The Rassoul Clay bar did not work for me, because it made my hair much darker, and the Rosemary-Mint one also darkened my white</li>
            <li>When you use a natural, no toxic ingredient shampoo like this, it is not going to strip your hair which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>The scalp has to adjust to its natural state of never having its oils stripped.  </li>
            <li>Getting off of shampoo and on to a natural wash took my scalp about a month to adjust.  </li>
            <li>I got all the flavors mentioned, except the natural was switched for a lemon egg flavor,which is fine;my fiance volunteered to try it along with the beer shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and all natural.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/loose curly hair, and have tried every product imaginable.</li>
            <li>I am going to try and natural substance like silica.</li>
            <li>I feel like they have brought out the natural beauty of my hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that after using these bars, my natural waves are accentuated.</li>
            <li>It was strange not using conditioner at first, but I don&#x27;t miss it now</li>
            <li>next I will try the voodoo bamboo shampoo bar it looks just as promising and believe me these full bars last a long time.</li>
            <li>so you do not waste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Lemon and Chamomile so far.</li>
            <li>but I scrub and rub my entire head with bar shampoo out of habit then rinse my whole head at one time.  </li>
            <li>i was expecting a residue build up, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>All their beauty creations are lovely, free of all that artificial crap that other companies use, and, almost as importantly, they obviously value their costumers and care about giving the best possible product AND experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw the pretty purple gift bag and instead got a beat up box that was held closed with tape.  </li>
            <li>We especially appreciate the natural fragrances!</li>
            <li>I expected the bars to be a bit bigger, they are tiny, thin slivers that don&#x27;t really allow for several washing a to get a good feel for the product.</li>
            <li>Using the fine tooth comb was a little more difficult than usual, but not impossible.  </li>
            <li>If you are used to using regular store bought shampoo, your natural oils get stripped off of your hair every time you wash.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried one flavor so far and washed my hair</li>
            <li>but I have only tried 1 of them so far</li>
            <li>I would only recommend these products if all you care about is environmentally-friendly packaging and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>They seemed to strip my hair of natural oils (leaving it so coarse</li>
            <li>All of the bars left our hair feeling soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>Will be updating after a few months worth of using products.</li>
            <li>She was crazy about the bamboo charcoal one that I have ordered multiple times, just would have loved to receive what we ordered.  </li>
            <li>The only other one I really wanted to try was Moroccan Mud, but its easier to buy individual bars than the sampler so this worked out.</li>

            <li> Very good product and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Great way to see which ones you like best.  </li>
            <li> Amazon as always was great about crediting/replacing, but instead of trying the samples I replaced it with Charcoal Bamboo and was very happy.  </li>
            <li> I truly loved the product !</li>
            <li> my curls are great now without any product.</li>

            <li> they smell nice and lather well!</li>
            <li> awesome shampoos, enjoying all of them.</li>
            <li> They all smell great, and it was a good way for my family to see which one they liked.  </li>
            <li> A good time to find out if the product works for you or</li>
            <li> They all lather gorgeously and leave you hair with a lot of body.</li>
            <li> I loved trying all of them out before settling on our favorites.</li>
            <li> My hair LOVED the beer shampoo.</li>
            <li> (Good by me.)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 7: &amp;#34;I am having Withdrawls from my Beloved Hair Conditioner...</li>
            <li> Have not tried it yet it seems nice and smells great</li>
            <li> A good starter kit to try</li>
            <li> Still couldn&#x27;t get a good result.  </li>
            <li> No conditioner needed.&lt;br /&gt;The bars I liked best for my hair were Beer, Lemon-Chamomile and the Hemp Seed (unscented), my latest favorite.  </li>
            <li> I am very glad I tried the samples.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and a good start to a toxic free lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> Lovely earthy smells!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Beauty and the Bees is the first brand of shampoo bar that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I received the box, it was nice and when I opened it, most of the soaps were melted and sticking to another!</li>
            <li> Oh and this company has amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re money also its nice</li>
            <li> Nice sampler.</li>
            <li> It all smells so good, and lathers better than almost anything.</li>
            <li> Yes, these considerations are great, but the shampoo won&#x27;t actually clean your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would be purchasing the shampoo I liked the most</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> I cured it with awesome non toxic products like this and eating an organic, whole food, gluten free diet.  </li>
            <li> I know chamomile is great for hair, so I tried that one first.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying the full size bar, but maybe they&#x27;ll be good for business trips.</li>
            <li> have untreated, healthy, silver, very fine hair and a super-sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> I like it, very smooth texture.</li>
            <li> So glad for the sample size bars.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Lovely product, lovely scents.  </li>
            <li> After noticing that my hair is much more manageable on days when I do not shampoo it, I started to look into shampoo alternatives.</li>
            <li> am yet to decide which of these bars I would eventually buy after running out of these samples, but for now, I love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have lasted me more than 2 washes each.</li>
            <li> I love all of them.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so shiny and healthy since I started using the shampoo bars.</li>
            <li> This produced more lather than in my hands.  </li>
            <li> I use more soap on the more tangled areas.  </li>
            <li> I was able to rake my fingers through it and the smell was</li>
            <li> and I love them even more as the ones sold in this set are not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about them until I tried the others.</li>
            <li> you get more for</li>
            <li> top picks are the Egg, Beer and mud shampoo bars and the beer and  honey silk conditioning bars</li>
            <li> I love the Beauty and the Bees shampoo bars, and I came to love them through this sample pack.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t take it any more....</li>
            <li> I feel sure</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> i have waist length hair and have started washing twice with the shampoo to be able to go 3 to 4 days before needing to wash my hair again.</li>
            <li> The different smells were wonderful.</li>
            <li> We enjoyed the scents.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I am happy to have 2 less bottles, I am happy with how my hair feels and looks</li>
            <li> You should add conditioner samples with the bundle, I have fine hair and sometimes conditioners are too heavy, it would be nice to try those as well.&lt;br /&gt;All over great product!</li>
            <li> tried 2 of these bars so far and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a favorite because they&#x27;re all fabulous.</li>
            <li> These really smell good.  </li>
            <li> Specially, Rosemary Mint and Voodoo!</li>
            <li> It is not an easy transition</li>
            <li> I use apple-cider vinegar rinse after shampooing to remove any residue and make my hair shiny and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product came very quick, in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The conditioner bar is the best, The Honey Coconut Protective Creme is my new most favorite thing ever, and the only tragedy is that the Tasmania Honey and Herb Polish shattered in its glass jar before I could give it a try</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair with a flatiron and fine tooth comb.  </li>
            <li> These bars are 100% natural and they clean hair very well without drying and stripping the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been doing the ACV rinse, but my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> 4: Didn&#x27;t wash my hair, but I unbraided it, to re-braid it and noticed it was Super Shiny!  </li>
            <li> I am super happy with the product because it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if you do because it&#x27;s so natural and creates amazing lather.</li>
            <li> a huge favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I great way to test out all the different varieties and see which ones you like.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this bars to be a bit bigger, but I would have to say that all in all I was happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Light was glistening from my hair.  </li>
            <li> 6: Didn&#x27;t wash my hair, still looked nice and very</li>
            <li> Realizing that I sound like a lunatic.  </li>
            <li> I try to keep a plastic free house and this means a lot to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got rid of the easy stuff first..</li>
            <li> I wish so much I could write a good review of these, I really do!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to look anywhere else now for shampoo and conditioning top quality products with amazing scent not over powering fresh and natural Beauty and the Bees</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in San Diego, it is easy to slip into Hippie-Hood pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> I like squeaky clean</li>
            <li> My scalp stays clean for a longer period of time and my hair has lots of body.  </li>
            <li> But I had read so many positive reviews online</li>
            <li> All natural, more manageable hair, and doesn&#x27;t trigger my husband&#x27;s chemical sensitivities!</li>
            <li> Lathers beautifully, smells great (natural, subtle)...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft, but it does have a nice scent.</li>
            <li> All 6 samples combined are about the size of one full bar</li>
            <li> Ordered the sample pack for my girlfriend and received just the Rosemary Mint in a full sized bar.  </li>
            <li> I use sooo much shampoo and even more conditioner just to get the tangles</li>
            <li> , I have bought the egg and beer shampoo bars in full sizes that this kit does not include</li>
            <li> Product itself is good but find I need to use ACV afterwards, I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet and with no poo I only have to wash my hair every 3 to 4 days, so</li>
            <li> but who prefer handmade naturals to the stuff the stores sell, thank you so much will order 3 more when  my budget allows,</li>
            <li> Lathers quickly and rinses out quickly.  </li>
            <li> this will still last me almost 3 months :) I do like the bars I&#x27;ve tried, but another bar I really love has ACV in the bar</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great, the small size of the bars are easy for him to handle by himself, and he loves the smell of each one.</li>
            <li> I always make sure to have back ups stored away to never run out, I have tried many products and it is rare</li>
            <li> My hair has always been flat and fine and prone to stringiness, but for the first time in my life it has a little body to it now... very healthy &amp; happy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other natural shampoos, but this is by far the best, I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Loved every single one.</li>
            <li> Very good sampler, the bars lasted for a couple of weeks at least depending on</li>
            <li> and I hope to see them extent their product line in the future its like these products are not from earth because they are so amazing</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say the bars are relatively economical too (</li>
            <li> It was fun to have samples to try.</li>
            <li> Try this first before committing to a full size bar.</li>
            <li> These are lovely and work better than I ever expected.  </li>
            <li> I was supposed to get the sample pack that had 6 shampoo bar samples, each of a different kind</li>
            <li> I love the products so far, haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet.  </li>
            <li> tried this sampler and after having tried most of the samples ended up buying full size bars of the Beer and the Lemon-Chamomile Bar, which made my hair soft and shiny, produce a nice creamy lather, and don&#x27;t dry my scalp.</li>
            <li> Once this happens the scalp has the right amount of oils and wont be greasy anymore.  </li>
            <li> But I really am missing the nice smooth brushing that comes with conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have now is I love them all.</li>
            <li> This year is the first year without it.</li>
            <li> At first I thought a mistake had been made like one reviewer mentioned:I got a box advertising a sample</li>
            <li> /&gt;Further details:&lt;br /&gt;These samples are about 20g each and would certainly last more than a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> I was so accustomed to regular shampoo and wasn&#x27;t sure I could give up conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been able to go an extra day between washings.</li>
            <li> I rinsed until the hot water gave out...</li>
            <li> Glad I only got the samples of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better for use as a body wash only.</li>
            <li> No big bottles spilling  that have mostly water and chemicals that ruin hair and scalp</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t leave them in the hot water they will melt</li>
            <li> If you are used to using solid shampoo then you will be pleased.  </li>
            <li> I recommend buying if you are interested in switching shampoos.</li>
            <li> I will try to support more local business next time but this sampler did put me on the bar shampoo train, so if you aren&#x27;t sure if you want to do it</li>
            <li> I basically wasted my money because I can&#x27;t really use these and get good results</li>
            <li> As with shampoos I find (I have very fine natural curly hair and enough hair for 2 people) that I can&#x27;t us the same bar more then 3 times in a row, so I do really like the mix of bars.</li>
            <li> an unwelcome experience.&lt;br /&gt;Someone else could easily have a different experience.  </li>
            <li> It was a tough choice, but my favorites were the Tasmanian Beer, Moroccan Mud (both were very moisturizing) and Lemon and Chamomile (great for my blond hair).</li>
            <li> It rinses well and fast</li>
            <li> My hair was really greasy</li>
            <li> they are the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband has volunteered to try the Real Beer sample and seems to like it so far.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the sampling, because now I know what bars I want to buy.</li>
            <li> Here is my real experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: &amp;#34;Gotta Style this Mess&amp;#34</li>
            <li> ( I was very nervous. )  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Bar shampoo lasts much longer than liquid shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have blonde color treated hair but very rarely use heated tools on it.</li>
            <li> Well not completely gluten free</li>
            <li> These clean the hair so well and are a economical, less wasteful way to use shampoo.</li>
            <li> I finally got to the end of the products, I washed my hair with a cheap but natural supermarket shampoo followed by a rinse with apple cider vinegar to get rid of the build up from the shampoo bars.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I am  more than a little worried.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has ever left my hair so clean soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been so happy to have been sent the wrong thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will take a week or two of use before you are totally adjusted, but it is so worth</li>
            <li> Will update once I&#x27;ve tried it a few more times.</li>
            <li> My hair was straighten and moved and flowed like normal, which made me realize</li>
            <li> However, it can make my hair feel really thick and kind of oily/heavy (though it doesn&#x27;t look oily).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did Beauty and the Bees send me the correct shampoo box, but they sent me a WHOLE BOX of other goodies, all of which I love.</li>
            <li> It just smells heavenly and lively.</li>
            <li> clarification I need to add that I have very soft water at home.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was particularly glad to see this product line and anxious to try it.  </li>
            <li> The Rassoul Clay bar did not work for me, because it made my hair much darker, and the Rosemary-Mint one also darkened my white</li>
            <li> When you use a natural, no toxic ingredient shampoo like this, it is not going to strip your hair which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> The scalp has to adjust to its natural state of never having its oils stripped.  </li>
            <li> Getting off of shampoo and on to a natural wash took my scalp about a month to adjust.  </li>
            <li> I got all the flavors mentioned, except the natural was switched for a lemon egg flavor,which is fine;my fiance volunteered to try it along with the beer shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Affordable and all natural.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/loose curly hair, and have tried every product imaginable.</li>
            <li> I am going to try and natural substance like silica.</li>
            <li> I feel like they have brought out the natural beauty of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that after using these bars, my natural waves are accentuated.</li>
            <li> It was strange not using conditioner at first, but I don&#x27;t miss it now</li>
            <li> next I will try the voodoo bamboo shampoo bar it looks just as promising and believe me these full bars last a long time.</li>
            <li> so you do not waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Lemon and Chamomile so far.</li>
            <li> but I scrub and rub my entire head with bar shampoo out of habit then rinse my whole head at one time.  </li>
            <li> i was expecting a residue build up, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> All their beauty creations are lovely, free of all that artificial crap that other companies use, and, almost as importantly, they obviously value their costumers and care about giving the best possible product AND experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw the pretty purple gift bag and instead got a beat up box that was held closed with tape.  </li>
            <li> We especially appreciate the natural fragrances!</li>
            <li> I expected the bars to be a bit bigger, they are tiny, thin slivers that don&#x27;t really allow for several washing a to get a good feel for the product.</li>
            <li> Using the fine tooth comb was a little more difficult than usual, but not impossible.  </li>
            <li> If you are used to using regular store bought shampoo, your natural oils get stripped off of your hair every time you wash.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried one flavor so far and washed my hair</li>
            <li> but I have only tried 1 of them so far</li>
            <li> I would only recommend these products if all you care about is environmentally-friendly packaging and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> They seemed to strip my hair of natural oils (leaving it so coarse</li>
            <li> All of the bars left our hair feeling soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> Will be updating after a few months worth of using products.</li>
            <li> She was crazy about the bamboo charcoal one that I have ordered multiple times, just would have loved to receive what we ordered.  </li>
            <li> The only other one I really wanted to try was Moroccan Mud, but its easier to buy individual bars than the sampler so this worked out.</li>
            <li> Goes well with my regular routine of washing my hair once a week with organic whole leaf aloe vera gel and raw honey mixed together.  </li>
            <li> I use other natural products and had no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried one bar so far, and the results are typical for a solid shampoo bar with conditioning oils.  </li>
            <li> Each bar last quite a long time as well.</li>
            <li> but this thing left my hair all dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I noticed that shortly after he started using the shampoo bars that his scalp was no longer flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling like I had been swimming at the beach all day then just let my hair dry.</li>
            <li> My last bar shampoo left me with a sad case of dandruff, and I think it&#x27;s a little better in the couple weeks since I&#x27;ve been using this bar.</li>
            <li> Think I may order a large bar of at least one of the fragrances when I finish comparing them all.  </li>
            <li> Using these little wafers, I got water in my ears when I rinsed the suds off which surprised me -</li>
            <li> I have long been an organic advocate, and a &#x27;no poo&#x27; person</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the ones I have tried</li>
            <li> Also, I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, and it seems one of the sample bars lasts about 3 weeks for me.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as long.  </li>
            <li> Only down side, there defiantly is a left over residue after washing...</li>
            <li> After having tried the other leading brands (JR Liggett and Maple Hill), I always end up going back to the Tasmanian shampoo</li>
            <li> I purchased this sampler 8 weeks ago and am on the third sample bar (shampooing ever other day or so).  </li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair every other day and now I wash it about every 3rd day.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my hair seemed dirtier every time I washed it as the shampoo left a residue at the roots.</li>
            <li> shampoo bars left me feeling extremely self-conscious and filthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then I towel my hair dry and blow-dry it in shape.</li>
            <li> If you take the paper off any bar soap or shampoo and let it dry, it lasts even longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the bar is allowed to dry after using it extends the life of the</li>
            <li> my hair was so dry</li>
            <li> My hair did comb right through without being tangly but it was just heavy, dull and lifeless still.  </li>
            <li> a single bar of soap(I was expecting the bag I saw advertised).</li>
            <li> Instead I received a single lavender bar.</li>
            <li> the six soap sample pack, but instead received a single bar in a variety that was not even in the sample pack.  </li>
            <li> When I got back from traveling 6 weeks later (past the &amp;#34;return policy&amp;#34; date)</li>
            <li> but they dry out my hair, which is bad because the climate I live in is hot and dry.</li>
            <li> The bars left my hair squeaky but not clean.</li>
            <li> Tiny little box with tiny little samples.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> My son has the oiliest hair, and he is autistic, so he can not use traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weekend, I braid my hair wet, didn&#x27;t think another thing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many times I have bought bath size bars only to find out that I hate the product.  </li>
            <li> The sample bars are small and get a little hard to use when they&#x27;re down to a sliver, but they&#x27;re still pretty long-lasting (and of course the bigger bars will be easier to work with).  </li>
            <li> which one was the winner.&lt;br /&gt;Beauty and the Bees bars clearly blow all the other shampoo bars out of the water, I mean</li>
            <li> There was also very little variance between the different bars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair.&lt;br /&gt;These bars appear small but give me about 2 to three weeks of daily washing.  </li>
            <li> I have used other shampoo bars before.</li>
            <li> Shampoo bars were a weird concept to me at first.</li>
            <li> Plus, shampoo bars have an advantage over other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos because they&#x27;re not packaged in plastic:</li>
            <li> My husband was skeptical about the bars at first</li>
            <li> Maybe apple cider vinegar would work, but I have tried other bars (Burt&#x27;s Bees until they stopped making it) and never had this issue.</li>
            <li> I remove my bottled shampoo and conditioner from my shower and stick them under the sink with all the other misfit products.  </li>
            <li> One other thought, if you don&#x27;t have conditioner, be warned.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair every day and all other shampoo bars dry out my scalp and make my hair frizzy after a few weeks, just like all the shampoos (with or without sulfates).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These were a lot smaller than i had anticipated and were hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Now I am really noticing that the weird feeling from Day 1 and Day 2 is gone.  </li>
            <li> had I used at least a vinegar rinse to cut the residue, my experience would have been different</li>
            <li> Down to my elbow</li>
            <li> Neck down gets bar</li>
            <li> My hair took much less time to dry with a hair dryer than usual.</li>
            <li> I cut the voodoo bar in half and gave a piece to fiance to place in his shower.</li>
            <li> but I swear my hair has body, shine and less split ends already.</li>
            <li> less waste&#x3D;better for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any styling products whatsoever and had already been using an anti-residue shampoo previous to this.  </li>
            <li> I like the ingredient list, but it does not work for my thick, dry hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves a heavy film on hair that won&#x27;t rinse out.</li>
            <li> you are not helping to destroy the oceans with chemicals.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;ve tried 2 of the 6 so far and was not impressed by either one.</li>
            <li> My hair felt heavy.  </li>
            <li> my hair was just heavy, weighed down, dull and lifeless.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve actually received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely felt weird.  </li>
            <li> Way back,  when I was a child, people used stale beer, vinegar or lemon juice as conditioner.  </li>

            <li> He put it on the built in soap dish and w/subsequent showers it has warped the soap a bit and made black drippy stains run down the side so that it looks like something creepy is growing in his shower.</li>
            <li> I did not use them with hard water.  </li>
            <li> I stood in awe in my mirror for at least a couple moments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I persisted with the entire sample box, but this was by far the worst shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked using rinses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sample sizes are approximately 1/4 - 1/3 of an inch thick and I quite a few shampoos out of a bar even with thick below shoulder length</li>

            <li> but, I been using for a while and still no good.</li>
            <li> I used them on my little one and it helped eliminate her cradle cap (along with coconut oil)!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry that the barcode shot is a little blurry in the picture!</li>
            <li> I know that neither the JR Liggett or the Maple Hill bars worked when I went to see my sister who has very hard water.  </li>
            <li> I have thin brittle hair and this soap works wonders.</li>
            <li> The thin wafers have a paper identifier.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed I did not receive the item I wanted but opted to just keep the single bar as I needed shampoo and hadn&#x27;t the time to run to the UPS store to return the item.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these shampoo bars!</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was morning, I am shopping randomly on Amazon...  </li>
            <li> , my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weird</li>
            <li> (he thought I was crazy), but now he&#x27;s requesting the beer shampoo bar...and telling everyone about it because it has beer in it.</li>
            <li> and it is a crazy mane.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I got the wrong item!</li>
            <li> Horrible, it least you hair greasy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I figured that it might have been bad shipping conditions</li>
            <li> I have had bad psoriasis all my life to where my scalp would bleed and get scabby.  </li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1:  &amp;#34;What the Crap</li>
            <li> cannot review the scents because I have no sense of smell but nobody ran away from me holding their noses or sneezing violently.</li>
            <li> so I tried one, and my god was it BAD!</li>
            <li> Bad product!</li>
            <li> but I never gave in and washed it with that nasty toxic shampoo thats in stores.  </li>
            <li> This is highly disappointing!!!!</li>
            <li> I was doing the no  poo (shampoo) thing and got the horrible dandruff.</li>

            <li> Beauty and the Bees shampoo bars are the best shampoo bars I have tried. After having tried the other leading brands (JR Liggett and Maple Hill), I always end up going back to the Tasmanian shampoo bars.&lt;br /&gt;I have untreated, healthy, silver, very fine hair and a super-sensitive scalp.  I have to wash my hair every day and all other shampoo bars dry out my scalp and make my hair frizzy after a few weeks, just like all the shampoos (with or without sulfates).&lt;br /&gt;I tried this sampler and after having tried most of the samples ended up buying full size bars of the Beer and the Lemon-Chamomile Bar, which made my hair soft and shiny, produce a nice creamy lather, and don&#x27;t dry my scalp. I just rub the bar in my hand, create lots of creamy suds and work it through my short bob.  It rinses well and fast and then I towel my hair dry and blow-dry it in shape. No conditioner needed.&lt;br /&gt;The bars I liked best for my hair were Beer, Lemon-Chamomile and the Hemp Seed (unscented), my latest favorite.  The Rassoul Clay bar did not work for me, because it made my hair much darker, and the Rosemary-Mint one also darkened my white hair.&lt;br /&gt;These bars appear small but give me about 2 to three weeks of daily washing.  A good time to find out if the product works for you or not.&lt;br /&gt;The sampler is perfect if you want to try shampoo bars or find your favorite.  I ended up with three favorites, which I will rotate on a monthly basis,  I can&#x27;t make up my mind which one was the winner.&lt;br /&gt;Beauty and the Bees bars clearly blow all the other shampoo bars out of the water, I mean shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For clarification I need to add that I have very soft water at home.  I did not use them with hard water.  They may not work that well then.  I know that neither the JR Liggett or the Maple Hill bars worked when I went to see my sister who has very hard water.  I had to switch back to shampoo when I visited her.</li>
            <li> These were a lot smaller than i had anticipated and were hard to work with. definitely a sample box.</li>
            <li> My son has the oiliest hair, and he is autistic, so he can not use traditional shampoo. This shampoo is great, the small size of the bars are easy for him to handle by himself, and he loves the smell of each one. I am super happy with the product because it is 100% natural. I have tried many other natural shampoos, but this is by far the best, I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I have used other shampoo bars before. Even after a week of using this product I still felt as though I had residue in my hair. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these shampoo bars! All natural, more manageable hair, and doesn&#x27;t trigger my husband&#x27;s chemical sensitivities!</li>
            <li> Really great shampoo!  Lathers quickly and rinses out quickly.  We especially appreciate the natural fragrances!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these but they dry out my hair, which is bad because the climate I live in is hot and dry. I like the ingredient list, but it does not work for my thick, dry hair. I thought maybe it was transition period but, I been using for a while and still no good. I use other natural products and had no problems.</li>
            <li> I received the box, it was nice and when I opened it, most of the soaps were melted and sticking to another! I figured that it might have been bad shipping conditions so I tried one, and my god was it BAD! I have long been an organic advocate, and a &#x27;no poo&#x27; person but this thing left my hair all dry and brittle. Bad product!</li>
            <li> I great way to test out all the different varieties and see which ones you like. They all lather gorgeously and leave you hair with a lot of body.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this bars to be a bit bigger, but I would have to say that all in all I was happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> So glad for the sample size bars.  So many times I have bought bath size bars only to find out that I hate the product.  The only problem I have now is I love them all.</li>
            <li> Very good product and ingredients.  Goes well with my regular routine of washing my hair once a week with organic whole leaf aloe vera gel and raw honey mixed together.  If you are used to using regular store bought shampoo, your natural oils get stripped off of your hair every time you wash.  When you use a natural, no toxic ingredient shampoo like this, it is not going to strip your hair which is a plus.  But your scalp will start over producing oils and your hair will look greasy for a while.  The scalp has to adjust to its natural state of never having its oils stripped.  Once this happens the scalp has the right amount of oils and wont be greasy anymore.  Getting off of shampoo and on to a natural wash took my scalp about a month to adjust.  My hair was really greasy but I never gave in and washed it with that nasty toxic shampoo thats in stores.  I have had bad psoriasis all my life to where my scalp would bleed and get scabby.  This year is the first year without it. Not even a flake of dandruff.  I cured it with awesome non toxic products like this and eating an organic, whole food, gluten free diet.  Well not completely gluten free but I ate gluten sparingly.  Like equivalent to 3 pieces of bread a week.  Anyways,  you get my point.  This is a great product and a good start to a toxic free lifestyle.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m hooked.  :)  I purchased this sampler 8 weeks ago and am on the third sample bar (shampooing ever other day or so).  Lathers beautifully, smells great (natural, subtle)... My hair has always been flat and fine and prone to stringiness, but for the first time in my life it has a little body to it now... very healthy &amp; happy.  The sample bars are small and get a little hard to use when they&#x27;re down to a sliver, but they&#x27;re still pretty long-lasting (and of course the bigger bars will be easier to work with).  Also using their conditioner bar.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> I used the lemon and chamomile soap then rinsed with apple cider vinegar  ....perfect</li>
            <li> Horrible, it least you hair greasy and lifeless. did not work for me at all. I wish I can return it</li>
            <li> At first I thought a mistake had been made like one reviewer mentioned:I got a box advertising a sample but it looked like I got a single bar of soap(I was expecting the bag I saw advertised). I opened the box and instead of one bar I see six soap samples. I got all the flavors mentioned, except the natural was switched for a lemon egg flavor,which is fine;my fiance volunteered to try it along with the beer shampoo.  I have only tried one flavor so far and washed my hair w/it twice; lemon chamomile.  I know chamomile is great for hair, so I tried that one first. It just smells heavenly and lively. I keep forgetting it&#x27;s shampoo and want to wash my bod w/it. It&#x27;s ok if you do because it&#x27;s so natural and creates amazing lather. This is the 4th item I have chosen from Beauty/Bees and the 2nd shampoo. I tried some voodoo earlier and we still have some of that left. I cut the voodoo bar in half and gave a piece to fiance to place in his shower. He put it on the built in soap dish and w/subsequent showers it has warped the soap a bit and made black drippy stains run down the side so that it looks like something creepy is growing in his shower. For the people out there who don&#x27;t know about hand made soap-please keep it in a soap dish that drains and away from shower spray.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, lovely scents.  I wanted the sample size which are perfect for travel.  These clean the hair so well and are a economical, less wasteful way to use shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best sample box around! Can&#x27;t wait to try all the bars. I have thin brittle hair and this soap works wonders. Give up your salon shampoos. I am telling you, from someone who only used to purchase expensive products that my hairdresser recommended, this soap trumps all of them. Affordable and all natural. Can&#x27;t go wrong! Will be updating after a few months worth of using products. It&#x27;s only been a week but I swear my hair has body, shine and less split ends already. Will be purchasing again once I&#x27;ve tried all the samples!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/loose curly hair, and have tried every product imaginable. After noticing that my hair is much more manageable on days when I do not shampoo it, I started to look into shampoo alternatives. I was on the fence about shampoo bars, but let me tell you-- they are the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take a week or two of use before you are totally adjusted, but it is so worth it-- my curls are great now without any product. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I received this item promptly.&lt;br /&gt;I tried 2 of these bars so far and am happy with my purchase. My husband has volunteered to try the Real Beer sample and seems to like it so far.&lt;br /&gt;I am yet to decide which of these bars I would eventually buy after running out of these samples, but for now, I love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further details:&lt;br /&gt;These samples are about 20g each and would certainly last more than a couple of washes. I have long hair and the ones I have tried have lasted me more than 2 washes each. And I still have quite some left of them.</li>
            <li> this is how I started using shampoo bars.  Great way to see which ones you like best.  I didn&#x27;t dislike any of them, but have my favorites now.  Great products by this company.</li>
            <li> Tiny little box with tiny little samples.&lt;br /&gt;But they smell nice and lather well!</li>
            <li> Lovely earthy smells!  I use these on days when my hair feels a bit frazzled and needs a gentler wash.  However, it can make my hair feel really thick and kind of oily/heavy (though it doesn&#x27;t look oily).  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft, but it does have a nice scent.</li>
            <li> These really smell good.  I just tried one last night.  My hair is very fine and I still need to use leave in conditioner.  I am going to try and natural substance like silica.</li>
            <li> Shampoo bars were a weird concept to me at first. I was so accustomed to regular shampoo and wasn&#x27;t sure I could give up conditioner. But I had read so many positive reviews online and I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to products that are formulated without parabens, phthalates, SLS, etc., so I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. Plus, shampoo bars have an advantage over other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos because they&#x27;re not packaged in plastic: less waste&#x3D;better for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty and the Bees is the first brand of shampoo bar that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results. I feel like they have brought out the natural beauty of my hair. My hair is wavy and I&#x27;ve noticed that after using these bars, my natural waves are accentuated. I&#x27;ve also been able to go an extra day between washings. I used to wash my hair every other day and now I wash it about every 3rd day. It was strange not using conditioner at first, but I don&#x27;t miss it now and I don&#x27;t feel like I need it--I have no issues with tangles. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll do an ACV rinse to remove any buildup from styling products if I&#x27;ve been using them. My husband was skeptical about the bars at first (he thought I was crazy), but now he&#x27;s requesting the beer shampoo bar...and telling everyone about it because it has beer in it. I noticed that shortly after he started using the shampoo bars that his scalp was no longer flaky and dry. With my husband using them daily and me using them 3-4 times/week it took us almost 3 months to use up the sample pack. All 6 samples combined are about the size of one full bar so I&#x27;d say the bars are relatively economical too (another pro).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample pack was a great way to be introduced to shampoo bars. I loved trying all of them out before settling on our favorites. It was a tough choice, but my favorites were the Tasmanian Beer, Moroccan Mud (both were very moisturizing) and Lemon and Chamomile (great for my blond hair).</li>
            <li> I am now convinced that shampoo bars are the best way to go!!</li>
            <li> None of the samples I tried rinsed out of my hair. It left my hair feeling like I had been swimming at the beach all day then just let my hair dry. I rinsed until the hot water gave out...I tried conditioner, nothing helped. Maybe apple cider vinegar would work, but I have tried other bars (Burt&#x27;s Bees until they stopped making it) and never had this issue. I have since found a product that DOES work. Glad I only got the samples of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great Product. It was fun to have samples to try. I think that it is a great marketing tactic. Each bar last quite a long time as well. My hair is quite silky after wards and I do use coconut oil to make it even softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually received the wrong product. I didn&#x27;t get the samples, but got the voodoo bamboo charcoal soap instead. I&#x27;ve only tried it once and so I can&#x27;t judge it yet. It left a waxy residue though it went away after I rinsed it with apple cider vinegar. Will update once I&#x27;ve tried it a few more times.</li>
            <li> Too expensive. Leaves a heavy film on hair that won&#x27;t rinse out. Better for use as a body wash only.</li>
            <li> Ordered the sample pack for my girlfriend and received just the Rosemary Mint in a full sized bar.  She was crazy about the bamboo charcoal one that I have ordered multiple times, just would have loved to receive what we ordered.  Sorry that the barcode shot is a little blurry in the picture!</li>
            <li> Perfect size to try out each one. My hair LOVED the beer shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love all of them. My hair looks so shiny and healthy since I started using the shampoo bars. I really like the sampling, because now I know what bars I want to buy.</li>
            <li> Here is my real experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I have been looking at all the plastic bottles in my house.  Especially my bathroom...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;Contact Lens Solution&lt;br /&gt;Lotions&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Body Wash&lt;br /&gt;Hand Soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh!  So many bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got rid of the easy stuff first..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good bye Hand Soap Bottle - you are now a bar&lt;br /&gt;Good bye Body Wash Bottle - you are now a bar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was apprehensive about the hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in San Diego, it is easy to slip into Hippie-Hood pretty easily.  Also, I have long hair.  Down to my elbow and it is a crazy mane.  I use sooo much shampoo and even more conditioner just to get the tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was morning, I am shopping randomly on Amazon...  I decided... I am going to give this bar Shampoo a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1:  &amp;#34;What the Crap..&amp;#34;  I shower.. I lather the bar in my hands, like body soap and go for it.  It created enough lather, but then- What About The Conditioner!  I calmed myself..  This is an experiment and I need to follow through.  So I rinsed...  My hair was very hard to brush out wet.  My hair definitely felt weird.  Overall, I thought..  This is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2:  &amp;#34;Just go for it...  You have to product, just use it.&amp;#34;  I shower, this time I cup the bar in my hand and stroke it over my head as if I was brush my hair, with a bar of soap.  This produced more lather than in my hands.  While I had soap froth in my hair, I decided to brush it out.  I started at the bottom and worked my way up, detangling as I went.  This took a while, and I was giving elevator eyes to my big bottle of conditioner.  Though, I was determined to stick this experiment out.  Rinsed..  Hair still felt weird, but it was more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: &amp;#34;Meh&amp;#34;  Same as day 2.  Cup the bar in my hand, act like I am brushing my hair.  Then while soap is still in my hair, I detangle. I use more soap on the more tangled areas.  I rinse...  I notice that my hair is feeling less weird.  It&#x27;s a weekend, I braid my hair wet, didn&#x27;t think another thing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4: Didn&#x27;t wash my hair, but I unbraided it, to re-braid it and noticed it was Super Shiny!  Light was glistening from my hair.  I stood in awe in my mirror for at least a couple moments.  I was able to rake my fingers through it and the smell was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: &amp;#34;Gotta Style this Mess&amp;#34;  So back to work..  Big Bosses are in.. I gotta style my hair and I am  more than a little worried.  Wash my hair, cup the bar, rake through my hair, brush while frothy, rinse.  My hair took much less time to dry with a hair dryer than usual. (Good by me.)  I straighten my hair with a flatiron and fine tooth comb.  ( I was very nervous. )  Using the fine tooth comb was a little more difficult than usual, but not impossible.  My hair was straighten and moved and flowed like normal, which made me realize, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weird any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 6: Didn&#x27;t wash my hair, still looked nice and very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 7: &amp;#34;I am having Withdrawls from my Beloved Hair Conditioner...&amp;#34;  Suck it up, I say aloud, to myself...  Realizing that I sound like a lunatic.  I remove my bottled shampoo and conditioner from my shower and stick them under the sink with all the other misfit products.  Wash,  Brush, Rinse...  Now I am really noticing that the weird feeling from Day 1 and Day 2 is gone.  But I really am missing the nice smooth brushing that comes with conditioner.  But I am sold on Bar Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good bye Shampoo Bottle - you are now a bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have not gone back to my conditioner, I am looking at bar conditioner..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum all this up- for those of you, who chose not to read my entire ramblings...  It is not an easy transition but I am very happy with the results.  I am happy to have 2 less bottles, I am happy with how my hair feels and looks and I don&#x27;t think I am a hippie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars!hink I am a hippie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars!</li>
            <li> Just have used two of the six but so far very happy with the product.  Think I may order a large bar of at least one of the fragrances when I finish comparing them all.  They suds up great.</li>
            <li> Have not tried it yet it seems nice and smells great</li>
            <li> I truly loved the product !</li>
            <li> A good starter kit to try, I have bought the egg and beer shampoo bars in full sizes that this kit does not include and I love them even more as the ones sold in this set are not my favorite. I wasn&#x27;t sure about them until I tried the others. These bars are 100% natural and they clean hair very well without drying and stripping the best on the market. I don&#x27;t have to look anywhere else now for shampoo and conditioning top quality products with amazing scent not over powering fresh and natural Beauty and the Bees is everything it claims to be. Nothing has ever left my hair so clean soft and moisturized but this companies shampoo and conditioning bars. I always make sure to have back ups stored away to never run out, I have tried many products and it is rare you find one so perfect that is as described. No big bottles spilling  that have mostly water and chemicals that ruin hair and scalp you get more for you&#x27;re money also its nice you are not helping to destroy the oceans with chemicals. After using these products for months my overall hair quality has improved a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My top picks are the Egg, Beer and mud shampoo bars and the beer and  honey silk conditioning bars next I will try the voodoo bamboo shampoo bar it looks just as promising and believe me these full bars last a long time. They also have great soap bars but I have only tried 1 of them so far I hope this company will always be around and I hope to see them extent their product line in the future its like these products are not from earth because they are so amazing lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end you are doing yourself and the environment a huge favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add one last thing don&#x27;t leave them in the hot water they will melt fast use small pieces by cutting or breaking off so you do not waste.</li>
            <li> I expected the bars to be a bit bigger, they are tiny, thin slivers that don&#x27;t really allow for several washing a to get a good feel for the product. That being said, I&#x27;ve tried 2 of the 6 so far and was not impressed by either one. I won&#x27;t be buying the full size bar, but maybe they&#x27;ll be good for business trips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Lemon and Chamomile so far. I like it, very smooth texture. I haven&#x27;t been doing the ACV rinse, but my hair is fine. My last bar shampoo left me with a sad case of dandruff, and I think it&#x27;s a little better in the couple weeks since I&#x27;ve been using this bar. I have long hair, and it seems one of the sample bars lasts about 3 weeks for me.</li>
            <li> I love the Beauty and the Bees shampoo bars, and I came to love them through this sample pack.  6 bars, each labelled with what type of hair it is best for.  They all smell great, and it was a good way for my family to see which one they liked.  Try this first before committing to a full size bar.</li>
            <li> I wish so much I could write a good review of these, I really do!  I was so excited to order them.  But I lasted about a week and I couldn&#x27;t take it any more.... my hair was just heavy, weighed down, dull and lifeless.  Now if I had been someone who used a lot of products on my hair I&#x27;d understand it was that but I&#x27;m not... I don&#x27;t use any styling products whatsoever and had already been using an anti-residue shampoo previous to this.  My hair did comb right through without being tangly but it was just heavy, dull and lifeless still.  I did apple cider vinegar &amp; water rinses, I even tried doing them twice over, etc. etc... Still couldn&#x27;t get a good result.  I basically wasted my money because I can&#x27;t really use these and get good results so I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> Recently I was traveling and I asked my mom (This is her account, Wahagi) to send this bar shampoo sampler to my brother&#x27;s house, who I was visiting. Instead I received a single lavender bar. When I got back from traveling 6 weeks later (past the &amp;#34;return policy&amp;#34; date) I messaged Beauty and the Bees to let them know of the mix-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been so happy to have been sent the wrong thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did Beauty and the Bees send me the correct shampoo box, but they sent me a WHOLE BOX of other goodies, all of which I love. The conditioner bar is the best, The Honey Coconut Protective Creme is my new most favorite thing ever, and the only tragedy is that the Tasmania Honey and Herb Polish shattered in its glass jar before I could give it a try (Noooooo why!?? I tried to salvage it, but something tells me one shouldn&#x27;t wash one&#x27;s face with tiny shards of glass. Boo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say: This might be the best costumer service I&#x27;ve ever had, and I will use this company again. All their beauty creations are lovely, free of all that artificial crap that other companies use, and, almost as importantly, they obviously value their costumers and care about giving the best possible product AND experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Beauty and the Bees!&lt;br /&gt;Annie</li>
            <li> CHRISTMAS PRESENT  LATER REVIEW</li>
            <li> I would only recommend these products if all you care about is environmentally-friendly packaging and natural ingredients. Yes, these considerations are great, but the shampoo won&#x27;t actually clean your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I persisted with the entire sample box, but this was by far the worst shampoo I have ever tried. The bars left my hair squeaky but not clean. They seemed to strip my hair of natural oils (leaving it so coarse I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it and struggled to put it up in a ponytail). On the other hand, my hair seemed dirtier every time I washed it as the shampoo left a residue at the roots. I experimented with different ways to wash and rinse my hair but the effects were the same after every wash. There was also very little variance between the different bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo bars left me feeling extremely self-conscious and filthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally got to the end of the products, I washed my hair with a cheap but natural supermarket shampoo followed by a rinse with apple cider vinegar to get rid of the build up from the shampoo bars. It was the best feeling in the world.</li>
            <li> I am hooked.  These are lovely and work better than I ever expected.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Loved every single one. Specially, Rosemary Mint and Voodoo!</li>
            <li> Nice sampler. I must get the entire line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried one bar so far, and the results are typical for a solid shampoo bar with conditioning oils.  If you are used to using solid shampoo then you will be pleased.  I use apple-cider vinegar rinse after shampooing to remove any residue and make my hair shiny and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample sizes are approximately 1/4 - 1/3 of an inch thick and I quite a few shampoos out of a bar even with thick below shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot review the scents because I have no sense of smell but nobody ran away from me holding their noses or sneezing violently.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I tried the samples.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner.  Way back,  when I was a child, people used stale beer, vinegar or lemon juice as conditioner.  I&#x27;ve never liked using rinses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using shampoo bars in the 1970s because:&lt;br /&gt;  I like squeaky clean hair.&lt;br /&gt;  The packaging for bar shampoo is paper.  I try to keep a plastic free house and this means a lot to me.&lt;br /&gt;  Bar shampoo lasts much longer than liquid shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;  If you take the paper off any bar soap or shampoo and let it dry, it lasts even longer.&lt;br /&gt;  If the bar is allowed to dry after using it extends the life of the bar.&lt;br /&gt;  My hair doesn&#x27;t get split ends when I use bar shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t need a rinse as my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle when I use bar shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was particularly glad to see this product line and anxious to try it.  I figured I would buy the egg and lemon bar or the beer bar.  I also like Rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;  My hair didn&#x27;t squeak.&lt;br /&gt;  My hair felt heavy.  It clumped together and took longer drying.&lt;br /&gt;  My hair didn&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; as long.  I am used to washing my hair as part of my bathing ritual.  I am unused to &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair.&lt;br /&gt;  The scents of the wafers sort of mixed and the end result was unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;  The thin wafers have a paper identifier.  If you use the wafer and then try peeling the paper away, the wafer breaks up.&lt;br /&gt;  I wash my hair and face with the same bar and use regular soap for my body.  Neck up gets bar shampoo.  Neck down gets bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face usually feels cleaner than the rest of me.  I feel sure had I used at least a vinegar rinse to cut the residue, my experience would have been different but I don&#x27;t like using rinses.  Now I don&#x27;t have the foggiest notion if these things are connected but I scrub and rub my entire head with bar shampoo out of habit then rinse my whole head at one time.  Using these little wafers, I got water in my ears when I rinsed the suds off which surprised me - an unwelcome experience.&lt;br /&gt;Someone else could easily have a different experience.  When I looked at the six samples, the only sample I thought I might not was the Moroccan Mud.  I thought I would be purchasing the shampoo I liked the most once I tried the six choices.  Instead, I&#x27;ll keep looking for my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product. Only down side, there defiantly is a left over residue after washing...But it&#x27;s only Bee&#x27;s Wax! Simple fix, just add apple cider vinegar to you conditioner. One other thought, if you don&#x27;t have conditioner, be warned.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong item! I was supposed to get the sample pack that had 6 shampoo bar samples, each of a different kind and instead I got just one shampoo bar, the Voodoo one. This is highly disappointing!!!!</li>
            <li> The box was mislabeled and instead of six samples, I got a bar of Rosemary Mint, which irritated my scalp.  Amazon as always was great about crediting/replacing, but instead of trying the samples I replaced it with Charcoal Bamboo and was very happy.  The only other one I really wanted to try was Moroccan Mud, but its easier to buy individual bars than the sampler so this worked out.</li>
            <li> Have already recommended this to a bunch of people. If your not sure just try it. I was doing the no  poo (shampoo) thing and got the horrible dandruff. This stuff give me the desired effect of no poo without the dandruff. Love them. Oh and this company has amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> Product came very quick, in a couple of days. Product itself is good but find I need to use ACV afterwards, I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet and with no poo I only have to wash my hair every 3 to 4 days, so this will still last me almost 3 months :) I do like the bars I&#x27;ve tried, but another bar I really love has ACV in the bar so I don&#x27;t have an extra step. As with shampoos I find (I have very fine natural curly hair and enough hair for 2 people) that I can&#x27;t us the same bar more then 3 times in a row, so I do really like the mix of bars.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift so I can&#x27;t comment on how they work.  But be advised they are not as pictured.  I saw the pretty purple gift bag and instead got a beat up box that was held closed with tape.  It looked tacky to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying if you are interested in switching shampoos. Each one adds a different essence to your hairs condition. I wish they included a sample off all their shampoos,I think all they left out was the voodoo and goat&#x27;s milk.</li>
            <li> Very good sampler, the bars lasted for a couple of weeks at least depending on how often I used them. I wish they were local but I knew what I was ordering so I can&#x27;t fault them for that. I will try to support more local business next time but this sampler did put me on the bar shampoo train, so if you aren&#x27;t sure if you want to do it I would recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> Not for me. Could to get passed the crunchy part. I tried apple cider rinses etc.  my hair was so dry my hairdresser freaked out. I have blonde color treated hair but very rarely use heated tools on it.</li>
            <li> awesome shampoos, enjoying all of them. i was expecting a residue build up, but was pleasantly surprised. i have waist length hair and have started washing twice with the shampoo to be able to go 3 to 4 days before needing to wash my hair again. smells great, feels great. thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered the pictured item...the six soap sample pack, but instead received a single bar in a variety that was not even in the sample pack.  The labeling on the package even said sample pack.  I was disappointed I did not receive the item I wanted but opted to just keep the single bar as I needed shampoo and hadn&#x27;t the time to run to the UPS store to return the item.</li>
            <li> I love it,,,,, awesome great for seniors on a budget like me  but who prefer handmade naturals to the stuff the stores sell, thank you so much will order 3 more when  my budget allows,</li>
            <li> The different smells were wonderful. I don&#x27;t have a favorite because they&#x27;re all fabulous. Thanks</li>
            <li> We recently purchased the sampler of shampoo bars and we are hooked!  All of the bars left our hair feeling soft and well hydrated. We enjoyed the scents. They lathered well. I used them on my little one and it helped eliminate her cradle cap (along with coconut oil)!!! Keep the bars out of prolonged contact with water to help them last longer. This is a fantastic product! We will be buying shampoo bars as our shampoo from now on!</li>
            <li> I love the products so far, haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet.  My scalp stays clean for a longer period of time and my hair has lots of body.  You should add conditioner samples with the bundle, I have fine hair and sometimes conditioners are too heavy, it would be nice to try those as well.&lt;br /&gt;All over great product!</li>
            <li> It all smells so good, and lathers better than almost anything.</li>
