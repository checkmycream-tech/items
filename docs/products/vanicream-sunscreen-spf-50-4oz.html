    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This sunscreen works great!</li>
            <li>And just saw that it was reviewed as one of the safest and best sunscreens to use for anyone in the family!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great service.</li>
            <li>It would be great if they could re-formulate without synthetic chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sunscreen, but added moisturizer is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Great, effective and dermatologist recommended</li>
            <li>It does work good though and protect you from the sun.</li>
            <li>About to order more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel gunky or greasey and absorb nicely.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Its a good consistentacy, and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask?</li>
            <li>Best product available for anyone with eczema or otherwise sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I try to wear a hat most of the time, but for the times when I&#x27;m swimming or just without a hat.</li>
            <li>I would like it more if the cream vanished after application.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for the face and ear tips.</li>
            <li>None of the harmful chemicals that most of the OTC sunscreens contain</li>
            <li>A first I was happy that sunscreen spread more easily on my face.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Perfect for extra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I need full protection.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is awesome if you are sensitive to the chemicals in other sunscreens!</li>
            <li>and this is the first one that didn&#x27;t make me have a reaction.</li>
            <li>Easy application, no fragrance, it does leave a white residue on skin, but any SPF+ sunscreen with zinc oxide will do that.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I do live the product!</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to find a new product to use.</li>
            <li>point is the product is great and the seller SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product to me as my skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li>Us sensitive folks would appreciate it.</li>
            <li>I am so sad I loved the vanicream spf 60.  </li>
            <li>This new formulation by Pharmaceutical Specialties is certainly matte compared to the old shiny formula (the SPF 60 and 30), but that&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s improved, and that wasn&#x27;t even something that bothered me, since my skin is so dry.  </li>
            <li>People with normal to oily skin might really enjoy this, but it&#x27;s made my skin so angry.  </li>
            <li>Dry, sensitive skin?</li>

            <li> Dry, sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> Gets all chalky and ashy by the end of the day, and it took days to recover with intense moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because purely physical sunblocks (as opposed to chemical sunscreens) are hard to find, especially without fragrances and essential oils.</li>
            <li> I still have a little irritationon my face, but nothing close to regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I had to use other ones that just weren&#x27;t the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very thick so it gives long lasting coverage.</li>
            <li> Some of my dark spots have faded from using this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Seriously it leave a white flim like texture in my face ðŸ˜¥</li>
            <li> I also broke into an angry red rash.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they changed the formula, took out the oils, and now it irritates our skin and makes it dry.  </li>
            <li> Right after buying Vanicream Sunscreen there was an article in the paper &amp; mentioned on TV that rated it one of the WORST SUNCREENS.  </li>

            <li> I like this product. Not too greasy. Easy to put on. Skin doesn&#x27;t break out. Good price.</li>
            <li> Right after buying Vanicream Sunscreen there was an article in the paper &amp; mentioned on TV that rated it one of the WORST SUNCREENS.  Therefore, I haven&#x27;t tried it, as I&#x27;m scared it doesn&#x27;t have any coverage and I need full protection.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service. What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> Easy application, no fragrance, it does leave a white residue on skin, but any SPF+ sunscreen with zinc oxide will do that.  This product is recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Great, effective and dermatologist recommended</li>
            <li> Best product available for anyone with eczema or otherwise sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you shiny or appear slimy.  Perfect for extra sensitive skin.  I use it on face and body with no breakouts or issues.</li>
            <li> A first I was happy that sunscreen spread more easily on my face.  Then I looked in the mirror and looked like a ghost.  The old vanicream spf 60 would eventually absorb into the skin so any whitening was not very evident.&lt;br /&gt;Plus I also broke into an angry red rash.  I am so sad I loved the vanicream spf 60.  I guess I will have to find a new product to use.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s great for sunscreen, but added moisturizer is very nice.  Some of my dark spots have faded from using this sunscreen.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Dry, sensitive skin? Vanicream products work.</li>
            <li> I wish they never changed the formula.  My husband got sunburned with this stuff.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me as my skin is so sensitive and I cannot tolerate scented products. Vanicream is unscented. The problem is that it breaks me out in a bumpy raised rash. That is the only reason that I do not like it.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is awesome if you are sensitive to the chemicals in other sunscreens! Its a good consistentacy, and absorbs into the skin quickly. I still have a little irritationon my face, but nothing close to regular sunscreen. I try to wear a hat most of the time, but for the times when I&#x27;m swimming or just without a hat. This sunscreen works great!</li>

            <li> Bummer that it has propylene and pentylene glycol.  Unfortunately, Vanicream has many products with PG.  It would be great if they could re-formulate without synthetic chemicals.  Us sensitive folks would appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Seriously it leave a white flim like texture in my face ðŸ˜¥</li>
            <li> I have recently had a chemical peel and the doctor recommended this. I do live the product! I don&#x27;t like scented lotion on my face and ethos has no scent what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel gunky or greasey and absorb nicely.&lt;br /&gt;But I ordered this two weeks before I was to leave for California and it came while I was already on my trip.&lt;br /&gt;I had sent multiple emails to the seller and they never replied or got back to me. I had to use other ones that just weren&#x27;t the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is the product is great and the seller SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> I like it. Will buy again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I would like it more if the cream vanished after application. It does work good though and protect you from the sun.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my pediatrician. And just saw that it was reviewed as one of the safest and best sunscreens to use for anyone in the family! About to order more!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they changed the formula, took out the oils, and now it irritates our skin and makes it dry.  We have to use something else now......</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for the face and ear tips. Very thick so it gives long lasting coverage.</li>
            <li> From all of my research, this has no harmful chemicals from what I can tell. It gets is UV blocking from zinc oxide [think the white noses on lifeguards at the beach or pool] and titanium dioxide. None of the harmful chemicals that most of the OTC sunscreens contain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to every sunscreen I try and this is the first one that didn&#x27;t make me have a reaction. It rubs in well and is not greasy or smelly!</li>
