            <li>They might not be moisturizing enough for your hands and feet (but will do the job) but are amazing for the rest of your body.</li>
            <li>Short term moisturizer and very light, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>has the same great quality as all the cuccio products; I just ordered a second bottle .not</li>

            <li> while this is not as thick as the body butter in the jar, it is very moisturizing and absorbs quickly.  has a wonderful, light smell, and leaves skin with a non-greasy feeling.  has the same great quality as all the cuccio products; I just ordered a second bottle .not as intense as the body butter in the jar, but does a great job for when you have to wash your hands frequently.  highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and fell in love with it. It is a cross between a lotion and body butter. Rubs in great and my skin feels so soft after.</li>
            <li> A co-worker of mine had brought this in, I love it. It goes on so nicely I just had to have some for myself!!</li>
            <li> I just love Cuccio.  It is great for your hands and feet.  The Ultra-sheer is the best on your hands because it soaks right in and does not leave a greasy residue.  When I get my pedicures, the gal puts the regular kind on my legs and feet and it is magic. Just having a problem finding it locally, so ordering will have to do for now.  I just love this product and do not want to have to do with out it.</li>
            <li> Love the Brand.  Have used all varieties, and like them all.  Definitely recommend...and they also make wonderful gifts!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have ever tried for dry hands and legs. Not only that, it lasts through hand washings. The smell is incredibly great.</li>
            <li> loved it and it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li> The spa I received my mani/pedi used this moisturizer instead of lotion.  I loved how it soaked in and did not have greasy or odd scent. Bits very pleasing.  Looked it up and got a better deal through Amazon, of course.</li>
            <li> Feel and smell is so nice. Good and tick lotion. I love it. The pump is also good and fucntions well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite lotion! Not greasy on the skin at all and soaks in fast.</li>
            <li> I like this product but to be honest, I&#x27;ve been using the Honey Butter so I haven&#x27;t really given it the &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; it deserves.</li>
            <li> Love the Cuccio nail products.  Lotion smells as wonderful as the nail oils and is a great hand lotion.  Short term moisturizer and very light, absorbs quickly.  Nice lotion but pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> now this smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is rich, smells yummy and soaks right in.  I purchased this after I read a post on the Richard Simmons website, and I am now on my third bottle. I see a difference, and I actually use this stuff because it works!!!</li>
            <li> Not very &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34;. Great smell but don&#x27;t like the feel. Gave it to my husband he&#x27;s not near as picky. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fabulous as always.  I use this every day. It&#x27;s lightweight and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I first got this as a gift and I have already gone thru two bottles. I&#x27;ve used almost every body lotion out there, from high end to drug-store. This is beyond my favourite.  First of all, they smell amazing.  They are super light-weight and absorbs into your skin right away.  They might not be moisturizing enough for your hands and feet (but will do the job) but are amazing for the rest of your body. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My manicurist used this on my hands a couple of times and I just had to have some.  I garden and my hands get dry from constant washing (yes I wear gloves to garden).  I keep it at my kitchen sink and use it after I wash my hands.  And the bottle lasts a long time.  I will order more.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome!  It comes in many scents but this one is the best!  You&#x27;ll love it!  My hands love it!</li>
            <li> An excellent moistureizer!  It goes on very smoothly and is taken in by the skin incredibly quickly and completely-no greasy residue and you don&#x27;t have to work hard to rub it all in. Best lotion I&#x27;ve used but I am admittedly not an expert.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time i used this product and like it very much! it makes my skin so soft and the lotion is easily absorb into the skin. love it and will sure recommend to friends.</li>
