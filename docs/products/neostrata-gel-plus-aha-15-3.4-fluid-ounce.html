    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Price is excellent considering strength of product.</li>
            <li>This product works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff I have ever used (and I have tried a lot of products).  </li>
            <li>Everything is perfect in Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li>Best stuff for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this!!!</li>
            <li>It was a gift and my mom loved it.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of my favorite lotion (Eucerin) and it keeps my skin nearly flawless.</li>
            <li>The AHA 15 is ok, but not as good as your Foot Gel was for preventing cracks in my heels during the winter.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing is very important as it is drying, so just know you may need a stronger moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Whenever I run out, I get pimples around my chin, so, there, what more could I say?</li>
            <li>I love glycolic acid peels.</li>
            <li>I definitely love this product and see a reduction in pore size.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Takes away fine lines and gives you a youthful face.&lt;br /&gt;Important to use sun screen.</li>
            <li>Has no fragrance and can make even the driest skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion for super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>They could look up the lot number and confirm that it is not only the genuine product, but also won&#x27;t expire until 2018, so I just bought two more bottles!</li>
            <li>It does everything from helping to clear up existing acne to preventing more outbreaks and helps with discoloration, enlarged pores, and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years, it&#x27;s great and make my skin smooth during the hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li>Must be used consistently nightly but the results are worth it.?</li>
            <li>Works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>If you use it the first time, do NOT leave it on your face overtime.</li>
            <li>Been using NeoStrata for years and it does make a positive difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is the first acne remover really works on me.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast, really works.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>I use on my feet and they are baby soft, but you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li>Love the gel also, so easy to use and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal but it is sorta expensive now.</li>
            <li>I decided to check with them, due to others expressing that they did not receive a genuine Neostrata product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a way better price then other products claiming to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>I have used Glycolic 70% and TCA 15% peels with success in the past</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this gel for the past 4 years and it&#x27;s wondeful for smoothing out not 100% clear skin.</li>
            <li> It burns if you just start trying acid product but after 2-3 uses the burning will be less obvious.</li>

            <li> Great product! Learned about it from Brett Freedman.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should. A little goes a long way. Price is excellent considering strength of product. Moisturizing is very important as it is drying, so just know you may need a stronger moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast, really works.</li>
            <li> Must be used consistently nightly but the results are worth it.? Makes ur face glow. Takes away fine lines and gives you a youthful face.&lt;br /&gt;Important to use sun screen.</li>
            <li> I just got off the phone with Neostrata. They could look up the lot number and confirm that it is not only the genuine product, but also won&#x27;t expire until 2018, so I just bought two more bottles! I decided to check with them, due to others expressing that they did not receive a genuine Neostrata product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this gel for the past 4 years and it&#x27;s wondeful for smoothing out not 100% clear skin. Whenever I run out, I get pimples around my chin, so, there, what more could I say? I am so glad I found this!!! I mix it with moisturizer when applying.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly for me. It cleans up my pores and reduces marks/scars that I got from acne. It burns if you just start trying acid product but after 2-3 uses the burning will be less obvious. If you use it the first time, do NOT leave it on your face overtime. Other than that, I notice the price has raised from twenty four bucks to thirty something. This was a great deal but it is sorta expensive now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years, it&#x27;s great and make my skin smooth during the hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li> My skin exploded in itchy papules after using it. I love glycolic acid peels. I have used Glycolic 70% and TCA 15% peels with success in the past but this is a sticky rosacea trigger gel. Finally my skin is clearing up after discontinuing this.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and also gets oily throughout the day.  This is the best stuff I have ever used (and I have tried a lot of products).  It does everything from helping to clear up existing acne to preventing more outbreaks and helps with discoloration, enlarged pores, and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The AHA 15 is ok, but not as good as your Foot Gel was for preventing cracks in my heels during the winter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put it on my eyelids or under my eyes but it burns and makes them peel like crazy. I had to stop using it.  I put lotion on my eyes and apply this very carefully and don&#x27;t put near my eyes at all and somehow it still burns them really bad.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for super dry skin.  Has no fragrance and can make even the driest skin smooth.  I use on my feet and they are baby soft, but you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li> Ordered a second bottle so I won&#x27;t run out. I definitely love this product and see a reduction in pore size. Love the gel also, so easy to use and a little goes a long way. This is a way better price then other products claiming to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> Been using NeoStrata for years and it does make a positive difference on my skin.  Always will recommend this product</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect in Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This product is the first acne remover really works on me. Use it one night before sleep, see less acnes second morning!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and my mom loved it. Shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m 43 and still have acne if I don&#x27;t use this every day (go figure).  I use it on top of my favorite lotion (Eucerin) and it keeps my skin nearly flawless.</li>
