            <li>More eye-catching, sparkling, and bright than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>The clip is nice and durable</li>
            <li>Tissues a beautiful hair clip, was thinking of changing it into a brooch, still haven&#x27;t figured out exactly how to do that yet.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and no doubt very comfortable.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very pretty and looks good in my hair.</li>
            <li>Lovely hair clip</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s prettier than I&#x27;d expect for the price, I may order more for gifts.</li>
            <li>This is sparkly and shimmery much more than the pic shows.</li>

            <li>Cute hair clip.</li>
            <li>satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li>Love the material, design and colors.</li>
            <li>I am going to be getting a couple more in a variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is okay for the price being paid.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>and I love them all...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this clip, it is so beautiful, holds very nice, very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very colorful, and sparkles nice.</li>
            <li>If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
            <li>this is so pretty the color are so bright, when I wear it</li>
            <li>I got this one pretty cheap and dint expect it to be awesome, i would have been happy if it was in good condition and dint look cheap , but to my surprise it was so pretty and sparkly and also arrived way ahead than expected.</li>
            <li>But once you put it in your hair you can&#x27;t really tell because it still looks good.</li>
            <li>This barrette is very bright, colorful and have such a great quality - no chips, no broken crystals.  </li>
            <li>It would be perfect other than that.  </li>
            <li>The clasp is strong.</li>
            <li>The beautiful colors are probably the only upside.</li>
            <li>This clip if beautiful, but the clasp is left handed.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I admit that it&#x27;s not bad wearing it</li>
            <li>Now trying to wear it down and this clip is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a fine piece of jewelry for your hair.</li>
            <li>Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>It works great to hold all my hair back at my neck</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect anything like Prime&#x27;s Free 2-day</li>
            <li>Love the colors pretty</li>
            <li>love how this shines so pretty &amp; is feminine.</li>
            <li>It kind of looks better on the picture then actual life.</li>
            <li>; really a work of art; sets off a woman&#x27;s hair in an elegant way.</li>
            <li>This peacock looks even better in real life.  </li>
            <li>But if you are wearing looking at a distance, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>This barrett is very pretty.</li>
            <li>This hair clip is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and well made</li>
            <li>This is very pretty.</li>
            <li>It was an easy fix and the clip is not heavy and it has a secure clasp.</li>
            <li>the reason why I give you a 4 rating is be cause it looks lije the beads might fall off after a few wears...other than that it looks great.</li>
            <li>It would be cute for a young girl.</li>
            <li>It took quite awhile to get here but was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
            <li>The white jewels were intact and it closes and opens nicely.  </li>
            <li>a while to deliver, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The clip itself is large and the colors are even more vibrant than in the picture.</li>
            <li>I said, surprisingly high quality and very pretty!</li>
            <li>WAS SO VERY REASONABLE.</li>
            <li>Will try to find a way to make it work since its so pretty.</li>
            <li>This barrette is really pretty.</li>
            <li>This is so pretty.</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone, got compliments on it too ;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ask about it and have been told how pretty it is</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Still they are pretty.</li>
            <li>Not quite as I expected, but is still a nice barrette.  </li>
            <li>Its beaded and looks exactly like the photo on site.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much and God Bless!</li>
            <li>Nice little thing my wife likes it.</li>
            <li>It looks cheap in person, was hoping it looked a little more classy.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to work in my hair very well.</li>
            <li>The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
            <li>The color actually looks cheap when you see it up close.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I think it would be lovely at the back of the head, beneath or above an up-do hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>It is as advertised, but picture does not give a very clear picture of what barrette really looks like.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>the only problem is there is a long delivery time for it, satisfied with product</li>
            <li>And it was way too heavy for most uses.</li>
            <li>The back piece of clip comes off easily however, I can put it back on.</li>
            <li>MUCH LARGER, VERY LARGE, EXTREAMLY LARGE.I can not use any of the items from this seller.</li>
            <li>Arrived much earlier than expected and the quality is much better than we assumed too.</li>
            <li>the clip is very pretty , although it had several crystal pieces I had to glue back into place.</li>
            <li>LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL MY HAIR IN A PONY TAIL.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdily built, with a solid clasp mechanism.  </li>
            <li>One can use it for special occasions and everyday too.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but too heavy to hold in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
            <li>(I have black straight hair).</li>
            <li>more subtle, especially the pink than pictured, which for me is a plus.</li>
            <li>For myself, with fine thin hair, it wants to slip down, as well as standing out an inch from my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It worked good for a little while, then it was unable to close and kept falling out of my hair.</li>
            <li>These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>

            <li> My daughter has worn it a few times and it has held up well thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable and will have a long life.  </li>
            <li> At such a low.price, I expected this to be a cheapy, one use battery.  </li>
            <li> With thick or curly hair to hide the clasp opening at the head of the peacock, it would be absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that, for some, may be its drawback -- because it is a full 1&amp;#34; thick, making it quite heavy for a hair clip.  </li>
            <li> should take some time, but I have other item from China which only takes a week.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and for years have worn it in a bun.</li>
            <li> Since I have very thick hair, this is not large enough to contain all my hair, but I can pull the sides up and it really holds well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping did not take as long as I expected with it coming from overseas.  </li>
            <li> It is very casual however you could dress up and still be able to wear this.</li>
            <li> All the stones are intact, and the barrette mechanism works well on my heavy long hair.</li>
            <li> They were packaged with extreme care.</li>
            <li> The photos do them absolutely no justice!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find things for my hair that actually hold.</li>
            <li> It is awkward to manage my hair and close clip backwards from what I&#x27;m used to, so I find myself avoiding this clip in favor of one that I can close right handed.</li>
            <li> But took me two and a half weeks to receive it.  </li>
            <li> The colors are a little (but just a little)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend for little girls, teenagers, adults too.</li>
            <li> This is just heavy.</li>
            <li> I have a few of these already</li>
            <li> I HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING IT TO FASTEN,BUT KEPT WORKING TILL</li>
            <li> This has a clip on the inside that snaps shut, and isn&#x27;t heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do not have thin hair but these hair clips were heavy and BIG</li>
            <li> , I have thin hair, not extremely thin but thin.</li>
            <li> Changes a plain hair twist into a fashionable hairdo.</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a clip that works, but this one does.</li>
            <li> so it holds thick hair or part of it and thinner hair as well.</li>
            <li> I do not have thick hair either</li>
            <li> This is a little cheesy looking but the clip holds hair well.</li>
            <li> Between thin, thick, strait or curly</li>
            <li> It would also do well on the side for anyone blessed with very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> (my hair is medium thickness), but since the fastener is behind the bird&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices.</li>

            <li> Clip looks just like photo...the reason why I give you a 4 rating is be cause it looks lije the beads might fall off after a few wears...other than that it looks great.</li>
            <li> The clip is nice and durable</li>
            <li> Very pretty but too heavy to hold in my hair.</li>
            <li> This barrett is very pretty. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to work in my hair very well. Will try to find a way to make it work since its so pretty.</li>
            <li> Lovely hair clip; really a work of art; sets off a woman&#x27;s hair in an elegant way. Changes a plain hair twist into a fashionable hairdo.</li>
            <li> the clip is very pretty , although it had several crystal pieces I had to glue back into place. It was an easy fix and the clip is not heavy and it has a secure clasp.</li>
            <li> all my friends like it and they want to have one too it is very beautiful, it is a good for a  gift</li>
            <li> This barrette is really pretty. The colors are a little (but just a little) more subtle, especially the pink than pictured, which for me is a plus. All the stones are intact, and the barrette mechanism works well on my heavy long hair. It&#x27;s prettier than I&#x27;d expect for the price, I may order more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Just to big, items were MUCH LARGER, VERY LARGE, EXTREAMLY LARGE.I can not use any of the items from this seller. I do not have thin hair but these hair clips were heavy and BIG so they pulled my hair out wile they were falling off my head.</li>
            <li> The quality is good! The clip is as shown in the picture! I suggest buying this item. Good for the price!</li>
            <li> This is so pretty. Between thin, thick, strait or curly this works for all. It&#x27;s a larger barrette so it holds thick hair or part of it and thinner hair as well. This is sparkly and shimmery much more than the pic shows. It is very casual however you could dress up and still be able to wear this.</li>
            <li> do not know how they can make an item like this for the price they sell it for. the only problem is there is a long delivery time for it, satisfied with product</li>
            <li> This is just heavy. I have to use bobby pins in order to keep it in place.  It would be perfect other than that.  It is lovely!</li>
            <li> This is a little cheesy looking but the clip holds hair well. I have a ton of hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a clip that works, but this one does.</li>
            <li> I have had alot of compliments. The back piece of clip comes off easily however, I can put it back on.</li>
            <li> I call this my sunshine piece because I like to wear it when the sun is shining and I have my summer attire on looking so jazzy during the day.</li>
            <li> Nice little thing my wife likes it. Arrived much earlier than expected and the quality is much better than we assumed too. All good.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very pretty.  Shipping did not take as long as I expected with it coming from overseas.  My daughter has worn it a few times and it has held up well thus far.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the one from the picture, it  looks good and fits great. It is great for the price, my mom loved it.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this purchase. This barrette is very bright, colorful and have such a great quality - no chips, no broken crystals.  I definitely recommend it for others!</li>
            <li> I like this hair clip, it&#x27;s very pretty and looks good in my hair. I recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Mrs. Rick</li>
            <li> It looks cheap in person, was hoping it looked a little more classy. It would be cute for a young girl.</li>
            <li> It took quite awhile to get here but was worth it.  It is absolutely beautiful!  I gave this for a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, matches most things I wear and great as beautiful gifts for others. Sturdy. Thanks so much and God Bless!</li>
            <li> The item has everything: good quality, good price, good design - looks beautiful. Anyone would like it. One can use it for special occasions and everyday too.</li>
            <li> I love that it clips and looks beautiful</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made</li>
            <li> Item is beautiful and as described...Thank you!  Great Service</li>
            <li> A beautiful addition to your hair!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this clip, it is so beautiful, holds very nice, very sturdy. It is a lovely piece. Recommend to anyone, got compliments on it too ;-)</li>
            <li> This is very pretty. Cute hair clip. My friends also like it. Very colorful, and sparkles nice. It looks great in my hair. Good size.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! this is so pretty the color are so bright, when I wear it I&#x27;m ask about it and have been told how pretty it is</li>
            <li> I got this one pretty cheap and dint expect it to be awesome, i would have been happy if it was in good condition and dint look cheap , but to my surprise it was so pretty and sparkly and also arrived way ahead than expected. thanks!</li>
            <li> satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li> This is a fine piece of jewelry for your hair. Lightweight and no doubt very comfortable. I would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Beautiful clip. Love the material, design and colors.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!!! I have very long hair and for years have worn it in a bun. Now trying to wear it down and this clip is perfect.</li>
            <li> This peacock looks even better in real life.  But took me two and a half weeks to receive it.  Yes it comes from China should take some time, but I have other item from China which only takes a week.  Next time, I will wait till I am in Asian country before getting them.</li>
            <li> These are really big, I thought they were smaller. Still they are pretty.</li>
            <li> It worked good for a little while, then it was unable to close and kept falling out of my hair. I do not have thick hair either, I have thin hair, not extremely thin but thin. The beautiful colors are probably the only upside. Maybe i got a dud.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair clip and I get compliments every time I wear it. It doesn&#x27;t slide around in my hair, it stays where I put it.</li>
            <li> This Vintage jewelry crystal peacock hair pin is gorgeous!  Pin was designed with very beautiful vivid peacock decorated with nice beads and the quality is very nice.  It&#x27;s durable and will have a long life.  The price is unbelievable.  It would make a perfect gift for any girls or ladies who love to dress up their hair.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
            <li> Not quite as I expected, but is still a nice barrette.  It is as advertised, but picture does not give a very clear picture of what barrette really looks like.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Very nice hair clip Love it. Took a while to get but where it&#x27;s shipping from understandable. Love the colors pretty</li>
            <li> I received  this yesterday and wasn&#x27;t as impressed as I wanted to be.  The colors are off of what is in the picture.  The colored leaves look like a metal in the pic and I got a hastily painted plastic.  The white jewels were intact and it closes and opens nicely.  Still way good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This clip if beautiful, but the clasp is left handed.  It works great to hold all my hair back at my neck (my hair is medium thickness), but since the fastener is behind the bird&#x27;s head.  It is awkward to manage my hair and close clip backwards from what I&#x27;m used to, so I find myself avoiding this clip in favor of one that I can close right handed.</li>
            <li> This is a well made hair clip. Its beaded and looks exactly like the photo on site. The clasp is strong. Only problem they need a signature for delivery which becomes a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Okay, I admit that it&#x27;s not bad wearing it (I have black straight hair). It looks good. But in the picture the item looks gorgeous. The color actually looks cheap when you see it up close. But if you are wearing looking at a distance, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Make that 4.5 stars!  The hair clip, which I ordered from an overseas seller, arrived today, despite the Amazon &amp;#34;Delivery Estimate&amp;#34;.  Very pleased to get it 9 days ahead of it&#x27;s earliest delivery estimate.  But don&#x27;t expect anything like Prime&#x27;s Free 2-day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip itself is BEAUTIFUL!  More eye-catching, sparkling, and bright than I anticipated.  At 3 1/2 x 1 inch, it&#x27;s actually somehow even larger looking in person.  It is very sturdily built, with a solid clasp mechanism.  But that, for some, may be its drawback -- because it is a full 1&amp;#34; thick, making it quite heavy for a hair clip.  I think it would be lovely at the back of the head, beneath or above an up-do hairstyle.  It would also do well on the side for anyone blessed with very thick hair.  For myself, with fine thin hair, it wants to slip down, as well as standing out an inch from my scalp.  With thick or curly hair to hide the clasp opening at the head of the peacock, it would be absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at $2.76 including free shipping, it is an amazing bargain!!</li>
            <li> beautiful hair pin, came in good condition and well packaged, I recommend this pin looks very elegant. Thank You</li>
            <li> At such a low.price, I expected this to be a cheapy, one use battery.  I can&#x27;t believe the quality &amp; it is absolutely beautiful.  Since I have very thick hair, this is not large enough to contain all my hair, but I can pull the sides up and it really holds well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a couple weeks for delivery so don&#x27;t wait until the last minute to place your order.  I am going to be getting a couple more in a variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, surprisingly high quality and very pretty!</li>
            <li> Fell apart second time I wore it. And it was way too heavy for most uses.</li>
            <li> Tissues a beautiful hair clip, was thinking of changing it into a brooch, still haven&#x27;t figured out exactly how to do that yet. It would be a awesome brooch. The clip itself is large and the colors are even more vibrant than in the picture. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product is okay for the price being paid. It kind of looks better on the picture then actual life. But once you put it in your hair you can&#x27;t really tell because it still looks good. It&#x27;s a very good size and it does hold the hair. I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to find things for my hair that actually hold.</li>
            <li> Very nice way to embellish any hair do....................................................................  I love it allot  I have a few of these already and I love them all...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</li>
            <li> THIS IS A BARETTE. IT IS JUST AS THE PICTURE SHOWS. LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL MY HAIR IN A PONY TAIL. I HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING IT TO FASTEN,BUT KEPT WORKING TILL IT HOLDS WELL. GOOD LOOKING IN YOUR HAIR.PRICE WAS SO VERY REASONABLE. VERY SATISFIED!!</li>
            <li> This has a clip on the inside that snaps shut, and isn&#x27;t heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I love how this shines so pretty &amp; is feminine. The colors are what I like, because I can wear it with all my summer &amp; spring outfits.&lt;br /&gt;Took a while to deliver, but well worth the wait. I&#x27;d recommend for little girls, teenagers, adults too.</li>
