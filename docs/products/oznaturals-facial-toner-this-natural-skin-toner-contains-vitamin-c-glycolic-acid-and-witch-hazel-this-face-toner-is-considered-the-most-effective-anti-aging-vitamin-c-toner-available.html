            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sea Breeze and Neutrogena toners for years and they&#x27;re great but after using this one from OZ Naturals</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to my skin care regimen</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great refresher for your make-up about mid-afternoon, just a spritz</li>
            <li>OMG I love it!!</li>

            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>This OZ toner is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>They are amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly, a must have!</li>
            <li>Really nice feeling going on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally loving this toner!</li>
            <li>excellent product i love it</li>
            <li>I will keep this one handy at all times!  </li>
            <li>Feels good works great</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant too.  </li>
            <li>toner has a pleasant scent and is 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a pleasant odor as others have described.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, too.  </li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent and the sprayer has a perfect amount of product mist.</li>
            <li>but i got fooled by all those who got bribed to write a good review</li>
            <li>but it did a good job at evening skin tone</li>
            <li>I think the toner itself is good, but I gave two star because I didn&#x27;t like how the bottle came unselaed and it leaked.</li>
            <li>The price is fair, too, for the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>like OZ Naturals line for their efficacy and for their good prices.</li>
            <li>I received this product as a sample for my review; I have no problem endorsing it because it really is good</li>
            <li>Because when you buy something from them, they encourage you to leave a good comment.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair way to attract people.</li>
            <li>but I have heard good things about it</li>
            <li>and my face feels exhilarating and youthful.</li>
            <li>Does a good prep job.</li>
            <li>Look good, but I doubt how it works.</li>
            <li>Great toner, feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>This one is a good choice</li>
            <li>This feels soooooo good after the Vitamin C wash ‚ù§</li>
            <li>Will continue using knowing it is good for my skin.</li>
            <li>but then again toners don&#x27;t smell that good.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>n&#x27;t because it is that good.</li>
            <li>I loved that it was a spray</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and smells good too.</li>
            <li>but Vitamin C is good for you</li>
            <li>But, It does feel good to use it.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for summer.</li>
            <li>It smells soooo good and it makes my skin shiny.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and they were so good</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s the toner doing it&#x27;s job because after that my skin felt good.</li>
            <li>, it makes my face feel so good before I use OZ Naturals Serum.</li>
            <li>But, I re-ordered it, because it is a really good product</li>
            <li>Scent is good too.</li>
            <li>It says to use it after cleansing and exfoliating, but I have found that it feels good whenever.  </li>
            <li>but it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>was provided this product from the company for a fair and unbiased reiew.  </li>
            <li>I look more beautiful than ever</li>
            <li>This toner calms your unbalanced skin and helps to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles from your skin to give you a happy healthy youthful glow!!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed that the product is made right here in the good ole USA.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I received this toner for review because it is a great toner.  </li>
            <li>This toner is very refreshing, and I have seen a reduction in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>was very pleased to review this product for OZ</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased when I did.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing however living in a humid environment I will use on dryer days.  </li>
            <li>This Toner is very refreshing to use.</li>
            <li>I used to use just witch hazel on a cotton ball as a toner, but this is great, and probably better for my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a refreshing toner and works great to set or refresh make-up during the day.</li>
            <li>so im completely happy and satisfied with this product and hope</li>
            <li>I love this toner!</li>
            <li>so refreshing!</li>

            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I also think it has helped with scarring and making the texture of my skin much better!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I also love the vitamin c serum!</li>
            <li>Refreshing and Pleasant.</li>
            <li>Nice, refreshing mist that tones skin!</li>
            <li>they are all helping the Vit A serum, the HA serum, the great eye gel (that I use all over my face for the fine lines in the cheek areas) to penetrate and go deeper.</li>
            <li>but it fades quickly and leaves my skin bright and glowing all day!</li>
            <li>It feels great and gives a really smooth surface to work on when applying it before makeup.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It would be great if this is available on subscribe.</li>
            <li>After using this for almost a week now, I can already see amazing results and I am loving every minute of it.</li>
            <li>This toner is amazing.</li>
            <li>so these products have worked amazing during this winter.  </li>
            <li>Great toner....fresh and light</li>
            <li>Works amazing</li>
            <li>We both agree, though, this spray toner goes on light, does not sting, and is a great step before serums &amp; moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good toner I love the fact that is in a spray form</li>
            <li>but I liked the smell of it.</li>
            <li>After that, I apply my favorite serums and moisturizers, and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this in order to give my honest feedback, but I have already added it to my wish list on here to buy again when I am out of it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is organic and its better for me, while giving me great looking skin.  </li>
            <li>Opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li>yet it primes my skin nicely for my makeup after I moisturiZe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice alternative to a cream primer.</li>
            <li>I have really liked every Oz Naturals product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>She has asked if she could take over using it or have me purchase her own bottle</li>
            <li>this is my 100% honest opinion.redients</li>

            <li>You can also apply this by spraying it onto a cotton pad, but I honestly prefer to just spray it on my face.</li>

            <li>Studies have found Vitamin C to be most effective in protecting against damage induced by UV light and also effective in the treatment of photodamage and/or skin</li>

            <li>Love to spritz this on twice a day...</li>
            <li>The idea is that the skin will better absorb whatever you apply to the skin if applied while the skin is still moist...</li>
            <li>Make sure when you apply anything you are doing upward and outward motions on your face.</li>
            <li>Will be adding more as I have used it longer to see results.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I was not at all pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Instantly refreshing :)</li>
            <li>I have received this product for free, in return for my HONEST review.</li>
            <li>love all the products I&#x27;ve tried from them so far.&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliater, the serum, undereye serum, and face wash</li>
            <li>I am glad I chose to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>So many stinky memories.</li>
            <li>Refreshing toner.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I. Love.</li>
            <li>Does my face look and feel better, clearer, and more even than ever before?</li>

            <li>Then, they will send you free samples!</li>
            <li>My face has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Let me just start off with, THIS FACIAL TONER IS AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m learning more about taking care of my skin as I age</li>
            <li>and I will continue to ad more.</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue with this toner, love it!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used toners to  remove traces of makeup that my facial cleanser wasn&#x27;t able to remove so I was taken aback with this being a spritzer, but I decided to use this with my HA serum that is best used with some sort of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing when you spray it on your face then wipe off with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing</li>
            <li>I also love the light scent it has!</li>
            <li>I love the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>is that this toner can and should be used as a refreshing spray you use throughout the day as needed to refresh the makeup.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes spray it on during the day if I feel my skin is thirsty :)</li>
            <li>The pores on top of cheeks have shrunk.</li>
            <li>I can see my skin is soft, smooth and flawless gradually.</li>
            <li>am 100% satisfied with this toner.</li>
            <li>I use moisturizer on top of it and then apply my makeup, which seems to go on smoother.  </li>
            <li>It may work better for someone else.</li>
            <li>It is both refreshing and moisturizing when sprayed on the skin if it is kept in</li>
            <li>Pleased to find that OZ Naturals make this tonic with organic ingredients  </li>
            <li>This toner is soooo refreshing.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to lessen them but they continued to get deeper and more</li>
            <li>And I am a skeptic, folks, but I LOVE this product line.</li>
            <li>but this toner helps make the makeup go on smother and since it is helping my moisturizer work better</li>
            <li>I am sure with a bit more use of the toner combined with my moisturizer</li>
            <li>my skin will be nice and smooth again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing and does not leave any sticky feel or residue.  </li>
            <li>I also love to just  spritz my face throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Probably one of my favorite things about this product is that it serves as a primer to serums and moisturizers - which is code for it enhances the absorption of the products applied after the spray.</li>
            <li>I have continued using this product for a couple weeks now, and I am still enjoying it.</li>
            <li>It says that this toner can be used on top of makeup throughout the day, so I wanted to try that out to see if the toner would make my make up run or not, and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Seemed like one more product to sell.  </li>
            <li>But I was given this to try, and my skin surely isn&#x27;t getting any younger‚Äîin fact, it&#x27;s getting more exposed since I&#x27;ve taken up lap swiimming‚Äî</li>
            <li>I can say for sure is that  it feels nice and has a light, refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this toner has glycolic acid in it.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the refreshing smell and feel of this toner.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love this toner.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS TONER  FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>More so than when I&#x27;ve used witch hazel on</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t need to use cotton ball to apply the toner.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I do believe the manufacturer (I love OZ products) might want to add some information about it being a spray.container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spritz and go for a healthy glow -</li>
            <li>my skin made it through the winter thanks to the OZ Naturals skin care products - the skin toner is great under of just going out to protect the face.</li>

            <li>/&gt;OZ Ocean Mineral Tonic has an interesting scent.  </li>
            <li>But I truly do love their product line.</li>
            <li>even better results as i use it more.</li>
            <li>It is not USDA certified organic and unlike many of OZ Naturals products, this one doesn&#x27;t even say what percentage of it is organic.</li>
            <li>I just would like to see a bit more honesty from OZ naturals.</li>
            <li>It feels so refreshing and energizing.  </li>
            <li>and I just love the ingredients thats  in it like glycolic acid, ocean minerals, vitamin c &amp; amino acids.</li>

            <li>and I think this will feel good and refreshing to spray on my face on the days I&#x27;m feeling too hot and sweaty.</li>

            <li>Great product and it really, honestly, did work on blemishes that were developing or current.  </li>
            <li>The toner has a light scent and the spray bottle allows a nice, light mist.</li>

            <li>.or fine lines from aging my skin tone is more even</li>
            <li>Nice refreshing scent, goes on as a light mist that dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I used about 3 sprays to cover my whole face, it gives you a nice fine mist which is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this to review by the company, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a huge hassle to have to call your sister and tell her to print a return label and find a box, tape it, make sure it&#x27;s packaged correctly and drive 4.2 miles to my nearest UPS store.</li>
            <li>,it has a huge ingredient list and many are organic.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing and light.  </li>

            <li>This product is really great, even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s organic and alcohol free.</li>
            <li>If not then this toner has a light refreshing feel and smell.</li>
            <li>They are good quality at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but you get some very powerful benefits from this toner&#x27;s Glycolic Acid, Vitamin C, Amino Acids and lots more.</li>

            <li>Refreshing, feels clean.</li>
            <li>I would consider buying this again because of the solid anti-aging ingredients, but would be more inclined if the scent was more pleasant.</li>
            <li>Love the OZ products Natural and good for my skin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>

            <li>Not to strong .great ingredients to help skin and sun damage</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what it actually does, but it makes my skin feel like I was just swimming in the ocean (in a good way).  </li>
            <li>It has a strong scent of Witch Hazel, though, which makes me think of Preparation</li>

            <li>item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I am currently using more natural products because it is the best for the skin.</li>
            <li>It has a light feel</li>
            <li>My skin is showing great signs of premature aging and I am only 44.</li>
            <li>even.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.</li>

            <li>/&gt;*regardless of receiving this product for free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kicking myself because now we&#x27;re spending a lot more on skin care, but for us, it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The eye serum is the best and NO irritation to the skin around the eye - or the eye itself - and I am super sensitive to skin products and an older woman.</li>
            <li>and it has made my face so smooth.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy when we are out on the boat</li>
            <li>This Toner is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I heard great things about facial toner from my friends.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>I use it before putting any make up on and it seems to really smooth my skin, prepping it for my make up.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, cruelty-free and effective.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle for free but that did not affect my opinions of the product.</li>
            <li>smell is light too.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel smooth after the hydration mask</li>
            <li>It drips even when I spray lightly from about a foot away.  </li>
            <li>Like that its light feeling.  </li>
            <li>Does help with liquid foundation to set smoothly.  </li>
            <li>but I do enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>

            <li>I also like the fact that it is cruelty free tested.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin pore free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the whiole body too - especially after toweling off out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If that is important to you than you should skip on this toner.</li>
            <li>The  scent  is light</li>

            <li>Wakes your skin right up and helps to better absorb serums into your skin.</li>
            <li>They gave me a full size product for free for the purpose of testing and reviewing it, giving only my own thoughtful and honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>however it is very effective with anti-aging products and/or facial treatments.</li>
            <li>As ive gotten older the blotchiness has become more and more visible.</li>
            <li>The pump also makes it easy to take along with you and use on those days when your makeup needs a quick spritz refresher.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick your done.</li>
            <li>Have never gotten into full skincare regimes but am loving the OZ line so much that I like using them all in tandem.</li>
            <li>product is very easy to use thanks to the bottle being a spray on.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this toner very much.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean but can sting your eyes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing for sensitive skin and gets results!!</li>
            <li>I am lucky to have a clear complexion and good skin tone, but the OZ Naturals makes my skin feel and look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin immediately felt more youthful and rejuvenated with the first spray.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d never used before I made sure to read all the directions first.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this products and the whole OZ naturals line!</li>
            <li>It would be refreshing on a hot day</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure that It can help the make up set.</li>
            <li>In the summer,  I can imagine this being refreshing on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a moisturizer your looking for try the Bee Friendly line.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list has a lot of scientific names but also every day names that are familiar, like witch hazel, vitamin C, and aloe.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels cool, smooth and clean after using.</li>
            <li>I love that its natural :)</li>
            <li>Its filled with all kinds of amazing and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Leaves you with a refreshingly clean feel.</li>
            <li>It sprays on lightly, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>One note however, if you have eyeliner, eyebrows, lips tattooed, avoid those areas by spraying in the palm of your clean hand and apply to your face with fingertips.</li>
            <li>I love that all these products are organic and natural and my skin has never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li>The sprayer and nozzle did not get clogged so there was no need to clean it as with others.  </li>
            <li>I will say I believe the toner causes the serum to be more effective overall.</li>
            <li>The scent is like witch hazel, light and not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use Oz Natural products because they have not let me down and have given me hope for a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>While I received a sample for review purposes, I&#x27;m so impressed with this whole line of products that I will continue purchasing them and am exploring the other things they have on offer.</li>
            <li>I started using this product about two weeks ago right after I wash my face with the ocean mineral face wash!</li>
            <li>I can feel it absorb into my skin right away!</li>
            <li>and I apply it by taking the lid/spray top off and dab it on a face pad (or into my clean hands) and gently apply it on my face.  </li>
            <li>Finally my skin has a bright appearance.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, as is expected from Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li>I love it, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I have been using a lavender organic toner for some time, but the OZ version is much more gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels thanks to this</li>
            <li>good for daily routine.</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s refreshing but don&#x27;t know that it really did anything for my face...</li>
            <li>This has a nice scent and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Hours later my face still feels refreshed besides the smell in the stickiness I have to say this is a really good toner if you&#x27;re probably not into the stickiness</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin has changed so much and feels a lot better afterwards.</li>
            <li>This product will stay in my product rotation for sure.  Very affordable as well.</li>
            <li>to the gentle nature of the tonic, it is safe for skin types and can be used throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this most.</li>
            <li>Very soothing; refreshing, hydrating.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that the toner is somehow really helping my moisturizer work better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>This is a \\&quot;toner/tonic\\&quot;, the afore-mentioned toners leave my face cool and refreshed while I notice this one does that</li>
            <li>I do not think I will purchase it again just because I do not like it being advertised as organic when it isn&#x27;t, but as far as the product itself is concerned, it is nice.</li>
            <li>and I am loving the results so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad, but just not my preference.  </li>
            <li>I also use this toner throughout the day to refresh my face because it also moisturizers and gives me that &amp;#34;put together&amp;#34; glow and this toner works GREAT on dry, itchy, winter skin!!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that breaks out very easily.</li>
            <li>you have sun damage, fine lines or uneven skin tone, this is a great product to use.</li>
            <li>In addition, I have noticed that it works GREAT on pimples (in other parts of the body as well).</li>
            <li>, this one is so light I can&#x27;t describe it other than pleasant.</li>
            <li>It leaves a fresh clean surface.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin tone even, and clean with a fresh scent</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I am always running around so a quick spritz to refresh</li>
            <li>I apply my toner by spraying 2 pumps into the palm of my hand and then spread it quickly with my finger tips...</li>
            <li>I purchased the Oz Naturals Facial Toner along with the Super Youth Moisturizer, and Vitamin C Serum and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Shrinks pores and clears up mild acne.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>It has a particular seaweed fishy smell to it and my skin has not gotten better.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful facial toner that hydrates and clears up your skin as well as help your entire body with moisture and anti itch.  </li>
            <li>I use the Retinol Serum (pm), Vitamin C Serum (am), Hyaluronic Acid Serum (am/pm) and the Super Youth Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Funky smell but that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Ocean Mineral cleanser, the toner, serum, and  Super Youth retinol moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My favs are the Vit C serum, hyaluronic acid serum &amp; the Super Youth Moisturizer with Retinol.</li>
            <li>The smell fades as quick as it dries on your face.  </li>
            <li>mild scent, doesn&#x27;t sting,</li>
            <li>I‚Äôm not too sure about the benefits of glycolic acid and MSM, but everybody knows that Vitamin E is one of the top nutrients, especially for the skin.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, soaks up quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I have sensitive skin, I was happy to learn that this OZ Naturals anti-aging toner is 100% natural, vegan, alcohol-free, and doesn&#x27;t contain any sulfates or parabens.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I had high hopes this would help my skin.</li>
            <li>so I was interested in trying this toner for free* to review.</li>
            <li>Nor Cal where it can get very hot during the summers</li>
            <li>Nor Cal where it can get very hot during the summers</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I am very happy with my other OZ Natural products</li>
            <li>Very satisfied , use daily, improves skin texture</li>
            <li>When I first heard about Oz Naturals&#x27; review a product for free offer I thought, why not?</li>
            <li>Sometimes it comes out in globs, so I spray it in my hand first and then smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I have found myself just &#x27;spritzing&#x27; my face with it throughout the day as it is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is my very first time using a face toner.</li>
            <li>What I do know is it feels great anytime of the day or night as a &#x27;refresher&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t leak, spill, or run down my face.  </li>
            <li>What a refreshing new step to my regimen.</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy and vibrant, my pores are smaller in appearance and my fine lines on my forehead seem to be filling in more.</li>
            <li>Works really well (but it does have a strong witch hazel smell)</li>
            <li>She noticed an improvement immediately and really enjoys how easy it is to use this product.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Im not a frequent reviewer unless i really love a product and this line has worked fantastic!</li>
            <li>It feels like lightly splashing my face with cool water but the ingredients are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it very natural</li>
            <li>Be aware guys!</li>
            <li>It did however remind me what a toner is really for...getting rid of leftover makeup!!</li>
            <li>After 7 days of use, I could see a brightening of my skin and now, 3 weeks into my daily routine with the OZ Naturals Tonic, I am ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH IT!  </li>
            <li>I love all of Oz Natural products and this toner is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying more of this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel.it goes on like a cool mist and dries nicely without feeling heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I started using the toner, Hyaluronic acid+ vitamin C serum, Vitamin C facewash, and Super Youth moisturizer twice a day a few weeks ago and have seen a great improvement in the texture, softness, redness and dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the natural ingredients and that it has a very light scent.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C generally brightens the skin and makes it appear more glowy and radiant, so when I found a toner that is vitamin C based, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>It smelled like pure witch hazel, a cheap astringent that can purchased via any retail store.  </li>
            <li>Although I have been using prescription strength renova for over 15 years and have very good skin for my age, I have noticed a big difference in my skin after using OZ Naturals products, especially around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soothing and the pump applicator is fantastic ---</li>
            <li>All around great everyday toner.</li>
            <li>and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I received complimentary product in exhchange for a review.</li>
            <li>and I am loving the OzNaturals Facial Toner.  </li>
            <li>Once the toner dries you can&#x27;t tell you even put anything on except that your face feels fresh.</li>
            <li>Love this and all oz natural products</li>
            <li>Using this product my skin tone looks more radiant and soft without making it feel oily.</li>
            <li>product feels fresh when you spray it on your face.</li>
            <li>My only problem is honestly the smell.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how many steps are recommended in a skin care regimen</li>
            <li>I was expecting a more natural ocean like smell per the name, which is why I gave the rating four stars.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t smell it after it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li>All products received are complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh, I like that you can spray it on your face instead of using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh when you spray it on.</li>
            <li>It gives the skin a fresh and youthful look.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh, but I wont buy it again .</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed how incredibly soft and smooth my face felt!</li>
            <li>I realize being more natural no perfumes are added.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, until I tried this facial toner, I didn&#x27;t think that I needed a toner.  </li>
            <li>I used my Oz Natural products last night and they felt great.</li>
            <li>I have used it  in these colder months throughout the day to give my makeup a fresh look.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy for the scent-smell reminds me of burnt ash.</li>
            <li>Worth a try, and</li>
            <li>but it was not helping enough on its own</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh after i use this.</li>

            <li>I really thank Oz for giving us a complimentary product that is organic and free from harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Love the spritz bottle &#x3D; means there&#x27;s no waste and no need for a cotton ball to apply.</li>

            <li>/&gt;*I was given this product to sample and provide honest feedback for potential buyers.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>I also like to use it mid-day over my makeup to give it a fresh dewy look.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>This toner works wonders layering with other Oz Natural products as I have personally tried many of these products together and loved the results!!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you spritz in on, no need for cotton pads &amp; no mess.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels so fresh and extra clean.</li>
            <li>This wakes up my face in the morning and it dries pretty quick.</li>
            <li>It is clean and refreshing and I would definitely recommend using it in your skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t feel right about it.</li>
            <li>Can spray right on skin.</li>
            <li>I use Ocean Mineral Toner before I apply my OZ Naturals serums and it helps them absorb right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Some toners can have an over whelming scent, but this is just right.</li>
            <li>I use a face wash, which contains glycolic acid and use this product right after.</li>
            <li>I use it right before my vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>so I use is faithfully right after cleansing my face and before I put the serum on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for 4 days and my skin feel like silk right now.</li>
            <li>Everyone should try these if they would like to see some positive results!</li>
            <li>I just found my new favorite toner - OZ Naturals Facial Toner is so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>THIS toner/tonic from OZ keeps my face shine free and crisp for much longer.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin and so far the products are wonderful.</li>
            <li>of the first ingredients are witch hazel and aloe, which seem to wake up the skin and also soothe the skin, which is nice especially if you&#x27;ve been out in the sun or wind a lot.  </li>
            <li>Thank you OZ for creating a toner that leaves the skin feeling soft, clean, and calm!</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and light, and my skin has been very clear.</li>
            <li>Honestly, there is no other toner out there like this one and decently priced.</li>
            <li>The toner is true to form and really works well .love that their products are organic.</li>
            <li>It really is a great toner when u get past the smell and from the reviews some ppl like the scent.</li>
            <li>first time I tried out this product was right after I got home from my zumba class.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh feeling of this toner when I spritz it on my facial area.</li>
            <li>I feel that if there is good stuff in this product then you deal with a slight smell you don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In receiving this product for a review, the only reason it a rating of a 4 stars instead of 5 is because of smell factor but absolutely everything else about this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, I pressed the nozzle and directly sprayed it to my face.  </li>
            <li>I am a big Witch Hazel fan, so I&#x27;m happy that&#x27;s a prominent ingredient (but was surprised that the ingredient list - while natural/organic - is so long!!).  </li>
            <li>for my sensitive skin and incredibly efficient for sun spots on my pale tone.</li>
            <li>Easy, no mess spray type.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with this toner, not only is it FANTASTIC before my moisturizer, but it leaves my make-up looking fresh all day with just a few sprays.</li>
            <li>and it does this appear very fast in the skin I do recommend</li>
            <li>dries off very fast and is transparent as a toner should be.</li>
            <li>You really WILL see results within the first 7 days!</li>
            <li>taste a little salty but good stuff</li>
            <li>I really look forward to using it on hot summer days!  </li>
            <li>I love this toner because my skin is SUPER oily in the summer even if I took a shower 15 minutes ago in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>Really leaves my face and neck clean and ready for OZ moisturizer.</li>
            <li>PLUS, unlike so many other products out there, water is NOT the first ingredient!!     </li>
            <li>I could feel my skin tightening, but it was not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>Both of these products soak into my skin much better than they did prior to my using the toner.  </li>
            <li>I like that they are paraben free and use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>btw, ewww, what a gross word...moist! :)</li>
            <li>I like that so much better than the open bottle/cotton ball method.  </li>
            <li>The product is able to be used prior to applying makeup or after</li>
            <li>I noticed results after using the toner consistently twice a day for 3 days.</li>
            <li>Your face looks different, more youthful.</li>
            <li>The OZ Naturals Ocean Mineral Tonic with Glycolic Acid, MSM and Vitamin C is meant to be used immediately prior to the application of any Serum and again as needed throughout the day, over makeup for a refreshing lift.</li>
            <li>I can see an improvement in texture, my skin seems firmer and the overall tone appears more balanced and</li>
            <li>Best I can reading the ingredients there is no alcohol in this at all unless it&#x27;s under some weird name</li>
            <li>Now if you are using the toner for deep cleaning after you have already washed your face then that works better to remove the dirt.</li>
            <li>Now if you are using the toner for deep cleaning after you have already washed your face then that works better to remove the dirt.</li>
            <li>and it really does work!</li>
            <li>so I was willing to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference after first use.</li>
            <li>First time buyer, but on the first application I could already noticed a healthier and moist skin.</li>
            <li>This Facial Toner is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now looking to buy more skincare in the same range!  </li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My pores look smaller and my skin tone looks more even.</li>
            <li>and I love this entire company.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel that if this company is willing to give me this opportunity that they are fully dedicated and believe in their products 100%.</li>
            <li>Has a smoky scent at first</li>
            <li>This is the best secret I have found to refresh and prime my skin !</li>
            <li>I love this facial toner.  </li>
            <li>ans it effective and carefully chosen ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have had no break outs and just love the way this toner gives my skin extra cleaning and toning.</li>
            <li>simple and refreshing.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>At first I sprayed it on, but have since gone to using a cotton ball to apply.  </li>
            <li>This is such a refreshing product.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could make it better is if it was 6 or 8 oz.</li>
            <li>It smells like the beach and hydrates my skin after a hot shower.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Oz Naturals!</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>Applied topically it may aid in the healing of scars and blemishes, the soothing of sunburns, and the maintenance of youthful and healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really like this line of products!</li>
            <li>Most women have a daily skin routine that they follow even if it&#x27;s just washing your face at night before bed.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying my oz naturals facial toner.  </li>
            <li>I never realized how much a toner makes a difference in my skin care regimen!  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Oz Naturals!</li>
            <li>I love OZ Naturals Facial Toner!  </li>
            <li>this is the first i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>My wife swears (though I don&#x27;t know how;) it improves her skin tone and makes makeup application easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finishing up my 2nd bottle and for sure will keep using.</li>
            <li>One time, was more than enough for me.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed to help with my oil/dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so good using OZ Naturals, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  </li>
            <li>Means alot to me in my pursuit of trying to improve the health of my 58 yr old skin!!!!         .</li>
            <li>She is 15 and going through those changes that makes her skin break out and more sensitive to products and she likes how this one is cooling and refreshing without burning her skin like some other products do.</li>
            <li>You really have to trial and error to get a system that is right for your skin...</li>
            <li>My first impression was that the toner smelled quite a bit like witch hazel ( It contains witch hazel) - and after using it I&#x27;ve seen a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice and just as expected!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as it really seems to work!!</li>
            <li>I especially love that this toner is anti-aging, 100% natural, cruelty-free, vegan, does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is PH balanced which makes it safe for all skin types, which is almost impossible to find all of that in one product.</li>
            <li>It has a slight clean scent, but I feel this makes it that much better to use.</li>
            <li>This spray is great when I use my derma roller and wrinkle treatment, I do find that it is not for everyday use if you have ultra sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I am back to feeling good again and taking care of my skin for the future.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it works very well as a toner to start off your facial skin regimen, it is also just a refreshing spray that you can use any time of the day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell that it does that much, and I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>This toner is also a quick pick me on humid summer days because it leaves a clean cooling sensation on your face and at the same time shrinks the pores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t so much use it for anti-aging as I do to help keep my skin clear and healthy, but between being organic and having a boost of Vitamin C, this toner was so much more then your average over the counter toner.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that leaves my skin a bit dry, but I use serum right after and it feels good.</li>
            <li>I make sure to spray it right after cleansing while my skin is still wet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have been using this product, I have been told that I am positively glowing.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this toner for a long time. :)</li>
            <li>This is a great tip for anyone with dry skin as it helps to seal in the moisture and help prevent dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals are wonderful products and the prices are unbelievably low relative to other brands.</li>
            <li>The scent of the Toner was mentioned in previous comments to smell amazing.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many product, but everything either made me brake out or become really dry and irritated.</li>
            <li>if often used in chemical peels intended to improve the appearance of the skin by causing a mild exfoliation, softening and brightening the appearance of skin and, blending skin tones and improving the texture of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane), a sulfur compound that occurs naturally in plants, is often taken orally for joint strength and flexibility.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of their products now &amp; every single one has delievered.</li>
            <li>Not as pure as it needs to be .  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and not overbearing and the texture on your face seems to dissolve in less than a minute to have you ready to go.</li>
            <li>So far so good apart from having a slight burnt caramel smell</li>
            <li>It makes this a 2 second step and it makes your face feel fresh and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>especially if you&#x27;re having a wonderful (NOT)  hot flash!!!!!  </li>
            <li>The Oz Naturals Toner is perfect because although it does have astringents for an oily or other problem skin conditions, it also contains moisturizing properties to soothe my dry skin, &amp; anti-oxidants for the necessary protection, we are all exposed to; from both the sun‚Äôs harmful rays and the environmental pollution.  </li>
            <li>It has such amazing reviews, but I swear, it is just salty and gross and it makes my skin break-out.</li>
            <li>Have only used a few times but my face feels great after spritzing.</li>
            <li>I would say that putting some water in a mist bottle and spraying your face before moisturizing would absolutely be just as efficient.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very neutral smell&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>So much easier than a toner &amp; a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>These oz naturals folks really know what they are doing.</li>
            <li>and they work very well</li>
            <li>Very salty skin toner.  </li>
            <li>so there is not too much exfoliation for my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, if you spray too much in the mouth area it tastes like salt water.</li>
            <li>you are on the fence about the usefulness of a tonic, I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>I really like the way how this toner makes my skin feel after I cleanse.</li>
            <li>I really like this toner.</li>
            <li>I really like this toner.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of redness to my skin and this really balances everything out.</li>
            <li>I find that I really like this toner.</li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle and can not tell any difference when I use it or not.</li>
            <li>I really like the OZ Naturals line of products and use all of them.</li>
            <li>VERY SOOTHING/ HYDRATING</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals impresses my wife and this product has really improved her skin.</li>
            <li>But mine didn&#x27;t so I didn&#x27;t think much of it.  </li>
            <li>It feels completely hydrated and fresh.</li>
            <li>Not so much hydrating effect, no brightening effect.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants healthier looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from &amp;#34;just&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I feel refreshed I would put this Oz Naturals Ocen Mineral Tonic on my list to order thanks</li>
            <li>but it seems to dispense too much liquid.  </li>
            <li>a spray bottle is much easier than the cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>I feel it has improved the texture to my skin/neck area (really feels so much smoother) and even healing my sometimes dermatitis around my scalp area.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this toner.</li>
            <li>but you really dont want fragrance added anyhow.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well</li>
            <li>but I really like this one for its ease of use as well</li>
            <li>I really do like it</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell that much</li>
            <li>The combination of OZ products really does make it</li>
            <li>and I have lived in very sunny places.  </li>
            <li>I hope they keep them economical as well as natural &amp; hard-working.</li>
            <li>This toner really prepares my skin to absorbe the serum.  </li>
            <li>I will always use toner now, especially OZ Natural Toner.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much of a scent and the witch hazel in it and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to say I really like it.</li>
            <li>Never been one to use toner much and now I cannot do without it.</li>
            <li>once I see (or don&#x27;t see) much of a change,</li>
            <li>It really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin , it has kept blemishes at bay</li>
            <li>so I wanted to leave a real review for anyone looking to purchase.</li>
            <li>Though they are powerful, they are not harsh.</li>
            <li>Well, I am absolutely amazed at the change in just two weeks.</li>
            <li>There is something about a beach vacation that always leaves my skin looking clear and fresh.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am really liking it, and will say it is loaded with skin-loving, anti-aging ingredients.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this toner!</li>
            <li>It really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You can really control the amount of toner that comes out and having it in a spray bottle</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Oz.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of it</li>
            <li>Did not se much of difference comparing to others product used</li>
            <li>Very cleansing toner.</li>
            <li>This tonic is really pleasing when putting it on.  </li>
            <li>and i really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this toner and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I have to say I really like the way this toner feels on my face when I spray it on.</li>
            <li>But I really like the ease of the spray.</li>
            <li>After it had a few minutes to sit it stopped and my skin did feel nice, but</li>
            <li>I love the fact these are natural ingredients and it prepares the skin for the next application.</li>
            <li>, I guess I just wasn&#x27;t using the right toner because after using this one, my face felt so dewy and fresh that my skin felt 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other ones, but its pretty awesome that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>But one day, I was way too bothered by the greenish dusts, I decided to open the whole bottle and clean it from the inside.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this Oz Naturals Facial Toner in the mail!</li>
            <li>I have never used a toner, but I love the other OZ naturals products and thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  </li>
            <li>Excited to test the next product!</li>
            <li>It seems to make the other skin products sink into the skin better and work</li>
            <li>It seems to tighten my shin which makes me happy because i have bigger than normal pores which causes beakouts and my face hasnt broke out in a few days</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh, clean and ready for the other Oz products.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed that my face felt more firm after the first use.</li>
            <li>Some spray and make your face feet wet instead of fresh and cool.</li>
            <li>I very much like the OZ Natural Products.  </li>
            <li>It really refreshes my skin and is easy and quick to spritz on your face if you&#x27;re too lazy to use a cotton pad and swipe.</li>
            <li>This toner is a very light spray that has a slight indistinguishable odor.  </li>
            <li>The toner has a nice and light feel to it that makes you skin feel revitalized and fresh not oily at all which I was afraid it would be.</li>
            <li>Like some say it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty because it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>It also helps those with normal skin to really lock in moisture.</li>
            <li>At first I tried using it by spraying it on a cotton ball, then I decided to just use the spray directly on my face.</li>
            <li>and I think you should give your face a new chance at rejuvenation as well!at rejuvenation as well!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh like a normal toner, but it doesn‚Äôt dry it out like others, it leaves it feeling just right.</li>
            <li>It smelled odd to me, but I&#x27;m sure others can find pleasure in this smell and</li>
            <li>I spray it directly onto my skin after cleaning and it leaves my skin very refreshed and ready for my nighttime serum or day time</li>
            <li>I can quickly wash my face to get rid of any oil and dirt then spray this on giving me a refresh in the middle or at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can quickly wash my face to get rid of any oil and dirt then spray this on giving me a refresh in the middle or at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily the scent only lasts about 4seconds after you spray it</li>
            <li>Because the main ingredient is witch hazel</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: Unlike others who received free products I am writing this slightly negative review at the risk of never being one of the people who get to try a product for free.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the scent..which I can&#x27;t really describe -</li>
            <li>the mist goes on evenly and dries quickly so you can proceed with the next step in your routine.  </li>
            <li>after using it for several days, I ordered another to keep in my kitchen for quick pick-ups during the day.  </li>
            <li>That smell dissipated quickly and wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me either way.</li>
            <li>Layered with my other Oz Naturals products, this toner has really helped my fine lines disappear in the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve spent the past several years looking for the perfect replacement....</li>
            <li>I Love how this makes my face feel tight without drying it out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>After trying it myself, I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this toner from reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended, pamper your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yet perhaps the best testament to this product (and the other OZ Naturals products I have been using‚Äîplease see my other reviews if you are interested) came just a few days ago, when someone asked me, ‚ÄúWhat have you been using on your skin?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My skin is easily irritated, but this product has been gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I saw a dramatic improvement in my nasolabial/marionette lines.</li>
            <li>I love that they are basically unisex and are completely natural with dermatological-grade active ingredients.</li>
            <li>Just splash it directly by spraying onto the face and gently massage.</li>
            <li>This is an all natural toner which also makes it an absolute must.</li>
            <li>When you spray the toner, it is very mist like and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with a fresh face and then after the morning facial routine it&#x27;s another layer on brightness and youthful look on my face.</li>
            <li>Maybe with more long term use I might see a different result</li>
            <li>To make sure it was the toner and not something else, I stopped using the toner for a few days, but continued using the products I had been using and</li>
            <li>My uneven skin looks much better now.</li>
            <li>I have used many toners for different skin issues and this has been the 2nd all natural toner that has helped me with my breakouts.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting scent, I swear it smells like burnt sugar, not the acrid smell, but a sweet faint caramelized sorta scent, I really like that!</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels softer, smoother and more firm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the long term effects are good but after using it for a few days</li>
            <li>not a great smell though but its good</li>
            <li>I feel that my skin looks more clear and my acne blemishes have toned down a bit.</li>
            <li>and I love what it has in it to really prepare my skin not only for the day but for my other skin care</li>
            <li>I have also tried it right after getting out of the pool from swimming laps and again, it made my skin feel tighter and refreshed at the same time.</li>
            <li>This was such a fine mist that it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been in need of a new toner for my face.</li>
            <li>like trying new products</li>
            <li>I also live in</li>
            <li>I also live in</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and I am always on the hunt for a new product to introduce to my clients.</li>
            <li>now I can&#x27;t live without it .It</li>
            <li>I live in the midwest</li>
            <li>This product has also become a new permanent member of my make-up arsenal.</li>
            <li>I do not love the smell (very light mineral smell), or I would give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Review by BonitaBlueEyes contributor for PrairieWifeInHeels.com</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and what it has in it to really prepare my skin not only for the day but for my other skin care</li>
            <li>My skin stays shine free and it&#x27;s a great base layer before I apply a serum</li>
            <li>I like that the scent is very mild, just slightly herbal.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m ready for the next steps in getting my face ready for the day.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m ready for the next steps in getting my face ready for the day.</li>
            <li>I have really been making an effort to take better care of my skin lately since I&#x27;m getting close to forty</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and find that this keeps my face hydrated all</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin, but I use toner mainly to remove any facewash that didn&#x27;t rinse off of my face completely after cleansing.</li>
            <li>The toners I used in my teen years were very drying, so when I was given this product to try &amp; review, I really was not looking forward to trying it.</li>
            <li>It smells very natural and calming, Almost like the Colorado mountains after it rains.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is very natural.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re guaranteed organic and cruelty-free, which is a pretty big deal to me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Toners are always liquids, and usually in a bottle that you can pour the toner out or a flip top lid.</li>
            <li>Toners are always liquids, and usually in a bottle that you can pour the toner out or a flip top lid.</li>
            <li>sure enough after 3 days the acne went away and has not come back - so it was definitely this</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using any type of toner in the past, and wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be of any use to me.  </li>
            <li>I chose the toner first because it was the one thing my admittedly tiny budgeted face care regimen was lacking.</li>
            <li>For those of us that wear makeup or moisturizer daily, what if I told you that there was an anti-aging toner that we should be applying first?</li>
            <li>, most toners that I tried in the past seemed to be designed for oily skin, and mine is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>toner is a primer which simply means it is the first thing you can choose to put on your face, neck or chest areas.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not usually a fan of toners.</li>
            <li>While the other basic toners eliminate the shine and produce a crisp clean feeling the effect goes away after about 1/2 hr and my oily skin reverts to</li>
            <li>This is not your old &amp;#34;sea breeze&amp;#34; from the past, but something much better that preps the face for your serums and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m unsure of any other benefits that it&#x27;s providing on its own apart from other products that I&#x27;m using, including OZ Naturals Eye Gel and OZ Naturals Serum.</li>
            <li>I actually used it one day after a mud mask that irritated my skin to help cool it back down and sooth it some, you can&#x27;t say that about many toners out there since they often do the burning especially if they have alcohol in them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid 60s, and I was pretty unhappy when I saw those lines developing, but not I am HAPPY.</li>
            <li>This 100% natural product is made in the USA and comes in a spray bottle, making it easy to mist over the face and neck as part of a complete skin care regimen and as a little treat for the skin throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I tried the whole collection of OZ Naturals products (because not only are they advertised as being all natural but they are best sellers on Amazon), I was soooo disappointed.</li>
            <li>My fine lines and uneven skin tone are a result of having radiation therapy for cancer.</li>
            <li>A bit drying for skin of a certain age, though it tones it well prior to moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It not only felt firmer but areas where my skin was beginning to sag a little had a more lifted appearance.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin but in the summer it is hard to keep balanced &amp; looking healthy.</li>
            <li>The scent of this toner was so overwhelming, it was hard to use on my face.</li>
            <li>What I am using this Toner for is to get me away from my previous toner and into an organic/natural product that I know is good for my skin and which will compliment the other OZ facial products I have been using for awhile now.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft now; I believe this is the result of the antioxidants in the toner.  </li>
            <li>Here is the real deal with facial products...</li>
            <li>I was surprised-</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>so far no problem.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have any scrapes, so this surprised me.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like spraying it directly on.</li>
            <li>So far, I like what the toner is doing to my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this spray does not irritate.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t completely cover the freckles.</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li>have an established facial care routine that involves a gentle cleanser, followed by an exfoliating product then a serum and</li>
            <li>This one is organic and natural which is something I like to look for as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to overdo all the chemicals on my face because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think I have tried every toner on the market and this one by far is the nicest.</li>
            <li>And I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I  spray directly from the bottle on my face and neck twice a day.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying another Oz natural product.  </li>
            <li>It soaks into her skin, refreshes her skin and makes her skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I really like this facial toner.</li>
            <li>the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple formula is very reassuring.  </li>
            <li>(100% natural):  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by the results I am experiencing.  </li>
            <li>, each of these are far better.&lt;br /&gt;Spend</li>
            <li>It really does make one&#x27;s pores smaller</li>
            <li>When I started using this toner, my skin tone became even, no break outs (not even hormonal ones), and my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can use this product without any problems.</li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This facial toner is gentle and works just like witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>having witch hazel in since my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>To my surprise, all of the &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; on my forehead was completely cleared by morning.</li>
            <li>I use a cotton ball as too not waste alot</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, moisturized and balanced.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone looking for natural skin care products.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to redness around my nose and eyes, but this has evened it all out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And to seal the deal, they are USA made, Vegan (no animal testing!), all natural, and the prices can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>The area I was concerned with around my eyes has completely resolved.</li>
            <li>I had circles, vertical lines and crows feet; and they are GONE, completely gone....</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how refreshed I felt.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>downside is, you can&#x27;t really tell if it covered entirely or missed the spot (*</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li>while I do like them, I think it is misleading for them to be marked organic.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use this as my base before using Oz Naturals The Best Eye Gel and C Serum.</li>
            <li>The spray is light and dries quickly, but had a mildly unpleasant scent to me and honestly stung a little.</li>
            <li>Every toner usually leaves dry patches on my skin, kind of like eczema.</li>
            <li>I purchased while looking for a product that would help reduce some new vertical aging lines under my eyes, crows feet around the side of my eyes, and a general firming and moisturizing product for my face that would brighten my skin.</li>
            <li>but i find that it absorbs well, a little sticky but helps me clean up residues off my face when I use it after washing my face.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly how my skin feels every single time I use it</li>
            <li>I say this with all the honesty and relief of a 31 year old woman who has been struggling to find a decent face treatment for my combo, occasional acne and blackhead-prone, splotchy face for years:</li>
            <li>I am usually very lazy about writing reviews unless I absolutely love it..</li>
            <li>Clean, refreshed, firm but not tight, and supple.</li>
            <li>It does have a slight mineral odour, which fades quickly.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what OZ says it will do, great base for the rest of the OZ products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use because you can spray it over the face and then let it dry before applying my other  products.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry quicker using the spray bottle so that&#x27;s a positive.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and sinks into the skin very fast.</li>
            <li>or so I saw major improvement!</li>
            <li>In all fairness, I don&#x27; think I have had it long to really critique.</li>
            <li>only used a few times, will report back once I finish the product for a better judgement on how it worked for me.</li>
            <li>The toner I was using before was full of harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight and dried out, just nice and refeshed.</li>
            <li>uneven and fine lines/wrinkles are all still the same.</li>
            <li>The net effect is clean, hydrated skin, not stripped or dull, and gently moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and a good base for my other two products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used countless face products so I am always on the lookout for a new one.</li>
            <li>The product comes out a nice fine mist and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor or take long to absorb.</li>
            <li>So convenient, just spritz it on face and neck, let it dry and your ready for your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have also been using the toner before applying my makeup and my makeup goes on so much smoother now, when your skin is dry</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to return the item, but my only time to go to the post office to return it was the time only after the post office closes, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see in few more weeks when the bottle will be empty.</li>
            <li>The spray bottle is super convenient and you don&#x27;t waste valuable product saturating a cotton pad to apply.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this toner is soothing and has no gross perfume odor.</li>
            <li>After using this for a couple of weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes in my skin and that is why I docked it a star.</li>
            <li>I feel more than a little compelled to share with other women and men about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing major.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I tried it again, and I had to wash it off due to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used toner for many years due to enlarged pores and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and can be carried in a handbag for use at any time during the day.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is quite large and will last long, especially due to the fact you only need a squirt or two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Using this face toner during the beauty regime is perhaps a luxury, but not a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Generally don&#x27;t use a toner but was given the opportunity to try this one.  </li>
            <li>You can only smell it when spraying on, it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>It just sinks in the skin so gently.</li>
            <li>It could&#x27;ve been just a leak from the bottle, but the stain looked so yellow and so old like those items piled up in 99 cents store window.</li>
            <li>OZ Natural Facial Tone is an Anti-aging Regimen it Calms my Unbalanced Skin and the wrinkle&#x27;s around my nose and mouth are disappearing.</li>
            <li>Also as mentioned above I have sensitive skin and this has not irritated it at all.</li>
            <li>I am mature and need to keep it properly hydrated in summer.</li>
            <li>Natural products are the only products you should use on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I used to ask that question until I tried OZ Natural Facial Toner.</li>
            <li>If you are younger- start now and start with OZ Natural Products.</li>
            <li>Currently started using a OZ Natural toner.  </li>
            <li>For an extra kick i use Oz Natural Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I can barely handle the smell and for that reason I probably will not be purchasing it again</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be sprayed on the hands and rubbed onto the face and neck, or you can simply close your eyes and spray the product directly on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I just received this item a few days ago and I am already surprised by how much it brightens my skin when applied!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to copy and paste this review to the products I&#x27;ve listed above to avoid finding a new way to say the same thing!</li>
            <li>Luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t last after it has dried.</li>
            <li>My skin hardly ever drys out, so finding a product that helps serums and my (heavy) moisturizer cream to absorb completely is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>It seems to provide a nice base for spreading the Vitamin C Serum, as the C serum seems to absorb quickly without toner.  </li>
            <li>I do have normally oily skin but use anti-aging products that can tend to leave it on the dry side, so I do like this.</li>
            <li>However usually after cleaning my face it is clean and I don&#x27;t seen any further dirt on the cotton balls/pads.</li>
            <li>However usually after cleaning my face it is clean and I don&#x27;t seen any further dirt on the cotton balls/pads.</li>
            <li>I saw other reviewers said their face broke out too, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it until it happened to me.</li>
            <li>I believe that this tonic, along with my careful and consistent facial care routine have given me the opportunity to truly push back the advancing telltale signs of time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I used the facial toner in the morning and at night hoping for a miracle as I have done with so many other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little weird to spray your face but it works perfectly and reduces product waste.  </li>
            <li>It definitely lasts a while as I feel I have barely put a dent into the bottle.</li>
            <li>I washed and dried my face first and then applied the Ocean Mineral Tonic.</li>
            <li>I put this on and wow is my facial skin high &amp; tight.</li>
            <li>2 weeks later, using the tonic twice a day, my skin feels baby smooth and my uneven skin tone due to &amp;#34;pregnancy mask&amp;#34; has diminished.  </li>
            <li>Nothing weird or stinky going on here like some other all natural toners I have tried, just kind of natural and wet smelling.</li>
            <li>I had previously been using the tea tree facial toner from Lush, and I never really felt it did much.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you that it works VERY WELL in conjunction with the other Oz Naturals products!!</li>

            <li> Since using the toner,  I&#x27;ve noticed that they&#x27;ve greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sea Breeze and Neutrogena toners for years and they&#x27;re great but after using this one from OZ Naturals</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great addition to my skin care regimen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great refresher for your make-up about mid-afternoon, just a spritz</li>
            <li> OMG I love it!!</li>

            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This OZ toner is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> They are amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly, a must have!</li>
            <li> Really nice feeling going on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally loving this toner!</li>
            <li> excellent product i love it</li>
            <li> I will keep this one handy at all times!  </li>
            <li> Feels good works great</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant too.  </li>
            <li> toner has a pleasant scent and is 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a pleasant odor as others have described.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, too.  </li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent and the sprayer has a perfect amount of product mist.</li>
            <li> but i got fooled by all those who got bribed to write a good review</li>
            <li> but it did a good job at evening skin tone</li>
            <li> I think the toner itself is good, but I gave two star because I didn&#x27;t like how the bottle came unselaed and it leaked.</li>
            <li> The price is fair, too, for the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like OZ Naturals line for their efficacy and for their good prices.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample for my review; I have no problem endorsing it because it really is good</li>
            <li> Because when you buy something from them, they encourage you to leave a good comment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair way to attract people.</li>
            <li> but I have heard good things about it</li>
            <li> and my face feels exhilarating and youthful.</li>
            <li> Does a good prep job.</li>
            <li> Look good, but I doubt how it works.</li>
            <li> Great toner, feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> This one is a good choice</li>
            <li> This feels soooooo good after the Vitamin C wash ‚ù§</li>
            <li> Will continue using knowing it is good for my skin.</li>
            <li> but then again toners don&#x27;t smell that good.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> n&#x27;t because it is that good.</li>
            <li> I loved that it was a spray</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and smells good too.</li>
            <li> but Vitamin C is good for you</li>
            <li> But, It does feel good to use it.</li>
            <li> Maybe good for summer.</li>
            <li> It smells soooo good and it makes my skin shiny.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they were so good</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s the toner doing it&#x27;s job because after that my skin felt good.</li>
            <li> , it makes my face feel so good before I use OZ Naturals Serum.</li>
            <li> But, I re-ordered it, because it is a really good product</li>
            <li> Scent is good too.</li>
            <li> It says to use it after cleansing and exfoliating, but I have found that it feels good whenever.  </li>
            <li> but it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> was provided this product from the company for a fair and unbiased reiew.  </li>
            <li> I look more beautiful than ever</li>
            <li> This toner calms your unbalanced skin and helps to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles from your skin to give you a happy healthy youthful glow!!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed that the product is made right here in the good ole USA.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I received this toner for review because it is a great toner.  </li>
            <li> This toner is very refreshing, and I have seen a reduction in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> was very pleased to review this product for OZ</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased when I did.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing however living in a humid environment I will use on dryer days.  </li>
            <li> This Toner is very refreshing to use.</li>
            <li> I used to use just witch hazel on a cotton ball as a toner, but this is great, and probably better for my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a refreshing toner and works great to set or refresh make-up during the day.</li>
            <li> so im completely happy and satisfied with this product and hope</li>
            <li> I love this toner!</li>
            <li> so refreshing!</li>
            <li> I love OZ Naturals products!</li>

            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I also think it has helped with scarring and making the texture of my skin much better!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I also love the vitamin c serum!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and Pleasant.</li>
            <li> Nice, refreshing mist that tones skin!</li>
            <li> they are all helping the Vit A serum, the HA serum, the great eye gel (that I use all over my face for the fine lines in the cheek areas) to penetrate and go deeper.</li>
            <li> but it fades quickly and leaves my skin bright and glowing all day!</li>
            <li> It feels great and gives a really smooth surface to work on when applying it before makeup.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> It would be great if this is available on subscribe.</li>
            <li> After using this for almost a week now, I can already see amazing results and I am loving every minute of it.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing.</li>
            <li> so these products have worked amazing during this winter.  </li>
            <li> Great toner....fresh and light</li>
            <li> Works amazing</li>
            <li> We both agree, though, this spray toner goes on light, does not sting, and is a great step before serums &amp; moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good toner I love the fact that is in a spray form</li>
            <li> but I liked the smell of it.</li>
            <li> After that, I apply my favorite serums and moisturizers, and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this in order to give my honest feedback, but I have already added it to my wish list on here to buy again when I am out of it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is organic and its better for me, while giving me great looking skin.  </li>
            <li> Opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li> yet it primes my skin nicely for my makeup after I moisturiZe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice alternative to a cream primer.</li>
            <li> I have really liked every Oz Naturals product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> She has asked if she could take over using it or have me purchase her own bottle</li>
            <li> this is my 100% honest opinion.redients</li>
            <li> this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>

            <li> You can also apply this by spraying it onto a cotton pad, but I honestly prefer to just spray it on my face.</li>

            <li> received this for review purposes however my opinions are honest.</li>
            <li> Toners are a must have for me and this one I really loved because it was non-drying and contained beneficial ingredients-I want more.</li>
            <li> The combination of the blotchiness, acne scars and sundamage start to weigh on your self esteem thats why i am so thrilled to have found this product.</li>

            <li> They are ok - nothing great, just ok.</li>

            <li> It is nice, but I do not notice any changes.  </li>
            <li> (lemon-y smell, but not the tasty kind...)</li>
            <li> I WAS GIVEN A COMPLEMENTARY SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> Nice toner you can feel it working</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Nice toner.</li>
            <li> Great clean, moist feeling.</li>
            <li> I do highly suggest getting all three product to get the best benefit out of the products.  </li>
            <li> As stated with the cleanser I was lucky to try this for free, I have tried lots of skincare over the years and I am really impressed with this company.</li>
            <li> No bad side effects, just great skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I found my new best friend!</li>
            <li> I wake up with right beautiful skin</li>
            <li> I was given this product free of charge for my fair and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This toner is a highly effective ant-aging refresher that contains many amazing ingredients from vitamin c, witch hazel, ocean minerals and glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> This toner smells pleasantly of witch hazel which is its primary ingredient.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, can&#x27;t wait to see the difference this going to have on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong witch hazel smell which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> The pump sprayer is of good quality and produces a fine mist.  </li>
            <li> However, because I&#x27;ve been impressed with the quality and results I&#x27;ve experienced using other Oz Naturals products I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I have to say in my case, it is far from the best...</li>
            <li> This toner tightens my skin and makes my skin look nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> Good comments &#x3D; free samples...</li>

            <li> The ingredients sound good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Instantly refreshing :)</li>

            <li> I am glad I chose to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> So many stinky memories.</li>
            <li> Refreshing toner.  </li>

            <li> I. Love.</li>
            <li> Does my face look and feel better, clearer, and more even than ever before?</li>

            <li> My face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Let me just start off with, THIS FACIAL TONER IS AMAZING!!!</li>

            <li> Will definitely continue with this toner, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used toners to  remove traces of makeup that my facial cleanser wasn&#x27;t able to remove so I was taken aback with this being a spritzer, but I decided to use this with my HA serum that is best used with some sort of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing when you spray it on your face then wipe off with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li> It is so refreshing</li>
            <li> I also love the light scent it has!</li>
            <li> I love the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> is that this toner can and should be used as a refreshing spray you use throughout the day as needed to refresh the makeup.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes spray it on during the day if I feel my skin is thirsty :)</li>
            <li> The pores on top of cheeks have shrunk.</li>
            <li> I can see my skin is soft, smooth and flawless gradually.</li>
            <li> am 100% satisfied with this toner.</li>
            <li> I use moisturizer on top of it and then apply my makeup, which seems to go on smoother.  </li>
            <li> It may work better for someone else.</li>
            <li> It is both refreshing and moisturizing when sprayed on the skin if it is kept in</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to lessen them but they continued to get deeper and more</li>
            <li> And I am a skeptic, folks, but I LOVE this product line.</li>
            <li> but this toner helps make the makeup go on smother and since it is helping my moisturizer work better</li>
            <li> I am sure with a bit more use of the toner combined with my moisturizer</li>
            <li> my skin will be nice and smooth again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing and does not leave any sticky feel or residue.  </li>
            <li> I also love to just  spritz my face throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Probably one of my favorite things about this product is that it serves as a primer to serums and moisturizers - which is code for it enhances the absorption of the products applied after the spray.</li>
            <li> I have continued using this product for a couple weeks now, and I am still enjoying it.</li>
            <li> It says that this toner can be used on top of makeup throughout the day, so I wanted to try that out to see if the toner would make my make up run or not, and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Seemed like one more product to sell.  </li>
            <li> But I was given this to try, and my skin surely isn&#x27;t getting any younger‚Äîin fact, it&#x27;s getting more exposed since I&#x27;ve taken up lap swiimming‚Äî</li>
            <li> I can say for sure is that  it feels nice and has a light, refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this toner has glycolic acid in it.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing smell and feel of this toner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife has used them much more than me.  </li>
            <li> Love this toner.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS TONER  FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> More so than when I&#x27;ve used witch hazel on</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t need to use cotton ball to apply the toner.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I do believe the manufacturer (I love OZ products) might want to add some information about it being a spray.container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spritz and go for a healthy glow -</li>
            <li> my skin made it through the winter thanks to the OZ Naturals skin care products - the skin toner is great under of just going out to protect the face.</li>

            <li> /&gt;OZ Ocean Mineral Tonic has an interesting scent.  </li>
            <li> But I truly do love their product line.</li>
            <li> even better results as i use it more.</li>
            <li> It is not USDA certified organic and unlike many of OZ Naturals products, this one doesn&#x27;t even say what percentage of it is organic.</li>
            <li> I just would like to see a bit more honesty from OZ naturals.</li>
            <li> It feels so refreshing and energizing.  </li>
            <li> and I just love the ingredients thats  in it like glycolic acid, ocean minerals, vitamin c &amp; amino acids.</li>

            <li> I really love how clean it makes my face feel after I&#x27;ve applied it!</li>

            <li> I used about 3 sprays to cover my whole face, it gives you a nice fine mist which is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this to review by the company, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a huge hassle to have to call your sister and tell her to print a return label and find a box, tape it, make sure it&#x27;s packaged correctly and drive 4.2 miles to my nearest UPS store.</li>
            <li> ,it has a huge ingredient list and many are organic.</li>
            <li> It is so refreshing and light.  </li>

            <li> So easy.</li>
            <li> I have tried this facial toner all week and this ocean mineral tonic toner is a great anti aging vitamin C toner that claims to provide a healthy, youthful glow.</li>
            <li> The toner Is easy to take with you on the go and the fact I can spray it on the go makes it easier as well.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs very quickly as well</li>
            <li> Easy transaction.</li>
            <li> It is easy to tuck into a bag to take to the pool or beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to understate a toner</li>

            <li> Refreshing, feels clean.</li>
            <li> I would consider buying this again because of the solid anti-aging ingredients, but would be more inclined if the scent was more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love the OZ products Natural and good for my skin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell</li>
            <li> Not to strong .great ingredients to help skin and sun damage</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what it actually does, but it makes my skin feel like I was just swimming in the ocean (in a good way).  </li>
            <li> It has a strong scent of Witch Hazel, though, which makes me think of Preparation</li>
            <li> scent is quite strong too</li>
            <li> This toner is very gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> Sounds like OZ naturals has my skin regimen all planned out for beautiful skin now and into the future.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I normally didn&#x27;t have to fight the T-zone or oily skin (good genes), so</li>
            <li> and this worked fine with my face.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing, and I especially like to use it after cleaning up after a workout or on a warm, humid day.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel tighter and it fills in the fine lines.</li>
            <li> This toner has witch hazel that tightens the face and is also an antiaging product for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Super Toner!  </li>
            <li> It drys quickly so I can move on to the serums and prepares my face in a refreshing way.  </li>
            <li> very soothing and refreshing!  </li>
            <li> This is a light weight quick refreshing mist.</li>
            <li> This toner is very light and makes me feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> and I guarantee you will LOVE it as much as I do!!</li>
            <li> What I enjoyed most was the results I experienced within little over a week of use.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more because of all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> then I apply whatever product I need to apply or my makeup and its so smooth.</li>
            <li> It is vegan free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Received free for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i received a free sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I am currently using more natural products because it is the best for the skin.</li>
            <li> It has a light feel</li>
            <li> My skin is showing great signs of premature aging and I am only 44.</li>
            <li> even.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*regardless of receiving this product for free</li>
            <li> /&gt;*regardless of receiving this product for free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kicking myself because now we&#x27;re spending a lot more on skin care, but for us, it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The eye serum is the best and NO irritation to the skin around the eye - or the eye itself - and I am super sensitive to skin products and an older woman.</li>
            <li> and it has made my face so smooth.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy when we are out on the boat</li>
            <li> This Toner is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about facial toner from my friends.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I use it before putting any make up on and it seems to really smooth my skin, prepping it for my make up.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, cruelty-free and effective.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle for free but that did not affect my opinions of the product.</li>
            <li> smell is light too.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel smooth after the hydration mask</li>
            <li> It drips even when I spray lightly from about a foot away.  </li>
            <li> Like that its light feeling.  </li>
            <li> Does help with liquid foundation to set smoothly.  </li>
            <li> but I do enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and I can fit</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for great results in your face to feel refreshed this product is doubly for you.</li>
            <li> It is not drying at all, and it does make the rest of the products &amp; foundation go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This Ocean facial Tonic works great</li>
            <li> Even though I receive this product free, I would purchase it if I did</li>
            <li> My pores are closing, my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> This is so light and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think i finally believe my search for a great product line is over.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals gets such great reviews, and there was a coupon, so</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is cruelty free tested.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin pore free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the whiole body too - especially after toweling off out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If that is important to you than you should skip on this toner.</li>
            <li> The  scent  is light</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> It went on very light and made my skin feel really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I think most people must have gotten these products for Free in return to leave a positive review!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in my skin but just love using this!!  </li>
            <li> Wakes your skin right up and helps to better absorb serums into your skin.</li>
            <li> They gave me a full size product for free for the purpose of testing and reviewing it, giving only my own thoughtful and honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> however it is very effective with anti-aging products and/or facial treatments.</li>
            <li> As ive gotten older the blotchiness has become more and more visible.</li>
            <li> The pump also makes it easy to take along with you and use on those days when your makeup needs a quick spritz refresher.</li>
            <li> Easy and quick your done.</li>
            <li> Have never gotten into full skincare regimes but am loving the OZ line so much that I like using them all in tandem.</li>
            <li> product is very easy to use thanks to the bottle being a spray on.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this toner very much.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean but can sting your eyes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing for sensitive skin and gets results!!</li>
            <li> I am lucky to have a clear complexion and good skin tone, but the OZ Naturals makes my skin feel and look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin immediately felt more youthful and rejuvenated with the first spray.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d never used before I made sure to read all the directions first.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this products and the whole OZ naturals line!</li>
            <li> It would be refreshing on a hot day</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure that It can help the make up set.</li>
            <li> In the summer,  I can imagine this being refreshing on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a moisturizer your looking for try the Bee Friendly line.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list has a lot of scientific names but also every day names that are familiar, like witch hazel, vitamin C, and aloe.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels cool, smooth and clean after using.</li>
            <li> I love that its natural :)</li>
            <li> Its filled with all kinds of amazing and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Leaves you with a refreshingly clean feel.</li>
            <li> It sprays on lightly, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> One note however, if you have eyeliner, eyebrows, lips tattooed, avoid those areas by spraying in the palm of your clean hand and apply to your face with fingertips.</li>
            <li> I love that all these products are organic and natural and my skin has never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li> The sprayer and nozzle did not get clogged so there was no need to clean it as with others.  </li>
            <li> I will say I believe the toner causes the serum to be more effective overall.</li>
            <li> The scent is like witch hazel, light and not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use Oz Natural products because they have not let me down and have given me hope for a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> While I received a sample for review purposes, I&#x27;m so impressed with this whole line of products that I will continue purchasing them and am exploring the other things they have on offer.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about two weeks ago right after I wash my face with the ocean mineral face wash!</li>
            <li> I can feel it absorb into my skin right away!</li>
            <li> and I apply it by taking the lid/spray top off and dab it on a face pad (or into my clean hands) and gently apply it on my face.  </li>
            <li> Finally my skin has a bright appearance.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, as is expected from Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> I love it, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using a lavender organic toner for some time, but the OZ version is much more gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels thanks to this</li>
            <li> good for daily routine.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s refreshing but don&#x27;t know that it really did anything for my face...</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Hours later my face still feels refreshed besides the smell in the stickiness I have to say this is a really good toner if you&#x27;re probably not into the stickiness</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin has changed so much and feels a lot better afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product will stay in my product rotation for sure.  Very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> to the gentle nature of the tonic, it is safe for skin types and can be used throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this most.</li>
            <li> Very soothing; refreshing, hydrating.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that the toner is somehow really helping my moisturizer work better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> This is a \\&quot;toner/tonic\\&quot;, the afore-mentioned toners leave my face cool and refreshed while I notice this one does that</li>
            <li> I do not think I will purchase it again just because I do not like it being advertised as organic when it isn&#x27;t, but as far as the product itself is concerned, it is nice.</li>
            <li> and I am loving the results so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad, but just not my preference.  </li>
            <li> I also use this toner throughout the day to refresh my face because it also moisturizers and gives me that &amp;#34;put together&amp;#34; glow and this toner works GREAT on dry, itchy, winter skin!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out very easily.</li>
            <li> you have sun damage, fine lines or uneven skin tone, this is a great product to use.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have noticed that it works GREAT on pimples (in other parts of the body as well).</li>
            <li> , this one is so light I can&#x27;t describe it other than pleasant.</li>
            <li> It leaves a fresh clean surface.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin tone even, and clean with a fresh scent</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I am always running around so a quick spritz to refresh</li>
            <li> I apply my toner by spraying 2 pumps into the palm of my hand and then spread it quickly with my finger tips...</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oz Naturals Facial Toner along with the Super Youth Moisturizer, and Vitamin C Serum and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Shrinks pores and clears up mild acne.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> It has a particular seaweed fishy smell to it and my skin has not gotten better.  </li>
            <li> A wonderful facial toner that hydrates and clears up your skin as well as help your entire body with moisture and anti itch.  </li>
            <li> I use the Retinol Serum (pm), Vitamin C Serum (am), Hyaluronic Acid Serum (am/pm) and the Super Youth Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Funky smell but that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Ocean Mineral cleanser, the toner, serum, and  Super Youth retinol moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My favs are the Vit C serum, hyaluronic acid serum &amp; the Super Youth Moisturizer with Retinol.</li>
            <li> The smell fades as quick as it dries on your face.  </li>
            <li> mild scent, doesn&#x27;t sting,</li>
            <li> I‚Äôm not too sure about the benefits of glycolic acid and MSM, but everybody knows that Vitamin E is one of the top nutrients, especially for the skin.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, soaks up quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I have sensitive skin, I was happy to learn that this OZ Naturals anti-aging toner is 100% natural, vegan, alcohol-free, and doesn&#x27;t contain any sulfates or parabens.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I had high hopes this would help my skin.</li>
            <li> so I was interested in trying this toner for free* to review.</li>
            <li> Nor Cal where it can get very hot during the summers</li>
            <li> Nor Cal where it can get very hot during the summers</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am very happy with my other OZ Natural products</li>
            <li> Very satisfied , use daily, improves skin texture</li>
            <li> When I first heard about Oz Naturals&#x27; review a product for free offer I thought, why not?</li>
            <li> Sometimes it comes out in globs, so I spray it in my hand first and then smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I have found myself just &#x27;spritzing&#x27; my face with it throughout the day as it is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is my very first time using a face toner.</li>
            <li> What I do know is it feels great anytime of the day or night as a &#x27;refresher&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t leak, spill, or run down my face.  </li>
            <li> What a refreshing new step to my regimen.</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy and vibrant, my pores are smaller in appearance and my fine lines on my forehead seem to be filling in more.</li>
            <li> Works really well (but it does have a strong witch hazel smell)</li>
            <li> She noticed an improvement immediately and really enjoys how easy it is to use this product.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Im not a frequent reviewer unless i really love a product and this line has worked fantastic!</li>
            <li> It feels like lightly splashing my face with cool water but the ingredients are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it very natural</li>
            <li> Be aware guys!</li>
            <li> It did however remind me what a toner is really for...getting rid of leftover makeup!!</li>
            <li> After 7 days of use, I could see a brightening of my skin and now, 3 weeks into my daily routine with the OZ Naturals Tonic, I am ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH IT!  </li>
            <li> I love all of Oz Natural products and this toner is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying more of this stuff!  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my skin feel.it goes on like a cool mist and dries nicely without feeling heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I started using the toner, Hyaluronic acid+ vitamin C serum, Vitamin C facewash, and Super Youth moisturizer twice a day a few weeks ago and have seen a great improvement in the texture, softness, redness and dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the natural ingredients and that it has a very light scent.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C generally brightens the skin and makes it appear more glowy and radiant, so when I found a toner that is vitamin C based, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> It smelled like pure witch hazel, a cheap astringent that can purchased via any retail store.  </li>
            <li> Although I have been using prescription strength renova for over 15 years and have very good skin for my age, I have noticed a big difference in my skin after using OZ Naturals products, especially around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soothing and the pump applicator is fantastic ---</li>
            <li> All around great everyday toner.</li>
            <li> and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I received complimentary product in exhchange for a review.</li>
            <li> and I am loving the OzNaturals Facial Toner.  </li>
            <li> Once the toner dries you can&#x27;t tell you even put anything on except that your face feels fresh.</li>
            <li> Love this and all oz natural products</li>
            <li> Using this product my skin tone looks more radiant and soft without making it feel oily.</li>
            <li> product feels fresh when you spray it on your face.</li>
            <li> My only problem is honestly the smell.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how many steps are recommended in a skin care regimen</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more natural ocean like smell per the name, which is why I gave the rating four stars.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t smell it after it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li> All products received are complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It feels fresh, I like that you can spray it on your face instead of using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> It feels fresh when you spray it on.</li>
            <li> It gives the skin a fresh and youthful look.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh, but I wont buy it again .</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed how incredibly soft and smooth my face felt!</li>
            <li> I realize being more natural no perfumes are added.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, until I tried this facial toner, I didn&#x27;t think that I needed a toner.  </li>
            <li> I used my Oz Natural products last night and they felt great.</li>
            <li> I have used it  in these colder months throughout the day to give my makeup a fresh look.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy for the scent-smell reminds me of burnt ash.</li>
            <li> Worth a try, and</li>
            <li> but it was not helping enough on its own</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh after i use this.</li>
            <li> Its worth a try.</li>
            <li> so it was worth</li>
            <li> I really thank Oz for giving us a complimentary product that is organic and free from harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Love the spritz bottle &#x3D; means there&#x27;s no waste and no need for a cotton ball to apply.</li>
            <li> Is it safe on sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I was given this product to sample and provide honest feedback for potential buyers.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> I also like to use it mid-day over my makeup to give it a fresh dewy look.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> This toner works wonders layering with other Oz Natural products as I have personally tried many of these products together and loved the results!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you spritz in on, no need for cotton pads &amp; no mess.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels so fresh and extra clean.</li>
            <li> This wakes up my face in the morning and it dries pretty quick.</li>
            <li> It is clean and refreshing and I would definitely recommend using it in your skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t feel right about it.</li>
            <li> Can spray right on skin.</li>
            <li> I use Ocean Mineral Toner before I apply my OZ Naturals serums and it helps them absorb right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Some toners can have an over whelming scent, but this is just right.</li>
            <li> I use a face wash, which contains glycolic acid and use this product right after.</li>
            <li> I use it right before my vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> so I use is faithfully right after cleansing my face and before I put the serum on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 4 days and my skin feel like silk right now.</li>
            <li> Everyone should try these if they would like to see some positive results!</li>
            <li> I just found my new favorite toner - OZ Naturals Facial Toner is so refreshing.  </li>
            <li> THIS toner/tonic from OZ keeps my face shine free and crisp for much longer.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin and so far the products are wonderful.</li>
            <li> of the first ingredients are witch hazel and aloe, which seem to wake up the skin and also soothe the skin, which is nice especially if you&#x27;ve been out in the sun or wind a lot.  </li>
            <li> Thank you OZ for creating a toner that leaves the skin feeling soft, clean, and calm!</li>
            <li> It feels fresh and light, and my skin has been very clear.</li>
            <li> Honestly, there is no other toner out there like this one and decently priced.</li>
            <li> The toner is true to form and really works well .love that their products are organic.</li>
            <li> It really is a great toner when u get past the smell and from the reviews some ppl like the scent.</li>
            <li> first time I tried out this product was right after I got home from my zumba class.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh feeling of this toner when I spritz it on my facial area.</li>
            <li> I feel that if there is good stuff in this product then you deal with a slight smell you don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In receiving this product for a review, the only reason it a rating of a 4 stars instead of 5 is because of smell factor but absolutely everything else about this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, I pressed the nozzle and directly sprayed it to my face.  </li>
            <li> I am a big Witch Hazel fan, so I&#x27;m happy that&#x27;s a prominent ingredient (but was surprised that the ingredient list - while natural/organic - is so long!!).  </li>
            <li> for my sensitive skin and incredibly efficient for sun spots on my pale tone.</li>
            <li> Easy, no mess spray type.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this toner, not only is it FANTASTIC before my moisturizer, but it leaves my make-up looking fresh all day with just a few sprays.</li>
            <li> and it does this appear very fast in the skin I do recommend</li>
            <li> dries off very fast and is transparent as a toner should be.</li>
            <li> You really WILL see results within the first 7 days!</li>
            <li> taste a little salty but good stuff</li>
            <li> I really look forward to using it on hot summer days!  </li>
            <li> I love this toner because my skin is SUPER oily in the summer even if I took a shower 15 minutes ago in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Really leaves my face and neck clean and ready for OZ moisturizer.</li>
            <li> PLUS, unlike so many other products out there, water is NOT the first ingredient!!     </li>
            <li> I could feel my skin tightening, but it was not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Both of these products soak into my skin much better than they did prior to my using the toner.  </li>
            <li> I like that they are paraben free and use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> btw, ewww, what a gross word...moist! :)</li>
            <li> I like that so much better than the open bottle/cotton ball method.  </li>
            <li> The product is able to be used prior to applying makeup or after</li>
            <li> I noticed results after using the toner consistently twice a day for 3 days.</li>
            <li> Your face looks different, more youthful.</li>
            <li> The OZ Naturals Ocean Mineral Tonic with Glycolic Acid, MSM and Vitamin C is meant to be used immediately prior to the application of any Serum and again as needed throughout the day, over makeup for a refreshing lift.</li>
            <li> I can see an improvement in texture, my skin seems firmer and the overall tone appears more balanced and</li>
            <li> Best I can reading the ingredients there is no alcohol in this at all unless it&#x27;s under some weird name</li>
            <li> Now if you are using the toner for deep cleaning after you have already washed your face then that works better to remove the dirt.</li>
            <li> Now if you are using the toner for deep cleaning after you have already washed your face then that works better to remove the dirt.</li>
            <li> and it really does work!</li>
            <li> so I was willing to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after first use.</li>
            <li> First time buyer, but on the first application I could already noticed a healthier and moist skin.</li>
            <li> This Facial Toner is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now looking to buy more skincare in the same range!  </li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My pores look smaller and my skin tone looks more even.</li>
            <li> and I love this entire company.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel that if this company is willing to give me this opportunity that they are fully dedicated and believe in their products 100%.</li>
            <li> Has a smoky scent at first</li>
            <li> This is the best secret I have found to refresh and prime my skin !</li>
            <li> I love this facial toner.  </li>
            <li> ans it effective and carefully chosen ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have had no break outs and just love the way this toner gives my skin extra cleaning and toning.</li>
            <li> simple and refreshing.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> At first I sprayed it on, but have since gone to using a cotton ball to apply.  </li>
            <li> This is such a refreshing product.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that could make it better is if it was 6 or 8 oz.</li>
            <li> It smells like the beach and hydrates my skin after a hot shower.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Oz Naturals!</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> Applied topically it may aid in the healing of scars and blemishes, the soothing of sunburns, and the maintenance of youthful and healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like this line of products!</li>
            <li> Most women have a daily skin routine that they follow even if it&#x27;s just washing your face at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying my oz naturals facial toner.  </li>
            <li> I never realized how much a toner makes a difference in my skin care regimen!  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Oz Naturals!</li>
            <li> I love OZ Naturals Facial Toner!  </li>
            <li> this is the first i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> My wife swears (though I don&#x27;t know how;) it improves her skin tone and makes makeup application easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finishing up my 2nd bottle and for sure will keep using.</li>
            <li> One time, was more than enough for me.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed to help with my oil/dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so good using OZ Naturals, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  </li>
            <li> Means alot to me in my pursuit of trying to improve the health of my 58 yr old skin!!!!         .</li>
            <li> She is 15 and going through those changes that makes her skin break out and more sensitive to products and she likes how this one is cooling and refreshing without burning her skin like some other products do.</li>
            <li> You really have to trial and error to get a system that is right for your skin...</li>
            <li> My first impression was that the toner smelled quite a bit like witch hazel ( It contains witch hazel) - and after using it I&#x27;ve seen a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice and just as expected!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as it really seems to work!!</li>
            <li> I especially love that this toner is anti-aging, 100% natural, cruelty-free, vegan, does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is PH balanced which makes it safe for all skin types, which is almost impossible to find all of that in one product.</li>
            <li> It has a slight clean scent, but I feel this makes it that much better to use.</li>
            <li> This spray is great when I use my derma roller and wrinkle treatment, I do find that it is not for everyday use if you have ultra sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I am back to feeling good again and taking care of my skin for the future.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it works very well as a toner to start off your facial skin regimen, it is also just a refreshing spray that you can use any time of the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell that it does that much, and I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> This toner is also a quick pick me on humid summer days because it leaves a clean cooling sensation on your face and at the same time shrinks the pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t so much use it for anti-aging as I do to help keep my skin clear and healthy, but between being organic and having a boost of Vitamin C, this toner was so much more then your average over the counter toner.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that leaves my skin a bit dry, but I use serum right after and it feels good.</li>
            <li> I make sure to spray it right after cleansing while my skin is still wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have been using this product, I have been told that I am positively glowing.</li>
            <li> I plan on using this toner for a long time. :)</li>
            <li> This is a great tip for anyone with dry skin as it helps to seal in the moisture and help prevent dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals are wonderful products and the prices are unbelievably low relative to other brands.</li>
            <li> The scent of the Toner was mentioned in previous comments to smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many product, but everything either made me brake out or become really dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> if often used in chemical peels intended to improve the appearance of the skin by causing a mild exfoliation, softening and brightening the appearance of skin and, blending skin tones and improving the texture of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane), a sulfur compound that occurs naturally in plants, is often taken orally for joint strength and flexibility.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of their products now &amp; every single one has delievered.</li>
            <li> Not as pure as it needs to be .  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and not overbearing and the texture on your face seems to dissolve in less than a minute to have you ready to go.</li>
            <li> So far so good apart from having a slight burnt caramel smell</li>
            <li> It makes this a 2 second step and it makes your face feel fresh and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> especially if you&#x27;re having a wonderful (NOT)  hot flash!!!!!  </li>
            <li> The Oz Naturals Toner is perfect because although it does have astringents for an oily or other problem skin conditions, it also contains moisturizing properties to soothe my dry skin, &amp; anti-oxidants for the necessary protection, we are all exposed to; from both the sun‚Äôs harmful rays and the environmental pollution.  </li>
            <li> It has such amazing reviews, but I swear, it is just salty and gross and it makes my skin break-out.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times but my face feels great after spritzing.</li>
            <li> I would say that putting some water in a mist bottle and spraying your face before moisturizing would absolutely be just as efficient.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- very neutral smell&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> So much easier than a toner &amp; a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> These oz naturals folks really know what they are doing.</li>
            <li> and they work very well</li>
            <li> Very salty skin toner.  </li>
            <li> so there is not too much exfoliation for my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, if you spray too much in the mouth area it tastes like salt water.</li>
            <li> you are on the fence about the usefulness of a tonic, I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I really like the way how this toner makes my skin feel after I cleanse.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of redness to my skin and this really balances everything out.</li>
            <li> I find that I really like this toner.</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle and can not tell any difference when I use it or not.</li>
            <li> I really like the OZ Naturals line of products and use all of them.</li>
            <li> VERY SOOTHING/ HYDRATING</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals impresses my wife and this product has really improved her skin.</li>
            <li> But mine didn&#x27;t so I didn&#x27;t think much of it.  </li>
            <li> It feels completely hydrated and fresh.</li>
            <li> Not so much hydrating effect, no brightening effect.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants healthier looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from &amp;#34;just&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I feel refreshed I would put this Oz Naturals Ocen Mineral Tonic on my list to order thanks</li>
            <li> but it seems to dispense too much liquid.  </li>
            <li> a spray bottle is much easier than the cotton balls.  </li>
            <li> I feel it has improved the texture to my skin/neck area (really feels so much smoother) and even healing my sometimes dermatitis around my scalp area.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this toner.</li>
            <li> but you really dont want fragrance added anyhow.  </li>
            <li> It cleans very well</li>
            <li> but I really like this one for its ease of use as well</li>
            <li> I really do like it</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell that much</li>
            <li> The combination of OZ products really does make it</li>
            <li> and I have lived in very sunny places.  </li>
            <li> I hope they keep them economical as well as natural &amp; hard-working.</li>
            <li> This toner really prepares my skin to absorbe the serum.  </li>
            <li> I will always use toner now, especially OZ Natural Toner.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much of a scent and the witch hazel in it and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say I really like it.</li>
            <li> Never been one to use toner much and now I cannot do without it.</li>
            <li> once I see (or don&#x27;t see) much of a change,</li>
            <li> It really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin , it has kept blemishes at bay</li>
            <li> so I wanted to leave a real review for anyone looking to purchase.</li>
            <li> Though they are powerful, they are not harsh.</li>
            <li> Well, I am absolutely amazed at the change in just two weeks.</li>
            <li> There is something about a beach vacation that always leaves my skin looking clear and fresh.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am really liking it, and will say it is loaded with skin-loving, anti-aging ingredients.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this toner!</li>
            <li> It really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You can really control the amount of toner that comes out and having it in a spray bottle</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Oz.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of it</li>
            <li> Did not se much of difference comparing to others product used</li>
            <li> Very cleansing toner.</li>
            <li> This tonic is really pleasing when putting it on.  </li>
            <li> and i really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this toner and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have to say I really like the way this toner feels on my face when I spray it on.</li>
            <li> But I really like the ease of the spray.</li>
            <li> After it had a few minutes to sit it stopped and my skin did feel nice, but</li>
            <li> I love the fact these are natural ingredients and it prepares the skin for the next application.</li>
            <li> , I guess I just wasn&#x27;t using the right toner because after using this one, my face felt so dewy and fresh that my skin felt 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other ones, but its pretty awesome that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> But one day, I was way too bothered by the greenish dusts, I decided to open the whole bottle and clean it from the inside.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this Oz Naturals Facial Toner in the mail!</li>
            <li> I have never used a toner, but I love the other OZ naturals products and thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  </li>
            <li> Excited to test the next product!</li>
            <li> It seems to make the other skin products sink into the skin better and work</li>
            <li> It seems to tighten my shin which makes me happy because i have bigger than normal pores which causes beakouts and my face hasnt broke out in a few days</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh, clean and ready for the other Oz products.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that my face felt more firm after the first use.</li>
            <li> Some spray and make your face feet wet instead of fresh and cool.</li>
            <li> I very much like the OZ Natural Products.  </li>
            <li> It really refreshes my skin and is easy and quick to spritz on your face if you&#x27;re too lazy to use a cotton pad and swipe.</li>
            <li> This toner is a very light spray that has a slight indistinguishable odor.  </li>
            <li> The toner has a nice and light feel to it that makes you skin feel revitalized and fresh not oily at all which I was afraid it would be.</li>
            <li> Like some say it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty because it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> It also helps those with normal skin to really lock in moisture.</li>
            <li> At first I tried using it by spraying it on a cotton ball, then I decided to just use the spray directly on my face.</li>
            <li> and I think you should give your face a new chance at rejuvenation as well!at rejuvenation as well!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh like a normal toner, but it doesn‚Äôt dry it out like others, it leaves it feeling just right.</li>
            <li> It smelled odd to me, but I&#x27;m sure others can find pleasure in this smell and</li>
            <li> I spray it directly onto my skin after cleaning and it leaves my skin very refreshed and ready for my nighttime serum or day time</li>
            <li> I can quickly wash my face to get rid of any oil and dirt then spray this on giving me a refresh in the middle or at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can quickly wash my face to get rid of any oil and dirt then spray this on giving me a refresh in the middle or at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily the scent only lasts about 4seconds after you spray it</li>
            <li> Because the main ingredient is witch hazel</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: Unlike others who received free products I am writing this slightly negative review at the risk of never being one of the people who get to try a product for free.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the scent..which I can&#x27;t really describe -</li>
            <li> the mist goes on evenly and dries quickly so you can proceed with the next step in your routine.  </li>
            <li> after using it for several days, I ordered another to keep in my kitchen for quick pick-ups during the day.  </li>
            <li> That smell dissipated quickly and wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me either way.</li>
            <li> Layered with my other Oz Naturals products, this toner has really helped my fine lines disappear in the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve spent the past several years looking for the perfect replacement....</li>
            <li> I Love how this makes my face feel tight without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After trying it myself, I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this toner from reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended, pamper your skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yet perhaps the best testament to this product (and the other OZ Naturals products I have been using‚Äîplease see my other reviews if you are interested) came just a few days ago, when someone asked me, ‚ÄúWhat have you been using on your skin?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin is easily irritated, but this product has been gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I saw a dramatic improvement in my nasolabial/marionette lines.</li>
            <li> I love that they are basically unisex and are completely natural with dermatological-grade active ingredients.</li>
            <li> Just splash it directly by spraying onto the face and gently massage.</li>
            <li> This is an all natural toner which also makes it an absolute must.</li>
            <li> When you spray the toner, it is very mist like and not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I wake up with a fresh face and then after the morning facial routine it&#x27;s another layer on brightness and youthful look on my face.</li>
            <li> Maybe with more long term use I might see a different result</li>
            <li> To make sure it was the toner and not something else, I stopped using the toner for a few days, but continued using the products I had been using and</li>
            <li> My uneven skin looks much better now.</li>
            <li> I have used many toners for different skin issues and this has been the 2nd all natural toner that has helped me with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> It has an interesting scent, I swear it smells like burnt sugar, not the acrid smell, but a sweet faint caramelized sorta scent, I really like that!</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels softer, smoother and more firm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the long term effects are good but after using it for a few days</li>
            <li> not a great smell though but its good</li>
            <li> I feel that my skin looks more clear and my acne blemishes have toned down a bit.</li>
            <li> and I love what it has in it to really prepare my skin not only for the day but for my other skin care</li>
            <li> I have also tried it right after getting out of the pool from swimming laps and again, it made my skin feel tighter and refreshed at the same time.</li>
            <li> This was such a fine mist that it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been in need of a new toner for my face.</li>
            <li> like trying new products</li>
            <li> I also live in</li>
            <li> I also live in</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and I am always on the hunt for a new product to introduce to my clients.</li>
            <li> now I can&#x27;t live without it .It</li>
            <li> I live in the midwest</li>
            <li> This product has also become a new permanent member of my make-up arsenal.</li>
            <li> I do not love the smell (very light mineral smell), or I would give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Review by BonitaBlueEyes contributor for PrairieWifeInHeels.com</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and what it has in it to really prepare my skin not only for the day but for my other skin care</li>
            <li> My skin stays shine free and it&#x27;s a great base layer before I apply a serum</li>
            <li> I like that the scent is very mild, just slightly herbal.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m ready for the next steps in getting my face ready for the day.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m ready for the next steps in getting my face ready for the day.</li>
            <li> I have really been making an effort to take better care of my skin lately since I&#x27;m getting close to forty</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and find that this keeps my face hydrated all</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin, but I use toner mainly to remove any facewash that didn&#x27;t rinse off of my face completely after cleansing.</li>
            <li> The toners I used in my teen years were very drying, so when I was given this product to try &amp; review, I really was not looking forward to trying it.</li>
            <li> It smells very natural and calming, Almost like the Colorado mountains after it rains.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it is very natural.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re guaranteed organic and cruelty-free, which is a pretty big deal to me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Toners are always liquids, and usually in a bottle that you can pour the toner out or a flip top lid.</li>
            <li> Toners are always liquids, and usually in a bottle that you can pour the toner out or a flip top lid.</li>
            <li> sure enough after 3 days the acne went away and has not come back - so it was definitely this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using any type of toner in the past, and wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be of any use to me.  </li>
            <li> I chose the toner first because it was the one thing my admittedly tiny budgeted face care regimen was lacking.</li>
            <li> For those of us that wear makeup or moisturizer daily, what if I told you that there was an anti-aging toner that we should be applying first?</li>
            <li> , most toners that I tried in the past seemed to be designed for oily skin, and mine is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> toner is a primer which simply means it is the first thing you can choose to put on your face, neck or chest areas.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not usually a fan of toners.</li>
            <li> While the other basic toners eliminate the shine and produce a crisp clean feeling the effect goes away after about 1/2 hr and my oily skin reverts to</li>
            <li> This is not your old &amp;#34;sea breeze&amp;#34; from the past, but something much better that preps the face for your serums and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m unsure of any other benefits that it&#x27;s providing on its own apart from other products that I&#x27;m using, including OZ Naturals Eye Gel and OZ Naturals Serum.</li>
            <li> I actually used it one day after a mud mask that irritated my skin to help cool it back down and sooth it some, you can&#x27;t say that about many toners out there since they often do the burning especially if they have alcohol in them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid 60s, and I was pretty unhappy when I saw those lines developing, but not I am HAPPY.</li>
            <li> This 100% natural product is made in the USA and comes in a spray bottle, making it easy to mist over the face and neck as part of a complete skin care regimen and as a little treat for the skin throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I tried the whole collection of OZ Naturals products (because not only are they advertised as being all natural but they are best sellers on Amazon), I was soooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> My fine lines and uneven skin tone are a result of having radiation therapy for cancer.</li>
            <li> A bit drying for skin of a certain age, though it tones it well prior to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It not only felt firmer but areas where my skin was beginning to sag a little had a more lifted appearance.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but in the summer it is hard to keep balanced &amp; looking healthy.</li>
            <li> The scent of this toner was so overwhelming, it was hard to use on my face.</li>
            <li> What I am using this Toner for is to get me away from my previous toner and into an organic/natural product that I know is good for my skin and which will compliment the other OZ facial products I have been using for awhile now.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft now; I believe this is the result of the antioxidants in the toner.  </li>
            <li> Here is the real deal with facial products...</li>
            <li> I was surprised-</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> so far no problem.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have any scrapes, so this surprised me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like spraying it directly on.</li>
            <li> So far, I like what the toner is doing to my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and this spray does not irritate.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t completely cover the freckles.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li> have an established facial care routine that involves a gentle cleanser, followed by an exfoliating product then a serum and</li>
            <li> This one is organic and natural which is something I like to look for as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to overdo all the chemicals on my face because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I think I have tried every toner on the market and this one by far is the nicest.</li>
            <li> And I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I  spray directly from the bottle on my face and neck twice a day.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying another Oz natural product.  </li>
            <li> It soaks into her skin, refreshes her skin and makes her skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial toner.</li>
            <li> the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple formula is very reassuring.  </li>
            <li> (100% natural):  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by the results I am experiencing.  </li>
            <li> , each of these are far better.&lt;br /&gt;Spend</li>
            <li> It really does make one&#x27;s pores smaller</li>
            <li> When I started using this toner, my skin tone became even, no break outs (not even hormonal ones), and my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can use this product without any problems.</li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This facial toner is gentle and works just like witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> having witch hazel in since my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> To my surprise, all of the &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; on my forehead was completely cleared by morning.</li>
            <li> I use a cotton ball as too not waste alot</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, moisturized and balanced.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone looking for natural skin care products.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to redness around my nose and eyes, but this has evened it all out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And to seal the deal, they are USA made, Vegan (no animal testing!), all natural, and the prices can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The area I was concerned with around my eyes has completely resolved.</li>
            <li> I had circles, vertical lines and crows feet; and they are GONE, completely gone....</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how refreshed I felt.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> downside is, you can&#x27;t really tell if it covered entirely or missed the spot (*</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li> while I do like them, I think it is misleading for them to be marked organic.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use this as my base before using Oz Naturals The Best Eye Gel and C Serum.</li>
            <li> The spray is light and dries quickly, but had a mildly unpleasant scent to me and honestly stung a little.</li>
            <li> Every toner usually leaves dry patches on my skin, kind of like eczema.</li>
            <li> I purchased while looking for a product that would help reduce some new vertical aging lines under my eyes, crows feet around the side of my eyes, and a general firming and moisturizing product for my face that would brighten my skin.</li>
            <li> but i find that it absorbs well, a little sticky but helps me clean up residues off my face when I use it after washing my face.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly how my skin feels every single time I use it</li>
            <li> I say this with all the honesty and relief of a 31 year old woman who has been struggling to find a decent face treatment for my combo, occasional acne and blackhead-prone, splotchy face for years:</li>
            <li> I am usually very lazy about writing reviews unless I absolutely love it..</li>
            <li> Clean, refreshed, firm but not tight, and supple.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight mineral odour, which fades quickly.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what OZ says it will do, great base for the rest of the OZ products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use because you can spray it over the face and then let it dry before applying my other  products.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry quicker using the spray bottle so that&#x27;s a positive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and sinks into the skin very fast.</li>
            <li> or so I saw major improvement!</li>
            <li> In all fairness, I don&#x27; think I have had it long to really critique.</li>
            <li> only used a few times, will report back once I finish the product for a better judgement on how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> The toner I was using before was full of harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight and dried out, just nice and refeshed.</li>
            <li> uneven and fine lines/wrinkles are all still the same.</li>
            <li> The net effect is clean, hydrated skin, not stripped or dull, and gently moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and a good base for my other two products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless face products so I am always on the lookout for a new one.</li>
            <li> The product comes out a nice fine mist and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor or take long to absorb.</li>
            <li> So convenient, just spritz it on face and neck, let it dry and your ready for your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have also been using the toner before applying my makeup and my makeup goes on so much smoother now, when your skin is dry</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to return the item, but my only time to go to the post office to return it was the time only after the post office closes, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see in few more weeks when the bottle will be empty.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is super convenient and you don&#x27;t waste valuable product saturating a cotton pad to apply.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this toner is soothing and has no gross perfume odor.</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple of weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes in my skin and that is why I docked it a star.</li>
            <li> I feel more than a little compelled to share with other women and men about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing major.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I tried it again, and I had to wash it off due to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used toner for many years due to enlarged pores and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and can be carried in a handbag for use at any time during the day.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is quite large and will last long, especially due to the fact you only need a squirt or two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Using this face toner during the beauty regime is perhaps a luxury, but not a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Generally don&#x27;t use a toner but was given the opportunity to try this one.  </li>
            <li> You can only smell it when spraying on, it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> It just sinks in the skin so gently.</li>
            <li> It could&#x27;ve been just a leak from the bottle, but the stain looked so yellow and so old like those items piled up in 99 cents store window.</li>
            <li> OZ Natural Facial Tone is an Anti-aging Regimen it Calms my Unbalanced Skin and the wrinkle&#x27;s around my nose and mouth are disappearing.</li>
            <li> Also as mentioned above I have sensitive skin and this has not irritated it at all.</li>
            <li> I am mature and need to keep it properly hydrated in summer.</li>
            <li> Natural products are the only products you should use on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to ask that question until I tried OZ Natural Facial Toner.</li>
            <li> If you are younger- start now and start with OZ Natural Products.</li>
            <li> Currently started using a OZ Natural toner.  </li>
            <li> For an extra kick i use Oz Natural Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I can barely handle the smell and for that reason I probably will not be purchasing it again</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be sprayed on the hands and rubbed onto the face and neck, or you can simply close your eyes and spray the product directly on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I just received this item a few days ago and I am already surprised by how much it brightens my skin when applied!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to copy and paste this review to the products I&#x27;ve listed above to avoid finding a new way to say the same thing!</li>
            <li> Luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t last after it has dried.</li>
            <li> My skin hardly ever drys out, so finding a product that helps serums and my (heavy) moisturizer cream to absorb completely is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> It seems to provide a nice base for spreading the Vitamin C Serum, as the C serum seems to absorb quickly without toner.  </li>
            <li> I do have normally oily skin but use anti-aging products that can tend to leave it on the dry side, so I do like this.</li>
            <li> However usually after cleaning my face it is clean and I don&#x27;t seen any further dirt on the cotton balls/pads.</li>
            <li> However usually after cleaning my face it is clean and I don&#x27;t seen any further dirt on the cotton balls/pads.</li>
            <li> I saw other reviewers said their face broke out too, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it until it happened to me.</li>
            <li> I believe that this tonic, along with my careful and consistent facial care routine have given me the opportunity to truly push back the advancing telltale signs of time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I used the facial toner in the morning and at night hoping for a miracle as I have done with so many other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird to spray your face but it works perfectly and reduces product waste.  </li>
            <li> It definitely lasts a while as I feel I have barely put a dent into the bottle.</li>
            <li> I washed and dried my face first and then applied the Ocean Mineral Tonic.</li>
            <li> I put this on and wow is my facial skin high &amp; tight.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks later, using the tonic twice a day, my skin feels baby smooth and my uneven skin tone due to &amp;#34;pregnancy mask&amp;#34; has diminished.  </li>
            <li> Nothing weird or stinky going on here like some other all natural toners I have tried, just kind of natural and wet smelling.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using the tea tree facial toner from Lush, and I never really felt it did much.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you that it works VERY WELL in conjunction with the other Oz Naturals products!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something more like a witch hazel texture, but this product is somewhat thick and green.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many items this past month and this one has definitely helped to improve my dry skin as well as uneven complexion.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a couple cheap things a year, use half a bottle, see no results, and toss it in a drawer.</li>
            <li> These three ingredients (along with a plethora of other natural ingredients such as ocean minerals, jojoba oil, aloe vera, ginseng, and chamomile) are combined in OZ Naturals‚Äô Ocean Mineral Tonic.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out &amp; made me look even older.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Start breathing life back into your dry, damaged skin by healing your cells with OZ Naturals Facial</li>
            <li> Right now I have been using it for about a little less than a month</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, just still have not used it long enough to know if I will purchase again</li>
            <li> There really is no other word to describe how my skin felt other than refreshed.</li>
            <li> I knew that I was supposed to use it before using a mask to open my pores, and after cleansing to remove any excess oils, but I never really felt that I was getting results, and I wondered if toners were actually necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> My skin is showing a definite improvement, and I have hardly used the product because it goes on so smoothly, that you need very little.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner it does not make my skin feel too tight and works well under the other oz products I have used</li>
            <li> In general my skin looks and feels smoother - probably due to the glycolic acid I&#x27;m guessing.</li>
            <li> The creases are much more shallow, smoother, and less noticeable after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> With a blend of amino acids, ocean minerals, vitamin C, and glycolic acid, this toner refreshes your skin when worn under daily makeup or other facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be hard for me to discern exactly how the toner actually works, since I use in conjunction with the other products</li>
            <li> I have combo skin, leaning towards dry - especially in the winter, and this toner doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all or greasy in the slightest.</li>
            <li> This product replaced my plain old witch hazel!  </li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the smell, but it isn&#x27;t any worse than other similar facial products.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never quite appreciated the need for a toner.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never been much for toners.</li>
            <li> other thing that makes me like this over other natural toners I have used is that it comes in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> other thing that makes me like this over other natural toners I have used is that it comes in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this toner for as long as OZ Naturals makes it.</li>
            <li> are it was strange smells</li>
            <li> I will update my review if my observations change over long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am  41 years old with combination normal/oily skin and uneven skin tones.  </li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks now, noticeable drying effect on mature skin.</li>
            <li> I have never really used toner regularly before, I have tried some a couple of times and did not feel they were working so under the sink they went to the beauty regimen graveyard.</li>
            <li> It is a good base for after you&#x27;ve cleansed the skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin (like me) or just want to have soft, hydrated skin, try applying it while your skin is still a little damp.</li>
            <li> The Toner is getting 4 Stars ONLY because I don&#x27;t have problematic skin ( no blemishes, no sensitivity, no large pores).  </li>
            <li> When I received this package I was so excited, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to my sister, daughter, and several other friends.</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep for a toner-like item, however it does seem to last a lot longer when compared to the toner I still use twice daily.</li>
            <li> In addition, I do think it has helped my skin brighten up a little bit - it is not extreme - but it is noticeable.</li>
            <li> You just spray and wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> let it dry.</li>
            <li> Just wash, dry, then spray this onto your face and swipe it around with a couple of cotton balls.</li>
            <li> My Winter dry skin has thanked me using this product</li>
            <li> so when I get out of the shower (which is where I wash my face) I can dab my face dry with my towel and then spray this on.</li>
            <li> I then towel dry the rest of my body, take my AM medicine, put on lip balm and then start working on my face.</li>
            <li> so when I get out of the shower (which is where I wash my face) I can dab my face dry with my towel and then spray this on.</li>
            <li> I then towel dry the rest of my body, take my AM medicine, put on lip balm and then start working on my face.</li>
            <li> If you have issues with dry skin or rosacea</li>
            <li> It was scaly and dry around the eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> and it is dry.</li>
            <li> I use it to hydrate my make-up during the day since I do suffer from dry skin, my make-up tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> Added this to the mix and my combo skin got too dry.</li>
            <li> This toner makes your face feel refreshed and like your skin is tightening up when it starts to dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have as much dry skin as I did to start with.</li>
            <li> Hydrates my dry and oily skin</li>
            <li> I wipe a 2% salicylic acid over my face before I spritz and then allow to air dry before I apply serum for the day.</li>
            <li> I spray my face with this twice a day after I let it dry</li>
            <li> My skin used to be dry, but now it isn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients such as ocean minerals, vitamin C, Witch Hazel and active plant extracts definitely do the job they promise to all buyers.</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in my face too, no pimples (but i only used to get a few occasionally) and I feel like it has also helped the redness in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I figured I had nothing to loose but dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has a slight strange smell but it only lasts a minute until it dries.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found other less expensive products that do a much better job.</li>
            <li> I  usually don&#x27;t use a toner but am sold on this product and all the oz natural products.</li>
            <li> For the first few minutes my skin felt a little tight.  </li>
            <li> I have a very clear complexion and hardly get pimples.</li>
            <li> I purchased this several months back with a few other OZ products.</li>
            <li> I also had  some slight hyper pigmentation which is slowly starting to improve.</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks, no big change, just a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> but, I do not particularly like the smell.</li>
            <li> It replenishes and restores your skin to a softer, supple, and radiant skin that will feel like you just stepped out of having a facial treatment but for less the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I also spray after makeup, my skin has become very dry during this winter and this helps a lot...</li>
            <li> I do like this product, more so on less muggy days.  </li>
            <li> I spray a little on my face after washing it, then I put on moisturizer next.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on skin but tough on signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like spraying it on my face and letting it dry before applying my other beauty products.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to give a bad review because I love what this company stands for...</li>
            <li> do these awful products get great reviews?</li>
            <li> I have used it twice a day for app 4 months, absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I get the same benefits without using harsh chemicals on my body.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely do NOT regret getting this product.</li>
            <li> Keep them closed.</li>
            <li> and although I&#x27;ve added a few lately; I definitely don&#x27;t do them all YET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Astringents, tighten the skin, shrink pores, and remove oil, and fresheners work similarly to astringents to firm up the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to toss it, it serves absolutely no purpose.</li>
            <li> In addition to witch hazel extract, the formula contains aloe juice, glycolic acid, and various fatty acids to help protect the skin from loss of moisture as well as minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and a host of botanical extracts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve tried toner before, but never really have figured out why.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected ...</li>
            <li> That being said, I HATE wasting money on this kind of stuff, so for this product...</li>
            <li> plain and simple.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong and unpleasant that I cannot use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review products unless I have used them for a few weeks or at least a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Thats not a positive thing</li>
            <li> The dark rings under my eyes have faded a lot, my uneven tones are starting to even out</li>
            <li> Little goes long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have any overpowering fragrance or any at all, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day</li>
            <li> Other than that I do believe it helps my moisturizer  </li>
            <li> Does not make my skin oily like some other toners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used other products with acids like glycolic acid before you&#x27;ll recognize the scent.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the cleanser, and couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed with both products.</li>
            <li> All the other product I buy from OZ has a seal on the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a toner that didn&#x27;t contain Salicylic Acid (willow bark) or SD Alcohol and other drying ingredients for a while.</li>
            <li> I had to conclude these results were due to Oz Naturals toner.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I thought it had a weird smell, but now I crave using this toner, my skin just loves it for some reason.</li>
            <li> After using it twice daily for a week now, I&#x27;m not sure how I lived without it.</li>
            <li> It also increases absorption and efficacy of other products like eye cream, serum or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Oz Naturals Ocean Mineral Tonic is a spray containing, among other ingredients, glycolic acid, MSM, and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I have been using an organic coconut spray toner, so didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like this toner over the other.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other products from Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying other products</li>
            <li> I use this faithfully and have no plans to hunt for other brand products.</li>
            <li> This is a toner unlike any other I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I dig is that this is a spray and not a splash on like other toners.</li>
            <li> It has a watery feel and it smells slightly acid, not much</li>
            <li> I have combination of dry and oily skin with uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals Facial Toner is designed to deliver anti-aging results in as little as little one week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for less than a week</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle in my purse and find it a quick refresher on nasty, hot and humid days.</li>
            <li> Regardless the cap tightly being closed, I kept getting some dark greenish dusts around the spraying area.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is the scent.</li>
            <li> I read that this product contains organic sulphur which probably accounts for the smell I dislike, however the smell is not so intense that I am unable to use.  </li>
            <li> Love how this product is used a base toner, on-top-of make-up during the day or can be used all the body for the glow.</li>
            <li> It slows down your aging process for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just soothes my skin and prepares it for my other OZ products!</li>
            <li> it has very funny, unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> so I use less make up now.  </li>
            <li> I also use it with previously purchased</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s not super fragrant.</li>
            <li> Results seen in less than 7 days.</li>
            <li> I stand by my previous review for myself.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I use less product with my follow up skincare than I did before I started using this.</li>
            <li> I notice my pores are less visible and my skin is clearer than ever before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use, but decided as winter approaches to use it.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, brighter and I&#x27;m experiencing less break outs.</li>
            <li> and if you even had slightly oily skin it reduces that.  </li>
            <li> but I have noticed that my face feels cleaner and less</li>
            <li> I have less break-outs of acne</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays wherever it feels dry and cracked or anywhere you feel needs a little toning!</li>
            <li> If you have dull and dry face</li>
            <li> I have always used witch hazel, but lately it leaves my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> it seemed it was just a little too drying for my skin -</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about spraying this on my face after putting my contacts in but the witch hazel doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> The toner is a little bit sticky but it can do because I put make up on</li>
            <li> I get a little exfoliation from using this on a damp cotton</li>
            <li> Maybe if I add a little rosewater.....</li>
            <li> I found them smell to be a little unpleasant at first, like witch hazel.</li>
            <li> It has an unpleasant smell and the first week</li>
            <li> You take off the lid and spray a few sprays on your face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any sort of film left behind.</li>
            <li> I started using  OZ naturals few months ago, works well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how I felt just a few days in when I saw changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> ( I combine it with the OZ Naturals serum) and my uneven skin tone have diminished significantly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, once it dried the smell disappated.</li>
            <li> I did end up using up all the bottle because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money</li>
            <li> This way it stays off my hair, and not any is wasted.  </li>
            <li> I am 32 but have thin skin and spent many years working in the sun, and was considering fillers for the ever deepening lines from my nose to the outer edges of my mouth because of how they were aging me and making me look tired and unhappy.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for approximately two weeks in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on thins product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a day</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily, and I mean OILY.</li>
            <li> , it‚Äôs way faster to use than a cotton round, (that‚Äôs what I usually use).</li>
            <li> My concern is trying to slow down the wrinkle process, providing nourishment to the cells, help with some brown spots and to brighten the skin.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dark spots and uneven skin tone for years!!</li>
            <li> I have slightly dry skin as it is but these products made it 10 times worse.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t last as long when I break out nor does it get quite as bad as it did before.</li>
            <li> I have not been someone who used toner in the past</li>
            <li> but I usually prefer scent-free products so it could be just me.</li>
            <li> With ordinary primer my face tends to look &amp;#34;makeup-Ey&amp;#34; and with this spray, it just looks smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to tell if it is working.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried any toner in the past.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if my bottle has a defective spray</li>
            <li> I had been using Obagi for the past year but thought i would give this a try.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave your skins oily or sticky like some I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what a toner is supposed to do</li>
            <li> It seems to provide me with a dewy look under my make up, which I am also not sure if I like or not.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been dryer this winter than it ever has in the past</li>
            <li> I have noticed my face isn&#x27;t oily as it has been in the past.</li>
            <li> I had clogged pores on my nose and chin along with small break outs on my chin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, not my favorite toner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can only give it 3 stars because it is listed as &amp;#34;organic skin toner&amp;#34; and it is not organic.</li>
            <li> This toner is definitely a must have base for anyone‚Äôs anti aging daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works (hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing anything).</li>
            <li> It has always been hard for me to find products that work on me</li>
            <li> I like it, but my spray is really hard and in a stream.  </li>
            <li> It is a hard to describe smell</li>
            <li> I use this at least 2 times a day after washing and again after makeup to set it.</li>
            <li> After I shake the bottle I close my eyes and spray at least 4 times my face and neck area.</li>
            <li> I recommend you at least try this once and see the effects yourself.</li>
            <li> This toner has a complex herbal fragrance dominated by witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> I mean, what company does that these days?  </li>
            <li> Worthless product despite of a high review.</li>
            <li> My facial skin feels very uncomfortable after using this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously???</li>
            <li> Its use is to be used as a base layer for your everyday facial serums and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have one MAJOR COMPLAINT-IT STINKS!</li>
            <li> It feels a little unfair to give this product a 3 stars, however I&#x27;m reviewing this based off my experience.</li>
            <li> After a week of spritzing the toner on my face and neck as a base for my other products,  I noticed my skin was less &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy on your face!!!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant that this product would make a difference and that it was an unnecessary step.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to the OZ Vitamin C</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is meant to be a base for regular moisturizer</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to like this product, but the smell is just awful!</li>
            <li> Not a happy paying customer.</li>
            <li> My skin which was broken out has been clearing up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the look-out for a product that somehow makes my face feel less oily, and this product has helped!!!!</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with any of my OZ Naturals products and will continue to this toner along with my other products.</li>
            <li> I have never had those, so needless to say, it ruined my day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say</li>
            <li> The product felt uncomfortable...</li>
            <li> there is no alcohol in this at all unless it&#x27;s under some weird name</li>
            <li> and u kinda go blind to the sent if u keep using it.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell, and please use a sunscreen after using this since it can stain your face</li>
            <li> If anything the smell is weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, am tossing it and will be on the hunt for another toner.</li>
            <li> Sorry Oz, but you missed a mark on this</li>
            <li> in just one week I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would breakout my skin with it</li>
            <li> But I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> - I thought that meant they are working and was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> the smell was so bad..</li>
            <li> I tried it, it caused my face a really bad allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This toner smells bad &amp; does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I broke out so badly from using the ocean minerals cleanser, the tonic &amp; retinol</li>
            <li> are you are person who hates bad smells</li>
            <li> Click on this link: [...]</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I would hate for someone to break out like I did based on my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toner is the base of serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it&#x27;s very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff STINKS!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the product I recieved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they have fake reviews !!!</li>

            <li> Awful product, burned my face.</li>

            <li> Nice, refreshing mist that tones skin! I spray it on my decolettage too before I moisturize!</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a difference when I started using OZ Naturals Ocean Mineral Tonic.  I could feel my skin tightening, but it was not uncomfortable.  It made my anti-aging serum and skin cremes glide on.  2 weeks later, using the tonic twice a day, my skin feels baby smooth and my uneven skin tone due to &amp;#34;pregnancy mask&amp;#34; has diminished.  I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments!  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use the product.  I do not love the smell (very light mineral smell), or I would give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Review by BonitaBlueEyes contributor for PrairieWifeInHeels.com</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It is so refreshing and light.  The fragrance is pleasant too.  What I like the best is what it does for my skin.  After using the toner I apply the vitamin C serum and then the moisturizer. Both of these products soak into my skin much better than they did prior to my using the toner.  My skin is so soft now; I believe this is the result of the antioxidants in the toner.  I have not been someone who used toner in the past but this product has made a believer out of me. My skin tone is more even so I use less make up now.  This is a great addition to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> In all fairness, I don&#x27; think I have had it long to really critique. So, I will go on and review  how I feel to date. I do have to say it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have the greatest smell. You can only smell it when spraying on, it&#x27;s natural so I am sure that&#x27;s why. It absorbs quickly. I thought I saw a difference in the 11&#x27;s between the eyes, but they showed back up and brought the marionette lines with them. I have never had those, so needless to say, it ruined my day. The,claim is that this toner is considered the &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; for anti-aging. I have to say in my case, it is far from the best...my quest goes on.</li>
            <li> I have asian skin.. and this is not working for me at alll. I have used it twice a day for app 4 months, absolutely no results. I&#x27;m sorry to say but i got fooled by all those who got bribed to write a good review</li>
            <li> I had previously been using the tea tree facial toner from Lush, and I never really felt it did much. I knew that I was supposed to use it before using a mask to open my pores, and after cleansing to remove any excess oils, but I never really felt that I was getting results, and I wondered if toners were actually necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I guess I just wasn&#x27;t using the right toner because after using this one, my face felt so dewy and fresh that my skin felt 10 years younger. I used it with the retinol face moisturizer from the same brand and have been seeing excellent results. While I received a sample for review purposes, I&#x27;m so impressed with this whole line of products that I will continue purchasing them and am exploring the other things they have on offer. I like that they are paraben free and use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> OMG I love it!! It just sinks in the skin so gently. It dries up in seconds then I apply whatever product I need to apply or my makeup and its so smooth. It feels great and gives a really smooth surface to work on when applying it before makeup. Right now I have been using it for about a little less than a month and I am pleased. OZ Naturals has got some great products. I will repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good toner I love the fact that is in a spray form and it does this appear very fast in the skin I do recommend</li>
            <li> Love to spritz this on twice a day...so refreshing!</li>
            <li> Great deliveryexperience andlove the product</li>
            <li> Really nice feeling going on! You just spray and wait for it to dry. I love OZ Naturals products!</li>
            <li> Here is the real deal with facial products...You really have to trial and error to get a system that is right for your skin...plain and simple. That being said, I HATE wasting money on this kind of stuff, so for this product...I would say that putting some water in a mist bottle and spraying your face before moisturizing would absolutely be just as efficient. The idea is that the skin will better absorb whatever you apply to the skin if applied while the skin is still moist...btw, ewww, what a gross word...moist! :)</li>
            <li> This product has witch hazel. I know some of you are like what is witch hazel. Well it is a ingredient that will help with breaking out.  You take off the lid and spray a few sprays on your face let it dry. Then put it on your skin after you have done the oz naturals facial toner the vit c serum. Then after that you take the naturals facial moisturizer on. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!  Make sure when you apply anything you are doing upward and outward motions on your face. If you do downwards well you will start sagging sooner than you would like too. It is vegan free. When you have been using this for a weeks or so you will notice your skin texture feeling smoother.  I do highly suggest getting all three product to get the best benefit out of the products.  The does have a smell of witch hazel but I liked the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Smells like water, feels like water, results like water....</li>
            <li> Never have used toner, but this one is great. Thank you Oz</li>
            <li> Received OZ Naturals Toner yesterday,used it as I was preparing for work. Very easy to apply, can&#x27;t wait to see the difference this going to have on my skin. Will be adding more as I have used it longer to see results.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was on time</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Main pros:&lt;br /&gt;- evened out skin tone&lt;br /&gt;- got rid of acne blemishes&lt;br /&gt;- very neutral smell&lt;br /&gt;- dries out like water on your skin so you feel nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this with same brand hyaluronic acid serum - this combo is magical.&lt;br /&gt;It comes as spray so easy to apply. Little goes long way.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh feeling of this toner when I spritz it on my facial area. It is so refreshing and leaves my face with a clean feeling. I use it before applying my moisturizer and sometimes I spritz it on after applying my makeup. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy residue. My skin stays shine free and it&#x27;s a great base layer before I apply a serum and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I received complimentary product in exhchange for a review.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner it does not make my skin feel too tight and works well under the other oz products I have used</li>
            <li> This toner is pretty great! I love the way it seems to help pull toxins from my skin...even after I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve got it clean, this helps! I also really love the spray nozzle for this toner...So easy. Just wash, dry, then spray this onto your face and swipe it around with a couple of cotton balls. After that, I apply my favorite serums and moisturizers, and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love OZ Naturals products. They&#x27;re guaranteed organic and cruelty-free, which is a pretty big deal to me! They also guarantee your satisfaction...You really WILL see results within the first 7 days!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for a couple of weeks now and absolutely LOVE it! It has all natural ingredients, no harmful chemicals, and has a very clean, pleasant smell. I spray it directly onto my skin after cleaning and it leaves my skin very refreshed and ready for my nighttime serum or day time make up routine. I noticed that my pores are visibly smaller and the serum and the lotion I use right after work much better since the toner itself has tons of great stuff in it. Amazing product! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I had been using Clinique&#x27;s Clarifying Lotion for years as my toner step, but once I hit my 40&#x27;s it seemed it was just a little too drying for my skin - so I&#x27;ve spent the past several years looking for the perfect replacement....and I am loving the OzNaturals Facial Toner.  I am a big Witch Hazel fan, so I&#x27;m happy that&#x27;s a prominent ingredient (but was surprised that the ingredient list - while natural/organic - is so long!!).  I use this toner after washing my face, then follow up with my derma roller, serum, moisturizer and eye cream. It&#x27;s really soothing and the pump applicator is fantastic --- I like that so much better than the open bottle/cotton ball method.  I have combo skin, leaning towards dry - especially in the winter, and this toner doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all or greasy in the slightest. It&#x27;s just the right balance of ingredients to leave me with a nice dewy, youthful glow! The pump also makes it easy to take along with you and use on those days when your makeup needs a quick spritz refresher. I received this in order to give my honest feedback, but I have already added it to my wish list on here to buy again when I am out of it.  This is just another great product in the OzNaturals line of products I&#x27;ve been impressed with!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and Pleasant. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I have tried this facial toner all week and this ocean mineral tonic toner is a great anti aging vitamin C toner that claims to provide a healthy, youthful glow. I have tried many items this past month and this one has definitely helped to improve my dry skin as well as uneven complexion. The moment you wash your face with this toner, you will feel the product going deep into the underlying areas of the pores and skin and rejuvenating them with every wash. I love that the product comes as a spray and is easy to use. The fragrance is nice and not overbearing and the texture on your face seems to dissolve in less than a minute to have you ready to go. The product is able to be used prior to applying makeup or after and I have found it works either way. My skin immediately felt more youthful and rejuvenated with the first spray. I have continued using this product and have noticed people saying that they see a difference in my face without me even asking them. I love that this toner is organic and not tested on animals as well. This is very important for an animal lover like myself. I care also about what products go on my skin so to know this is safe for all skin types makes me feel confident about what I am letting touch my body.The toner Is easy to take with you on the go and the fact I can spray it on the go makes it easier as well. I am always running around so a quick spritz to refresh and I am back to feeling good again and taking care of my skin for the future. The active ingredients such as ocean minerals, vitamin C, Witch Hazel and active plant extracts definitely do the job they promise to all buyers. I was not disappointed. This should last quite awhile too if used only once or twice daily. OZ Naturals guarantees within 7 days you will see changes! The OZ Naturals facial toner is made in the US and is Dermatologist grade. This is satisfaction guaranteed! My Winter dry skin has thanked me using this product and I think you should give your face a new chance at rejuvenation as well!at rejuvenation as well!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Spray it all over your face (I use 3 sprites) and apply your tonic afterwords. Tastes just like salt.</li>
            <li> I have used toner for many years due to enlarged pores and uneven skin tone.  The toner I was using before was full of harsh chemicals but it did a good job at evening skin tone so I continued using it anyways.  I am glad that I received this toner for review because it is a great toner.  I get the same benefits without using harsh chemicals on my body.  I love that it is organic and its better for me, while giving me great looking skin.  My skin looks healthy and vibrant, my pores are smaller in appearance and my fine lines on my forehead seem to be filling in more.</li>
            <li> I have to admit- I was a bit hesitant that this product would make a difference and that it was an unnecessary step.  I am addicted to the OZ Vitamin C Serum- but when combined with this Toner- it increased the strength and results. I was surprised- which by now I shouldn&#x27;t be. Every product from OZ- has surpassed my expectations. I noticed results after using the toner consistently twice a day for 3 days. For those who are on the fence about purchasing this product- please do so- you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Have only used for a week but I love that its a spray that I can spray so easily on my face, neck &amp; chest. So much easier than a toner &amp; a cotton ball.  Like some say it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty because it is all natural.  Its not a terrible smell &amp; its not a smell that lingers.  I love that its natural :)</li>
            <li> This toner is very refreshing, and I have seen a reduction in the size of my pores. I have very sensitive skin, and this toner is soothing and has no gross perfume odor.</li>
            <li> Wow. These oz naturals folks really know what they are doing. I have sensitive dry skin and so far the products are wonderful. The toner is true to form and really works well .love that their products are organic. Means alot to me in my pursuit of trying to improve the health of my 58 yr old skin!!!!         .</li>
            <li> I think the toner itself is good, but I gave two star because I didn&#x27;t like how the bottle came unselaed and it leaked. I wouldn&#x27;t purchse this product again for that reason.</li>
            <li> This facial toner is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased to review this product for OZ Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;The toner has a pleasant scent and is 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;Use this as a primer for serums or all over your body for toning. You can also spray over make up throughout the day to refresh your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I find this spray to be refreshing and not oily at all. I follow this toner with OZ Naturals Hyarulonic Acid Serum and they work very well together.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using this product, I have been told that I am positively glowing. My skin feels firmer and looks brighter.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sun damage, fine lines or uneven skin tone, this is a great product to use.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! This product messed up my face so bad!! From the moment I got this item, I didn&#x27;t feel right about it. The box had stain that looked like it&#x27;s been there for years and years. It could&#x27;ve been just a leak from the bottle, but the stain looked so yellow and so old like those items piled up in 99 cents store window. I really really wanted to return the item, but my only time to go to the post office to return it was the time only after the post office closes, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Regardless the cap tightly being closed, I kept getting some dark greenish dusts around the spraying area. Wiping it off every time was not the problem. The problem was, the more I used this product, it worsened my face. I have a very clear complexion and hardly get pimples. Not only was I getting stressed out from it, my parents were concerned because of the pimples blossoming on my face. I thought maybe I was going through a hormonal change. But one day, I was way too bothered by the greenish dusts, I decided to open the whole bottle and clean it from the inside. As I opened the bottle,,,, OMG!!!! there was fungus growing inside!!!! I&#x27;ve been applying fungus every night and so I was getting all these pimples on my face. Seriously??? Be aware guys! I don&#x27;t know how well this product works, but I was an ogre while using this product. Thank goodness, ever since I stopped using this product, my face cleared up again. My friend and I bought OZ naturals vitamin C serum along with this product, but we didn&#x27;t see any results, so we are not planning on buying this product again. Especially me, I&#x27;m NEVER using this product again!</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about spraying this on my face after putting my contacts in but the witch hazel doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. I use this as my base before using Oz Naturals The Best Eye Gel and C Serum. This will be of great use during the hot Florida summers to refresh my face.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel as if you just swam in the ocean.  Very salty skin toner.  I spray my face after I cleans.  It is refreshing.</li>
            <li> so far no problem. I use it every other day so there is not too much exfoliation for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It has such amazing reviews, but I swear, it is just salty and gross and it makes my skin break-out. And my skin isn&#x27;t even picky. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjunction with OZ Naturals Retinol Moisturizer and had similar experiences with both products. The spray is light and dries quickly, but had a mildly unpleasant scent to me and honestly stung a little. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t have any scrapes, so this surprised me. After it had a few minutes to sit it stopped and my skin did feel nice, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This toner tightens my skin and makes my skin look nice and smooth! Its filled with all kinds of amazing and natural ingredients. This product would be great to take with you on the go during the summer! Just a few sprays wherever it feels dry and cracked or anywhere you feel needs a little toning! Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. It smells great and feels hydrating on my skin. I do have normally oily skin but use anti-aging products that can tend to leave it on the dry side, so I do like this. I don&#x27;t feel any sort of film left behind. It did however remind me what a toner is really for...getting rid of leftover makeup!! Vitamin C generally brightens the skin and makes it appear more glowy and radiant, so when I found a toner that is vitamin C based, I was so excited.  i use the oz naturals mask before and then i apply this toner. they work great together and my skin shows it.  I always moisturize afterwards. and it smells like the ocean. i also noticed my husband has been using it too and he loves it as well.  I feel like this does balance my skin a lot, will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;i received a free sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> I bought this toner in conjunction with the Vitamin C Serum. I also use it with previously purchased Vitamin C cleanser and sea minerals moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now. It would be hard for me to discern exactly how the toner actually works, since I use in conjunction with the other products but I can tell you that it works VERY WELL in conjunction with the other Oz Naturals products!! It&#x27;s refreshing-although I suppose anything in spritzed on the face would.... I have one MAJOR COMPLAINT-IT STINKS! So the smell actually takes away from the experience. I will still give it 4 stars for quality. In addition, I have noticed that it works GREAT on pimples (in other parts of the body as well). Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, tightens my skin. I started using  OZ naturals few months ago, works well. I wake up with a fresh face and then after the morning facial routine it&#x27;s another layer on brightness and youthful look on my face.</li>
            <li> The Toner is getting 4 Stars ONLY because I don&#x27;t have problematic skin ( no blemishes, no sensitivity, no large pores).  What I am using this Toner for is to get me away from my previous toner and into an organic/natural product that I know is good for my skin and which will compliment the other OZ facial products I have been using for awhile now. My concern is trying to slow down the wrinkle process, providing nourishment to the cells, help with some brown spots and to brighten the skin. I have noticed another level of brightness to my skin and I believe the Toner is boosting the Vit C allowing for another level of brightening and I know with the great ingredients of the product ( glycolic acid, the vits and amino acids) they are all helping the Vit A serum, the HA serum, the great eye gel (that I use all over my face for the fine lines in the cheek areas) to penetrate and go deeper. I apply my toner by spraying 2 pumps into the palm of my hand and then spread it quickly with my finger tips... this is the method I have always used as putting it on a cotton pad seems wasteful and I don&#x27;t like spraying it directly on.</li>
            <li> taste a little salty but good stuff</li>
            <li> Toner works great along with the serums I use during the day and night. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I have been using the OZ Naturals vitamin c face wash and vitamin c serum and have just added this wonderful toner product to my daily routine. I was so excited to try it and I was very pleased when I did. I washed my face with my OZ Naturals face wash then spritzed my skin with the OZ Naturals toner. It went on very light and made my skin feel really fresh and clean. It has a slight strange smell but it only lasts a minute until it dries. Once the toner dries you can&#x27;t tell you even put anything on except that your face feels fresh. After using the toner I put on my vitamin c serum and my skin felt amazing!! I have very sensitive skin that breaks out very easily. It has always been hard for me to find products that work on me and now I finally have!! I have never been disappointed with any of my OZ Naturals products and will continue to this toner along with my other products. I especially love that this toner is anti-aging, 100% natural, cruelty-free, vegan, does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is PH balanced which makes it safe for all skin types, which is almost impossible to find all of that in one product. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I definitely recommend this product and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> So far, I like what the toner is doing to my face. It obviously is not a miracle worker but i find that it absorbs well, a little sticky but helps me clean up residues off my face when I use it after washing my face. The only negative I can think of is the scent. I can&#x27;t quite describe it but I usually prefer scent-free products so it could be just me.</li>
            <li> I have been in need of a new toner for my face. I am currently using more natural products because it is the best for the skin. I love this product. The one thing I do not like is the spray pump. I don&#x27;t like spraying anything on my face. Other than that I do believe it helps my moisturizer  seep deeper into my skin (like the product claims to do). I also like that it&#x27;s not super fragrant. Also, if you spray too much in the mouth area it tastes like salt water. This product absorbs very quickly as well</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It feels fresh and light, and my skin has been very clear. I like that the scent is very mild, just slightly herbal. I&#x27;ve never used toner before so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other ones, but its pretty awesome that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> This spray is very nice! I received this at discount for my opinion and have been using it daily for almost a month now. It has a light feel yet it primes my skin nicely for my makeup after I moisturiZe. It smells like salt air from the ocean. My skin is sensitive and this spray does not irritate. It&#x27;s a nice alternative to a cream primer. I have freckles and use mineral makeup so I don&#x27;t completely cover the freckles. With ordinary primer my face tends to look &amp;#34;makeup-Ey&amp;#34; and with this spray, it just looks smoother. It also can be used to set makeup after applied, which I sometimes do and the makeup has stayed on longer</li>
            <li> my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li> I like this as a toner,  I reuse on no makeup days throughout the day.  I&#x27;m not sure how to tell if it is working.  I like the ingredients though.  I have really liked every Oz Naturals product I have tried.  I did a ton of research before deciding on this one.  My family says my skin looks brighter, so maybe.....</li>
            <li> I like this toner. I like that it is natural. The only thing is that leaves my skin a bit dry, but I use serum right after and it feels good.</li>
            <li> I was not at all pleased with this product. It smelled like pure witch hazel, a cheap astringent that can purchased via any retail store.  The product felt uncomfortable...stinging and sticky on my facial skin.  I would not recommend this product...and I will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oz Naturals Facial Toner along with the Super Youth Moisturizer, and Vitamin C Serum and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. What I enjoyed most was the results I experienced within little over a week of use. I used the facial toner in the morning and at night hoping for a miracle as I have done with so many other products I have tried in the past. I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how I felt just a few days in when I saw changes in my skin. It not only felt firmer but areas where my skin was beginning to sag a little had a more lifted appearance. Thinking I must be imagining it I took a selfie and texted it to my sister. She wrote back, &amp;#34;Cute pic. Your face looks different, more youthful. What did you do to it?&amp;#34; I told her about Oz Naturals and she was impressed. Well that was all I needed. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use Oz Natural products because they have not let me down and have given me hope for a more youthful appearance. Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> Shrinks pores and clears up mild acne.  It would be great if this is available on subscribe.</li>
            <li> Love this and all oz natural products</li>
            <li> OZ Natural Facial Tone is an Anti-aging Regimen it Calms my Unbalanced Skin and the wrinkle&#x27;s around my nose and mouth are disappearing. The toner Feels great and works well after washing the skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this toner makes my face feel! Instantly softer! I have always used witch hazel, but lately it leaves my face feeling dry. The gycolic acid and vitamin c feed my face. I use this at least 2 times a day after washing and again after makeup to set it. I&#x27;ve always used Evian facial spray to set makeup but this mineral tonic definelty adds an extra boost! Instantly refreshing :)</li>
            <li> I have received this product for free, in return for my HONEST review. I have suffered from Acne almost all my life it feels like. Using this product my skin tone looks more radiant and soft without making it feel oily. Finally my skin has a bright appearance. Great Product.</li>
            <li> Finally, it&#x27;s here - alcohol-free toner! Youthful glow almost instant. Results seen in less than 7 days. Love how this product is used a base toner, on-top-of make-up during the day or can be used all the body for the glow. Leaves you with a refreshingly clean feel. My favorite!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to experience this product by the company.  They gave me a full size product for free for the purpose of testing and reviewing it, giving only my own thoughtful and honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have an established facial care routine that involves a gentle cleanser, followed by an exfoliating product then a serum and finally, a moisturizer.  The OZ Naturals Ocean Mineral Tonic with Glycolic Acid, MSM and Vitamin C is meant to be used immediately prior to the application of any Serum and again as needed throughout the day, over makeup for a refreshing lift. It is also an excellent all over body tonic.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I noticed that my serum was easily absorbed! After 7 days of use, I could see a brightening of my skin and now, 3 weeks into my daily routine with the OZ Naturals Tonic, I am ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH IT!  It hydrates my skin, refreshes my makeup mid day and is my go to product from here on out. My fine lines and uneven skin tone are a result of having radiation therapy for cancer. My skin is showing great signs of premature aging and I am only 44. I believe that this tonic, along with my careful and consistent facial care routine have given me the opportunity to truly push back the advancing telltale signs of time.&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence about the usefulness of a tonic, I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> My review is based on 11 weeks usage.&lt;br /&gt;The product feels fresh when you spray it on your face. It does have a slight mineral odour, which fades quickly. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and sinks into the skin very fast. It is easy to apply and can be carried in a handbag for use at any time during the day.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is quite large and will last long, especially due to the fact you only need a squirt or two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Using this face toner during the beauty regime is perhaps a luxury, but not a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;My eldest daughter (23), who often helps to review the skincare products did experience a hypersensitivity to it in combination with the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on both my face and neck. I can see an improvement in texture, my skin seems firmer and the overall tone appears more balanced and even.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company, for purposes of review.</li>
            <li> Love the OZ products Natural and good for my skin</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this toner is that it&#x27;s in a spray bottle - genius!  No cotton pads to bother with.  It&#x27;s a little weird to spray your face but it works perfectly and reduces product waste.  I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for 3 months (nightly) and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I love the way this toner makes my skin feel!! I wake up with right beautiful skin ( I combine it with the OZ Naturals serum) and my uneven skin tone have diminished significantly!&lt;br /&gt;I love all the products I&#x27;ve tried from them so far.&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliater, the serum, undereye serum, and face wash</li>
            <li> Simple to Use. I like it!!</li>
            <li> I love this toner because my skin is SUPER oily in the summer even if I took a shower 15 minutes ago in a dry climate. I also had  some slight hyper pigmentation which is slowly starting to improve. I am glad I chose to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Update 7/23/15: My daughter has found this product in my stash of beauty products and loves the smell and the way it feels on her as a toner. She has asked if she could take over using it or have me purchase her own bottle so I am letting her finish off mine before buying one. She is 15 and going through those changes that makes her skin break out and more sensitive to products and she likes how this one is cooling and refreshing without burning her skin like some other products do. I stand by my previous review for myself. I just wanted to add in what she thought of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous review:&lt;br /&gt;I like trying new products and I am always on the lookout for a toner that is not going to burn me during use so I was interested in trying this toner for free* to review. This one is organic and natural which is something I like to look for as well. I don&#x27;t like to overdo all the chemicals on my face because I have sensitive skin. After using this for a couple of weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes in my skin and that is why I docked it a star. Maybe with more long term use I might see a different result but I didn&#x27;t see the 7 day guarantee...my skin is still uneven and fine lines/wrinkles are all still the same. Though I don&#x27;t have a lot to get rid of now is the time to start working on them right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like with this toner is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, this one is so light I can&#x27;t describe it other than pleasant. Nothing weird or stinky going on here like some other all natural toners I have tried, just kind of natural and wet smelling. Also as mentioned above I have sensitive skin and this has not irritated it at all. When you have sensitive skin no reaction is a good reaction! I actually used it one day after a mud mask that irritated my skin to help cool it back down and sooth it some, you can&#x27;t say that about many toners out there since they often do the burning especially if they have alcohol in them. Best I can reading the ingredients there is no alcohol in this at all unless it&#x27;s under some weird name I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that makes me like this over other natural toners I have used is that it comes in a spray bottle. Toners are always liquids, and usually in a bottle that you can pour the toner out or a flip top lid. This means having cotton balls or pads on hand and using to get the toner on. Now if you are using the toner for deep cleaning after you have already washed your face then that works better to remove the dirt. However usually after cleaning my face it is clean and I don&#x27;t seen any further dirt on the cotton balls/pads. I&#x27;m also almost always in a rush in the morning and anything to save steps is a great help to me. I like that this is a spray so when I get out of the shower (which is where I wash my face) I can dab my face dry with my towel and then spray this on. I then towel dry the rest of my body, take my AM medicine, put on lip balm and then start working on my face. By the time I get to that step this has had time to soak in/dry on my face so I&#x27;m ready for the next steps in getting my face ready for the day. I also live in Nor Cal where it can get very hot during the summers and I think this will feel good and refreshing to spray on my face on the days I&#x27;m feeling too hot and sweaty. I can quickly wash my face to get rid of any oil and dirt then spray this on giving me a refresh in the middle or at the end of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of receiving this product for free this is my 100% honest opinion.redients there is no alcohol in this at all unless it&#x27;s under some weird name I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that makes me like this over other natural toners I have used is that it comes in a spray bottle.

            <li> I loved the OZ Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum -perfect for my sensitive skin and incredibly efficient for sun spots on my pale tone. So I decided to give a try to this tonic. Bad idea. The smell is so strong and unpleasant that I cannot use it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way how this toner makes my skin feel after I cleanse. Clean, refreshed, firm but not tight, and supple. I feel that in the summer I could possibly get away with just toner and no moisturizer. Does not make my skin oily like some other toners I&#x27;ve used. My only problem is honestly the smell. This stuff STINKS!! No I am not one of those ppl that expect everything to smell like a field of flowers. I use a lot of natural products and accept that nature sometimes does not smell that great compared to synthetic products and I&#x27;m ok with that. But I opened the bottle sniffed and gagged. So many stinky memories. Luckily the scent only lasts about 4seconds after you spray it and u kinda go blind to the sent if u keep using it. It really is a great toner when u get past the smell and from the reviews some ppl like the scent. Scent is very personal so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have become a fan of the OZ Naturals products.  They are good quality at a reasonable price.  I really like this toner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely do NOT regret getting this product. After I shake the bottle I close my eyes and spray at least 4 times my face and neck area. The product comes out a nice fine mist and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor or take long to absorb. It has truly works for me. Worth the money and Worth knowing that I&#x27;m taking the best that I can for my skin/face. I recommend you at least try this once and see the effects yourself.</li>
            <li> It works for toning skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally loving this toner! I have been using a lavender organic toner for some time, but the OZ version is much more gentle to my skin. It leaves it primed and prepped for Vitamin C and moisturizer. The net effect is clean, hydrated skin, not stripped or dull, and gently moisturized. The price is fair, too, for the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like OZ Naturals line for their efficacy and for their good prices. I received this product as a sample for my review; I have no problem endorsing it because it really is good and it really does work!</li>
            <li> Refreshing toner.  Love it. Can spray right on skin.</li>
            <li> Calms my skin but can probably find something a bit cheaper with the same effect.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give Oz Naturals&#x27; Ocean Mineral Toner a 100 Star review! I LOVE this product! If you have issues with dry skin or rosacea it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Use twice a day -- after a week I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean but can sting your eyes! Keep them closed.</li>
            <li> No difference , did not help me in any way.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner. I purchased this several months back with a few other OZ products. This wakes up my face in the morning and it dries pretty quick. I would recommend this toner.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased OZ Naturals face moisturizer, Vitamin C cleanser, toner, and eye serum. I say this with all the honesty and relief of a 31 year old woman who has been struggling to find a decent face treatment for my combo, occasional acne and blackhead-prone, splotchy face for years: I. Love. These. Products.&lt;br /&gt;Do they smell like the ocean? Yes. Is that a wonderful thing? No. Does my face look and feel better, clearer, and more even than ever before? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been a soap and Aveeno guy his entire life. I asked him to try it out and HE loves it! I&#x27;m kicking myself because now we&#x27;re spending a lot more on skin care, but for us, it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;m going to copy and paste this review to the products I&#x27;ve listed above to avoid finding a new way to say the same thing!</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels thanks to this toner.&lt;br /&gt;I did not give 5 stars only for the fact that i do not like its smell. Otherwise this product is great.&lt;br /&gt;It dries off very fast and is transparent as a toner should be. It does not feel sticky. it just vaporizes. I can feel the redness on my skin fading and skin is becoming clearer.&lt;br /&gt;The product is very easy to use thanks to the bottle being a spray on. Just splash it directly by spraying onto the face and gently massage. It an be used over make too.&lt;br /&gt;Very good for daily routine. I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> It feels a little unfair to give this product a 3 stars, however I&#x27;m reviewing this based off my experience. I received the bottle from my sister as a gift and it arrived defected. Some of the liquids were already spilling out of the bottle once I opened it and I wonder how that even happens when there&#x27;s a box containing it in and trust me, it&#x27;s a huge hassle to have to call your sister and tell her to print a return label and find a box, tape it, make sure it&#x27;s packaged correctly and drive 4.2 miles to my nearest UPS store. The scent of the Toner was mentioned in previous comments to smell amazing. It smelled odd to me, but I&#x27;m sure others can find pleasure in this smell and some won&#x27;t. Returned this product and looking to purchase their Vitamin C one instead, hoping it will smell better and not damaged.</li>
            <li> I am using it for 2 weeks, combines with the OZ vitamin C serum + OZ Hyaluronic acid serum and I don&#x27;t see any change or improvement.I&#x27;ll see in few more weeks when the bottle will be empty. Not convinced till now. After 5 weeks, no big change, just a slight improvement. One think to know: I&#x27;ve been attracted to buy OZ products because they have a great amount of very good reviews. Why? Because when you buy something from them, they encourage you to leave a good comment. Then, they will send you free samples! Nothing to see with the quality of their products that, to me are &amp;#34;so-so&amp;#34;. Good comments &#x3D; free samples... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair way to attract people.</li>
            <li> Works really well (but it does have a strong witch hazel smell)</li>
            <li> Been using another line of products and decided to try OZ, really great product</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have a lot of redness to my skin and this really balances everything out. I use along with the retinal serum, face mask, and moisturizer. My face has never looked better. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Really great product! I started using this product about two weeks ago right after I wash my face with the ocean mineral face wash! I really love how clean it makes my face feel after I&#x27;ve applied it! I also think it has helped with scarring and making the texture of my skin much better! It is clean and refreshing and I would definitely recommend using it in your skin care regimen. It also doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy on your face!!! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Not what it says it is!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product , really helps the serums and moisturizers to work better!!</li>
            <li> It has a particular seaweed fishy smell to it and my skin has not gotten better.  I guess I expected more because of all the great reviews.  I will go back to my former glycolic toner/tonic.</li>
            <li> Nice product, feels refreshing</li>
            <li> excellent product i love it</li>
            <li> As part of the ILoveToReview community, I was given this item at no cost, (shipping fees apply), in order to give my honest opinion. Let me just start off with, THIS FACIAL TONER IS AMAZING!!! I have had problems with dark spots and uneven skin tone for years!! After using this for almost a week now, I can already see amazing results and I am loving every minute of it. I use it once a day, and I&#x27;m already getting even toned skin, and it hasn&#x27;t been a week yet!? I love the witch hazel! It has also helped with my acne. Which is also great! I&#x27;m not going to give my life story in this review but I will say, it works, I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Ilovetoreview Review</li>
            <li> I have really been making an effort to take better care of my skin lately since I&#x27;m getting close to forty and my skin is showing it! Tonic has never been a part of my skin care routine but I have heard good things about it so I was willing to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d never used before I made sure to read all the directions first. I washed and dried my face first and then applied the Ocean Mineral Tonic. It&#x27;s very easy to use. You just simply spray it on your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always concerned about sprays on my face because of my eyes. Obviously I close them but sometimes things still leak and drip into the eyes after. This was such a fine mist that it dried quickly and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is meant to be a base for regular moisturizer so I then applied my moisturizer. I was surprised to see how many steps are recommended in a skin care regimen and although I&#x27;ve added a few lately; I definitely don&#x27;t do them all YET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m learning more about taking care of my skin as I age so this is a great step to ad and I will continue to ad more. I recently tried the Vitamin C serum which has made a difference and combined with this tonic, I do see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals - They work amazingly!!!!! I am so happy I tried them. The eye serum is the best and NO irritation to the skin around the eye - or the eye itself - and I am super sensitive to skin products and an older woman. Everyone should try these if they would like to see some positive results!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this products and the whole OZ naturals line! Please check out my full review here on YouTube! Click on this link: [...]</li>
            <li> I had never used a spray toner before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I really love this toner, sprays on lightly and my face feels exhilarating and youthful. Will definitely continue with this toner, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used toners to  remove traces of makeup that my facial cleanser wasn&#x27;t able to remove so I was taken aback with this being a spritzer, but I decided to use this with my HA serum that is best used with some sort of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days of using this toner my face broke out with acne. I saw other reviewers said their face broke out too, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it until it happened to me. To make sure it was the toner and not something else, I stopped using the toner for a few days, but continued using the products I had been using and sure enough after 3 days the acne went away and has not come back - so it was definitely this toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the questions/answers and someone asked about the color of the toner so I decided to open it up and take a picture. Not only is the toner yellow, but if you look at the bottom you will see there is sediment in the bottle. I bet that stuff is what got on my skin and broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, although some people swear by this OZ Naturals product I cannot recommend it. I would hate for someone to break out like I did based on my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Does a good prep job. I would have given it five stars but, I do not particularly like the smell.</li>
            <li> I trialed the product for seven days. I immediately noticed that my face felt more firm after the first use. It sprays on lightly, and dries quickly. I found them smell to be a little unpleasant at first, like witch hazel. However, once it dried the smell disappated. I was expecting a more natural ocean like smell per the name, which is why I gave the rating four stars. I used the product following my regular cleansing routine, and before makeup application. I felt that my makeup applied more smoothly after the application. I would recommend this organic toner. The product did perform as advertised, and toned my skin. I appreciate that there are no toxins or unsafe chemicals. I was given this product free of charge for my fair and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it! Using along with moisturizer and serum. Noticed a difference after first use.</li>
            <li> This toner is very gentle yet effective. Never knew a toner came in a spray bottle until I watched a YouTube skin care video clip. It feels refreshing when you spray it on your face then wipe off with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li> I like it, but my spray is really hard and in a stream.  I have to spray it in my hand, then apply to my face.</li>
            <li> I think I have tried every toner on the market and this one by far is the nicest. I use this the spray after washing my face morning and night. And I also use the spray after applying my makeup and throughout the day. It is so refreshing and it has made my face so smooth. I will continue to use this toner for as long as OZ Naturals makes it.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helpes my skin at all</li>
            <li> The greatest toner and moisturizer I have ever used!!! I use Ocean Mineral Toner before I apply my OZ Naturals serums and it helps them absorb right into my skin.  I also use this toner throughout the day to refresh my face because it also moisturizers and gives me that &amp;#34;put together&amp;#34; glow and this toner works GREAT on dry, itchy, winter skin!! It takes away the itch and hydrates my legs, back and arms that seem to suffer in the winter. It&#x27;s awesome!!!! A wonderful facial toner that hydrates and clears up your skin as well as help your entire body with moisture and anti itch.  I think it smells pleasant, clean, and refreshing and that&#x27;s exactly how my skin feels every single time I use it and I use it A LOT throughout the day!! It&#x27;s amazing for sensitive skin and gets results!! Try it and I guarantee you will LOVE it as much as I do!!</li>
            <li> Smells awful! Can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, more so on less muggy days.  It is very refreshing however living in a humid environment I will use on dryer days.  I really enjoy when we are out on the boat it is a great splash to refresh with.</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to get used to spraying toner all over my face but it does seem to help!</li>
            <li> When I received this package I was so excited, but I was wrong. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on my skin and the smell was so bad.. I did end up using up all the bottle because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money but I am not purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product! First time buyer, but on the first application I could already noticed a healthier and moist skin. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I lvoe OZ Naturals I have tried many of their products now &amp; every single one has delievered. This Facial Toner is phenomenal. I have oily skin but in the summer it is hard to keep balanced &amp; looking healthy. I am mature and need to keep it properly hydrated in summer. The Oz Naturals Toner is perfect because although it does have astringents for an oily or other problem skin conditions, it also contains moisturizing properties to soothe my dry skin, &amp; anti-oxidants for the necessary protection, we are all exposed to; from both the sun‚Äôs harmful rays and the environmental pollution.  Skin toner can do a number of things, traditional toners consist of moisturizers, oils and extracts that help soothe the skin. Astringents, tighten the skin, shrink pores, and remove oil, and fresheners work similarly to astringents to firm up the skin. Therefore, Ocean Minerals Tonic Toner is for both tightening and moisturizing, along with anti-oxidants for protection. That is why it worked so perfectly for me. I also love the light scent it has!</li>
            <li> Great item and I&#x27;m highly impressed!  I&#x27;m now looking to buy more skincare in the same range!  I highly recommend this as it really seems to work!!</li>
            <li> Delivered promplty. Item exactly as described. I am very happy with the quality. Easy transaction.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s refreshing but don&#x27;t know that it really did anything for my face...</li>
            <li> This is the best toner ever! Includes glycolic acid! And it can go on top of makeup!!!</li>
            <li> I find that I really like this toner. I find that my skin is smoother and brighter since I started using it a month ago. My pores look smaller and my skin tone looks more even. I spray this on morning and evening and pat it into my skin. I noticed that I use less product with my follow up skincare than I did before I started using this. I started suffering from cystic acne last year and I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t last as long when I break out nor does it get quite as bad as it did before. I am really impressed with this toner. It has a watery feel and it smells slightly acid, not much and you can&#x27;t smell it after it&#x27;s absorbed. If you&#x27;ve used other products with acids like glycolic acid before you&#x27;ll recognize the scent. You can also apply this by spraying it onto a cotton pad, but I honestly prefer to just spray it on my face. This is a product I highly recommend. I have been trying to improve my skincare for awhile now and this has been one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried. I will keep it in my skincare routine!</li>
            <li> I love all of Oz Natural products and this toner is one of my favorites! Wakes your skin right up and helps to better absorb serums into your skin. I have a regimen going with them. I have noticed an improvement in my skin after starting Oz skincare. I use the Retinol Serum (pm), Vitamin C Serum (am), Hyaluronic Acid Serum (am/pm) and the Super Youth Moisturizer. I&#x27;m 51 and look younger for using these products. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell, and please use a sunscreen after using this since it can stain your face</li>
            <li> This Toner is fantastic. I am a makeup artist and I am always on the hunt for a new product to introduce to my clients. After trying it myself, I HIGHLY recommend it. It goes on great! I love the spray nozzle. It shoots out the perfect amount and dries fast. I have super dry skin and find that this keeps my face hydrated all day.&lt;br /&gt;  DISCLAIMER: All products received are complimentary for testing purposes. All opinions stated are my own and are not influenced by any affiliates.</li>
            <li> It feels fresh, I like that you can spray it on your face instead of using a cotton ball. Easy and quick your done.</li>
            <li> Oz naturals is a great product.  I gave this one only 4 because I don&#x27;t care for the smell of the product.  Other than that, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I read that this product contains organic sulphur which probably accounts for the smell I dislike, however the smell is not so intense that I am unable to use.  I feel that if there is good stuff in this product then you deal with a slight smell you don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit I just read about is that this toner can and should be used as a refreshing spray you use throughout the day as needed to refresh the makeup.  This is the reason for the pump.  This is not your old &amp;#34;sea breeze&amp;#34; from the past, but something much better that preps the face for your serums and moisturizers.  Sounds like OZ naturals has my skin regimen all planned out for beautiful skin now and into the future.</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle and can not tell any difference when I use it or not.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this toner from reading all the reviews. It has an unpleasant smell and the first week I tried it, it caused my face a really bad allergic reaction. And I do not have sensitive skin. It was scaly and dry around the eyes and forehead. I had to go to the dermatologist to get treatment cream and pay $$$.</li>
            <li> I really like the OZ Naturals line of products and use all of them. I like this toner. It feels fresh when you spray it on. I sometimes spray it on during the day if I feel my skin is thirsty :)</li>
            <li> Because the main ingredient is witch hazel the smell is terrible. But I feel like my skin has brightened after using this product.</li>
            <li> This toner is great! I instantly feel it going to work when I put it on...just soothes my skin and prepares it for my other OZ products!</li>
            <li> VERY SOOTHING/ HYDRATING</li>
            <li> Look good, but I doubt how it works.</li>
            <li> My friend got me this for my birthday because she was once staying at my house and noticed I had 3 OZ Naturals products on my vanity. She asked me about the line and i raved about it. I told her how i wanted to try the toner. Annnnd she got it for me. Honestly it is the best toner I have used and I love this entire company. Every toner usually leaves dry patches on my skin, kind of like eczema. Not this one! Definitely will purchase this once im out of the one i got for a gift</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product. It dried my skin out &amp; made me look even older. I stayed with it for 2 weeks before I thew it away.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing. I have combination of dry and oily skin with uneven skin tone. I have never tried any toner in the past. I heard great things about facial toner from my friends. This toner is light and refreshing. It has very pleasant. The toner is the base of serum and moisturizer. I apply it after cleansing my face. I  spray directly from the bottle on my face and neck twice a day. In the morning I apply serum and moisturizer after applying the toner. and do my daily makeup. At night I remove all the makeup and wash my face and then spray this toner. Then apply serum/moisturizer. I have seen difference in my skin tone and texture. The pores on top of cheeks have shrunk. My uneven skin looks much better now. I can see my skin is soft, smooth and flawless gradually. It is working great for me. It improves your skin. It gives the skin a fresh and youthful look. It slows down your aging process for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with this toner. The ingredients are awesome for the skin. I would highly recommend it. I received this toner in exchange of my unbiased opinion on a promotional discount. However it didnt affect my thoughts about it.</li>
            <li> Received my Ocean Mineral Skin Toner about a week ago and have been using it day and night.  Seems to tighten the pores almost instantly as it dries.  I use moisturizer on top of it and then apply my makeup, which seems to go on smoother.  Looking forward to trying another Oz natural product.  Very excited about this product line.  The fact that I am able to try this line of products free of charge, courtesy of Oz, is quite an advantage for me to try everything.  Makes me feel that if this company is willing to give me this opportunity that they are fully dedicated and believe in their products 100%.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but my face broke out using it. It may work better for someone else. The toner did tighten my face though. I don&#x27;t fault the product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> First day using the oz products and already love it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this toner. It smells great. It soaks into her skin, refreshes her skin and makes her skin feel soft. She noticed an improvement immediately and really enjoys how easy it is to use this product. My wife also likes to know that vitamins are being pushed into her skin, instead of a product with ingredients she knows nothing about. OZ Naturals impresses my wife and this product has really improved her skin.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am very happy with my other OZ Natural products and I really wanted to like this product, but the smell is just awful! Couldn&#x27;t use it because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Has a smoky scent at first but it fades quickly and leaves my skin bright and glowing all day!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the cleanser, and couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed with both products. This toner smells bad &amp; does nothing for my skin. I&#x27;m going to toss it, it serves absolutely no purpose. I have used all brands of products at all price points &amp; haven&#x27;t ever run across products this low quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do these awful products get great reviews? Incomprehensible to me.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial toner. Does what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li> This toner has a complex herbal fragrance dominated by witch hazel.  It is both refreshing and moisturizing when sprayed on the skin if it is kept in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple formula is very reassuring.  In addition to witch hazel extract, the formula contains aloe juice, glycolic acid, and various fatty acids to help protect the skin from loss of moisture as well as minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and a host of botanical extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic bottle holds 4 fl. oz.  The pump sprayer is of good quality and produces a fine mist.  It is easy to tuck into a bag to take to the pool or beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (100% natural):  Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel), ocean minerals, deionized aqua (water), organic Aloe barbadensis leaf (aloe vera), glycolic acid, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), sodium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin C), aprylic/capric triglyceride, hydrogenated vegetable oil, Crithmum maritimum extract (sea fennel wax), Matrixyl 3000, silk protein amino acid blend (sodium L-pyrrolidone carboxylate, sodium lactate, L-arginine, L-aspartic acid, L-pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid, glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-valine, L-proline, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-histidine, L-phenylalanine), Arctostaphylos uva-ursi leaf extract, colloidal silver, organic Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba oil), Cucumis sativus (cucumber hydrosol), wildcrafted Panax ginseng (ginseng), wildcrafted Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo), organic Glycyrrhiaz glabra (licorice), organic Matricaria recutita (chamomile), organic Altahaea officinalis (marshmallow), organic Echinacea purpurea (echinacea), organic Calendula officinalis (calendula), organic Viola tricolor (violet), organic Spilanthes acmella (spilanthes), wildcrafted Stellaria media (chickweed), organic Sambucus nigra (elder flower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals provided toner for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> As someone that‚Äôs always looking for beauty products to help improve the appearance of my skin I was excited to receive this Oz Naturals Facial Toner in the mail! After testing this Facial Toner out for myself I have to say this toner is amazing!! This Oz Naturals facial toner with witch hazel is a dermatologist grade skin treatment that works wonders!! Its use is to be used as a base layer for your everyday facial serums and moisturizer. This toner is super easy to use all you need to do is spray your face and neck with is toner in the morning and at night!! This toner is a highly effective ant-aging refresher that contains many amazing ingredients from vitamin c, witch hazel, ocean minerals and glycolic acid. This toner is definitely a must have base for anyone‚Äôs anti aging daily regimen. This toner calms your unbalanced skin and helps to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles from your skin to give you a happy healthy youthful glow!! This toner works wonders layering with other Oz Natural products as I have personally tried many of these products together and loved the results!! This toner is amazing and it is also 100% natural, cruelty-free, vegan, does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is PH balanced which makes it safe for all skin types!! You are bond to love this amazing toner and I definitely recommend it to everyone and anyone!!</li>
            <li> This product is really great, even for sensitive skin. I have tried so many product, but everything either made me brake out or become really dry and irritated. This has actually improved my skin tone and I have notices smaller pores. I bought this with the vitamin C serum. great Products.</li>
            <li> A toner is something often times people skip in their skin care routine, shame on them! This is an all natural toner which also makes it an absolute must. It is easy and refreshing on the skin without alcohol and parabens! In receiving this product for a review, the only reason it a rating of a 4 stars instead of 5 is because of smell factor but absolutely everything else about this product is amazing. You will feel squeaky clean after using this!</li>
            <li> It broke my face. And somewhat cause a blistering around my lips.  I don&#x27;t know if the if a seal was on this product or suppose to have a seal on the product.  But mine didn&#x27;t so I didn&#x27;t think much of it.  I very much like the OZ Natural Products.  All the other product I buy from OZ has a seal on the product.  Anyways, make a seal is on the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a toner that didn&#x27;t contain Salicylic Acid (willow bark) or SD Alcohol and other drying ingredients for a while. Pleased to find that OZ Naturals make this tonic with organic ingredients  and as I&#x27;m already a fan of their vitamin C serum &amp; eye product decided to give this a try too.  So far so good apart from having a slight burnt caramel smell it seems to be working well !!!</li>
            <li> This toner is soooo refreshing. It feels great on my face and i actually look forward to my morning and night spray. I received this prodcut in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion. Thank you oz!!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I had high hopes this would help my skin. I broke out so badly from using the ocean minerals cleanser, the tonic &amp; retinol serum-  it&#x27;s embarrassing.  I hesitate to give a bad review because I love what this company stands for...just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients, but combine it with another brand for more effectiveness as very light results. It has a very strong witch hazel smell which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> Came unsealed and used. Don&#x27;t order!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is a spray on.  It is very convenient and easy to use.  I love the tightness it gives to my skin.  My skin feels fresh, clean and ready for the other Oz products.</li>
            <li> This Toner is very refreshing to use. It has a slight clean scent, but I feel this makes it that much better to use. Some toners can have an over whelming scent, but this is just right. The sprayer is perfect as it does not spray in large droplets and has a fine mist which is extremely important to me in a toner. Some spray and make your face feet wet instead of fresh and cool. I use this before and after my makeup use and throughout the day if I am at home. I also use it after the shower before my face care before bed. This is the 1st step to my skin care routine at night. I really enjoy the way it makes my face feel. It feels completely hydrated and fresh. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I saw no changes or improvements in my skin.  I&#x27;ve over 60 and I&#x27;ve found other less expensive products that do a much better job.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the product I recieved. It is an obvious knock-off. Typos on the bottle and all. Not a happy paying customer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price. While it works very well as a toner to start off your facial skin regimen, it is also just a refreshing spray that you can use any time of the day. I keep a bottle in my purse and find it a quick refresher on nasty, hot and humid days. Great stuff, as is expected from Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> A bit sticky after spraying on my face. Not so much hydrating effect, no brightening effect. I am just using it because I missed the timeline to return the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for a couple weeks now and I am seeing an improvement in my skin. I use a face wash, which contains glycolic acid and use this product right after. I feel that my skin looks more clear and my acne blemishes have toned down a bit. I will definitely purchase this toner again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great toner, feels nice on the skin. I have noticed the pores on my face getting smaller.  Natural products are the only products you should use on your skin.  This one is a good choice</li>
            <li> Great clean, moist feeling. Funky smell but that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Great skin toner for your face and neck!</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this toner, not only is it FANTASTIC before my moisturizer, but it leaves my make-up looking fresh all day with just a few sprays.I loved the smell! It smells very natural and calming, Almost like the Colorado mountains after it rains.  I do have acne prone skin and this worked fine with my face. Though I did receive this product free from Oz Naturals, my opinions are my own. I love this brand.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has a pleasant smell and feels great on your skin. I use it before putting any make up on and it seems to really smooth my skin, prepping it for my make up. I notice my pores are less visible and my skin is clearer than ever before. It is gentle, cruelty-free and effective. I recommend this to anyone who wants healthier looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product but everyone&#x27;s skin is different .  What works for one person may not work for another.</li>
            <li> So fresh and clean!! Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> it has very funny, unpleasant smell. i had to returned.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner! I have been using it for two weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin, but I use toner mainly to remove any facewash that didn&#x27;t rinse off of my face completely after cleansing. This has a nice scent and leaves my skin feeling soft. I received a bottle for free but that did not affect my opinions of the product.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by the results I am experiencing.  I didn&#x27;t expect much from &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; a toner or any toner for that matter. Oz Naturals is a product that produces results.  After a week of spritzing the toner on my face and neck as a base for my other products,  I noticed my skin was less &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34;.  The toner calmed and soothed the redness and hormonal acne on my face. I also noticed my under eye area looked brighter, rested  and smoother. I had to conclude these results were due to Oz Naturals toner. Who woulda thunk üòä!</li>
            <li> This is the best secret I have found to refresh and prime my skin ! I used it for 2 weeks now I can&#x27;t live without it .It feels so good when you mist clean skin and can also used over Make Up for a refreshing feel .the smell is light too. Not to strong .great ingredients to help skin and sun damage .or fine lines from aging my skin tone is more even and I feel refreshed I would put this Oz Naturals Ocen Mineral Tonic on my list to order thanks I&#x27;m reviewing this product at no cost to do a review ! 5stars</li>
            <li> I love this facial toner.  My fav part abt it: IT IS A SPRAY!!!! So convenient, just spritz it on face and neck, let it dry and your ready for your moisturizer. No need of a cotton ball or rubbing or anything.  I have seen a difference in my face too, no pimples (but i only used to get a few occasionally) and I feel like it has also helped the redness in my cheeks. I will keep this one handy at all times!  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with it. This product is better than no toner. If anything the smell is weird. I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint the scent.... it smells like the bacon in the McDonalds bacon ranch salad. Thats not a positive thing but I can get over it. It does make my skin feel smooth after the hydration mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Unlike others who received free products I am writing this slightly negative review at the risk of never being one of the people who get to try a product for free. I&#x27;m a chump who had to pay for this.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if my bottle has a defective spray but it seems to dispense too much liquid.  It drips even when I spray lightly from about a foot away.  The scent is like witch hazel, light and not unpleasant.  I don&#x27;t know if the long term effects are good but after using it for a few days, I haven&#x27;t seen anything noticeable.  It would be refreshing on a hot day but I haven&#x27;t had steamy weather to try it.</li>
            <li> This feels soooooo good after the Vitamin C wash ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Just need an excellent moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Have always used a coconut toner... but this one is great in the evening before applying the retinol moisturizer</li>
            <li> This toner is very light and makes me feel fresh.  I love that it&#x27;s in a spray bottle instead of having to use cotton balls. I travel quite a bit so a spray bottle is much easier than the cotton balls.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS toner! I don&#x27;t typically use, but decided as winter approaches to use it. It is one of the BEST skin products I have found in a long time and will continue purchasing for myself and for gifts. I feel it has improved the texture to my skin/neck area (really feels so much smoother) and even healing my sometimes dermatitis around my scalp area. Will continue using knowing it is good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this toner.  I have never used a toner, but I love the other OZ naturals products and thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  I honestly don&#x27;t know what it actually does, but it makes my skin feel like I was just swimming in the ocean (in a good way).  The first time I used it I thought it had a weird smell, but now I crave using this toner, my skin just loves it for some reason.</li>
            <li> Never used a toner before, I love it. I can see a difference in the texture and firmness of my skin after about a month of using it. It&#x27;s not miracle spray, but definitely helps with tone.</li>
            <li> nice toner, not too strong or over drying</li>
            <li> I recently started getting in the habit of incorporating toner into my daily routine. I actually really like this toner. I don&#x27;t review products unless I have used them for a few weeks or at least a decent amount of time. I&#x27;ll use this product in the middle of the day for a dewy look and as a refresher. It&#x27;s easy to understate a toner but so nice for a quick pick me up. Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied , use daily, improves skin texture</li>
            <li> Have never gotten into full skincare regimes but am loving the OZ line so much that I like using them all in tandem. Such a fan of this organic line.</li>
            <li> Im not a frequent reviewer unless i really love a product and this line has worked fantastic! I had been using Obagi for the past year but thought i would give this a try. I purchased the Ocean Mineral cleanser, the toner, serum, and  Super Youth retinol moisturizer. LOVE them all. I live in the midwest so these products have worked amazing during this winter.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> All around great everyday toner. Gives skin a nice afterglow with out over drying.  The spray bottle is super convenient and you don&#x27;t waste valuable product saturating a cotton pad to apply.</li>
            <li> Like that its light feeling.  Does help with liquid foundation to set smoothly.  The scent is not the best but you really dont want fragrance added anyhow.  I have sensitive skin so very happy with no irritation or breakouts. Still too soon to say if skin texture is any different.</li>
            <li> I have used many toners for different skin issues and this has been the 2nd all natural toner that has helped me with my breakouts. I love this mineral toner for acne/ oily skin at night time. It cleans very well and I like the dryness it leaves on my skin because it prepares it for the serum. When I am not breaking out I do not use this toner. I find that is simply works best to aid to acne control. The size of the bottle is ideal, lots of information but I do enjoy using this product. This was sent to me to test and this review is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am enjoying this toner which keeps my pores from clogging and acne under control. It still works.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is very natural.</li>
            <li> This toner has so much going for it its a really great buy. I love that it very natural and I love what it has in it to really prepare my skin not only for the day but for my other skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals Facial Toner has in it Glycolic Acid MSM, Vitamin C and ocean minerals. its so easy to use because you can spray it over the face or spray it on a cotton ball to use it. I like spraying it on my face and letting it dry before applying my other beauty products. I have use a lot of different toners but I really like this one for its ease of use as well ans it effective and carefully chosen ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
            <li> Feels fresh, but I wont buy it again .</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product.  So far, so good.  I would love to see a toner added to the line of products.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!!! In just minutes you feel a cooling but relaxing sensation on your face and in just a week or so I saw major improvement! I have forehead lines and wrinkles under my eyes and it defiantly showed improvement in not longer but a week.</li>
            <li> Not as pure as it needs to be .  I like Instanaturals Rose Water and their Vitamin C Toner, each of these are far better.&lt;br /&gt;Spend your money on these two toners.</li>
            <li> Makes me so happy to finally find products that I love and feel good about putting on my face love you Oz Naturals thank you for your amazing products :)</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in my skin since I started using this. My skin is softer, brighter and I&#x27;m experiencing less break outs. Love it!</li>
            <li> My face does feel a lot smoother since I&#x27;ve started using this. I can&#x27;t stand the smell though; it reminds me of glue. Luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t last after it has dried. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This toner feels great on my skin! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight and dried out, just nice and refeshed. And it was delivered before the delivery date. Even better! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and I can fit I really do like it The toner is a little bit sticky but it can do because I put make up on and I&#x27;m pretty sure that It can help the make up set. I really don&#x27;t like the smell that much but then again toners don&#x27;t smell that good. Testing the product out today and it made my face feel so awake. Hours later my face still feels refreshed besides the smell in the stickiness I have to say this is a really good toner if you&#x27;re probably not into the stickiness are you are person who hates bad smells are it was strange smells I don&#x27;t think this product would be for you. If you&#x27;re looking for great results in your face to feel refreshed this product is doubly for you.</li>
            <li> I think I found my new best friend! This OZ toner is AMAZING! I used this toner by spraying it on a cotton facial disk and rubbing it on my entire cleansed face. I immediately noticed how incredibly soft and smooth my face felt! After using, it my pores appear smaller. I have had no break outs and just love the way this toner gives my skin extra cleaning and toning. I am definitely going to keep up with this toner in my nightly face cleansing regimen. Great product with a great price!</li>
            <li> This spray is great when I use my derma roller and wrinkle treatment, I do find that it is not for everyday use if you have ultra sensitive skin however it is very effective with anti-aging products and/or facial treatments.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I get a little exfoliation from using this on a damp cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer if it wasn&#x27;t in a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t want to spray a glycolic product around my my eye area.</li>
            <li> Easy, no mess spray type. Feels good on my face. Love it.</li>
            <li> Use this in combo with eye serum and moisturizer.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs basically a toner but better, I use it after washing my face in between moisturizing. It has an interesting scent, I swear it smells like burnt sugar, not the acrid smell, but a sweet faint caramelized sorta scent, I really like that! It leaves my skin feeling fresh like a normal toner, but it doesn‚Äôt dry it out like others, it leaves it feeling just right. And I love the spray bottle, it‚Äôs way faster to use than a cotton round, (that‚Äôs what I usually use). I used about 3 sprays to cover my whole face, it gives you a nice fine mist which is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this to review by the company, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I like this toner. simple and refreshing. not a great smell though but its good</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  Nice clean feeling.  Using at night under serum. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have recently just started using toners for my skin. I have noticed my skin has changed so much and feels a lot better afterwards. I have been suffering with enlarge pores for awhile now and this toner has helped me feel more confident about applying my makeup without my pores showing through.</li>
            <li> Awful product, burned my face. cannot return after 39 days of purchase???!!!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s so great about toners? I used to ask that question until I tried OZ Natural Facial Toner. It really does make one&#x27;s pores smaller and if you even had slightly oily skin it reduces that.  I have to say that I normally didn&#x27;t have to fight the T-zone or oily skin (good genes), so I didn&#x27;t think I ever had a problem.  When I started using this toner, my skin tone became even, no break outs (not even hormonal ones), and my skin feels so soft.  When you spray the toner, it is very mist like and not heavy.  It tastes salty like you&#x27;ve been to the beach- ahhhhhhh.  After I spray the toner, I use OZ Naturals Retinol Serum. Sometimes I&#x27;ll follow up with OZ Naturals Facial Moisturizer.  The combination of OZ products really does make it so I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation.  My skin looks healthy.  Just so you know, I am in my 40&#x27;s and I have recently started to pay attention to my face and I have lived in very sunny places.  If you are younger- start now and start with OZ Natural Products. If you are maturing, I cannot recommend these products enough. You don&#x27;t feel like you are putting chemicals on your face.AND they do not test on animals!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what OZ says it will do, great base for the rest of the OZ products. One note however, if you have eyeliner, eyebrows, lips tattooed, avoid those areas by spraying in the palm of your clean hand and apply to your face with fingertips. It has some retinol in it which will lighten your tattoos. I love the way my skin feels after I use the toner. The toners I used in my teen years were very drying, so when I was given this product to try &amp; review, I really was not looking forward to trying it. It is not drying at all, and it does make the rest of the products &amp; foundation go on smoothly. I don&#x27;t think I can be without this product either. My favs are the Vit C serum, hyaluronic acid serum &amp; the Super Youth Moisturizer with Retinol. Love love love OZ products. I hope they keep them economical as well as natural &amp; hard-working. thanks!</li>
            <li> This toner really prepares my skin to absorbe the serum.  I also spray it on my face in the middle of the day when my skin needs extra moisture during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This has kept all of my acne at ease! I love these products! They work WONDERFUL! I will be re purchasing!</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and what it has in it to really prepare my skin not only for the day but for my other skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals Facial Toner has in it Glycolic Acid MSM, Vitamin C and ocean minerals. It&#x27;s so easy to use because you can spray it over the face and then let it dry before applying my other  products.</li>
            <li> Currently started using a OZ Natural toner.  Generally don&#x27;t use a toner but was given the opportunity to try this one.  I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of it.  It&#x27;s not offensive just not that great smelling.  I realize being more natural no perfumes are added.  The smell fades as quick as it dries on your face.  It does not sting or irritate my skin leaving it feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have been using OZ Naturals products for two months now.  I love all of their products, including the toner.  Although I have been using prescription strength renova for over 15 years and have very good skin for my age, I have noticed a big difference in my skin after using OZ Naturals products, especially around the eyes.  Also, my pores are much smaller.  I currently use their cleanser, toner, mask, both serums, renova, moisturizer, and sunscreen.  I have recommended this product to my sister, daughter, and several other friends.</li>
            <li> This Ocean facial Tonic works great I use it right before my vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Super Toner!  I haven&#x27;t been using any type of toner in the past, and wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be of any use to me.  Well, this is a great toner, my skin feels so refreshed when putting this on my face; WOW!  At first I sprayed it on, but have since gone to using a cotton ball to apply.  This way it stays off my hair, and not any is wasted.  My skin feels so good using OZ Naturals, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  I will always use toner now, especially OZ Natural Toner.  I love that all these products are organic and natural and my skin has never felt or looked better. Even though I receive this product free, I would purchase it if I didn&#x27;t because it is that good.</li>
            <li> This is such a refreshing product.  I especially love it since the weather is warm and I need a sprits every now and then to give my skin so TLC.  I appreciate the natural ingredients and that it has a very light scent.  This product is highly recommended, pamper your skin.</li>
            <li> I got pimples when I applied it, and I thought it was just a misfit with my skin. However I gave it to a friend to use and same feedback from her.</li>
            <li> Honestly, until I tried this facial toner, I didn&#x27;t think that I needed a toner.  But I was wrong!  I love this stuff.  Makes my skin wake up and take notice.  Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I loved that it was a spray and you could instantly feel &#x27;something&#x27; happening.  Often I use witch hazel and apply it on my blemishes.  This product replaced my plain old witch hazel!  I have used it for awhile and still have plenty left.  The sprayer and nozzle did not get clogged so there was no need to clean it as with others.  Great product and it really, honestly, did work on blemishes that were developing or current.  I used it specifically at night time and am now going to use it in the morning prior to make-up application and at night.  :)</li>
            <li> I have used the toner for two weeks along with the ocean mineral facial cleanser. I love the way my skin feels so fresh and extra clean. My skin which was broken out has been clearing up. Love the products!</li>
            <li> This toner is a very light spray that has a slight indistinguishable odor.  It is a hard to describe smell but I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a pleasant odor as others have described.  I am not crazy about the smell, but it isn&#x27;t any worse than other similar facial products.  This toner helps nourish the skin especially when combined with a moisturizer.  This also works well after shaving.  I will update my review if my observations change over long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product! I use all Oz products and what a difference they have made! My skin is in the best shape and I owe it to this toner as well as the rest of the product line. I highly recommend this toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample of this product to review, however, the results are my own and my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> As stated with the cleanser I was lucky to try this for free, I have tried lots of skincare over the years and I am really impressed with this company. They give generous sizes and each product has great ingredients. I like the toner,it has a huge ingredient list and many are organic. I use it after cleansing and spritz it on after my powder, it&#x27;s great for setting makeup. The only thing that could make it better is if it was 6 or 8 oz. definitely a thumbs up. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I Love how this makes my face feel tight without drying it out. My pores are closing, my skin is smooth. This is great!</li>
            <li> I love it!  It smells like the beach and hydrates my skin after a hot shower.  The organic ingredients are top-notch and the product is very affordable.  This product will stay in my product rotation for sure.  Very affordable as well. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can use this product without any problems.</li>
            <li> This toner is so refreshing! It is moisturizing and smells good too. I mist it on my face and neck before applying a moisturizer or serum.</li>
            <li> My facial skin feels very uncomfortable after using this product.</li>
            <li> Recently started using this toner. I really like it. Light scent but doesn&#x27;t smell great but does fade quickly. Does not irratate my skin leaving it feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> It feels sticky, not a fan</li>
            <li> When I first heard about Oz Naturals&#x27; review a product for free offer I thought, why not? I chose the toner first because it was the one thing my admittedly tiny budgeted face care regimen was lacking. After using it twice daily for a week now, I&#x27;m not sure how I lived without it. Spray it on after washing or showering, face, chest, arms, legs. As it dries you can feel it tightening your skin. It also increases absorption and efficacy of other products like eye cream, serum or moisturizer. I can see the most difference in the reduction of lines around my eyes and mouth. Thanks Oz Naturals! Excited to test the next product!</li>
            <li> mild scent, doesn&#x27;t sting, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product after washing my face- currently using just coconut oil for face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have only used a few times, will report back once I finish the product for a better judgement on how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> This facial toner is gentle and works just like witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in her sixties, and asked her use this instead of witch hazel before she puts on her nightly serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of a week, she noticed that the tonic seemed to boost the results of her nightly serum. She even used the tonic without applying anything else on her skin and was still impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the wonderful ingredients like witch hazel, aloe, vitamin c, and jojoba oil which will enhance the overall appearance of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the gentle nature of the tonic, it is safe for skin types and can be used throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
            <li> This is the best toner ever!  I love it!!</li>
            <li> This tonic/toner is great!  My face feels so clean and smooth! It leaves a fresh clean surface.  I definitely will be buying more of this stuff!  üëç</li>
            <li> This product is great and I use it after I wash my face and it is dry. I love to spray this on my face to help hydrate it and before I put on my moisturizer. I have really sensitive skin and it does not irritate me at all. There really isn&#x27;t much of a scent and the witch hazel in it and the ocean minerals make my skin feel great! This is so light and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review purposes however my opinions are honest.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to use toner because I thought it was to drying for my skin.  Not so with this product.  In fact, I would not be without it!  What I have found is that it makes the serums work better.  I love this product and the results it provides when used with both the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid serums.</li>
            <li> I admit, I tried many regiments before and was skeptical that anything could produce such results as they claimed.  I purchased this product about 3 wks ago and have been using it daily.  I bought the vitamin C serum, eye cream, retinol moisturizer, and spray toner.  I have been using all 4 of these products as part of my morning and nighttime cleansing ritual. In just this short time, I have gotten noticeable results.  I am  41 years old with combination normal/oily skin and uneven skin tones.  I had horrible blackheads on my nose and forehead which have drastically shrunk in size and my face looks great!  The dark rings under my eyes have faded a lot, my uneven tones are starting to even out and I am happier than I thought I would be.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in another 3 wks.  I have tried others and noticed they caused stinging or burning - I thought that meant they are working and was I wrong!  This didn&#x27;t cause stinging and actually felt great!  What impressed me the most was the follow up email I received from the selling company OZ!  they emailed me with directions for use, what to expect, and gave me their contact information.  I mean, what company does that these days?  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Product is great and it is wonderful as a body spray as well!</li>
            <li> I was given this product to review. I&#x27;ve got to say I really like it. I was afraid it would breakout my skin with it having witch hazel in since my skin is sensitive but it did not. I have been using for a couple of weeks now and have seen changes. My skin looks and feels better. I like that this Toner does not make my face feel overly tightened when using. I also like that it is organic so no harmful chemicals like most have. I will be recommending to others.</li>
            <li> Never been one to use toner much and now I cannot do without it. What a refreshing new step to my regimen. I make sure to spray it right after cleansing while my skin is still wet. If you have dry skin (like me) or just want to have soft, hydrated skin, try applying it while your skin is still a little damp. This is a great tip for anyone with dry skin as it helps to seal in the moisture and help prevent dry, itchy skin. It also helps those with normal skin to really lock in moisture. I This product has also become a new permanent member of my make-up arsenal. I use it to hydrate my make-up during the day since I do suffer from dry skin, my make-up tends to dry out. Not only that, but you get some very powerful benefits from this toner&#x27;s Glycolic Acid, Vitamin C, Amino Acids and lots more. Honestly, there is no other toner out there like this one and decently priced. Oh and I LOVE the spray design. Super easy!</li>
            <li> great product.  works as advertised.  would order from again.</li>
            <li> Love this and WILL not be without....I use as directed but I also spray after makeup, my skin has become very dry during this winter and this helps a lot...</li>
            <li> Toners are a must have for me and this one I really loved because it was non-drying and contained beneficial ingredients-I want more.</li>
            <li> Convenient spray, I use it daily over makeup to refresh is great!</li>
            <li> I used my Oz Natural products last night and they felt great. They don&#x27;t have any overpowering fragrance or any at all, and a little goes a long way. To my surprise, all of the &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; on my forehead was completely cleared by morning. My forehead is completely smooth! Great products! I love that they are basically unisex and are completely natural with dermatological-grade active ingredients. They now only need to make a face scrub and sunscreen and then I am set :) Purchased the Vitamin C facial cleanser, Vitamin C 20% serum, Facial Toner, Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this most. It&#x27;s so refreshing and love the ingredients. I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in my skin but just love using this!!  This doesn&#x27;t leave your skins oily or sticky like some I&#x27;ve used in the past. Also, love spraying this on my face, so easier then applying a toner with a cotton ball. Get more product on your face by spraying the  using a cotton ball! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I think is toner is awesome. I love how it&#x27;s organic and alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this one. I&#x27;m not sure what a toner is supposed to do but it is in the protocol so I use is faithfully right after cleansing my face and before I put the serum on.</li>
            <li> I am usually very lazy about writing reviews unless I absolutely love it.. i LOVE this product.. in just one week I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic improvement in my skin! As ive gotten older the blotchiness has become more and more visible. I also have acne scars that i havent been able to find any product to make any sort of a diffrence. The combination of the blotchiness, acne scars and sundamage start to weigh on your self esteem thats why i am so thrilled to have found this product. For an extra kick i use Oz Natural Vitamin C serum. Yet another product of theirs thats a must have. I think i finally believe my search for a great product line is over.</li>
            <li> Use this before I put on my moisturizer.  I can feel how it refreshes and makes my moisturizer work better.  I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Oz Naturals Ocean Mineral Tonic is a spray containing, among other ingredients, glycolic acid, MSM, and Vitamin E. I‚Äôm not too sure about the benefits of glycolic acid and MSM, but everybody knows that Vitamin E is one of the top nutrients, especially for the skin. because it is known to ward off sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might even call this skin tonic to go since it can be so easily applied. You simply spray this tonic in your face (after closing your eyes, of course), then follow with serums and moisturizer. It can also give your skin a refreshing lift throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks</li>
            <li> This product feels great on the skin!  I really look forward to using it on hot summer days!  I have used it  in these colder months throughout the day to give my makeup a fresh look.  It works really well!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve tried toner before, but never really have figured out why. I can&#x27;t really tell that it does that much, and I rarely use it. OZ Naturals gets such great reviews, and there was a coupon, so I thought I&#x27;d try it again. I remain unimpressed. This toner smells pleasantly of witch hazel which is its primary ingredient. I can&#x27;t tell why I am supposed to be using it. Next time, I&#x27;ll save my money and just buy the Vit C Serum by OZ (like that one a lot!) or their moisturizer, or their eye gel.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, just still have not used it long enough to know if I will purchase again</li>
            <li> my coworker recommended this. i don&#x27;t dislike it. but it does have an interesting scent. there is no alcohol smell. that&#x27;s a great. skin seems to feel softer.</li>
            <li> Worthless product despite of a high review.</li>
            <li> Nice and just as expected!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this toner in place of the Proactive line I&#x27;m used to. will get back to you once I see (or don&#x27;t see) much of a change,</li>
            <li> I love this toner. It is refreshing and a good base for my other two products. I spray it on my face and neck. I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> The three key ingredients in OZ Naturals‚Äô Ocean Mineral Tonic/Toner are glycolic acid, MSM, and Vitamin C. According to my research:&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Glycolic acid if often used in chemical peels intended to improve the appearance of the skin by causing a mild exfoliation, softening and brightening the appearance of skin and, blending skin tones and improving the texture of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane), a sulfur compound that occurs naturally in plants, is often taken orally for joint strength and flexibility. Applied topically it may aid in the healing of scars and blemishes, the soothing of sunburns, and the maintenance of youthful and healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Studies have found Vitamin C to be most effective in protecting against damage induced by UV light and also effective in the treatment of photodamage and/or skin wrinkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  These three ingredients (along with a plethora of other natural ingredients such as ocean minerals, jojoba oil, aloe vera, ginseng, and chamomile) are combined in OZ Naturals‚Äô Ocean Mineral Tonic. This 100% natural product is made in the USA and comes in a spray bottle, making it easy to mist over the face and neck as part of a complete skin care regimen and as a little treat for the skin throughout the day. The toner has a light scent and the spray bottle allows a nice, light mist. It is very refreshing, and I especially like to use it after cleaning up after a workout or on a warm, humid day. It does not leave the skin feeling sticky or like there is any residue or heaviness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As someone who frequently breaks out from skin care products, I was pleased to find that I experienced no breakouts from the Ocean Mineral Tonic. Yet perhaps the best testament to this product (and the other OZ Naturals products I have been using‚Äîplease see my other reviews if you are interested) came just a few days ago, when someone asked me, ‚ÄúWhat have you been using on your skin? Your face looks fantastic!‚Äù</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully. My only issue with it is its smell! I can barely handle the smell and for that reason I probably will not be purchasing it again</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this toner very much. My skin is looking better then ever by using all these OZ products!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it. I look more beautiful than ever</li>
            <li> Not crazy for the scent-smell reminds me of burnt ash. Not sure if it works (hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing anything). Not greasy, soaks up quickly. I don&#x27;t think I would reorder.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected ... but Vitamin C is good for you so I&#x27;m using it!</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings on this product.  I was expecting something more like a witch hazel texture, but this product is somewhat thick and green.  The sprayer seems unreliable (maybe sometimes I do not shake it enough).  Sometimes it comes out in globs, so I spray it in my hand first and then smooth on my face.  I have used this after cleansing and before serums.  It seems to provide a nice base for spreading the Vitamin C Serum, as the C serum seems to absorb quickly without toner.  However, it has almost an oily texture and leaves the face shiny.  I can&#x27;t tell if I like that or not.  It seems to provide me with a dewy look under my make up, which I am also not sure if I like or not.  Worth a try, and I don&#x27;t doubt that it does what it says it does.  I really like this line of products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 4 days and my skin feel like silk right now. WOW!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice freshener for your face before you put on your moisturizer.  It has a strong scent of Witch Hazel, though, which makes me think of Preparation H.  But, It does feel good to use it.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, feels clean.</li>
            <li> So refreshing! I dont spray it on I use a cotton ball as too not waste alot</li>
            <li> I totally noticed a difference in the clarity and improved tone of my face.</li>
            <li> I love this spray toner!! I have been using an organic coconut spray toner, so didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like this toner over the other.  It has lots of great stuff in it that I think are great for my skin. Very happy with this product - once again OZ has come thru with a great product!</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing feeling.  I used to use just witch hazel on a cotton ball as a toner, but this is great, and probably better for my skin.  I like the spritz bottle it comes in, and it doesn&#x27;t bite my skin the way some toners can.</li>
            <li> Today I have been using this great product for 7 days. I love it!! It really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin , it has kept blemishes at bay an my skin is tighter an better circulation to my face. I would definitely recommend this product! Can&#x27;t wait to try other products from Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> It does in fact make your skin glow. I am so pleased with this product. My skin feels so soft, moisturized and balanced. I plan on using this toner for a long time. :)</li>
            <li> A bit drying for skin of a certain age, though it tones it well prior to moisturizer. Been using for a few weeks now, noticeable drying effect on mature skin. I use Oz vitamin c serum and the moisture mask, those work well for me. Added this to the mix and my combo skin got too dry. Maybe good for summer.</li>
            <li> Most women have a daily skin routine that they follow even if it&#x27;s just washing your face at night before bed. For those of us that wear makeup or moisturizer daily, what if I told you that there was an anti-aging toner that we should be applying first? OZ Naturals Facial Toner is designed to deliver anti-aging results in as little as little one week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for less than a week but I have noticed that my face feels cleaner and less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have sensitive skin, I was happy to learn that this OZ Naturals anti-aging toner is 100% natural, vegan, alcohol-free, and doesn&#x27;t contain any sulfates or parabens. The best part is that it&#x27;s safe for all skins types, which is crucial when it comes to skin care products. With a blend of amino acids, ocean minerals, vitamin C, and glycolic acid, this toner refreshes your skin when worn under daily makeup or other facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start breathing life back into your dry, damaged skin by healing your cells with OZ Naturals Facial Toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided to me through a discount coupon or gift card.</li>
            <li> It smells soooo good and it makes my skin shiny. I love it</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they were so good I decided to order some of the Oz products. I think most people must have gotten these products for Free in return to leave a positive review! They are ok - nothing great, just ok. I paid for my items so I wanted to leave a real review for anyone looking to purchase. I will use up what I have but not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after spraying this! I received the serum from this company and was very happy with the product, so I got another one. This toner makes your face feel refreshed and like your skin is tightening up when it starts to dry. It has a very mild scent and the sprayer has a perfect amount of product mist.</li>
            <li> Nice refreshing scent, goes on as a light mist that dries quickly. For the first few minutes my skin felt a little tight.  I guess that&#x27;s the toner doing it&#x27;s job because after that my skin felt good.</li>
            <li> Very soothing; refreshing, hydrating. I use this before bed after I use my night care products &amp; also in the morning to &#x27;set&#x27; makeup. Excellent price/value/results. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this tonic/toner as a part of my skincare routine.  I apply it after cleansing and before any serums or moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It can be sprayed on the hands and rubbed onto the face and neck, or you can simply close your eyes and spray the product directly on the skin.  The spray pump is very nice - it comes out like a very fine mist on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;There are no strong fragrances or chemicals in this product, which I greatly appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the first ingredients are witch hazel and aloe, which seem to wake up the skin and also soothe the skin, which is nice especially if you&#x27;ve been out in the sun or wind a lot.  It seems to make the other skin products sink into the skin better and work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  I will continue to use it as part of my routine.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for natural skin care products.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying my oz naturals facial toner.  It comes in a spray bottle and simply spray my face before applying moisturizer to seal in the moisture.  I also spray it over my finished makeup to set my makeup for the day.  In the summer,  I can imagine this being refreshing on a hot day.  The smell is very light and almost unnoticeable.  Very nice product.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I adore this company! I am not one to follow skincare regimes. I usually buy a couple cheap things a year, use half a bottle, see no results, and toss it in a drawer. And repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore! I started using the toner, Hyaluronic acid+ vitamin C serum, Vitamin C facewash, and Super Youth moisturizer twice a day a few weeks ago and have seen a great improvement in the texture, softness, redness and dryness of my skin. Most importantly, I saw a dramatic improvement in my nasolabial/marionette lines. I am 32 but have thin skin and spent many years working in the sun, and was considering fillers for the ever deepening lines from my nose to the outer edges of my mouth because of how they were aging me and making me look tired and unhappy.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to lessen them but they continued to get deeper and more pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of these products has saved me from the needle! The creases are much more shallow, smoother, and less noticeable after only a few weeks. And I am a skeptic, folks, but I LOVE this product line. It has saved my skin. Though they are powerful, they are not harsh. I have sensitive skin prone to redness around my nose and eyes, but this has evened it all out. It is gentle on skin but tough on signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to seal the deal, they are USA made, Vegan (no animal testing!), all natural, and the prices can&#x27;t be beat. You CAN afford an entire line of this stuff. I probably go through two entire bottles in a year of each product. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this toner! I have the entire line of Oz facial products. I started using them three weeks ago and my wrinkles seem to be disappearing and my skin is smoother!</li>
            <li> I came online this evening to write a review about the three OZ Naturals products that I recently ordered. I feel more than a little compelled to share with other women and men about the quality of this product. I have only been using it for approximately two weeks in the morning and evening. I could not be happier with this product. I purchased while looking for a product that would help reduce some new vertical aging lines under my eyes, crows feet around the side of my eyes, and a general firming and moisturizing product for my face that would brighten my skin. Well, I am absolutely amazed at the change in just two weeks. My skin looks and feels softer, smoother and more firm. The area I was concerned with around my eyes has completely resolved. I no longer have &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; lines around my eyes. I had circles, vertical lines and crows feet; and they are GONE, completely gone....so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my mid 60s, and I was pretty unhappy when I saw those lines developing, but not I am HAPPY. My skin is showing a definite improvement, and I have hardly used the product because it goes on so smoothly, that you need very little. Please try this product and see what it can do for you. I think you will be as happy as I am.</li>
            <li> I love the fact these are natural ingredients and it prepares the skin for the next application.</li>
            <li> Nothing major. Overhyped.</li>
            <li> It close my pores w/out using cotton.</li>
            <li> Great toner....fresh and light</li>
            <li> There is something about a beach vacation that always leaves my skin looking clear and fresh. I think of this product as a tropical vacation in a bottle. It feels great on my skin, and it leaves it feeling refreshed.  I love using it! I spray a little on my face after washing it, then I put on moisturizer next. I can feel it absorb into my skin right away! I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have never really used toner regularly before, I have tried some a couple of times and did not feel they were working so under the sink they went to the beauty regimen graveyard. My skin has been dryer this winter than it ever has in the past so I was looking for something to do to help put moisture back into my skin. I do use a moisturizer but it was not helping enough on its own so when offered the chance to give this toner by OZ Naturals a try I figured I had nothing to loose but dry skin. The toner has a nice and light feel to it that makes you skin feel revitalized and fresh not oily at all which I was afraid it would be. I wash my face, use the toner and then put on the same moisturizer and I have noticed that the toner is somehow really helping my moisturizer work better than it ever has. I have also been using the toner before applying my makeup and my makeup goes on so much smoother now, when your skin is dry it is often still visible under liquid makeup but this toner helps make the makeup go on smother and since it is helping my moisturizer work better I don&#x27;t have as much dry skin as I did to start with. I am sure with a bit more use of the toner combined with my moisturizer my skin will be nice and smooth again. I received this item at no cost to me in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of spray facial toners, and this one does not disappoint!  It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing and does not leave any sticky feel or residue.  I use it after I wash, before applying serums or moisturizer.  I also love to just  spritz my face throughout the day.  The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the scent..which I can&#x27;t really describe - it&#x27;s not bad, but just not my preference.  I would consider buying this again because of the solid anti-aging ingredients, but would be more inclined if the scent was more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love it! Hydrates my dry and oily skin</li>
            <li> I never realized how much a toner makes a difference in my skin care regimen!  I love this product! Layered with my other Oz Naturals products, this toner has really helped my fine lines disappear in the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.  Thanks, Oz Naturals!</li>
            <li> I just received this item a few days ago and I am already surprised by how much it brightens my skin when applied! Probably one of my favorite things about this product is that it serves as a primer to serums and moisturizers - which is code for it enhances the absorption of the products applied after the spray. My skin is extremely oily, and I mean OILY. My skin hardly ever drys out, so finding a product that helps serums and my (heavy) moisturizer cream to absorb completely is phenomenal! The price is a little steep for a toner-like item, however it does seem to last a lot longer when compared to the toner I still use twice daily. In all, I do recommend this product. I am really liking it, and will say it is loaded with skin-loving, anti-aging ingredients. PLUS, unlike so many other products out there, water is NOT the first ingredient!!     UPDATE: I have continued using this product for a couple weeks now, and I am still enjoying it. It definitely lasts a while as I feel I have barely put a dent into the bottle. In addition, I do think it has helped my skin brighten up a little bit - it is not extreme - but it is noticeable. In short, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my face feel tighter and it fills in the fine lines. I use this with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a refreshing toner and works great to set or refresh make-up during the day. Great product!</li>
            <li> It says that this toner can be used on top of makeup throughout the day, so I wanted to try that out to see if the toner would make my make up run or not, and it didn&#x27;t. The tonic is a watery substance and the name Ocean Mineral makes me think that I am splashing ocean water on my face because of the name and the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried out this product was right after I got home from my zumba class. When I sweat, I get this salty, gritty layer on my skin when the sweat dries away. I thought I would try spritzing this on my face and see what happens. I was surprised at how refreshed I felt. There really is no other word to describe how my skin felt other than refreshed. I have also tried it right after getting out of the pool from swimming laps and again, it made my skin feel tighter and refreshed at the same time.</li>
            <li> I love OZ Naturals Facial Toner!  I has a very nice, natural scent and most importantly, it makes my face feel so good before I use OZ Naturals Serum. I highly recommend trying this toner!</li>
            <li> I love this product! My face feels fresh after i use this. I am looking forward to trying other products this is the first i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works amazing</li>
            <li> I got this product thru the O.Z. review program and I really like it! the mist goes on evenly and dries quickly so you can proceed with the next step in your routine.  after using it for several days, I ordered another to keep in my kitchen for quick pick-ups during the day.  very soothing and refreshing!  especially if you&#x27;re having a wonderful (NOT)  hot flash!!!!!  it feels so nice and cool on my face .</li>
            <li> Another 5 star product from OZ Naturals. The tonic / toner both soothes and tones my shin. It really does what it says it will do. I use this faithfully and have no plans to hunt for other brand products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for about a week and I&#x27;m noticing that it helps to brighten up my face. I&#x27;m hoping with continued use it will help with my stubborn acne scarring. I&#x27;m always on the look-out for a product that somehow makes my face feel less oily, and this product has helped!!!! It really refreshes my skin and is easy and quick to spritz on your face if you&#x27;re too lazy to use a cotton pad and swipe. For someone with acne-prone skin, finding a product that does not break me out and helps with oiliness without the drying effects is always a challenge. Thank you OZ for creating a toner that leaves the skin feeling soft, clean, and calm!</li>
            <li> I tried the whole collection of OZ Naturals products (because not only are they advertised as being all natural but they are best sellers on Amazon), I was soooo disappointed. I have slightly dry skin as it is but these products made it 10 times worse. I would not recommend these products at all. If it&#x27;s a moisturizer your looking for try the Bee Friendly line. They are amazing! The night cream...OMG!!!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on thins product.&lt;br /&gt;they have fake reviews !!!</li>
            <li> I had not used a toner before and order this to see how it went, and after using it now for 2 months I would not be with out it, I use it before applying the serum day and night , then during the day, I spray my face over my makeup to give it a lift. Its worth a try.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never quite appreciated the need for a toner.  Seemed like one more product to sell.  But I was given this to try, and my skin surely isn&#x27;t getting any younger‚Äîin fact, it&#x27;s getting more exposed since I&#x27;ve taken up lap swiimming‚Äîso it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, most toners that I tried in the past seemed to be designed for oily skin, and mine is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My habit has been to spritz my face with some rosewater before applying  moisturizers, so this facial toner took the place of the rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;? Who knows. The ingredients sound good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say for sure is that  it feels nice and has a light, refreshing scent. Maybe if I add a little rosewater.....</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look so youthful. I am very impressed that the product is made right here in the good ole USA. I also like the fact that it is cruelty free tested. Great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome toner! I love the fact that this toner has glycolic acid in it. This feel nice when sprayed onto your skin. It&#x27;s a nice prep to even apply your serum afterwards. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a light weight quick refreshing mist. My skin feels so soft and moisturized. I have noticed my face isn&#x27;t oily as it has been in the past. I use this under my makeup. I also use this at night time when after I wash my face. I just love this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Clears up skin and works great with sensitive skin! X</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing smell and feel of this toner.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my skin a boost.  I  usually don&#x27;t use a toner but am sold on this product and all the oz natural products.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never been much for toners. My wife has used them much more than me.  We both agree, though, this spray toner goes on light, does not sting, and is a great step before serums &amp; moisturizers.  Personally, I have found myself just &#x27;spritzing&#x27; my face with it throughout the day as it is very refreshing. My wife swears (though I don&#x27;t know how;) it improves her skin tone and makes makeup application easier. I wouldn&#x27;t know. What I do know is it feels great anytime of the day or night as a &#x27;refresher&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t leak, spill, or run down my face.  OZ Naturals are wonderful products and the prices are unbelievably low relative to other brands. What a winner!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a month and i see no difference in my skin. It just smells like sea water.</li>
            <li> Love this toner. It leaves my skin refreshed. This toner is also a quick pick me on humid summer days because it leaves a clean cooling sensation on your face and at the same time shrinks the pores. I will definitely stick with Oz facial toner.</li>
            <li> The scent of this toner was so overwhelming, it was hard to use on my face. After the first use, I tried it again, and I had to wash it off due to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product in return of my HONEST review.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS TONER  FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW My first impression was that the toner smelled quite a bit like witch hazel ( It contains witch hazel) - and after using it I&#x27;ve seen a positive difference in my skin. More so than when I&#x27;ve used witch hazel on it&#x27;s own.  I had clogged pores on my nose and chin along with small break outs on my chin. Since using the toner,  I&#x27;ve noticed that they&#x27;ve greatly diminished.  You can really control the amount of toner that comes out and having it in a spray bottle is a plus.  In general my skin looks and feels smoother - probably due to the glycolic acid I&#x27;m guessing. I&#x27;d recommend this toner to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I always used my Oz Naturals Facial Toner twice a day.  I used it in the morning and in the afternoon.  It is so easy to use, I pressed the nozzle and directly sprayed it to my face.  The reason why I am using this is because it moisturize my facial skin and it left a refreshed finished.&lt;br /&gt;My husband also used this to his face.  I really thank Oz for giving us a complimentary product that is organic and free from harmful chemicals.  Thank you so much Oz.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how it would actually work on one&#x27;s skin. It may be helpful, but after trying it a couple of times, I personally cannot abide the smell. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it&#x27;s very unpleasant. Unfortunately, am tossing it and will be on the hunt for another toner.</li>
            <li> It is nice, but I do not notice any changes.  It just feels like salt water on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t need to use cotton ball to apply the toner.&lt;br /&gt;You just simply shake, spray and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is, you can&#x27;t really tell if it covered entirely or missed the spot (*unlike you use cotton ball to apply them all over the face).&lt;br /&gt;Just like the spray-type sunscreen...very convenient, but can&#x27;t tell if it covered appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s sprayed, I also get worried to open my eyes when it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is quite strong too (lemon-y smell, but not the tasty kind...)</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item before and returned it because it is in spray form.  But, I re-ordered it, because it is a really good product and I apply it by taking the lid/spray top off and dab it on a face pad (or into my clean hands) and gently apply it on my face.  I really like the feel of it and I am using it twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;Sprays bother my sinuses.  I do believe the manufacturer (I love OZ products) might want to add some information about it being a spray.container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you OZ!</li>
            <li> This is a toner unlike any other I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It feels like you&#x27;re spraying sea water on your face because the toner is salty.  It is a good base for after you&#x27;ve cleansed the skin. I wipe a 2% salicylic acid over my face before I spritz and then allow to air dry before I apply serum for the day. I&#x27;m finishing up my 2nd bottle and for sure will keep using.</li>
            <li> ****I WAS GIVEN A COMPLEMENTARY SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW****  Spritz and go for a healthy glow - my skin made it through the winter thanks to the OZ Naturals skin care products - the skin toner is great under of just going out to protect the face. Love the spritz bottle &#x3D; means there&#x27;s no waste and no need for a cotton ball to apply. Scent is good too.</li>
            <li> Nice toner you can feel it working</li>
            <li> Is it safe on sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> Great toner at a great price! I love that it very natural and refreshing, while adding great ingredients like Vitamin C, ocean minerals, and glycolic acid. I also love the vitamin c serum!</li>
            <li> It is fabulous and feels so good on the skin. I was given this product to test and am so pleased with it. It leaves my skin pore free.</li>
            <li> Did not se much of difference comparing to others product used</li>
            <li> Honestly, not my favorite toner. The smell is rancid, I can&#x27;t spray this on my face, and continue to smell it all day. One time, was more than enough for me. I shall stick to my regular toner, and tea tree oil. Sorry Oz, but you missed a mark on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
            <li> Love love this toner.... Especially that it refreshes my face over my makeup. I use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Very cleansing toner. I use it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a reduced price in order to review it. I do not endorse or promote products I wouldn&#x27;t personally recommend to my friends or family.</li>
            <li> Broke me out bad!! At 41 I had no idea I had a sensitivity to Witch Hazel... It&#x27;s been 4 days since I stopped and I am still recovering. will stick to my Obagi.</li>
            <li> Wonderful I spray my face with this twice a day after I let it dry I use the Serum and apply my makeup flawless this product I would recommend</li>
            <li> Really really enjoyed this toner. I&#x27;ve used countless face products so I am always on the lookout for a new one. I have troublesome skin, and this toner worked wonderfully. It was refreshing and really made my face feel good. I don&#x27;t so much use it for anti-aging as I do to help keep my skin clear and healthy, but between being organic and having a boost of Vitamin C, this toner was so much more then your average over the counter toner. I would definitely buy this product again. No bad side effects, just great skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product to sample and provide honest feedback for potential buyers. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This tonic is really pleasing when putting it on.  It says to use it after cleansing and exfoliating, but I have found that it feels good whenever.  It feels like lightly splashing my face with cool water but the ingredients are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Ocean Mineral Tonic has an interesting scent.  The ingredient list has a lot of scientific names but also every day names that are familiar, like witch hazel, vitamin C, and aloe.  I like how the effects of using these products makes my face feel.  I am lucky to have a clear complexion and good skin tone, but the OZ Naturals makes my skin feel and look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order of application for this is: Cleansing cream, exfoliate, spray tonic, serum, and then moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sea Breeze and Neutrogena toners for years and they&#x27;re great but after using this one from OZ Naturals I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll go back to those. This is a \\&quot;toner/tonic\\&quot;, the afore-mentioned toners leave my face cool and refreshed while I notice this one does that but with a longer lasting effect. While the other basic toners eliminate the shine and produce a crisp clean feeling the effect goes away after about 1/2 hr and my oily skin reverts to it&#x27;s natural state. THIS toner/tonic from OZ keeps my face shine free and crisp for much longer. After a shave, application of aftershave and mask I put this on and wow is my facial skin high &amp; tight. Another thing I dig is that this is a spray and not a splash on like other toners.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell but it seems like a good product. I have less break-outs of acne and I think this might help.</li>
            <li> I just found my new favorite toner - OZ Naturals Facial Toner is so refreshing.  I love the fact that you spritz in on, no need for cotton pads &amp; no mess.  It absorbs quickly, has a very pleasant scent and right away my face feels moisturized.  I also like to use it mid-day over my makeup to give it a fresh dewy look.  It&#x27;s great for the whiole body too - especially after toweling off out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product from the company for a fair and unbiased reiew.  But I truly do love their product line.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed to help with my oil/dry skin. Keeps my skin tone even, and clean with a fresh scent</li>
            <li> No cotton pads needed.  Spray and pat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this under my moisturizer and i really like it.  It seems to tighten my shin which makes me happy because i have bigger than normal pores which causes beakouts and my face hasnt broke out in a few days so im completely happy and satisfied with this product and hope even better results as i use it more. Will be back in a,few days to let you know how its going.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times but my face feels great after spritzing.</li>
            <li> I really do like this toner and it works very well. Unfortunately I can only give it 3 stars because it is listed as &amp;#34;organic skin toner&amp;#34; and it is not organic. It is not USDA certified organic and unlike many of OZ Naturals products, this one doesn&#x27;t even say what percentage of it is organic. I have generically of their products and while I do like them, I think it is misleading for them to be marked organic. If that is important to you than you should skip on this toner. If not then this toner has a light refreshing feel and smell. I use it a few times a day and I love the way it makes my skin feel.it goes on like a cool mist and dries nicely without feeling heavy or sticky. I do have sensitive skin and it did not cause a breakout or rosacea flare up. I do not think I will purchase it again just because I do not like it being advertised as organic when it isn&#x27;t, but as far as the product itself is concerned, it is nice. I just would like to see a bit more honesty from OZ naturals.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly, a must have!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for about a week now. At first I tried using it by spraying it on a cotton ball, then I decided to just use the spray directly on my face. I didn&#x27;t think I would like spraying my face like that but I actually prefer it now! It makes this a 2 second step and it makes your face feel fresh and dries quickly. It&#x27;s a great addition to my skin care regimen and I am loving the results so far. It&#x27;s also a great refresher for your make-up about mid-afternoon, just a spritz and you&#x27;re set!</li>
            <li> This is my very first time using a face toner. I have to say I really like the way this toner feels on my face when I spray it on. It feels so refreshing and energizing.  The  scent  is light and I just love the ingredients thats  in it like glycolic acid, ocean minerals, vitamin c &amp; amino acids. This toner has witch hazel that tightens the face and is also an antiaging product for fine lines and wrinkles. If you have dull and dry face this toner is definetly something you should consider in getting. It replenishes and restores your skin to a softer, supple, and radiant skin that will feel like you just stepped out of having a facial treatment but for less the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner is a primer which simply means it is the first thing you can choose to put on your face, neck or chest areas. You can then apply your makeup without it interfering with the benefits if this toner. This toner will give your skin hydration and by it being hydrated it will have your skun be well nourished and have a healthier gliw guaranteed!</li>
            <li> Nice toner. Really leaves my face and neck clean and ready for OZ moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The toner fells cool and refreshing on my skin! My skin used to be dry, but now it isn&#x27;t anymore. I am very happy with this product; I use it under  my sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that when I started using OZ Naturals Facial Toner,  it was really a different experience to spray a toner on my face.  I was used to applying with cotton and for awhile, I stopped using toner all together.  But I really like the ease of the spray. It drys quickly so I can move on to the serums and prepares my face in a refreshing way.  The scent is pleasant, too.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I like the way this smells and feels but I&#x27;m unsure of any other benefits that it&#x27;s providing on its own apart from other products that I&#x27;m using, including OZ Naturals Eye Gel and OZ Naturals Serum.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, smooth, refreshing toner with a great smell!  I have been using this product for months along with various serums from Oz Naturals.  The toner does a great job making the skin feel smooth and clean, preparing the face for the serums.  I just ordered another one and will continue to use with the serum preparations.  The toner also removes any makeup that may have been missed with the cleanser.  This product is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and I&#x27;m not usually a fan of toners. However, because I&#x27;ve been impressed with the quality and results I&#x27;ve experienced using other Oz Naturals products I decided to give this one a try. My initial thought was this  smells just like witch hazel. That smell dissipated quickly and wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me either way. It took some getting used to spraying my face and neck with the toner.  It seems to dry quicker using the spray bottle so that&#x27;s a positive. I had been using Oz Naturals. Vitamin C serum awhile before I began the toner. I will say I believe the toner causes the serum to be more effective overall. My skin is easily irritated, but this product has been gentle enough to use daily. My skin isn&#x27;t red or blotchy after using. My skin feels cool, smooth and clean after using. I sometimes will use this after working out too. I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Feels good works great</li>
