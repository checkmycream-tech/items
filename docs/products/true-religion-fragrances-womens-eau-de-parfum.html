            <li>love it</li>

            <li>this was the real deal at a great price.</li>
            <li>Now all I have to do is keep my daughter away from it. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different fragrances over the years, but this is the best.</li>

            <li>I was so excited!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great fragrance for a young woman!</li>
            <li>great price and fast delivery, love my true religion.</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing and light.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume for cheap price.</li>
            <li>Love True Religion.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled, this is not the authentic True Religion perfume.</li>
            <li>Love true religion.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the full size retail cost was $60... went onto Amazon in hopes that I would find a better deal.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal... Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous for work or going out.</li>
            <li>I enjoy prime shipping</li>
            <li>A bonus is the pretty bottle that it comes in:)</li>
            <li>I will never buy perfumes or colognes from Amazon again if I&#x27;m not going to receive the original product.</li>
            <li>perfume smelled way way too citrusy than the original one.</li>
            <li>I have never owned the original</li>
            <li>Originally saw this at kohls and tried it out</li>
            <li>I assumed that their experience was unique</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>It looks original to me.</li>
            <li>Fruity citrus clean scent</li>
            <li>Very clean crisp and lasts throughout the day...</li>
            <li>not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li>Reordered another bottle hoping it would be like the first… Bright yellow.</li>
            <li>Lasted forever, smelt like True Religion…  </li>
            <li>I have worn True Religion perfume for years.  </li>
            <li>The scent as i can describe is Lemon like, and i prefer Flowery scents and Sweet scents.</li>
            <li>yet not overly sweet</li>
            <li>It was in it&#x27;s original box, factory sealed, and when I opened it, it was the right colour and scent.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend ordering this:)</li>
            <li>My new favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s authentic and came in brand new, wrapped and everything.</li>
            <li>Awesome but didnt last long after spraying</li>
            <li>My order was prompt and exact!  </li>
            <li>Received this perfume in a gift package with lotion and travel size spray that was about $80, used up the regular sized bottle and wanted to order more!</li>
            <li>and I definitely will be purchasing more of this perfume!</li>
            <li>Scent for summer clean crisp grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, you have gained another loyal customer!</li>
            <li>Feminine and lovely soft</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell you what over and under tones it has as I&#x27;m no scent guru, but fresh and clean it is.</li>
            <li>Second bottle was bright yellow… smelled too strong, so i sent it back and got a refund.</li>
            <li>This scent is incredible and long lasting!!</li>
            <li>employee at the store recommended True Religion as it is a fresh clean scent that is not overwhelming and smells really amazing.</li>
            <li>She smells like pure goodness!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I remember wearing before I ran out and have not had a problem with coloring or smelling like alcohol.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>She just got around to opening and noticed the liquid inside the spray bottle is yellowish and not as potent when comparing to another bottle that she had just finished up and had purchased locally.</li>
            <li>I also love the larger size bottle.</li>
            <li>I loooove to smell pretty.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to order this because of the reviews saying that it was not the real thing, but I&#x27;ve had no problems at all!  </li>
            <li>Will buy more soon as possible.</li>
            <li>It is exactly how the product would have been had</li>
            <li>I purchased it at the department store for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>This product  does not smell like a real thing!</li>
            <li>Received exactly as promised and was spot on.</li>
            <li>I actually wanted the Purple Haze version, but I fell in love with this one.</li>
            <li>So i think it is not a fake.</li>
            <li>Loved the initial fragrance of this product, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>authentic, shipped from amazon in a timely manner and is a full size for way less than in stores.</li>
            <li>Should buy 50 ml , 100 ml of this little big , it seems not so beautiful.</li>
            <li>I do wish that the smell stayed as strong as it does in the first ten mins or so the whole time...</li>
            <li>, this is like pure alcohol, it irritates mt skin and the smell goes away in 10 min.</li>
            <li>it has a very mild citrus note over all very elegant&amp;#34; and some how reminds me of &amp;#34;winter and spring at the same time&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is indeed the real thing and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>The 3.4 oz. goes for $79 in the real world, save $35</li>
            <li>I believe it to be real.  </li>
            <li>This has to be straight RUBBING ALCOHOL.</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of D&amp;G&#x27;s Light Blue... but just a bit edgier.</li>
            <li>Bought this direct from Amazon.com, they&#x27;re the only vender I trust when it comes to things like this and salon goods; I&#x27;ve read too many \\&quot;watered</li>
            <li>If you really love this scent, spend the money because apparently 30 bucks gets you a big bottle of piss and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also very modern and classy.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend True Religion.  </li>
            <li>I am sure they bought the recycled bottles and put a water down version of this perfume in it.</li>
            <li>It is not the same as the authentic product that can be found at the local department store.  </li>
            <li>Well I love sticking my nose in my lovely wife&#x27;s hair and smelling that faint smell of the spray</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, or if you just want a very faint smell.</li>
            <li>it arrived on time and the product itself was high quality just as if i would have bought it at the mall but</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li>I would really like to leave no stars, this cologne is clearly</li>
            <li>It came fast and was wraped in the clear plastic cover that store perfumes are wrapped with.</li>
            <li>Love the long lasting sent!</li>
            <li>It BARELY smells like the real thing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for several years and right when I received my package</li>
            <li>Beware, I will be looking for a new vendor.</li>
            <li>Her new fave.</li>
            <li>I picked this up for my wife after she went to the department store to pick out a new perfume.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this perfume from a magazine sample and now can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I live it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years &amp; have a very sensitive nose--</li>
            <li>Love how this perfume smells, i wear it everyday!</li>
            <li>It actually gave me a headache the first time I wore it, and I have been wearing this cologne for a couple years.</li>
            <li>True Religion is getting more difficult to find in retail</li>
            <li>I found it here and was excited to get it for nearly half of what the department stores were selling it for.</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you paid for, this perfume is not only not the real thing</li>
            <li>My wife loves this fragrance and I was able to save at least 50% over the Department Store price.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming they gave me an old bottle both times.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife as a early Valentines gift.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve sprayed it and smelled quiet a few times and it lasts and smells better than this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like someone took a real bottle of True Religion and watered it down several times!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>It came just as expected, smells as expected, and I wear it daily :)</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and lasts a nice long time.  </li>
            <li>But with that being said, within the first half hour of putting it on, you couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing it anymore.</li>
            <li>I do hate girly smells, but this pairs nicely with my old spice deoderant, while still making me smell like a lady;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming but bold enough for people to notice.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to get her some thing different other than flowers and chocolate</li>
            <li>This purchase from Amazon doesn&#x27;t appear to be the real thing and is a watered down cheaper version of the scent.</li>
            <li>ridiculous to have the True Religion name on this...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> this was the real deal at a great price.</li>
            <li> Now all I have to do is keep my daughter away from it. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different fragrances over the years, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, I LOVE this scent for summer.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I would say get this one for sure.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the Clean scent it has!</li>
            <li> I was so excited!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great fragrance for a young woman!</li>
            <li> great price and fast delivery, love my true religion.</li>
            <li> It smells refreshing and light.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume for cheap price.</li>
            <li> Love True Religion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, this is not the authentic True Religion perfume.</li>
            <li> Love true religion.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the full size retail cost was $60... went onto Amazon in hopes that I would find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal... Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous for work or going out.</li>
            <li> I enjoy prime shipping</li>
            <li> A bonus is the pretty bottle that it comes in:)</li>
            <li> I will never buy perfumes or colognes from Amazon again if I&#x27;m not going to receive the original product.</li>
            <li> perfume smelled way way too citrusy than the original one.</li>
            <li> I have never owned the original</li>
            <li> Originally saw this at kohls and tried it out</li>
            <li> I assumed that their experience was unique</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li> It looks original to me.</li>
            <li> Fruity citrus clean scent</li>
            <li> Very clean crisp and lasts throughout the day...</li>
            <li> not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li> Reordered another bottle hoping it would be like the first… Bright yellow.</li>
            <li> Lasted forever, smelt like True Religion…  </li>
            <li> I have worn True Religion perfume for years.  </li>
            <li> The scent as i can describe is Lemon like, and i prefer Flowery scents and Sweet scents.</li>
            <li> yet not overly sweet</li>
            <li> It was in it&#x27;s original box, factory sealed, and when I opened it, it was the right colour and scent.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend ordering this:)</li>
            <li> My new favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s authentic and came in brand new, wrapped and everything.</li>
            <li> Awesome but didnt last long after spraying</li>
            <li> My order was prompt and exact!  </li>
            <li> Received this perfume in a gift package with lotion and travel size spray that was about $80, used up the regular sized bottle and wanted to order more!</li>
            <li> and I definitely will be purchasing more of this perfume!</li>
            <li> Scent for summer clean crisp grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon, you have gained another loyal customer!</li>
            <li> Feminine and lovely soft</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell you what over and under tones it has as I&#x27;m no scent guru, but fresh and clean it is.</li>
            <li> Second bottle was bright yellow… smelled too strong, so i sent it back and got a refund.</li>
            <li> This scent is incredible and long lasting!!</li>
            <li> employee at the store recommended True Religion as it is a fresh clean scent that is not overwhelming and smells really amazing.</li>
            <li> She smells like pure goodness!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I remember wearing before I ran out and have not had a problem with coloring or smelling like alcohol.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> She just got around to opening and noticed the liquid inside the spray bottle is yellowish and not as potent when comparing to another bottle that she had just finished up and had purchased locally.</li>
            <li> I also love the larger size bottle.</li>
            <li> I loooove to smell pretty.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this because of the reviews saying that it was not the real thing, but I&#x27;ve had no problems at all!  </li>
            <li> Will buy more soon as possible.</li>
            <li> It is exactly how the product would have been had</li>
            <li> I purchased it at the department store for a much higher price.</li>
            <li> This product  does not smell like a real thing!</li>
            <li> Received exactly as promised and was spot on.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted the Purple Haze version, but I fell in love with this one.</li>
            <li> So i think it is not a fake.</li>
            <li> Loved the initial fragrance of this product, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> authentic, shipped from amazon in a timely manner and is a full size for way less than in stores.</li>
            <li> Should buy 50 ml , 100 ml of this little big , it seems not so beautiful.</li>
            <li> I do wish that the smell stayed as strong as it does in the first ten mins or so the whole time...</li>
            <li> , this is like pure alcohol, it irritates mt skin and the smell goes away in 10 min.</li>
            <li> it has a very mild citrus note over all very elegant&amp;#34; and some how reminds me of &amp;#34;winter and spring at the same time&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is indeed the real thing and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> The 3.4 oz. goes for $79 in the real world, save $35</li>
            <li> I believe it to be real.  </li>
            <li> This has to be straight RUBBING ALCOHOL.</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of D&amp;G&#x27;s Light Blue... but just a bit edgier.</li>
            <li> Bought this direct from Amazon.com, they&#x27;re the only vender I trust when it comes to things like this and salon goods; I&#x27;ve read too many \\&quot;watered</li>
            <li> If you really love this scent, spend the money because apparently 30 bucks gets you a big bottle of piss and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also very modern and classy.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend True Religion.  </li>
            <li> I am sure they bought the recycled bottles and put a water down version of this perfume in it.</li>
            <li> It is not the same as the authentic product that can be found at the local department store.  </li>
            <li> Well I love sticking my nose in my lovely wife&#x27;s hair and smelling that faint smell of the spray</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, or if you just want a very faint smell.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time and the product itself was high quality just as if i would have bought it at the mall but</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> I would really like to leave no stars, this cologne is clearly</li>
            <li> It came fast and was wraped in the clear plastic cover that store perfumes are wrapped with.</li>
            <li> Love the long lasting sent!</li>
            <li> It BARELY smells like the real thing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for several years and right when I received my package</li>
            <li> Beware, I will be looking for a new vendor.</li>
            <li> Her new fave.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my wife after she went to the department store to pick out a new perfume.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this perfume from a magazine sample and now can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I live it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years &amp; have a very sensitive nose--</li>
            <li> Love how this perfume smells, i wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> It actually gave me a headache the first time I wore it, and I have been wearing this cologne for a couple years.</li>
            <li> True Religion is getting more difficult to find in retail</li>
            <li> I found it here and was excited to get it for nearly half of what the department stores were selling it for.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you paid for, this perfume is not only not the real thing</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance and I was able to save at least 50% over the Department Store price.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming they gave me an old bottle both times.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a early Valentines gift.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve sprayed it and smelled quiet a few times and it lasts and smells better than this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like someone took a real bottle of True Religion and watered it down several times!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It came just as expected, smells as expected, and I wear it daily :)</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and lasts a nice long time.  </li>
            <li> But with that being said, within the first half hour of putting it on, you couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing it anymore.</li>
            <li> I do hate girly smells, but this pairs nicely with my old spice deoderant, while still making me smell like a lady;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming but bold enough for people to notice.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get her some thing different other than flowers and chocolate</li>
            <li> This purchase from Amazon doesn&#x27;t appear to be the real thing and is a watered down cheaper version of the scent.</li>
            <li> ridiculous to have the True Religion name on this...</li>
            <li> It has a yellowish tint and does not provide the same long lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Larger size will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Plus, the scent is long lasting!</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I priced it locally and it was 3 times more expensive from a mall fragrance shop than what Amazon listed it at!  </li>
            <li> its too musky like its been sitting on the shelf for to long.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than I expected and in prestine shape.</li>
            <li> Second it doesn&#x27;t even smell the same once it dries down.</li>
            <li> a fake, first thing is it yellow(?)</li>
            <li> I hate perfumes most of the time, but was introduced to it a few years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> Usually when you buy the cheap stuff at least it smells some what decent but this crap stinks nastier than cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Not worth it....</li>
            <li> It sucks that a few venders have ruined the trust of these products for all other individual venders, just stick to \\&quot;Ships and Sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almost half price than what I pay at department stores.  </li>
            <li> alot less pricey.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to buy it on here for half the price and twice the size.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3.4oz for less than half the cost.</li>
            <li> She never really wore perfume in the past, but I wanted her to pick out something that she would like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She (and I) hate perfumes that are so flowery and strong.</li>
            <li> Macy&#x27;s , got it a little over 40 @</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m out $45 and stuck with this nice looking bottle fill with nasty alcohol they wanna pass as perfume.</li>
            <li> Would it be old, stale, discoloured?</li>
            <li> I wear this almost everyday</li>
            <li> I get that all perfumes are made with alcohol, but this product had such a heavy alcohol smell i jad to wonder if this was a fake or not.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but the store pricing is outrageous.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at a department store for about $70 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past five years.</li>
            <li> Total fake!</li>
            <li> Not good for an all day wear perfume.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I received</li>
            <li> The smell of the fragrance was nothing like the smell that I excepted to smell, it was very weak, once I spray the colgne on about a hour or so</li>
            <li> and I can tell that this one smells wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry this did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> THE SCENT STINKS</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> With all the bad reviews, I was hesitant, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I had a bad feeling about the quality because the price was so low.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I was sick of paying 60 bucks for it</li>
            <li> I give it negative stars!!!!</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived and I smelled it, I was so disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed with Amazon for their lack of quality control!</li>
            <li> I am sad that they stopped making it !!!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible...</li>

            <li> True Religion is perfect for anyone.  The scent is subtle and lasts a nice long time.  This is not an overbearing scent or one that smells of alcohol.  I have been wearing this perfume for over a year and get many compliments on the fragrance.  I would definitely recommend True Religion.  A bonus is the pretty bottle that it comes in:)</li>
            <li> I enjoy prime shipping but I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for years and I can tell that this one smells wrong.  its too musky like its been sitting on the shelf for to long.  Beware, I will be looking for a new vendor.</li>

            <li> I LIKE THE BOTTLE AND THE BOX... THE SCENT STINKS</li>
            <li> Bought as a 2010 Christmas gift for my wife. She just got around to opening and noticed the liquid inside the spray bottle is yellowish and not as potent when comparing to another bottle that she had just finished up and had purchased locally. This purchase from Amazon doesn&#x27;t appear to be the real thing and is a watered down cheaper version of the scent. I will never buy perfumes or colognes from Amazon again if I&#x27;m not going to receive the original product.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you paid for, this perfume is not only not the real thing but then you can&#x27;t return it.

            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, this is not the authentic True Religion perfume. It is not the same as the authentic product that can be found at the local department store.  It has a yellowish tint and does not provide the same long lasting fragrance.  Avoid this product!</li>
            <li> Should buy 50 ml , 100 ml of this little big , it seems not so beautiful.</li>

It sucks that a few venders have ruined the trust of these products for all other individual venders, just stick to \\&quot;Ships and Sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is indeed the real thing and my wife loves it. She smells like pure goodness! The 3.4 oz. goes for $79 in the real world, save $35+  in the e-world.</li>
            <li> Feminine and lovely soft</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> True Religion is getting more difficult to find in retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find it on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great fragrance for a young woman!</li>

            <li> Love how this perfume smells, i wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> Scent for summer clean crisp grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance and I was able to save at least 50% over the Department Store price.&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Great perfume!  Smells good!</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts all day. Very good perfume for those of us who are sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I loooove to smell pretty. I get compliments on this scent all the time. It is one of my favorite perfumes, along with Acqua Di Gioia and Euphoria.</li>
            <li> Originally saw this at kohls and tried it out and I love it ! Great clean scent, very fresh and once it sits on your skin and reacts with your body chemistry it smells even better. authentic, shipped from amazon in a timely manner and is a full size for way less than in stores. very happy!</li>
            <li> The most awesome scent.</li>
            <li> Loved the initial fragrance of this product, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  It should be classified in the cheaper category.</li>
            <li> 79.99 @ Macy&#x27;s , got it a little over 40 @ Amazon, and they got it to me the week of Christmas! Thanks Amazon, you have gained another loyal customer!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so amazing!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent!!  I was hesitant to order this because of the reviews saying that it was not the real thing, but I&#x27;ve had no problems at all!  I believe it to be real.  The scent is lasting.  I recommend this scent and seller!</li>
            <li> So I read someone else&#x27;s review and they mentioned that the color of the perfume was yellow.  I assumed that their experience was unique and I have been extremely happy with everything else I have purchased on Amazon so I decided to go for it.  Well the perfume was yellow and was just off.  I wear this perfume every day and I could tell the smell wasn&#x27;t the same.  If I could I would have returned the item but it was non-returnable (I knew ahead of time but decided to take the risk).  I would never buy this again nor would I buy any product like this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! Quick delivery which is always awesome and packaged with great care.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes.  Plus, the scent is long lasting!</li>
            <li> Awesome but didnt last long after spraying</li>
            <li> Well I love sticking my nose in my lovely wife&#x27;s hair and smelling that faint smell of the spray uuum uuum good</li>
            <li> Love true religion. Would order more. This is my favorite perfume for cheap price. Will buy more soon as possible.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but the store pricing is outrageous. So, when I was doing some post christmas browsing, I came across several vendors with this product. In all actuality, I picked this one because it was the cheapest price at the time, and who has disposable income these days. As I was waiting for it to come, I started reading the reviews. And then I started panicing. Would it be old, stale, discoloured? But, I got it today, and was THRILLED! It was in it&#x27;s original box, factory sealed, and when I opened it, it was the right colour and scent. With all the bad reviews, I was hesitant, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I was completly satisfied with my purchase. It is exactly how the product would have been had I purchased it at the department store for a much higher price. The product arrived earlier than I expected and in prestine shape. Thank you. I&#x27;ll definitely order from them again!!</li>
            <li> I found this product at the department store and loved it, but was shocked at the price. I found it here and was excited to get it for nearly half of what the department stores were selling it for. When I got it, I immediately sprayed some on to see how it smelled. It was more amazing than I had hoped for. But with that being said, within the first half hour of putting it on, you couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing it anymore. This is a good product if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, or if you just want a very faint smell. Not good for an all day wear perfume. You would have to carry it with you and constantly re spray to get an all day smell out of it.</li>
            <li> Had the best price and was the real deal. No knock off or anything! I wear this almost everyday and I love the Clean scent it has!</li>
            <li> Such a great deal... Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this. It came just as expected, smells as expected, and I wear it daily :)</li>
            <li> Love this scent! I get compliments often about it! Larger size will last a very long time. Great product!</li>
            <li> The smell of the fragrance was nothing like the smell that I excepted to smell, it was very weak, once I spray the colgne on about a hour or so later I smell nothing, and this is a very good sense the mens is very good I purchased the men for my husband, and he love, it so I guessI will get a bottle for me. Sorry this did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star. I had a bad feeling about the quality because the price was so low.&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is like pure alcohol, it irritates mt skin and the smell goes away in 10 min. I am sure they bought the recycled bottles and put a water down version of this perfume in it. Extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend she loves it and claims her husband will not leave her alone when she has this on.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent. I love it. I live it. I was sick of paying 60 bucks for it so I decided to buy it on here for half the price and twice the size. The first bottle that was sent to me was awesome. Lasted forever, smelt like True Religion…  so I decided to order another one when it was finished. Second bottle was bright yellow… smelled too strong, so i sent it back and got a refund. Reordered another bottle hoping it would be like the first… Bright yellow. I&#x27;m assuming they gave me an old bottle both times. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying from this seller. If you really love this scent, spend the money because apparently 30 bucks gets you a big bottle of piss and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have worn True Religion perfume for years.  I usually buy it at a department store for about $70 a bottle.  So when I saw this on Amazon for about $30 I was so excited!  When it arrived and I smelled it, I was so disappointed!  It BARELY smells like the real thing!  It&#x27;s like someone took a real bottle of True Religion and watered it down several times!  And it is not returnable!  I am SO disappointed with Amazon for their lack of quality control!</li>
            <li> its an excellent fragrance and the price is right,i will recommend it to anyone that buys it love it thank u</li>
            <li> Great perfume I just love it</li>
            <li> I use this perfume for quite awhile. This product  does not smell like a real thing! it is knock off. Don&#x27;t by it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for several years and right when I received my package I opened the bottle to smell it. This has to be straight RUBBING ALCOHOL. do not buy this product from the seller! I wish I would have read the comments more closely. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the great price. 100% a rip off</li>
            <li> Received exactly as promised and was spot on. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years &amp; have a very sensitive nose-- this was the real deal at a great price. Bonus- I re wives it earlier then promised.</li>
            <li> Received this perfume in a gift package with lotion and travel size spray that was about $80, used up the regular sized bottle and wanted to order more! I ONLY PAID $31, it was here in two days and the bottle is a larger size! So happy and so pleased!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for this to arrive. I have two favorites and this is one of them. Now all I have to do is keep my daughter away from it. :)</li>
            <li> I would really like to leave no stars, this cologne is clearly a fake, first thing is it yellow(?) Second it doesn&#x27;t even smell the same once it dries down. It actually gave me a headache the first time I wore it, and I have been wearing this cologne for a couple years.</li>
            <li> My new favorite fragrance. I will definitely buy this perfume again.  I have tried a lot of different fragrances over the years, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> great price, shipping speed!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the full size retail cost was $60... went onto Amazon in hopes that I would find a better deal. And I sure did! I ordered the 3.4oz for less than half the cost. It&#x27;s authentic and came in brand new, wrapped and everything. Most importantly, I LOVE this scent for summer.</li>
            <li> I love it. I get compliments on it all the time. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! Smells so great not too strong, just right. The bottle is wonderful as well. I would say get this one for sure.</li>
            <li> My dad bought me this perfume YEARS ago. I actually wanted the Purple Haze version, but I fell in love with this one. I have been using it for the past five years.</li>
            <li> I will always loooove this perfume! It&#x27;s an amazing smell that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Total fake! Smells terrible...ridiculous to have the True Religion name on this...I give it negative stars!!!!</li>
            <li> This scent is incredible and long lasting!! It is a beautiful combination of musk and sweet fragrance. I think it would work well as a unisex scent. Its addicting and I definitely will be purchasing more of this perfume!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and sweet smelling.  She&#x27;s been wearing this for years and I refuse to let her run out.  Buy some for your girlfriend / fiancee, wife....you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  If your daughter wears this, hide it from her - you don&#x27;t need the aggravation from the extra attention she&#x27;ll be getting.</li>
            <li> I hate perfumes most of the time, but was introduced to it a few years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back. I do wish that the smell stayed as strong as it does in the first ten mins or so the whole time...but I am a smoker, so that is probably a big factor. I do hate girly smells, but this pairs nicely with my old spice deoderant, while still making me smell like a lady;)</li>
            <li> Favorite Scent! Awesome price! Quick delivery!! Great purchase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It looks original to me. It came fast and was wraped in the clear plastic cover that store perfumes are wrapped with. So i think it is not a fake. I Bought it at a great price of $31 from this seller. I personnlay do not like this kind of scents in perfumes. But my daughter wanted it for Christmas so i bought it for her. The scent as i can describe is Lemon like, and i prefer Flowery scents and Sweet scents.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I received</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a early Valentines gift. I really wanted to get her some thing different other than flowers and chocolate and this worked out great. she loved it and so did I. I sort of bought this on a whim and a hunch from a variety of reviews I had never smelled it before and it is a really great scent it is &amp;#34;Delicate yet not overly sweet it has a very mild citrus note over all very elegant&amp;#34; and some how reminds me of &amp;#34;winter and spring at the same time&amp;#34;  The bottle is also very modern and classy. I will definitely be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for a guy looking for nice gift !</li>
            <li> great price and fast delivery, love my true religion.</li>
            <li> Great price and shipped right away! Would highly recommend ordering this:) And it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great scent for spring &amp; summer. The scent reminds me of D&amp;G&#x27;s Light Blue... but just a bit edgier. I love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Great price!</li>
            <li> It works for my g.f., it smells great on her, and what more could you ask for. This retailer has a great price for the size of the bottle, No complaints here</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Not worth it.... You are buying water.</li>
            <li> I get that all perfumes are made with alcohol, but this product had such a heavy alcohol smell i jad to wonder if this was a fake or not. It smelled nothing like the one from the department store. And when i contacted the seller, they didn&#x27;t do anything about it. Will not buy again</li>
