            <li>It is great for my skin, detoxing (put a baking soda too) also with Nuleo Lavender, it helps me to sleep better!</li>
            <li>Amazingly, I felt the difference immediately after a 20 minute soak.</li>
            <li>and I love a good epsom salt soak.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve tried, the whole family uses it, and we recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>keep it on the floor right by the tub in an attractive enameled tin bucket with a lid, and its own 1-cup scoop attached.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a huge bag to get a good price.</li>
            <li>I would buy from this brand again. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and this seemed like a reputable company.</li>
            <li>and if they lower the price I&#x27;ll buy it more often.</li>
            <li>but this really alleviated some joint pain I was having.  </li>
            <li>A lot more eye contact.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands</li>
            <li>I use this salt 3x a week, sometimes more depending on the week.  </li>
            <li>He has an excellent diet, even so he still wasn&#x27;t getting enough magnesium.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s way more than I ever heard of, or that the instructions say to use.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;m from the Bay Area so nice way to support my original home town.</li>
            <li>USP is a great bargain, a high quality salt that leaves you feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>The salts are fine and so easy to work with, plus they work so well on sore muscles!</li>
            <li>The epson salt is pretty and the price was good when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those wonderful things in life that really works, and with no negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;It also works for mom!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to get it in a large quantity for a good price.</li>
            <li>I require Espom Salt baths a few times a week to detox, and this was a great purchase!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been confirmed.  </li>
            <li>I am super impressed with the quality, the service, the packaging.....and the free sample of a different smoky salt (which I will definitely be ordering to cook with!).</li>
            <li>This epsom salt dissolves quickly and provides relief for sore muscles.</li>
            <li>The quantity and quality for the price is Exceptional (!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good to use in a homemade weed killer (with vinegar and Dawn dish soap... works better than Round Up).</li>
            <li>I love Epsom salt baths so highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>so it will last longer, but i go through it quickly!!!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a potent Epsom Salt that I could buy in bulk for my three year old son, who has been diagnosed with Autism.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, my son takes epson salt baths two to three times a week to help naturally with ADHD</li>
            <li>A massage therapist suggested using 4 cups worth in the bath.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised and shipped very fast</li>
            <li>My first time ordering from them</li>
            <li>He has his blood tested a few weeks ago and his magnesium levels are good</li>
            <li>I used a whole cup the first night, and was surprised to find he could not sleep at all after, he was too full of energy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li>So much calmer.  </li>
            <li>a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The difference in my son is astounding.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>Does not cake, dissolves well and really seams to sooth sore muscles better than other &amp;#34;Epsom Salt&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The difference between this Epsom Salt and what you may pick up at the drug store is apparent right from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The grains are a lot more clear, they dissolve easily in water, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Dissolves fast and clear.</li>
            <li>I also use it for my dog&#x27;s baths and it has helped clear &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; spots.</li>
            <li>Oh so soft skin, relaxed muscles,</li>
            <li>I like using a few cups in a warm bath,and the small boxes I find locally go too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Much better than buying the small bags of it at the local store.  </li>
            <li>After coming across a paper by Dr. Rosemary Waring I realized that kids who need the Magnesium most need to be introduced more slowly, so I cut back to a quarter cup and slowly built up to a cup over</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s SO heavy) is only exceeded by the pleasure of having enough available for every bath.</li>

            <li> I love Epsom salt baths so highly recommend this product.  It lasts awhile!</li>
            <li> Quality product. Helps my aches and pains, and I&#x27;ve even noticed it softens my skin when I come out of the bath. I would buy from this brand again. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It was great... I run and use epsom salt soaks to keep the soreness down.  It was great to have it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> I require Espom Salt baths a few times a week to detox, and this was a great purchase!  Sizing and pricing was just what I was looking for!  Thank you for a wonderful shopping experience!</li>
            <li> The epson salt is pretty and the price was good when I bought it.  I&#x27;m not sure about the differences, except I knew I was using it for bath soaks and this seemed like a reputable company. Plus I&#x27;m from the Bay Area so nice way to support my original home town. I&#x27;ve bought it twice and if they lower the price I&#x27;ll buy it more often. I had to buy a huge bag to get a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started putting two cups into bath water after a hard run or long bike ride and I can tell a difference the next day. It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to get it in a large quantity for a good price.</li>
            <li> I like using a few cups in a warm bath,and the small boxes I find locally go too quickly.  This last a long time.  I also use it for my dog&#x27;s baths and it has helped clear &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; spots.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased a big bag of Epsom Salts from the San Francisco Salt Company to make bath bombs.  These are the best that I have ever used!  The salts are fine and so easy to work with, plus they work so well on sore muscles! I also noticed that they aren&#x27;t drying to the skin like other brands. Highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of baths (I&#x27;m a man) but this really alleviated some joint pain I was having.  Soak it up</li>
            <li> My first time ordering from them and I have to say....WOW!!!  I am super impressed with the quality, the service, the packaging.....and the free sample of a different smoky salt (which I will definitely be ordering to cook with!).</li>
            <li> The difference between this Epsom Salt and what you may pick up at the drug store is apparent right from the beginning.  The grains are a lot more clear, they dissolve easily in water, and a little goes a long way.  I was looking for a potent Epsom Salt that I could buy in bulk for my three year old son, who has been diagnosed with Autism.  (It is said to help with sleep and maintain a calmer attitude).  I used a whole cup the first night, and was surprised to find he could not sleep at all after, he was too full of energy.  After coming across a paper by Dr. Rosemary Waring I realized that kids who need the Magnesium most need to be introduced more slowly, so I cut back to a quarter cup and slowly built up to a cup over a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The difference in my son is astounding.  So much calmer.  A lot more eye contact.  This is one of those wonderful things in life that really works, and with no negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;It also works for mom!  Oh so soft skin, relaxed muscles, a deeper sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I will order again.</li>
            <li> If you workout, you need this!!!  This epsom salt dissolves quickly and provides relief for sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I like to take baths to relax after a hard day&#x27;s work and I love a good epsom salt soak. USP is a great bargain, a high quality salt that leaves you feeling refreshed. 20lbs was about the largest size I could find that was not a solid cube. It comes in a thick mil plastic bag with a zip-loc lock enclosure. The bag is a little rigid so you can simply pour out what you need, reseal and soak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and i just love this one!!  I got the big bag so it will last longer, but i go through it quickly!!!  so relaxing....i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great salt.  I use this salt 3x a week, sometimes more depending on the week.  It is great for my skin, detoxing (put a baking soda too) also with Nuleo Lavender, it helps me to sleep better!</li>
            <li> The quantity and quality for the price is Exceptional (!)&lt;br /&gt;And the pleasure of having it delivered to your door (it&#x27;s SO heavy) is only exceeded by the pleasure of having enough available for every bath. It&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve tried, the whole family uses it, and we recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;We keep it on the floor right by the tub in an attractive enameled tin bucket with a lid, and its own 1-cup scoop attached.</li>
            <li> 100% No bull,no fuss.</li>
            <li> We go through a bag of this every couple of months.  I love this stuff, my son takes epson salt baths two to three times a week to help naturally with ADHD symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been confirmed.  He has an excellent diet, even so he still wasn&#x27;t getting enough magnesium.  He has his blood tested a few weeks ago and his magnesium levels are good and it&#x27;s still helping with calming him.  It&#x27;s also good to use in a homemade weed killer (with vinegar and Dawn dish soap... works better than Round Up).</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and shipped very fast</li>
            <li> Does not cake, dissolves well and really seams to sooth sore muscles better than other &amp;#34;Epsom Salt&amp;#34; brands we have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$/lb is great also!</li>
            <li> A massage therapist suggested using 4 cups worth in the bath. That&#x27;s way more than I ever heard of, or that the instructions say to use. Amazingly, I felt the difference immediately after a 20 minute soak. I ordered a 20 lb. bag of epsom salt and a 10 lb. bag of sea salt. I&#x27;ve finally discovered what makes this so healthful.</li>
            <li> Great product at a very good price.  Much better than buying the small bags of it at the local store.  Will last quite a while.  Looks like great quality as well.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Great value.</li>
            <li> Using it for my reef tank!  Dissolves fast and clear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t run a bath without it...</li>
