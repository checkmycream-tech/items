            <li>It must be good.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with their products, as always.</li>
            <li>When I first got rigid gas permeable contact lenses about 25 years ago, Lobob was recommended to me as the best cleaner for preventing the build up of film and debris on their surfaces.  </li>
            <li>but my ophthalmologist has always liked it.</li>
            <li>It did the best job on hard and now does the best job on gas permeable lens.</li>
            <li>Better than Lobob&#x27;s Optimum, this cleaner removes the most stubborn grease, oil and gunky deposits from lens with a minimum of effort.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy it at Walgreens and Wal-Mart; now I have to order it online</li>
            <li>It gets the most stubborn deposits off the lens with a minimum of effort.</li>

            <li>Cleans 10x better than Boston.</li>

            <li>This is such a great cleaner.  </li>
            <li>The best contact lens cleaner for hard and/or gas permeable lens is Lobob.</li>
            <li>She preferred this brand for the good job it did on her contacts and the low price.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>I only get new contacts about every 5 years and they are always in great shape and condition after all that use.</li>

            <li>Thanks,  Linda Seldow</li>
            <li>Wish it was available in the larger size!</li>

            <li>It has been hard to find at times, so many thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very clear, but realize this is based on new lenses as well.</li>

            <li>I have used all of the Lobob products for years and love them, they are hard to find</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t surprised when she told him she used Lobob.</li>
            <li>My eye Doctor recommends this product highly and the only way to find it in this area, is on line.</li>
            <li>and he finds it does a better job than other cleaners he has dried.  </li>

            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY CLEANING SOLUTION THAT WE USE IN MY HOUSE.  IT CLEANS AND REFRESHES OUR CONTACTS AND MAKES IT EASY ON OUR EYES.</li>
            <li> When I first got rigid gas permeable contact lenses about 25 years ago, Lobob was recommended to me as the best cleaner for preventing the build up of film and debris on their surfaces.  It is the only cleaner I have used all these years and it has lived up to that reputation.  I used to be able to buy it at Walgreens and Wal-Mart; now I have to order it online but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cleaner for Gas Perm Contact Lens.  I have used this product for many years and then had a hard time finding it in my area, so was so thrilled to find it on Amazon.  I have tried many other cleaners and have been very unhappy with them, so this really makes my day.  This is probably the very best cleaner out there.</li>

            <li> My husband has been using Lobob hard lens cleaner for years and he finds it does a better job than other cleaners he has dried.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so we order online.</li>
            <li> yep love this product.  Jill Lehr</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn hard lenses for 30+ years and you can&#x27;t buy a better cleaning solution. It has been hard to find at times, so many thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very good cleaner for hard contact lenses</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He loves it. It must be good.  Thanks,  Linda Seldow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn semi-rigid contact lenses for over 40 years and this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to remove gook from the lens.  I usually use another product because it comes with the soaking solution I buy.  However, it did not get the yucky stuff off my lenses and they were cloudy even tho I&#x27;d cleaned them.  I ordered Lobob and it did the trick.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Been wearing hard contacts since 1969; this works as well as any cleaner I have ever used and is about half the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using Lobob hard lens cleaner for at least 20 years.  It did the best job on hard and now does the best job on gas permeable lens. Better than Lobob&#x27;s Optimum, this cleaner removes the most stubborn grease, oil and gunky deposits from lens with a minimum of effort.  It is 1000% better than the other cleaners.  The only other cleaner I use is when I have hard calcium deposits or buildup - this saves a trip to the eye doc - when I use Alcon&#x27;s enzyme Supra Clens  [[ASIN:B000GCI95U Opti-Free Supra Clens Daily Protein Remover, 0.1 Fluid Ounce]][[ASIN:B001ET76OE Opti-Free Supra Clens Daily Protein Remover (.1 Fluid Ounces) (Pack of 3)]]  With these two products you are set!</li>
            <li> I had bought this for my wife in the past at Walmart but then it vanished from their shelves.  She preferred this brand for the good job it did on her contacts and the low price.  Glad we found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This cleaner is for the long time hard contact lenses.  If you don&#x27;t have those, you don&#x27;t want this.  My eye doctor recommended this product to me as my contacts were cloudy.  However, I got new contact lenses and began using Lobob.  Very clear, but realize this is based on new lenses as well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find Lobob here in Dallas but my ophthalmologist has always liked it. Sure does what is needed for GP lenses.</li>
            <li> High quality cleaning solution for rigid gas perm lenses.</li>
            <li> My eyes leave a lot of protein deposits on my lenses.  My eye Doctor recommends this product highly and the only way to find it in this area, is on line.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have used it for many years. This is the only cleaner that works for me with my hard contac lenses. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for  40+ years.  It does a terrific job of cleaning the debris that collects after 10 hours of wearing contacts.  I only get new contacts about every 5 years and they are always in great shape and condition after all that use.</li>
            <li> This is such a great cleaner.  I need the best and this item fits my needs.</li>
            <li> I really love the Lobob products.  I have used all of the Lobob products for years and love them, they are hard to find so I am glald Amazon has them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> No problems with the order. Came quickly and as described. I would purchase from them again.</li>

            <li> This is the best product i have found for cleaning gas permeable contact lenses. I will continue to buy it/</li>
            <li> This product truly is great.</li>
            <li> I have been using LoBob on the same pair of gas permeable lenses for several years.  Barely even need polishing at my check-ups.</li>
            <li> I have used Lobob for many years and it is the best cleaner for gas permeable lenses ever! You should try it.</li>
            <li> smooth transaction , been using this product for over 25 years, thanks</li>

            <li> My wife has used Lobob on her gas permeable lens for over 20 years. Once she apologized to the eye doctor because she hadn&#x27;t used the deep cleaner stuff for a long time. He said her contacts looked fine and asked what cleaner she used. He wasn&#x27;t surprised when she told him she used Lobob. She has only used another cleaner once when we couldn&#x27;t find Lobob at the store. That one sure did a sad job!</li>
            <li> Only cleaner I will use on Hard contact lenses....I have specially made lenses and this stuff cleans them safely and well! at $350 per pair of contac&#x27;s this is the best cleaner on the market!</li>
