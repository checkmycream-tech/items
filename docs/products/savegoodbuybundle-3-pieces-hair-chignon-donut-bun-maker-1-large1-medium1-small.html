            <li>Seriously, it is worth the money and 100 times better than the sock bun!</li>
            <li>My mom loved the look so much, that she&#x27;s asked me to order one for herself too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but these are so convenient and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>easy and quick to use!</li>
            <li>I cut my hair once every 6 months, so I use the three sizes to fit my hair lenght.</li>
            <li>And, just to tell you how secure the bun was, let me add this -</li>
            <li>But the donuts were of good quality, and I love them for the &amp;#34;put-together&amp;#34; look that only takes 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The large one  is more for medium length hair which I have.  </li>
            <li>These multi sized donuts are cool.</li>
            <li>good but the biggest size is medium size tactfully not big as i thought</li>
            <li>I can confidently say that the smallest one would be usually perfect for most people, and you can actually avoid getting the 3 piece set, and instead opt for the single smallest size individually from amazon.</li>
            <li>And once I was at the party, I cant tell you how many people complimented my look and how professionally done it looked!</li>
            <li>I rarely wear buns or my hair up</li>
            <li>Totally natural :)</li>
            <li>Other than that the product was good.</li>
            <li>got this 3 piece set, and I used the smallest one for my hair, and it was about right on my face.</li>
            <li>These work great, but the big one is so big</li>
            <li>This item makes a nice bun, however it is loose.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The material and quality is the same of that one from the beauty store, at a much better price for 3.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was wanted.  </li>
            <li>First time using this product</li>
            <li>I wouldnt use the medium and the large size</li>
            <li>The largest one is too large for my hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND this!</li>

            <li> In fact, I was concerned that i might have breakage of hair, since my hair would be so tightly held up in the chignon!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> being former Army i have always used the sock method and my hair never staid in place and by the end of the day the sock was showing. finally broke down and got these and im very happy with it. wish they would have had these 13 years ago</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Lazy hair days &#x3D; every day for me. I use only the biggest donut (the other two feel slightly too small).

But the donuts were of good quality, and I love them for the &amp;#34;put-together&amp;#34; look that only takes 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> These multi sized donuts are cool. I rarely wear buns or my hair up but these are so convenient and easy to wear. I figured With summer coming up i get lazy to dry my hair and curl it on HOT days,so this will suffice. Genius idea. :)</li>
            <li> good but the biggest size is medium size tactfully not big as i thought&lt;br /&gt;and the small one is soooo tiny for little grls :(&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t like the sizes :(</li>
            <li> Want the perfect professional looking bun? Then you need these. My hair is really long so I like that the set came with an extra large doughnut. I gave the smaller ones to friends.</li>
            <li> Love them! I have another chignon medium piece I bought at a beauty store for about $4 (just for one). The material and quality is the same of that one from the beauty store, at a much better price for 3.  Shipping time was just over two weeks.</li>
            <li> took a bit to receive them  , would recommend to a friend , very easy to use but you have to anchor them down with bobby pins or it looks funny</li>
            <li> they work great! easy and quick to use! I use it al the time on myself and others! Definitely satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted that top bun look and it&#x27;s so simple and chic. Bought these and they worked perfectly for that professional top bun look! Highly recommend to everyone!</li>

            <li> First time using this product and I must say, I love it!!!!!! It&#x27;s so easy to use and it makes my hair look so professionally done.</li>
            <li> I got this last week in my  mailbox and used it for the first time yesterday. I had a party to attend and I decided to go with the top bun look! So I put this at the end of my ponytail and kept rolling upwards, until I achieved the look! And once I was at the party, I cant tell you how many people complimented my look and how professionally done it looked! People were asking me how you made it so flawlessly! Of course, now I know and they know it as well! Seriously, it is worth the money and 100 times better than the sock bun! The sock bun still might have a chance of being messy, but this - NO WAY! It is just epic! My mom loved the look so much, that she&#x27;s asked me to order one for herself too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the bun using the TIGI Bed Head Hard Head Hair Spray and once the bun was in place, I just sprayed that on top of the look, in order to hold any fly aways in place. And, just to tell you how secure the bun was, let me add this - I never had to use a single bobby pin or anything! I didnt really need the hair spray either, but I used it for those smaller uneven length hair. If your hair length is uniform, you wont need the hairspray; otherwise, simply couple the final look with any hard hold hairspray you have. I personally love the TIGI one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even slept the night with the bun on, and when I woke up, it was still intact, and just in place! And, I had some nice curls in my hair too! :) So, one day you could have the top bun look, the other day, you effortlessly, get the waves :) No heating, no styling! Totally natural :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this 3 piece set, and I used the smallest one for my hair, and it was about right on my face. Sufficiently big actually. I wouldnt use the medium and the large size, becoz I think they would be hugeee on my face. I can confidently say that the smallest one would be usually perfect for most people, and you can actually avoid getting the 3 piece set, and instead opt for the single smallest size individually from amazon. But it depends on your preference. I go with the smallest size and its just perfect for look. For the other 2 sizes, I cant comment since I havnt tried them on, and wont, most likely. But will post an update in case I do. Also, I dont have very thick volumnous hair. I have very fine hair and they are thin too in volume, so I was concerned that they might not cover the chignon properly and evenly, and thus I opted for the smallest size. And not only my hair covered it veryyy well, but the size of the bun was right too! Now I know my hair can cover the bigger sizes of this as well, but the bigger-bun look wont be my personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, even without the spray, i am telling you, it wont budge a mm! And the best part is that you hair wont feel like its been stretched or damaged in any way! It&#x27;s soo comfortable to use that you wont have a problem! In fact, I was concerned that i might have breakage of hair, since my hair would be so tightly held up in the chignon! But not a single hair got entangled in it and let me add- I have pretty long hair. Touching my waist. Just be patient especially while rolling it on the top, just when you have the last roll to make. And you&#x27;d be the show-stopper! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this! It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I am ordering one for my mom right away! Trust me, you will soooo love it! I for one, sure do :)on. But it depends on your preference. I go with the smallest size and its just perfect for look. For the other 2 sizes, I cant comment since I havnt tried them on, and wont, most likely. But will post an update in case I do. Also, I dont have very thick volumnous hair.

            <li> I&#x27;ve made my own donut using socks and it works better than this. This item makes a nice bun, however it is loose. I had to redo my bun every couple hours. The bun sort of hangs there, it might be the type of material that is preventing the tightness, or maybe I need to put some product in my hair to prevent it from sliding.</li>
            <li> It does the job  well done.  The large one  is more for medium length hair which I have.  I have been using it to go to the gym and work.  It is very secure and it very comfortable.  It takes long time for delivery, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved them!</li>
            <li> These work great, but the big one is so big, I had to give it away to a friend who has super thick hair down to her butt, and it still was almost too big!</li>
            <li> The largest one is too large for my hair but I guess that my fault hopefully my hair will grow to be that length one day. Other than that the product was good.</li>
            <li> you really have to have very long hair for it to work and also thin hair, I have mid-back length hair and thick and just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
