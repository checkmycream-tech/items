            <li>arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t overly hydrating and dries on my skin fairly quickly, though it is alcohol-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also nice for mid day in the steamy summer.</li>
            <li>Not only is this toner amazingly gentle -- I&#x27;ve been using it with the rose foaming soap for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>This is our current favorite face-targeted skin toner.</li>

            <li>This is a decent product at a decent price.</li>
            <li>believe it might also be occasionally causing an itching sensation right after use, though it doesn&#x27;t happen every time I use it (even though the products and order of application doesn&#x27;t change).&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the product is natural.</li>
            <li>have been using for a month now, in combo with the night cream, and don&#x27;t notice a difference as far as skin tone/evenness.  </li>
            <li>The toner is so refreshing and is better than the expensive chemical toners I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I might repurchase this in the future, but first I will try other things to see if I like them</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had a hard time finding anything that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Since using the cleanser, toner and serum, my pores are smaller, acne scars and sun spots are fading, and my breakouts are are minimal (like 1 little pimple during my menses).</li>

            <li> I do not plan to repurchase, and instead will give apple cider vinegar a try (not that I will get moisture from that, but it will at least help slough skin cells).</li>
            <li> so was basically a useless step in my routine.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is a decent product at a decent price. I wouldn&#x27;t say it performed any miracles but it feels nice going on, doesn&#x27;t clog your skin or feel greasy. For the price, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Andalou Naturals Clementine Plus C Illuminating Toner spray is a wonderful product. I enjoy the refreshing my skin receives when I spay this on my face after cleansing. My complexion is glowing. And the product is natural. I definitely recommend this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually love this product, but the spritz didn&#x27;t work on the one I ordered from Amazon, so really, no use.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to use it by pouring the content, I spilled it everywhere.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I don&#x27;t understand the other review here since this is a toner and NOT a moisturizer.  I find it fabulously refreshing after washing my face and before moisturizing.  It smells really clean and nice, too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year. In fact I use Andalou exclusively and this is a great product for your regiment. My pores are tight! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this toner. I use it every morning, between washing my face and applying moisturizer. The smell is great and it absorbs quickly. I have been using this product for just over two months and can honestly this it makes my skin looks brighter throughout the day,</li>
            <li> Smells good, refreshing and chemical free.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my face.</li>
            <li> I love this toner.  Smells nice and works great.  Also nice for mid day in the steamy summer.</li>
            <li> skin feels and looks better</li>
            <li> I have been using it around two weeks and I might say it improves my complexion , and skin looked hydrated I will definitely recommend this brand and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product I cannot do without it! My hair is manageable and shiny!</li>
            <li> I love it i feel a huge difference on my face</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had a hard time finding anything that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Not only is this toner amazingly gentle -- I&#x27;ve been using it with the rose foaming soap for 2 weeks and I have had a number of people comment on how amazingly clear and bright my skin looks. That&#x27;s a real (and unusual) pleasure for me. The &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; around my eyes are much less noticeable.  These products are expensive -- but less so on amazon  --- WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
            <li> This is our current favorite face-targeted skin toner. It has a nice smell and does a nice job of neutralizing everything after doing more severe cleaning. Can work as a basic cleaner with nothing else, but overall should be used after an alcohol or acid wash.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly. Just as described.</li>
            <li> Thus toner is amazing. I use all the andalou products and I have to say I&#x27;m so happy to find these products. The toner is so refreshing and is better than the expensive chemical toners I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Refreshing as a toner and also for setting makeup.</li>
            <li> I might repurchase this in the future, but first I will try other things to see if I like them better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for a month now, in combo with the night cream, and don&#x27;t notice a difference as far as skin tone/evenness.

I cannot say that it has had any \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; effect.  It does not feel like it adds any moisture, so was basically a useless step in my routine.  I do not plan to repurchase, and instead will give apple cider vinegar a try (not that I will get moisture from that, but it will at least help slough skin cells).</li>
            <li> This is a great all natural toner for the price. It really assists in the absorption of my serums and moisturizers. Additionally it works well as a skin refresher and helps set make-up! The scent is clean and invigorating and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and bright.  I have been using the Andalou Brightening products for about 1 year and I have noticed a brighter and smother complexion. Since using the cleanser, toner and serum, my pores are smaller, acne scars and sun spots are fading, and my breakouts are are minimal (like 1 little pimple during my menses).</li>
