            <li>I&#x27;ll purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>Most products burn my eyes, this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I feel the bottle will last me about six months which is Awesome for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and also use on my hands.</li>
            <li>I also ordered for my two daughters and they also love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell however, and am using the remainder for my legs.  </li>
            <li>It needs to be used sparingly...kind of greasy with strong scent.  </li>
            <li>Has softened and brightened my skin incredibly and has reduced wrinkles and lines on my face and neck better than any other product I have used.  </li>
            <li>fine lines .</li>
            <li>Wonderfully light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>I will give it that it&#x27;s very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Works great on all skin types, I have combo, my mom has dry skin.</li>
            <li>this lotion makes my face so soft and hydrates it amazing</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s perfect of your looking for a thick concentrated moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Mix it with a little bio-ferment sea kelp or use it alone...........by far the best product I have used in years.  </li>
            <li>and you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>hands down the best natural and most affected facial cream out on the market …… Ladies it&#x27;s worth the try….</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the absolute best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much softer and the dry patches are so much better!</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing I would like more is having SPF</li>
            <li>Surprisingly i didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with this clogging my pores, but then again I didn&#x27;t apply it heavily in my prone areas.</li>
            <li>It just made my skin more dry.</li>
            <li>I do still tan just not as much.</li>
            <li>very well under makeup.</li>
            <li>You really get a lot of product for your money.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly for anyone!</li>
            <li>but I can live without it since this makes my life so much simpler.</li>
            <li>Really works well in the humid climate I live it.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Brallywood Butta&lt;</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this is the first time a face cream has made me break out.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a very large bottle</li>
            <li>I only need to just use this one product now instead of my normal array of toner+jojoba oil+serum+moisturizer set.</li>
            <li>anymore I really need something for my dry skin</li>
            <li>I normally have pretty low maintenance skin but during the last year I&#x27;ve been getting dry patches on my cheeks and nothing short of professional facials every month kept it in check.</li>
            <li>My fave gets really dry and this is the first lotion that I&#x27;ve had that softens my skin without causing extra oily skin and breakouts.</li>
            <li>I went back to my Lush moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy and has a nice very faint citrus smell, plus it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I gave this four stars because I live in Colorado and it is very very dry</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin</li>

            <li> This review is going to be very long</li>
            <li> I worked at a tanning place for a very long time 6 years.</li>
            <li> Well my face is just as dry.</li>
            <li> As well as a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin prone to eczema break-outs in the winter months and this moisturizer lives up to all it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for the last 3 months and still have 85% left.</li>
            <li> and it seriously ends my search for my new moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with reactions to face products or my skin still being too dry after using a moisturizer, but not the case with this one.</li>
            <li> I at the time was looking for something a little lighter.</li>
            <li> It does not sink into your skin so when you apply your foundation it cakes up into little chunks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very very heavy, I would recommend this for the harsh winter months but never summer.</li>
            <li> Expensive but lasts a long time, makes it cheaper than Oil of Olay regenerist ounce for ounce.</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle and I am surprised at how bad it smells, like orange baby aspirin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Sorry Brallywood :-(</li>
            <li> Give it a try - you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Terrible!  </li>

            <li> I love this ! Smells fantastic and makes my face feel so good. Lots of product in the bottle, it will last me a while. I&#x27;ll purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. My fave gets really dry and this is the first lotion that I&#x27;ve had that softens my skin without causing extra oily skin and breakouts. I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 days and I can already see a difference in my skin...it&#x27;s much softer and the dry patches are so much better!</li>
            <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, also not the worst. it&#x27;s very very heavy, I would recommend this for the harsh winter months but never summer. Surprisingly i didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with this clogging my pores, but then again I didn&#x27;t apply it heavily in my prone areas.

            <li> It smells really good - but its greasy and just not that great. I went back to my Lush moisturizer. Sorry Brallywood :-(</li>

            <li> Not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It needs to be used sparingly...kind of greasy with strong scent.  I only got to use it a handful of times because I accidentally knocked it off the bathroom sink and it shattered all over the floor.  I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! I normally have pretty low maintenance skin but during the last year I&#x27;ve been getting dry patches on my cheeks and nothing short of professional facials every month kept it in check. After using this for about a week my face is back to being soft and no more dry patches.

            <li> I have a lot of trouble with reactions to face products or my skin still being too dry after using a moisturizer, but not the case with this one. I love it! This is my second bottle and I will never buy another brand of moisturizer again!</li>
            <li> It does not sink into your skin so when you apply your foundation it cakes up into little chunks.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t help. It just made my skin more dry.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully light.  I will keep using this over Olay.</li>
            <li> This review is going to be very long and that&#x27;s ok. I gave this four stars because I live in Colorado and it is very very dry I&#x27;m always putting on chap stick. Well my face is just as dry. As well as a dry climate. I ran. I worked at a tanning place for a very long time 6 years. Now I&#x27;m older I don&#x27;t tan like that anymore I really need something for my dry skin cause I do still tan just not as much. This lotion smell great I will give it that it&#x27;s very fresh feeling. I have been using it for about three months now. Just after showing and before bed something&#x27;s. Sometimes I even put in on after I&#x27;m done tanning. I feel the bottle will last me about six months which is Awesome for the price. It was voted number one mositurizerfor 2014. I just feel like it does not give me the moisture I need for my skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell.  Leaves my skin feeling soft, but not greasy.  Really works well in the humid climate I live it.  Gives a nice glow to my make up.</li>
            <li> One of the best natural moisturizers on the market!&lt;br /&gt;Sets very well under makeup. No greasiness perfect for face and body. Works great on all skin types, I have combo, my mom has dry skin. this stuff does does wonders with all skin types. I highly recommend Brallywood Butta&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, too. You really get a lot of product for your money. Money well spent!</li>
            <li> Love this! Love the smell and also use on my hands. I also ordered for my two daughters and they also love it.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the absolute best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have extremely dry skin prone to eczema break-outs in the winter months and this moisturizer lives up to all it&#x27;s claims. It absorbs into the skin smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy and has a nice very faint citrus smell, plus it&#x27;s ingredients are all natural. My last bottle lasted 10 months! I recommend it highly for anyone! At this price you can&#x27;t beat the quality you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle and I am surprised at how bad it smells, like orange baby aspirin. I don&#x27;t want to put this on my body, let alone my face. I&#x27;m sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years now.  I&#x27;ll never go back to another facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about the yummy smell of this product! It&#x27;s light weight and I have had no issues with break outs. It&#x27;s my newest go to moisturizer</li>
            <li> Love it! I also add sea kelp to this and it helps to even skin tone and keep you hydrated during the winter months.</li>
            <li> this lotion makes my face so soft and hydrates it amazing</li>
            <li> hands down the best natural and most affected facial cream out on the market …… Ladies it&#x27;s worth the try…. I mix a dime size of NCN sea Kelp with it to tighten those !!!! fine lines . And I get complements  on how great my skin looks ( and how it feels ) amazing!!…..I never praise a product ever but this one gets 5 plus stars from me!!!</li>
            <li> Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this is the first time a face cream has made me break out.  Terrible!  I love the smell however, and am using the remainder for my legs.  But never again will I put this on my face.  Back to Guinot products for me!</li>
