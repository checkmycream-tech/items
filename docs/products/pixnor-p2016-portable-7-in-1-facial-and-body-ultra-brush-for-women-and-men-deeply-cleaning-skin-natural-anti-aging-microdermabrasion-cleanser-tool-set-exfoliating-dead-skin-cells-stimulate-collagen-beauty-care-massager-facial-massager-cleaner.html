            <li>Fingers crossed for another great result, when I have more to tell, I&#x27;ll update this review!</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing and its great for teenager skin also.</li>
            <li>This is a good substitute if you can&#x27;t afford to put out the money.</li>
            <li>Good at removing makeup and washing face...that is what I use it for.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so good.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good value and just about anyone can find some use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pain didn&#x27;t subside until I put some ice on the area for a good twenty minutes.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, fast shipping,  great seller!!</li>
            <li>Does a great job cleaning my face and the accessories are nice to have as well.</li>
            <li>, I really loved this brush.</li>
            <li>the shape and color of scars, I think it is a good thing, that shows </li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll probably damage the machine) to get good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i assure that this will work good</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It Works Really Good.</li>
            <li>But that one does a good job of exfoliating and stimulating collagen production.  </li>
            <li>The attachments were of good quality, the machine itself felt good in my hand.</li>
            <li>It cleans and brighten my skin so good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li>Also, perhaps it could be a bit stronger -- but remember you are getting the PIXNOR at a really good price compared to the pricey versions out there.</li>
            <li>Good, compact.</li>
            <li>and it gives my face a good scrub with no harshness.</li>
            <li>make-up sponge did a good job of working make-up remover into the skin and taking the make-up off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush heads appear to be fairly durable.</li>

            <li>I especially love the two different sanding attachments and find they work great on callouses, elbows, and I even sometimes use the fine one on my toenails as a nail file.  </li>
            <li>I find using my hands in circular motion is faster and more effective.  </li>
            <li>If it was faster and the heads/attachments did more, I would be loving this.   </li>
            <li>&gt;* Advanced cleansing system keeps a good effectiveness as skin professionals sold&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far, and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Honestly will probably use more on my toes/feet than my face</li>

            <li>Easy to use, and portable!</li>
            <li>thanks, it works really good on my skin!</li>
            <li>It operates on batteries, but doesn&#x27;t seem to drain them quickly, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the cheap price, but it ended up being a great value!</li>
            <li>With a couple of days, I feel very nice, cleansing is very clean, very comfortable, no uncomfortable feeling, and a lot of brush, a good variety of features - good price, worth sharing to friends.</li>
            <li>Without thinking twice I returned it and found something more suitable.</li>
            <li>Had a problem with my first order but company replaced it and it is great.</li>
            <li>Its a great price and does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this massager as a perfect starter set and ideal for first time use, as it is suitable for inexperienced hands.</li>
            <li>It is very light.</li>
            <li>This is really a very cheaply made device.</li>

            <li>So quick to use and get into a good skin care routine with it.</li>
            <li>The packaging was kind of beaten up, but everything inside was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is the attachment that will make me fall in love with this brush.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>It probably won&#x27;t be followed by many users, but it is recommended that the batteries be removed after each use.  </li>
            <li>The product does what you expect it to do, if it is waterproof better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>Although it did the job I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Item came when it was suppose to in safe packaging too.</li>
            <li>Sure, there are versions out there that are water resistant/water proof, but you&#x27;ll pay 3x the price.  </li>
            <li>OK, this is for beauty &amp; &amp;#34;rejuvenation&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>and I love it to pieces.</li>
            <li>It feels like it stimulated the circulation, and it has a fresher, clearer appearance and is most assuredly smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li>Love it alot.</li>
            <li>It could be improved by making the box a bit sturdier and adding a top lid, but at this price level, it&#x27;s probably not feasible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wish it had more power.</li>
            <li>Works okay, came with everything pictured.</li>

            <li>Skin feels clearer, more color, looks brighter.</li>

            <li>She liked it very much, and recommended me to buy one.</li>
            <li>Super brush, really soft but cleans the skin beautifully.</li>
            <li>Amazing price fast prime shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty unimpressed by this brush, honestly.</li>
            <li>A carry case for this would be nice but is unfortunately not included.  </li>
            <li>A lovely beauty accessory which works well and safely, and the price is really quite affordable.it sturdier and adding a top lid, but at this price level, it&#x27;s probably not feasible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty significant for four days of use!!</li>
            <li>providing the illusion of being a cool and fabulous gift:)  </li>
            <li>Included are two types of brushes, two sponge heads, one fine stone for polishing, a massager head, and pumice stone head.&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s cute and inexpensive and small and perfect!</li>
            <li>Not super impressed.</li>
            <li>It requires 2 AA batteries and works fine with rechargeable&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Its works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean as I would hope, but it definitely feels good and is a nice face massage.</li>
            <li>I use this brush three times a week because it really exfoliates the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic product!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fortunate to have gotten this at such a good deal.</li>
            <li>I love the different head options and I love that I can feel it cleaning better than when I use just my fingers!</li>

            <li>I was using a light foundation every day, but after using this product twice, I&#x27;ve decided I don&#x27;t need foundation anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for teens and adults, for the face as well as smooth elbows and knees.</li>
            <li>they are smooth</li>
            <li>feel smooth an soft&lt;br</li>

            <li>The different brushes that come with it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Just imagine what cheap would feel like</li>
            <li>After I use it my skin looks and feels so fresh :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a smooth skin in my life.</li>
            <li>makes it smooth and relaxed</li>
            <li>Overall, the product is great for the value.</li>
            <li>and attachments are cheaply made .</li>
            <li>I paid $12.99 for it with free shipping.</li>
            <li>The brush settings are so fantastic to wash and exfoliate your face.</li>
            <li>I had another similar one and lost it somehow and was happy to get a review sample again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean also.</li>

            <li>I did enjoy reading the instructions.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my face and feels like I&#x27;m getting a facial at home.</li>
            <li>Even though I received it free to review, my opinions are not altered.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This is cheaply made and did not work well at all.  </li>
            <li>I can take this product on the go and that it&#x27;ll easily fit into my purse for travel.  </li>
            <li>I know I will enjoy this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 7 different heads are great</li>
            <li>but I so wish it was more powerful</li>
            <li>Enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>It did a smooth, even job and with a bit of soap and water the head washed up well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes with some nice attachments and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>This is great for exfoliating, cleansing and massaging - a total spa in a box!  </li>
            <li>This massage comes with 7 great tools each with a different use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>properly, and with appropriate cleansers, soaps, or lotions, this product can produce some good results.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face super clean :)</li>
            <li>There is a great selection of heads and the whole product as a whole feels sturdy, but the power just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>But, still a really good product and it comes with so many different brush heads.</li>
            <li>The product is good so far.</li>
            <li>A lovely beauty accessory which works well and safely, and the price is really quite affordable.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I love that there are different brushes, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it not being good for your skin type,</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>i love this brush it works with the right amount of speed and force</li>
            <li>Very useful kit  in the skin cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li>So, it is very exciting, and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I have never tried a facial scrubber before, I have found this one to be very nice.</li>
            <li>The brush, cleanser and moisturizer together have given me the best skin ever in my life - it clears away dead skin, dirt and grime and leaves you with a \\&quot;clean slate.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The wheels come off quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>And it also has the benefits of exfoliating the skin and leaving the skin smooth, soft and looking very healthy.  </li>
            <li>This is very cool..and very easy to use.after using this</li>
            <li>i am very surprised because i worried of the cheap price but the product works very good and my skin feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I am 60 and my skin hasn’t looked this good since I turned 50, at which time I had a major heart attack</li>
            <li>There was a white, flaky substance all over the plastic window and the handle of the product, which was easy to see against the bright color.</li>
            <li>the brush heads are fairly small and best used on face, feet, elbows, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see how it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small but perfect to traveling.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I would gladly purchase another Pixnor Product just because they were willing to fix the problem.</li>
            <li>After the first week, my skin was clearer and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL POST:</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I was able to use each attachment before I was able to give a proper review.</li>
            <li>At first I wasnt sure if it was working</li>
            <li>To massage and clean your skin</li>
            <li>my face looks clean, I suffer from acne and this has helped reduced my acne because I have my face clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and smoother than its been.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for the price, but I only use three of the items because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After using the softer of the brushes included my face felt squeaky clean but not stripped.  </li>
            <li>I think a wash proof bag would be useful with it too, as its easy to mislay the heads once opened.</li>
            <li>Amazing it helped clear and exfoliated my skin so smoothly.</li>
            <li>You just won&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li>I was visually impressed with how clear my face looked after using the brush last night.  </li>
            <li>but this is good for someone who wants something gentle...</li>
            <li>This would be a good one for use in exfoliating the skin on the legs, elbows and feet except that the motor speed is too slow to do a good job with the pumice head on these</li>
            <li>I love this massager with all its different  heads that are very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Product received during a special promotional period.</li>
            <li>Nothing special though.</li>
            <li>I can use it, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>While I was almost always able to figure out what the seller was trying to say, I think the lack of attention to detail in the instruction booklet detracts from the quality of the product itself (I say, as I write a review that almost certainly has a typo somewhere).  </li>
            <li>The attachments are perfect for my uneven rough skin with a mix of skin that needs a good clean brush/ buff.</li>
            <li>first time used it felt really good and soft.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, great alternative to the more expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li>Wow, this really polished my face nicely!  </li>
            <li>So, I am always looking for products that I can use at home, that I can use to unclog and clogged pores, and to keep my skin looking bright and refreshed, as if I&#x27;ve had a facial.  </li>
            <li>As long as you put fresh batteries in the brush works great.</li>
            <li>received a sample for evaluation, and really believe that this product provides excellent value for the money, as there are similar rotary brushes that cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Very sleek and stylish body brush.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for those on a budget but looking for a good skin care system.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>If the brushes get warn, the price is so good that I will order 2 the next time.</li>
            <li>It comes with seven attachments which is so cool</li>
            <li>I received a replacement and really fell in love with the brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes 2 AA batteries that aren&#x27;t included, so after ordering this make sure that you have the batteries so that you&#x27;re ready to use it after you get in the mail.</li>
            <li>Cool product.</li>
            <li>But overall this product is good.</li>
            <li>There are also some nice soft brushes, too, so</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush:</li>
            <li>I am very well pleased with this model.</li>
            <li>liked the latex soft sponge for applying face cream and foundation.</li>
            <li>With this brush, I am able to be as gentle or aggressive as I need to be cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li>I like the longer face brush for my face as it feels more gentle and cleans well.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Face wash is also very clean, very thoroughly clean the dirt.</li>
            <li>The brushes and sponges are very gentle on the skin, and being handheld, this tool is relatively easy to control.  </li>
            <li>Great product the seller was extremely concerned with my happiness and the communication was open.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the attachments is pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>I found everything to be easy to use and the heads were not difficult at all to change out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, the instructions tell you exactly what to do and have pictures to follow as well,</li>
            <li>My skin has many red belminishes and it takes them away leaving my face very smooth.</li>
            <li>I ordered one of these for my 16 year old (who hates any kind of hygiene regimen) for her acne-prone face, and she raved about it from the first use!</li>
            <li>Came quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for something mostly for the face, this particular set has a lot of options.  </li>
            <li>Great exfoliator gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>Compares well to the branded option, and it arrived quickly (Imported).  </li>
            <li>I’m lucky</li>
            <li>Quick delivery too.</li>
            <li>What a nice way to have such smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I found myself putting more effort in than the brush, you&#x27;d be better off not turning it on, saving your batteries, and physically scrubbing your face yourself.</li>
            <li>Logistics is quickly, things quickly received, Yesterday given and today arrived.</li>
            <li>I used 2 other brand brushes but this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>This makes washing my face fun:) I love all the options, especially the exfoliating brush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great, love the different heads it comes with, I use this daily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, comfortable soft brush, face massage skills, able to deep clean feeling supple and moisturized after washing the face, apply the mask can be better absorbed.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush shortly after my sister bought the Dermabrush, thinking I was getting the better deal and a more highly ranked brush, therefore it had to be better, right?</li>
            <li>It is more clear and clean.</li>
            <li>I look very much like many of the jigsaw puzzles reviewed by my fellow reviewer Joseph Dewey reviews (check his review of this very item here as well-</li>
            <li>I took off a star because the attachments wobble as they spin, although it isn&#x27;t significant and doesn&#x27;t make the product less effective!</li>
            <li>The best part is the heads fit my other bigger brush</li>
            <li>I got  this for my face, after 2 days use I noticed that some of the dry skin around my nose has cleared, it feels good makes skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>But I am trying very much to survive the many surgeries I just completed with more on the horizons if I can regain enough strength to survive those surgeries.</li>
            <li>So overall I&#x27;m super happy with this product so far!</li>
            <li>some and feeling face also clean a lot, like it very much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended! ! !</li>
            <li>, i love the 7 different heads you can easily snap onto it.</li>
            <li>WOrks great for a small price...definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>For lazy people, this cleansing instrument is really convenient, you can do the clean by yourself at home, very good.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and was delighted with this product it takes my cream cleanser</li>
            <li>I find that it removes older skin cells very gently, lathers up facial cleansers and helps serums and creams to sink in, which in turn makes them more effective.</li>
            <li>I find that it removes older skin cells very gently, lathers up facial cleansers and helps serums and creams to sink in, which in turn makes them more effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly recommend this to a friend and consider it good enough to give as a gift to family.</li>
            <li>included in package) with 2 speeds,to give a gentle and smooth feelings,not a harm pressure on your skin</li>
            <li>The two brush attachments feel great on the skin and can remove dead skin on the outermost surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it for a few days, I am happy to report that it did make a difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this so much.</li>
            <li>But, this brush does come with attachments that would do a great job exfoliating dead skin all over.  </li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I am so thankful that I was offered this complimentary massager to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heads are about 1 ¼ inches wide, also allowing good control and precision application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To better clear up and exfoliate skin</li>
            <li>Totally worth the $</li>
            <li>However, I will definitely say that this is an effective tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this and now that i have this it is so useful.</li>
            <li>Powerful, is the strength of what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>and I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that this item arrived early.</li>
            <li>I always wanted a nice facial machine, but did not want to spend $200.00 for one.</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>I recommend this product, it&#x27;s so fun to use</li>
            <li>To better clear up and exfoliate skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say is it isn&#x27;t as powerful as I wanted it to be</li>
            <li>The brushes are amazingly soft and enjoyable to use.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too soon for me to know if I will achieve any measure of success.</li>
            <li>I gave my and my wife&#x27;s honest review above &amp; posted it.</li>
            <li>I gave my and my wife&#x27;s honest review above &amp; posted it.</li>
            <li>Liked the pumice stone especially well.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love it so far</li>
            <li>To better clear up and exfoliate skin</li>
            <li>I try it as soon as I received it and the brush for the face is smooth and it comes with 6 more massager definitely recommend this</li>
            <li>I noticed that using this PIXNOR 7-in-1 massager with other facial products makes it more effective and i love how it feels unto my skin.</li>
            <li>For dry skin, it is the perfect exfoliating, but I don&#x27;t recommend grinding it into your skin or staying on one spot too long.</li>
            <li>But it is just about right for getting rid of elbow calluses.  </li>
            <li>For exfoliation, my scrubby stuff just falls right off of the brush because it&#x27;s just rotating SO SLOWLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for the cost, it&#x27;s about right.</li>
            <li>Because it is so gentle in action, it is perfectly suitable for all parts of the face and neck.</li>
            <li>Just received it today and have used it on my facial,  the first time will hurt but your face will get used to it, but every part is super and my skin looks more healthy after using this product,  its cleaning your face and getting a rid of the dead skin so no pain no gain, amazing.</li>
            <li>was sso excited when I purchased this product two days ago and was thrilled when I got it today, due to Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>In particular, I&#x27;m working to smooth out scar tissue on my forehead</li>
            <li>Washing face very smooth, very clean, blackheads not so dark.</li>
            <li>Really, it is not that bad...just don&#x27;t expect too many bells and whistles and don&#x27;t expect it to be very fast (within reason) and it is OK for the price;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the appliance is light and well shaped, easy to hold and manoeuvre, and the different heads can be removed and exchanged with no fuss at all.</li>
            <li>It is pink/white, and I personally think would be an excellent starter kit for young girls or teens who want to take care of their skin like their female role models, without spending a lot of money or buying a product designed to tackle skin issues that come with age.</li>
            <li>I love the different heads and the multi speed is nice for different areas and control.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, works like some of the more professional expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how good my skin looks now, and I know I&#x27;m not exaggerating because I had at least 5 people at work comment about how good I looked - younger and my skin is brighter, after about a week of using all three.  </li>
            <li>Feel the difference right after my first try</li>
            <li>I have used it only two weeks and used it every day so far so good.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin super clean &amp; smoothe, the brushes are soft so when your washing your face</li>
            <li>That is why I apply it after washing my face with warm water, and apply it on a dry face.</li>
            <li>With 7 different massagers it&#x27;s a great product with different options.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great brush and definitely affordable.</li>
            <li>This is a great value as well, getting all the attachments for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Great Buy for such a low price!</li>
            <li>All in all, it is a good start to an affordable way to have a deep clean for your face washing routine, with added extra heads for bonus!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to loud and the attachments change easily</li>
            <li>My face really does feel more alive, and awake.</li>
            <li>This product is a great affordable alternative to the more expensive models out there.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool to use for deep cleaning your face and body but especially your face.  </li>
            <li>Your face will feel extra super clean after you use it!</li>
            <li>in that I’ve good skin, never had acne or any large open pores, but my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>It is very gentle....</li>
            <li>Although I do not think it does this, it does remove makeup with closer (so very gentle exfoliation).  </li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one of the 7 heads and all 7 of them are very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>Works very very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product feels very cheap and did not function properly.  </li>
            <li>It works very nicely, and I&#x27;ve used more expensive brushes/massagers, and this holds up in comparison.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will use it frequently!</li>
            <li>/&gt;4.Rolling massager:Stimulates blood circulation to stimulate collagen production and reduce fine lines (for anti-aging)&lt;br /&gt;5.Short soft brush:Gently brushes away residue from exfoliation</li>
            <li>It saves a lot of time from trying to clean up your face by hand using normal brushes and scrubbers.  </li>
            <li>portable facial and body brush is cute, and came with clear easy to follow directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of cheap and not very effective.</li>
            <li>Say what you will but essentially we all will find our own particular use for it.</li>
            <li>It played a huge part in helping me clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>and I wish it was a bit faster and more dynamic</li>
            <li>a pretty color.  </li>
            <li>First of all I want to say this is a value for money product.</li>
            <li>My skin actually looks healthy again with a shine.</li>
            <li>person with diabetes may not be able to feel his or her feet properly.</li>
            <li>People with diabetes must be fully aware of how to prevent foot problems before they occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am adding photos of the foot of a diabetic, before and after the first treatment using the Pixnor pumice applicator.  </li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>; which was only a couple of dollars more..</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t for sure about using this Pixnor facial and body cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after using it for the first time my skin was the softest its been in over 10 years.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>I first put it out of its plastic storage containers, I think,</li>
            <li>oh wow, this is incredibly cheap.</li>
            <li>was in my face, the first time I use it after I taked my makeup off</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I love how with the sponge setting, I can evenly apply my lotion to my entire face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Overall an okay product</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with different scrubs.</li>
            <li>The first week I used it, I broke out more than I normally do, so it is obviously getting deeper into my skin.</li>
            <li>The brushes stopped working after the first month of use</li>
            <li>Broke after the first use.</li>
            <li>Purchase this facial kit, you will be glad u did.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this during a recent promotion.</li>
            <li>Love this facial brush.</li>
            <li>My skin feels sooo much cleaner after using it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not really a massager, but it does have a kind of massaging extension, which is the one with four balls.</li>
            <li>HER &amp;#34;scar tissue&amp;#34; is mostly referring to a physical scar, one you SEE on the skin when looking at it it.</li>
            <li>For all that women have to endure in there day to day lives under the best of circumstances, I love to find a product like this that can give them at least a few minutes of &#x27;ME&amp;#34; time.</li>

            <li>love this massager and use it daily except for when I use a derma roller.</li>
            <li>Love all the different heads you can use, I do wish the speed was a tad faster.</li>
            <li>Had fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling smooth!</li>
            <li>I have not yet used the more abrasive body attachments, as I just have an issue using my facial tool on my body, too.  </li>
            <li>I love the duo speed and how you can not only wash your face with it but also massage.</li>
            <li>After viewing a lot about similar products, bought this because I wanted something more to help me wash my face.</li>
            <li>A week later the color of face obviously much better, smaller pores, the skin became a lot better.</li>
            <li>Pretty impressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>save lots of money on salon nail fills get done and keep em up your self with the included inter-changeable attachments great exfoliating and deep cleansing brushes for the face and a very nice soft buffer for the face to help buff the dead skin left after you exfolliate.</li>
            <li>The sound is just a slight \\&quot;humming whine\\&quot;, but the thunderous hum you hear in my video :)</li>
            <li>I do get a deeper clean, but it&#x27;s the same clean</li>
            <li>far I like it great for the price I found the little scrubber attachment to work better then the bigger one for my face</li>
            <li>( I make my own, nice and simple oil based) to work up a lather and gently exfoliate any dead skin.</li>
            <li>I found it needs to be used very gently, pressure more than the lightest just makes the heads stop rotating, but once I’d worked out how much pressure to use it was simple.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to be beautiful, too late!</li>
            <li>There are two rough ones, two smooth brushes, two smooth sponges, and one four-balled extension.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my face was so clean a d soft</li>
            <li>This on works really well also, but is not as firm, which I loved.</li>
            <li>but since I received this I&#x27;ve gotten better at washing my face (only because it&#x27;s much easier and faster now...)</li>
            <li>My face was left feeling clean and refreshed after using it!</li>
            <li>Nice  clean body i can exfoliate without scrubbing my Skin so hard.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &amp;#34;To make better skin circumstances from aging.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Please take out batteries if long time no use.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Do not disassemble the device if not being professional.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use this consistently, my skin is definitely much softer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really left my face soft  and smooth, but it seems so cheaply made that i may have to buy it again in six months or</li>
            <li>This one comes with more attachments and as long as you haven&#x27;t run the batteries out, works just as well.</li>
            <li>it is small so good for traveling.</li>
            <li>Feels good in hand since its small plus</li>
            <li>This little gadget does a really good job of cleaning my pores and my skin is always so soft right after.</li>
            <li>Love this little tool for apply my facial cleansers, two power setting and multiple different heads make this a great bargain!</li>
            <li>And there is a rough disk-like attachment (shown at the top in the first product image) that I would also not use on the face.  </li>
            <li>It come with seven massage heads of different functions, it&#x27;s easy to figure out how to put in the batteries and</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wash out (off the device), and let it dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>item requires batteries and it is easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to exert any pressure to exfoliate the dry skin on my feet without the spinning head coming to a</li>
            <li>Instructions are short, so it is easy to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li>The polishing wheel in particular, has proved to be more useful than I expected.</li>
            <li>But the strength or power isn&#x27;t that strong,  only when the bristles starts to get rougher.</li>
            <li>The power isn&#x27;t overly strong, but it definitely still works even when applying pressure.</li>
            <li>I also have friends that I have a certain &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It deeply cleansed my skin, and made it super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Very high quality product.</li>
            <li>It just sounded like plastic rubbing on plastic while it was in motion and not like a very high quality device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Agree with other comments before steaming the face is necessary, it may be easier to put the best face on the skin brush, if you wash your face for the first time to become very dry, and then use it.</li>
            <li>It takes two AA batteries (not included) and does not come with any kind of carry pouch or case (however, if you save the box, there are neat little slots for every attachment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to receive this facial and body brush as I&#x27;ve always wanted to try one but never could really afford them.</li>
            <li>Get the goods after the evening could not wait to use, with a mild massage brush and sponge brush, the overall feeling is washed clean than before, because the tight feeling after washing the face is more intense than their face.</li>
            <li>massager - four trapped balls in the head rotate and roll over your skin (actually feels great on my face)&lt;br /&gt;A fine stone and a coarse stone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small and comfortable in your hand and it is not awkward to use and you can easily and quickly go over your entire face.  </li>
            <li>, I found a huge difference in the size of my pores and my overall texture of the skin.</li>
            <li>I was expecting much faster (within reason).  </li>
            <li>Therefore, the brush is gentle and not abrasive on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The brush glides gently on skin.   </li>
            <li>I did not think it made a real dent on soles of feet but feet was softer.</li>
            <li>(I guess I was hoping for something much faster than my hands but not as fast as a Phillips sonicare tooth-brush)   </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as fast speed as others, but it does it job.</li>
            <li>The sponge really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t really feel like anything when using it.</li>
            <li>Personally since I use this item around water, I would like water proof available for this type of item.</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference to my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>i really like this product a lot for</li>
            <li>Product works really well as a cleaning or a dee cleaning routine.</li>
            <li>My skin says thanks everytime</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had my eye on the Clarisonic but at over $100, I do not want to spend so much money.</li>
            <li>This massager and cleaner has seven attachments and they are all usefull and works so very well for a very afordable price.</li>
            <li>This product works very well with my skin care products I use before bed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are like me and have a nightly skin cleansing ritual!</li>
            <li>My face smoother, clearer, looks much</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>really wish this had my power to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and really helps out with exfoliating.</li>
            <li>not irritating at all</li>
            <li>this product is more than I expected.</li>
            <li>so well I have used it several times and it&#x27;s so light weight</li>
            <li>but really does the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I believe my camera made this brush sound louder than it actually is.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and my daughter loves the way this cleans her skin</li>
            <li>but much longer needles to </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t even really get close to your face without it jamming up.</li>
            <li>The motor must not be made very well.</li>
            <li>The clariaonic is much wider</li>
            <li>I have owned a few different brands of these and this is definitely not the best.</li>
            <li>I feel like if I use too much pressure it may break.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate any company that looks to make their customers happy when they are not happy with their purchase.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother after I am finished.</li>
            <li>Long-term effects are not known, but there is still very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Device shuts off when applied gently to the face.  </li>
            <li>This works much better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>Gently brushes away residue from exfoliation&lt;</li>
            <li>ladies and gentlemen, I absolutely had to update my review on this product.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any one who wants a face cleanser.</li>
            <li>So can&#x27;t be to rough :)</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t want too much power</li>
            <li>Maybe I spent way too many years working for the Police Department and am overly suspicious?</li>
            <li>Maybe I spent way too many years working for the Police Department and am overly suspicious?</li>
            <li>very well making</li>
            <li>product works very well at cleaning out your pores and massaging your face..  </li>
            <li>All the brushes and head attachments that come with the unit work very well.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this unit!</li>
            <li>really like it uses 2 AA batteries so is easier to find and cheaper too.</li>
            <li>you so much</li>
            <li>i can really see the difference on my face.</li>
            <li>very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>found it to be very underpowered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well priced and makes my skin feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle and cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Really recommend this.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply soap and lather brush and wet face.</li>
            <li>It would also be helpful to have better and clear instructions on what/where to use the different heads.  </li>
            <li>For example, after soaking your feet in a warm bath, use the pumice head to get rid of calluses and dead skin.</li>
            <li>Effectively exfoliates all the dead skin and gets rid of makeup on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whenever I pressed too hard, the Pixnor stopped, perfect because after the first use much of the dead tissue was gone but the skin on the foot was not even red with irritation or injured.g effects of fine lines, wrinkles and discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>The handle is made of silicone, comfortable to hold and the small size makes it easy to control with precision.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Light weight &amp; easy to hold, small size but</li>
            <li>In the scrub is huge, especially for those who wear a lot of makeup or those with low time to clean the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20s, so I really just needed something to thoroughly clean off my make up and clear my pores to prevent acne.</li>
            <li>It was really nice of her since I still use it &amp; think that it is a decent facial brush, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it concerns me enough that I want to bring it up right here, right NOW.</li>
            <li>But it concerns me enough that I want to bring it up right here, right NOW.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and  smooth after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li>She said she felt skin clean than before wash with hands, the next day to find that the skin became more tense, a bit too smooth.</li>
            <li>I have really good skin naturally, and I only get a pimple or two on occasion, so this was very strange.  </li>
            <li>Each day I use the sponges along with my facial cleanser to clean my face, then the rolling massager on my face and neck, when I apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is comfortable to use on the skin though and does a good job as a face cleanser (less so as an exfoliator) and has a lot of attachments included (just missing a case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it to clean my face then attached the facial massage head</li>
            <li>You can use it on other parts of your body but the brushes are small so using it on the face is really the ideal application and for that it is a must have item for women.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The high speed isn&#x27;t that fast, and the motor doesn&#x27;t develop a lot of torque.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a couple times and its not very fast or strong.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads cannot be purchased but this is so inexpensive that if you want new heads, it&#x27;s easy enough to buy a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.ds cannot be purchased but this is so inexpensive that if you want new heads, it&#x27;s easy enough to buy a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>And even though I have long fingers, it still feels comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not surprised,  nor am I complaining, It was a cheap pricee</li>
            <li>This facial and body brush is everything I expected it to be and more!</li>
            <li>This massager stops if I exert too much pressure, by letting it gently remove the dead skin cells without pressure, his healthy skin is not damaged or irritated at all.</li>
            <li>and I actually use it on days when I do a full face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used the exfoliation attachments I don&#x27;t think those would be fast enough to actually be useful.</li>
            <li>[[[This item is definitely a good substitute for the more expensive facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and will travel nicely.</li>
            <li>She uses a more expensive brand, she said, this is as good as (currently she is in her teens picky interference - LOL).&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li>The brush wasn&#x27;t too hard and was happy with the initial results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a brush like this for my skin and originally bought it because honestly I am quite lazy and will sometimes skip a night because it&#x27;s just been a long day</li>
            <li>Also please use the pink buffer with caution, it&#x27;s easy to overdo it.</li>
            <li>switching out the brush heads is super simple, like a peg.</li>
            <li>This simple, safe, inexpensive, well thought out massager has become a necessity, used daily and sometimes twice or three times a day in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>I take the head off and wash out after use, the main unit needs to be kept out of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, a simple drawstring fabric bag would be adequate and ensure everything kept in place.  </li>
            <li>I have a larger one by another company but the smaller one is much better to travel with.</li>
            <li>Having facial at the salon is so pricey, glad that i have this Pixnor Massager, I can do facial at home or wherever I go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward for this to more deeply cleanse and exfoliate my skin (especially to remove stubborn blackheads).</li>
            <li>I wonder if this is how our faces felt when we were kids before we got older and started putting gunk on our face and clogging our pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall for the price (currently 11 bucks), this is a decent facial massager although not as high powered or sturdy as some that cost a bit more.  </li>
            <li>think the major issue with the product is the fact the motor in the gun (2 x AA batteries) isn&#x27;t strong enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The brush includes the 7 different function massaging heads keep my skin clean and clear!</li>
            <li>Only used the brush so far &amp; worth the money ;)</li>
            <li>It really gets deep into your pores and gets the job done right.</li>
            <li>And the kicker is that this brush isn&#x27;t strong enough to rotate on your skin unless you barely touch it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>pixnor beauty massager is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>For the first few times I used this brush I noticed the machine started to get really hot to the touch, after that it still got hot but wasn&#x27;t as hot</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews I thought I would need the brush to always be at the high setting</li>
            <li>But high speed never stalls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>The instructions are great for letting you know how the facial scrubber works, but there are numerous typos throughout the English version of the instructions (they are in multiple languages).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend all three products.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I pressed too hard, the Pixnor stopped, perfect because after the first use much of the dead tissue was gone but the skin on the foot wasnot even red with irritation or injured.</li>
            <li>There are 2 heads that I thought surely was gonna rub and hurt my skin,since I do have sensitive skin, but those 2 were just as painless as the other 5.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was a little more high powered, however for the price</li>
            <li>Nice little gadget for cleaning my face, works reasonable well, but I have to agree with other reviews, it should be a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li>I like that you are given options as far as attachments, but I know certain ones</li>
            <li>I do have to use a little more moisturiser.</li>
            <li>I love this little brush.</li>
            <li>power is weak but good for a soft gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li>I pair this with my clean and clear facial wash.</li>
            <li>it helped clear up my skin and gave it a deep clean.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to change the heads and the heads seem to last a very long time!!  </li>
            <li>I use my regular face soap and moisturizers but this brush gets it into the pores and removes dead skin leaving my face soft clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>With a whole slew of attachments, this battery operated beauty set has something for nearly every type of skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, so far the results look promising.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall great product so far, my only complaint would be that it is not water-proof so you cannot use this in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and its soft head brush doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li>Batteries do not come with the set, and the manufacturer suggest taking the batteries out after each usage.(assuming the device will be wet after use)&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company for purposes of review.</li>
            <li>I started using it two weeks ago as a welcome addition to my dry-brushing routine, which is difficult to do on the face.</li>
            <li>I bought the Bel essence originally as a great moisturizer (I am skeptical of the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; claims in creams), but I have to warn you</li>
            <li>This should be mentioned clearly on the description of the product, and really?</li>
            <li>It is as powerful as I hoped and proper price for the product quality.</li>
            <li>Normal sweat secretion and oil production that lubricates the skin of the foot is impaired.  </li>
            <li>Normal sweat secretion and oil production that lubricates the skin of the foot is impaired.  </li>
            <li>The LONG BRUSH  exfoliates and deep cleans better need after being ouside.</li>
            <li>multi use product works for helping with manicure and pedicure as well as face 7 different  attachments all that are useful</li>
            <li>After just a few uses, I feel my skin appears more radiant and is cleaner than ever.</li>
            <li>only attachment that I found useful was the latex sponge.</li>
            <li>My reason, not enough power to make the assortment of attachments useful.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my face is looking so much better nowadays...</li>
            <li>For normal use it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive facial cleaner, callus remover, etc., and don&#x27;t need a waterproof version, this is worth checking</li>
            <li>This item for only around $10.00 delivered at the time of my review is so well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>NO complaints:-)s item for only around $10.00 delivered at the time of my review is so well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>For only $12.99 vs the upward price of a Clarisonic being $130 its well worth.</li>
            <li>It works quite nicely, it moves slow</li>
            <li>I like how this comes with 7 different heads that you can easily switch out and each does something different for your skin.</li>
            <li>: Use with your facial cleanser to deep clean and gently exfoliate</li>
            <li>:Use with your facial cleanser to deep clean and gently exfoliate</li>
            <li>Now from my wife who has very large scars on her face, forehead up through the upper scalp area.</li>
            <li>I follow with the long &amp; short soft brush to make sure everything is removed.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a black head with a significant effect (which is my main reason to buy this), but my skin feel great, my foundation is to last for a long time because my skin less oily.</li>
            <li>I placed brand new batteries and item does not funtion.</li>
            <li>So after reading the directions and the function of each piece I put my 2 AA batteries in my new gadget and turned it on.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, my skin feels brand new.</li>
            <li>You would wanna use new batteries to get the speed and power it needs to work.</li>
            <li>It is smaller in overall size than other facial brushes making it great for travel IMO.  </li>
            <li>Also, the body of the facial cleaner is not waterproof, which seems like a bad idea to me, being as it could easily be dropped in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, however, this provides a great cleaning for the price.</li>
            <li>The unit cannot be immersed in water, so you have to clean it carefully with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li>it isnt too harsh on the face, so i think it would be safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very cute, small enough I carry it in my makeup box.  </li>
            <li>I just removed them from the device and used mild dish soap and water, then let them air dry.  </li>
            <li>I only use the two brush attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Paired with a gentle foaming cleanser, this spinning brush makes my skin so much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li>This brush will really clean your face, which means it takes off all the natural oils as well and can leave your skin dry.  </li>
            <li>Do not have this time is too long, but so far is not bad.</li>
            <li>The cycle and speed is very very gentle, it clarifies the skin and at the same time it cleanse it.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and acne prone, so cleansing is very very vital.</li>
            <li>That area was burning and was very sensitive to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft in my face..</li>
            <li>fi e and brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether you have dry, normal, oily or sensitive skin, mild exfoliation</li>
            <li>This is a great unit; however, the only change I would make is to add more power, a stiffer complexion brush and less useless accessories.</li>
            <li>(I do not think it provides a deep exfoliation which is why I bought the brush in the first place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than clarasonic and it does the job, I had read the reviews other buyer left and decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li>For my husband gently removing the calloused and dead skin from his feet without injuring healthy skin is a must for his health, for others it is only a should.</li>
            <li>On top of these visible benefits of healthier, younger looking skin, facial massages can help you relax, reduce stress and simply bring about the feeling of indulging yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>There was no power to the tool and found it to be a complete bust!</li>
            <li>Most of the time I would wear make up and remove it using makeup wipes, and then I cleanse my face using my facial cleanser and use this device to deeply cleanse whatever residue left.</li>
            <li>I did not buy any more of facial cleanser, but I think it will work just as well with other cleaning agents.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it would come with just one brush, but I can get multiple uses out of it.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>First off, I want to say I&#x27;ve only used this on my feet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be careful with sensitive skin areas, and also MAKE SURE ALL HAIR IS TIED BACK!</li>
            <li>The quality of this seems ok but doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as other similar devices.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda small, but it&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li>Also keep it on the lower setting when you first start using it until you can see how your skin takes the different speeds</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>If it succeeds or not at reducing MY type of internal scar tissue, or my wife&#x27;s external type scar tissue is really not of huge importance.</li>

            <li>This brush means its easy to use a little soap</li>
            <li>It is a very inexpensive tool and works decently for facial cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There just didn&#x27;t seem to be enough power and it would never give me that deep clean that I was hoping for</li>
            <li>The gentle exfoliation possible with its two brushes can be very beneficial to improve the look and tone of facial skin, and the fact that it&#x27;s so easy to use would certainly encourage someone who would not normally bother, male or female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Typos would not stop me from highly recommending this to anyone who wants the feel of a facial every day, without the redness and irritation that comes along with someone else poking and prodding at your face.</li>
            <li>The packaging is a little plain but effective to hold the various heads without crushing them.</li>
            <li>I have used a few days before to evaluate, it&#x27;s different with what I imagined, and I thought for the first time would not have any effect, but to my surprised was that this was effective, skin tight feeling after used, the first time feel the itch.</li>
            <li>It came with a few different brush heads that is suitable to whatever your skin needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Later, my skin feels so smooth, and at the end of the day and less greasy.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:31c7b25a7c2a25a11d7981f9b20bda13]] Includes the cleansing unit (2 AA batteries are required but not included), an microdermabrasion brush, latex sponge brush, make-up sponge brush, rolling massager, short soft brush, long fine brush, pumice applicator, and the instructions.  </li>
            <li>The brush exfoliates very well, the cleanser gets rid of dirt and oil, and the Bel Essence gives my skin new life - smooth, line free (still faint lines in my forehead and between my eyebrows, but barely noticeable) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This facial and body brush, while operated by 2 AA batteries, it is pretty quiet which is a great feature since you can use it basically whenever and wherever without disturbing anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited to use the other attachments!</li>
            <li>The removal of dead skin cells speeds up the skin renewal process allowing healthier skin cells to take their place reducing the aging effects of fine lines, wrinkles and discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am filled with oily skin all my life, of course I&#x27;m not a person with acne (just odd red point), but I was very upset my blackheads.</li>
            <li>The gentle exfoliation possible with its two brushes can be very beneficial to improve the look and tone of facial skin, and the fact that it&#x27;s so easy to use would certainly encourage someone who would not normally bother, male or female.</li>
            <li>But I wish it had more power, it stops if you press too hard (which isn&#x27;t alot of pressure).</li>
            <li>I also like how easy it is to go from one head to the other (there are 7 different heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush has 2 settings, low and high, both the exact same speed</li>
            <li>There are seven heads: two brushes of different depths, two sponge applicators for make-up and creams, two buffing ones, (one is mildly abrasive, the other is made of pumice stone and suitable for small calluses).</li>
            <li>Simple and convenient to use, it is suitable for lazy people like me to use.</li>
            <li>Really there are 4 different attachments and</li>
            <li>gentle enough to use on a baby should you desire to do so.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft.</li>
            <li>The different attachments, help make this product a very versatile health and beauty tool.  </li>
            <li>being gentle is crucial to your skins health.</li>
            <li>Latex soft sponge: To massage eye area and cheeks&lt;br /&gt; 3.</li>
            <li>The brush action seems too slow.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;The SHORT BRUSH so gentle and cleans my skin</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels when it is moisturizing and the different adapters.</li>
            <li>my skin felt soft and no harm no foul.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR</li>
            <li>face has definitely been much clearer after I used this.</li>
            <li>I do get the feeling it will break, so I&#x27;ve been extra gentle with it.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels soft now</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, blemishes, pimples, and like everyone else, wow.</li>
            <li>I really did, but it feel short in my book.</li>
            <li>I have always been plagued by extremely sensitive skin, and this brush hasn&#x27;t caused pain, dryness or redness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it helpful to use items like this on my face as they are usually far too abrasive</li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really recommend this, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a face brush but don&#x27;t want to spend $100s on one.</li>
            <li>It has no where near the power or scrubbing feeling that you get with a Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>Latex soft sponge:</li>
            <li>It feels soft on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use the make-up sponges to massage around my eye areas since they are more delicate.  </li>
            <li>I am 20 years old and I have combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the massaging head does not connect completely, and it falls off a lot.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li>so far works</li>
            <li>And maybe it&#x27;s because my skin might be sensitive or</li>
            <li>stall on the low speed with too much pressure.</li>
            <li>It is a device that offers ME a degree of hope, it makes my wife feel pampered.</li>
            <li>It is a device that offers ME a degree of hope, it makes my wife feel pampered.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it every day, but like it so far.</li>
            <li>impresses so far with the quality of the pieces,not abrasive and soft to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And the box was a joke, obviously directly copied from Google Translate or something because it made no sense</li>
            <li>So far this is an a+ product.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>That skin is especially sensitive and fragile and you can end up with cleanser in your eyes.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;2.Latex soft sponge:</li>
            <li>the next morning I found skin is very slippery.</li>
            <li>People are going to say all types of negative remarks but the truth is most are not using the brush correctly.</li>
            <li>The included brush is soft, but get the job done.</li>
            <li>TL;DR Don&#x27;t waste your time and money and go with something better like the Dermabrush that will actually scrub your face.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as the expensive name brands.</li>
            <li>Also, I suppose I don&#x27;t mind that this isn&#x27;t water proof since I&#x27;ve gotten used to only soaking the brush head itself, and I definitely worry about keeping the heads clean, but I clean them with baby shampoo after each use and keep them in a small plastic container.</li>
            <li>Had an issue with the product initially but the company went above and beyond to make it right.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s smaller than other facial and body brushes so that I can take it with me wherever I go!</li>
            <li>It does take a little extra time to gently exfoliat with this as opposed to scrubbing but this is much better for your skin in long run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never thought such a product could clean my face in such a short time.</li>
            <li>What I do like about this product that I did not get with other brands is the different heads available.  </li>
            <li>At first I did not use it every day, because it dried out my face a little, but now I use it every day, love it.</li>
            <li>I only use them very lightly on my skin, as I don&#x27;t want to tug at it and make excessive wrinkles, but I do want to improve circulation to my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had spinning facial brushes in the past that I liked, but none had even close to seven different attachments.  </li>
            <li>At 9pm I went to take a shower and looked in the mirror to find that the area right beneath my left eyebrow was severely swollen, hot, sensitive to the touch, and that some of my eyebrow was missing.  </li>
            <li>It is also a short but sweet review for ME anyway as this is a very limited use device in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I always use this everyday to clean my face..</li>
            <li>Decent enough does the job well</li>
            <li>, I just open the package, took out a handheld device and the main components of the brush.</li>
            <li>The first one I received did not work properly, as the low setting did not work at all.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this facial brush to anyone who is exactly like me and has been dreaming of the day to try a product like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the high end one, but for this price, it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li>The motor is very quiet though even on high speed.  </li>
            <li>aND it sure did take off the dead skin dry patches.</li>
            <li>Its gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin and simple to use too.</li>
            <li>Not sure what thes are like in stores, but this one seemed cheap.</li>
            <li>His feet are starting to look normal.  </li>
            <li>For the one or two brush heads that are useful, this device is not worth spending the money.by the wayside.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the one or two brush heads that are useful, this device is not worth spending the money.</li>
            <li>so I try to use products that aren’t too heavy or full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is not only keeping face clean and more soft but also taking away dirty and oil with it.</li>
            <li>Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li>I am attempting to break down this tissue to be absorbed within my body for pain relief.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Two foam pads, one a soft sponge, the other a little more rigid - for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Rolling</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pointless other than making it look more high tech.</li>
            <li>Yes,I get a little red, but I&#x27;m light skinned, so I&#x27;m used to it.</li>
            <li>your skin look puffy and loose; a daily facial massage when you apply moisturizer of 5 minutes once a day or  two to three minutes twice a day is all it takes to increase facial muscle tone, reduce fluid and puffiness, creating a brighter more even complexion, increased cell renewal and softer skin .</li>

            <li>This Pixnor Portable 7-in-1 System has everything you need to clean deep down in your pores and also massage your skin.  </li>
            <li>This means that it has less power than many other battery-operated tools like this.  </li>
            <li>once or twice a week and deep exfoliation once or twice a month literally brings new life to your complexion, leaving you with visibly brighter, healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>Exfoliation rids the skin of dead skin cells which keeps the pores clean and clear, preventing blackheads, acne, as well as creating the appearance of smaller pores.</li>
            <li>If you are ONLY looking to use the gentle facial brushes, this lower power won&#x27;t bother you.  </li>

            <li>Short soft brush: To clear up all scurf clings on the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li>: Right after I posted the review, it was voted down.</li>
            <li>but on my right it rotates down</li>
            <li>Tons of different attachments for scrubbing your face at a very low cost, it also came in the mail very fast definitely reccomend this product!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so facials are a big no-no for me.  </li>
            <li>Super cool facial machine, the only thing I did not like is that the speed is very slow.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I would like and feels a little flimsy.</li>
            <li>I find that all of the ones that I have tested have about the same high and low speeds, for example, and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, left my skin feeling lush but not waterproof.</li>
            <li>Cleans deeply, yet softly.</li>
            <li>I just got this product today and used it one time on the low setting and it completely messed up my face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin nor did I have any bumps or breakout prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li>Not much power however works really well and does the job.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to help make my skin soft and younger looking.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used the brush attachment so far.</li>
            <li>Because when you turn it on you can barely hear it</li>
            <li>and it can irritate it if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>Short soft brush:</li>
            <li>Pumice: Gently removes rough callused skin on feet and elbows&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that usually with face brushes like this, then all of the extensions are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple of different low priced facial &amp;#34;massagers&amp;#34;, and unlike vibrating devices this one really is for cleaning and massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>different length, soft, brushes</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin use the makeup like sponge or the short bristled brush instead of the longer bristled one.</li>
            <li>thought that the pumice head was much too rough to be used on the tender skin of the face.</li>
            <li>It gets a lot of work so the skin quickly gets tough esp as I tend to go barefoot much of the time)</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected it to be!!</li>
            <li>Good portable but a little weak vibration</li>
            <li>Received the goods on the night with the first use, break out of the bubble is very delicate, is much clean than usual hand wash, there will be bald first wash out ~~~  </li>
            <li>First, I would look around to see what other brushes there are within similar price range and see what they can do</li>
            <li>The handle of this device is comfortable to hold and should not slip if your hand is a little wet.  </li>
            <li>Cleansing instrument does a good job, very delicate of washing, the first time I feel very comfortable, not willing to put down, it may be a long time to wash a little Kazakhstan, after a slight tingling of the face, consult the seller, saying that this is a normal phenomenon, like wash your face with a towel and a long face like there will be a little uncomfortable, the next was to control the use of time, using the cleansing instrument washing face is good, but can not use a timeout.</li>
            <li>This is an extremely important safety feature for the feet of diabetics where the slightest injury could cause serious health risks.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought it for exfoliating my face but it also comes with an attachment similar to the Amope for callus and dry skin removal.</li>
            <li>I use is the &amp;#34;Rolling massager: To make better blood circumstances from skin aging&amp;#34; as it is described with poor Chinese translation in the included</li>
            <li>You can get a little carried away with this, so I recommend using a soft cleansing brush daily, and a more exfoliating brush (depends on your skin type what you use) no more than twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I used the short hair brush head on low with my usual cleanser and was immediately excited.  </li>
            <li>A few of them are very gentle</li>
            <li>THAT ruins the review process as the very invaluable tool it is.</li>
            <li>THAT ruins the review process as the very invaluable tool it is.</li>
            <li>Stopped working not long after purchase.</li>
            <li>did not long </li>
            <li>Having used a 4 battery model, this 2 battery does not quite have the power in comparison especially with the microdermabrasion brush, but the cleaning brushes are soft and do the job and foamed the facial cleanser well and did not irritate my skin and is easier to apply a facial cleanser using this than with my hands.  </li>
            <li>a few compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for three months, had just bought my first replacement head, now found my blackheads are almost non-existent.</li>
            <li>I have awful heels and this was a good way to clean them up</li>
            <li>But not being a water proof is really a step down.</li>
            <li>and I may stop any &amp; all reviews like this in future other than my Vine offers from LEGIT companies that CLEARLY Identify themselves and why their product is being reviewed.</li>

            <li>Good quality for price, if planning to use regularly, go for other expensive ones...</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a little more power behind the high speed setting.</li>
            <li>These infections can develop into gangrene, because of the poor blood flow antibiotics cannot get to the site of the infection easily.</li>
            <li>These infections can develop into gangrene, because of the poor blood flow antibiotics cannot get to the site of the infection easily.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how slooooow the high setting was, it was hardly spinning!</li>
            <li>They simply pull straight out and push down in place.</li>
            <li>Any pressure of the brush heads onto the skin causes the motor to slow down even more, almost bringing the brush head to a stop in some cases.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reviews saying this thing is slow must want to rub their skin raw in order to get it clean!!</li>
            <li>It takes off all the hard rough patches and easily smooths out the surfaces.</li>
            <li>is equivalent to my big electric vacuum cleaner, a little better, because I like its small size and weight.</li>
            <li>do recommend this particular massager for everyone but especially for older women with delicate, thinner skin and diabetics for foot care.  </li>

            <li> My skin feels amazing and its great for teenager skin also.</li>
            <li> This is a good substitute if you can&#x27;t afford to put out the money.</li>
            <li> Good at removing makeup and washing face...that is what I use it for.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so good.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good value and just about anyone can find some use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pain didn&#x27;t subside until I put some ice on the area for a good twenty minutes.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping,  great seller!!</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning my face and the accessories are nice to have as well.</li>
            <li> , I really loved this brush.</li>
            <li> the shape and color of scars, I think it is a good thing, that shows </li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll probably damage the machine) to get good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i assure that this will work good</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It Works Really Good.</li>
            <li> But that one does a good job of exfoliating and stimulating collagen production.  </li>
            <li> The attachments were of good quality, the machine itself felt good in my hand.</li>
            <li> It cleans and brighten my skin so good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li> Also, perhaps it could be a bit stronger -- but remember you are getting the PIXNOR at a really good price compared to the pricey versions out there.</li>
            <li> Good, compact.</li>
            <li> and it gives my face a good scrub with no harshness.</li>
            <li> make-up sponge did a good job of working make-up remover into the skin and taking the make-up off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush heads appear to be fairly durable.</li>

            <li> , the item looks good and I tried turning it on with batteries, it is working fine..</li>
            <li> I especially love the two different sanding attachments and find they work great on callouses, elbows, and I even sometimes use the fine one on my toenails as a nail file.  </li>
            <li> I find using my hands in circular motion is faster and more effective.  </li>
            <li> If it was faster and the heads/attachments did more, I would be loving this.   </li>
            <li> &gt;* Advanced cleansing system keeps a good effectiveness as skin professionals sold&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far, and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Honestly will probably use more on my toes/feet than my face</li>
            <li> but i liked the olay more bc</li>
            <li> Good deal and has made a huge difference for my skin.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and portable!</li>
            <li> thanks, it works really good on my skin!</li>
            <li> It operates on batteries, but doesn&#x27;t seem to drain them quickly, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the cheap price, but it ended up being a great value!</li>
            <li> With a couple of days, I feel very nice, cleansing is very clean, very comfortable, no uncomfortable feeling, and a lot of brush, a good variety of features - good price, worth sharing to friends.</li>
            <li> Without thinking twice I returned it and found something more suitable.</li>
            <li> Had a problem with my first order but company replaced it and it is great.</li>
            <li> Its a great price and does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this massager as a perfect starter set and ideal for first time use, as it is suitable for inexperienced hands.</li>
            <li> It is very light.</li>
            <li> This is really a very cheaply made device.</li>

            <li> Its very comfortable to use and hold in hand..</li>
            <li> my fragile skin, all the accessories are suitable for face and neck, except the pumice stone, which works best on the soles of the feet, kneecaps and elbows.</li>
            <li> So quick to use and get into a good skin care routine with it.</li>
            <li> The packaging was kind of beaten up, but everything inside was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is the attachment that will make me fall in love with this brush.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> It probably won&#x27;t be followed by many users, but it is recommended that the batteries be removed after each use.  </li>
            <li> The product does what you expect it to do, if it is waterproof better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Just think if it works this well on us, how much more can it do for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Pixnor:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>

            <li> Although it did the job I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Item came when it was suppose to in safe packaging too.</li>
            <li> Sure, there are versions out there that are water resistant/water proof, but you&#x27;ll pay 3x the price.  </li>
            <li> OK, this is for beauty &amp; &amp;#34;rejuvenation&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> and I love it to pieces.</li>
            <li> It feels like it stimulated the circulation, and it has a fresher, clearer appearance and is most assuredly smoother to the touch.</li>
            <li> Love it alot.</li>
            <li> It could be improved by making the box a bit sturdier and adding a top lid, but at this price level, it&#x27;s probably not feasible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wish it had more power.</li>
            <li> Works okay, came with everything pictured.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of heads.</li>

            <li> As an adult acne sufferer, I was thrilled when offered to try this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I did not, because I have good skin texture (smooth !!), and not so much wear as much makeup</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the PIXNOR to anyone that is looking for a good face and body machine.</li>
            <li> She liked it very much, and recommended me to buy one.</li>
            <li> Super brush, really soft but cleans the skin beautifully.</li>
            <li> Amazing price fast prime shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty unimpressed by this brush, honestly.</li>
            <li> A carry case for this would be nice but is unfortunately not included.  </li>
            <li> A lovely beauty accessory which works well and safely, and the price is really quite affordable.it sturdier and adding a top lid, but at this price level, it&#x27;s probably not feasible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty significant for four days of use!!</li>
            <li> providing the illusion of being a cool and fabulous gift:)  </li>
            <li> Included are two types of brushes, two sponge heads, one fine stone for polishing, a massager head, and pumice stone head.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s cute and inexpensive and small and perfect!</li>
            <li> Not super impressed.</li>
            <li> It requires 2 AA batteries and works fine with rechargeable&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Its works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean as I would hope, but it definitely feels good and is a nice face massage.</li>
            <li> I use this brush three times a week because it really exfoliates the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fortunate to have gotten this at such a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love the different head options and I love that I can feel it cleaning better than when I use just my fingers!</li>
            <li> It is little, however fits ergonomically perfect in your hand.</li>

            <li> I was using a light foundation every day, but after using this product twice, I&#x27;ve decided I don&#x27;t need foundation anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for teens and adults, for the face as well as smooth elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> they are smooth</li>
            <li> feel smooth an soft&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great deal totally recommended!</li>
            <li> The different brushes that come with it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Just imagine what cheap would feel like</li>
            <li> After I use it my skin looks and feels so fresh :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a smooth skin in my life.</li>
            <li> makes it smooth and relaxed</li>
            <li> Overall, the product is great for the value.</li>
            <li> and attachments are cheaply made .</li>
            <li> I paid $12.99 for it with free shipping.</li>
            <li> The brush settings are so fantastic to wash and exfoliate your face.</li>
            <li> I had another similar one and lost it somehow and was happy to get a review sample again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> I received this free for review.</li>
            <li> I just graduated college and don&#x27;t have a job, so I needed a more economical replacement.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy reading the instructions.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my face and feels like I&#x27;m getting a facial at home.</li>
            <li> Even though I received it free to review, my opinions are not altered.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is cheaply made and did not work well at all.  </li>
            <li> I can take this product on the go and that it&#x27;ll easily fit into my purse for travel.  </li>
            <li> I know I will enjoy this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 7 different heads are great</li>
            <li> but I so wish it was more powerful</li>
            <li> Enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> It did a smooth, even job and with a bit of soap and water the head washed up well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes with some nice attachments and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> This is great for exfoliating, cleansing and massaging - a total spa in a box!  </li>
            <li> This massage comes with 7 great tools each with a different use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> properly, and with appropriate cleansers, soaps, or lotions, this product can produce some good results.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my face super clean :)</li>
            <li> There is a great selection of heads and the whole product as a whole feels sturdy, but the power just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> But, still a really good product and it comes with so many different brush heads.</li>
            <li> The product is good so far.</li>
            <li> A lovely beauty accessory which works well and safely, and the price is really quite affordable.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I love that there are different brushes, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it not being good for your skin type,</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> i love this brush it works with the right amount of speed and force</li>
            <li> Very useful kit  in the skin cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> So, it is very exciting, and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a facial scrubber before, I have found this one to be very nice.</li>
            <li> The brush, cleanser and moisturizer together have given me the best skin ever in my life - it clears away dead skin, dirt and grime and leaves you with a \\&quot;clean slate.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The wheels come off quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> And it also has the benefits of exfoliating the skin and leaving the skin smooth, soft and looking very healthy.  </li>
            <li> This is very cool..and very easy to use.after using this</li>
            <li> i am very surprised because i worried of the cheap price but the product works very good and my skin feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and my skin hasn’t looked this good since I turned 50, at which time I had a major heart attack</li>
            <li> There was a white, flaky substance all over the plastic window and the handle of the product, which was easy to see against the bright color.</li>
            <li> the brush heads are fairly small and best used on face, feet, elbows, etc.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see how it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but perfect to traveling.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I would gladly purchase another Pixnor Product just because they were willing to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> After the first week, my skin was clearer and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL POST:</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I was able to use each attachment before I was able to give a proper review.</li>
            <li> At first I wasnt sure if it was working</li>
            <li> To massage and clean your skin</li>
            <li> my face looks clean, I suffer from acne and this has helped reduced my acne because I have my face clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clean and smoother than its been.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for the price, but I only use three of the items because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After using the softer of the brushes included my face felt squeaky clean but not stripped.  </li>
            <li> I think a wash proof bag would be useful with it too, as its easy to mislay the heads once opened.</li>
            <li> Amazing it helped clear and exfoliated my skin so smoothly.</li>
            <li> You just won&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li> I was visually impressed with how clear my face looked after using the brush last night.  </li>
            <li> but this is good for someone who wants something gentle...</li>
            <li> This would be a good one for use in exfoliating the skin on the legs, elbows and feet except that the motor speed is too slow to do a good job with the pumice head on these</li>
            <li> I love this massager with all its different  heads that are very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Product received during a special promotional period.</li>
            <li> Nothing special though.</li>
            <li> I can use it, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> While I was almost always able to figure out what the seller was trying to say, I think the lack of attention to detail in the instruction booklet detracts from the quality of the product itself (I say, as I write a review that almost certainly has a typo somewhere).  </li>
            <li> The attachments are perfect for my uneven rough skin with a mix of skin that needs a good clean brush/ buff.</li>
            <li> first time used it felt really good and soft.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great alternative to the more expensive ones out there.</li>
            <li> Wow, this really polished my face nicely!  </li>
            <li> So, I am always looking for products that I can use at home, that I can use to unclog and clogged pores, and to keep my skin looking bright and refreshed, as if I&#x27;ve had a facial.  </li>
            <li> As long as you put fresh batteries in the brush works great.</li>
            <li> received a sample for evaluation, and really believe that this product provides excellent value for the money, as there are similar rotary brushes that cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li> Very sleek and stylish body brush.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for those on a budget but looking for a good skin care system.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> If the brushes get warn, the price is so good that I will order 2 the next time.</li>
            <li> It comes with seven attachments which is so cool</li>
            <li> I received a replacement and really fell in love with the brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes 2 AA batteries that aren&#x27;t included, so after ordering this make sure that you have the batteries so that you&#x27;re ready to use it after you get in the mail.</li>
            <li> Cool product.</li>
            <li> But overall this product is good.</li>
            <li> There are also some nice soft brushes, too, so</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush:</li>
            <li> I am very well pleased with this model.</li>
            <li> liked the latex soft sponge for applying face cream and foundation.</li>
            <li> With this brush, I am able to be as gentle or aggressive as I need to be cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li> I like the longer face brush for my face as it feels more gentle and cleans well.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Face wash is also very clean, very thoroughly clean the dirt.</li>
            <li> The brushes and sponges are very gentle on the skin, and being handheld, this tool is relatively easy to control.  </li>
            <li> Great product the seller was extremely concerned with my happiness and the communication was open.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the attachments is pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> I found everything to be easy to use and the heads were not difficult at all to change out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, the instructions tell you exactly what to do and have pictures to follow as well,</li>
            <li> My skin has many red belminishes and it takes them away leaving my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these for my 16 year old (who hates any kind of hygiene regimen) for her acne-prone face, and she raved about it from the first use!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for something mostly for the face, this particular set has a lot of options.  </li>
            <li> Great exfoliator gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> Compares well to the branded option, and it arrived quickly (Imported).  </li>
            <li> I’m lucky</li>
            <li> Quick delivery too.</li>
            <li> What a nice way to have such smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I found myself putting more effort in than the brush, you&#x27;d be better off not turning it on, saving your batteries, and physically scrubbing your face yourself.</li>
            <li> Logistics is quickly, things quickly received, Yesterday given and today arrived.</li>
            <li> I used 2 other brand brushes but this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> This makes washing my face fun:) I love all the options, especially the exfoliating brush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great, love the different heads it comes with, I use this daily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comfortable soft brush, face massage skills, able to deep clean feeling supple and moisturized after washing the face, apply the mask can be better absorbed.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush shortly after my sister bought the Dermabrush, thinking I was getting the better deal and a more highly ranked brush, therefore it had to be better, right?</li>
            <li> It is more clear and clean.</li>
            <li> I look very much like many of the jigsaw puzzles reviewed by my fellow reviewer Joseph Dewey reviews (check his review of this very item here as well-</li>
            <li> I took off a star because the attachments wobble as they spin, although it isn&#x27;t significant and doesn&#x27;t make the product less effective!</li>
            <li> The best part is the heads fit my other bigger brush</li>
            <li> I got  this for my face, after 2 days use I noticed that some of the dry skin around my nose has cleared, it feels good makes skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> But I am trying very much to survive the many surgeries I just completed with more on the horizons if I can regain enough strength to survive those surgeries.</li>
            <li> So overall I&#x27;m super happy with this product so far!</li>
            <li> some and feeling face also clean a lot, like it very much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! ! !</li>
            <li> , i love the 7 different heads you can easily snap onto it.</li>
            <li> WOrks great for a small price...definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> For lazy people, this cleansing instrument is really convenient, you can do the clean by yourself at home, very good.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was delighted with this product it takes my cream cleanser</li>
            <li> I find that it removes older skin cells very gently, lathers up facial cleansers and helps serums and creams to sink in, which in turn makes them more effective.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d certainly recommend this to a friend and consider it good enough to give as a gift to family.</li>
            <li> included in package) with 2 speeds,to give a gentle and smooth feelings,not a harm pressure on your skin</li>
            <li> The two brush attachments feel great on the skin and can remove dead skin on the outermost surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, I am happy to report that it did make a difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this so much.</li>
            <li> But, this brush does come with attachments that would do a great job exfoliating dead skin all over.  </li>
            <li> No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful that I was offered this complimentary massager to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heads are about 1 ¼ inches wide, also allowing good control and precision application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To better clear up and exfoliate skin</li>
            <li> Totally worth the $</li>
            <li> However, I will definitely say that this is an effective tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this and now that i have this it is so useful.</li>
            <li> Powerful, is the strength of what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> and I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that this item arrived early.</li>
            <li> I always wanted a nice facial machine, but did not want to spend $200.00 for one.</li>
            <li> Fun</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, it&#x27;s so fun to use</li>
            <li> To better clear up and exfoliate skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say is it isn&#x27;t as powerful as I wanted it to be</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazingly soft and enjoyable to use.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too soon for me to know if I will achieve any measure of success.</li>
            <li> I gave my and my wife&#x27;s honest review above &amp; posted it.</li>
            <li> I gave my and my wife&#x27;s honest review above &amp; posted it.</li>
            <li> Liked the pumice stone especially well.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it so far</li>
            <li> To better clear up and exfoliate skin</li>
            <li> I try it as soon as I received it and the brush for the face is smooth and it comes with 6 more massager definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> I noticed that using this PIXNOR 7-in-1 massager with other facial products makes it more effective and i love how it feels unto my skin.</li>
            <li> For dry skin, it is the perfect exfoliating, but I don&#x27;t recommend grinding it into your skin or staying on one spot too long.</li>
            <li> But it is just about right for getting rid of elbow calluses.  </li>
            <li> For exfoliation, my scrubby stuff just falls right off of the brush because it&#x27;s just rotating SO SLOWLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for the cost, it&#x27;s about right.</li>
            <li> Because it is so gentle in action, it is perfectly suitable for all parts of the face and neck.</li>
            <li> Just received it today and have used it on my facial,  the first time will hurt but your face will get used to it, but every part is super and my skin looks more healthy after using this product,  its cleaning your face and getting a rid of the dead skin so no pain no gain, amazing.</li>
            <li> was sso excited when I purchased this product two days ago and was thrilled when I got it today, due to Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> In particular, I&#x27;m working to smooth out scar tissue on my forehead</li>
            <li> Washing face very smooth, very clean, blackheads not so dark.</li>
            <li> Really, it is not that bad...just don&#x27;t expect too many bells and whistles and don&#x27;t expect it to be very fast (within reason) and it is OK for the price;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the appliance is light and well shaped, easy to hold and manoeuvre, and the different heads can be removed and exchanged with no fuss at all.</li>
            <li> It is pink/white, and I personally think would be an excellent starter kit for young girls or teens who want to take care of their skin like their female role models, without spending a lot of money or buying a product designed to tackle skin issues that come with age.</li>
            <li> I love the different heads and the multi speed is nice for different areas and control.  </li>
            <li> Awesome, works like some of the more professional expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how good my skin looks now, and I know I&#x27;m not exaggerating because I had at least 5 people at work comment about how good I looked - younger and my skin is brighter, after about a week of using all three.  </li>
            <li> Feel the difference right after my first try</li>
            <li> I have used it only two weeks and used it every day so far so good.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super clean &amp; smoothe, the brushes are soft so when your washing your face</li>
            <li> That is why I apply it after washing my face with warm water, and apply it on a dry face.</li>
            <li> With 7 different massagers it&#x27;s a great product with different options.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great brush and definitely affordable.</li>
            <li> This is a great value as well, getting all the attachments for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Great Buy for such a low price!</li>
            <li> All in all, it is a good start to an affordable way to have a deep clean for your face washing routine, with added extra heads for bonus!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to loud and the attachments change easily</li>
            <li> My face really does feel more alive, and awake.</li>
            <li> This product is a great affordable alternative to the more expensive models out there.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to use for deep cleaning your face and body but especially your face.  </li>
            <li> Your face will feel extra super clean after you use it!</li>
            <li> in that I’ve good skin, never had acne or any large open pores, but my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> It is very gentle....</li>
            <li> Although I do not think it does this, it does remove makeup with closer (so very gentle exfoliation).  </li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one of the 7 heads and all 7 of them are very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> Works very very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product feels very cheap and did not function properly.  </li>
            <li> It works very nicely, and I&#x27;ve used more expensive brushes/massagers, and this holds up in comparison.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will use it frequently!</li>
            <li> /&gt;4.Rolling massager:Stimulates blood circulation to stimulate collagen production and reduce fine lines (for anti-aging)&lt;br /&gt;5.Short soft brush:Gently brushes away residue from exfoliation</li>
            <li> It saves a lot of time from trying to clean up your face by hand using normal brushes and scrubbers.  </li>
            <li> portable facial and body brush is cute, and came with clear easy to follow directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kind of cheap and not very effective.</li>
            <li> Say what you will but essentially we all will find our own particular use for it.</li>
            <li> It played a huge part in helping me clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> and I wish it was a bit faster and more dynamic</li>
            <li> a pretty color.  </li>
            <li> First of all I want to say this is a value for money product.</li>
            <li> My skin actually looks healthy again with a shine.</li>
            <li> person with diabetes may not be able to feel his or her feet properly.</li>
            <li> People with diabetes must be fully aware of how to prevent foot problems before they occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am adding photos of the foot of a diabetic, before and after the first treatment using the Pixnor pumice applicator.  </li>

            <li> ; which was only a couple of dollars more..</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t for sure about using this Pixnor facial and body cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after using it for the first time my skin was the softest its been in over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> I first put it out of its plastic storage containers, I think,</li>
            <li> oh wow, this is incredibly cheap.</li>
            <li> was in my face, the first time I use it after I taked my makeup off</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I love how with the sponge setting, I can evenly apply my lotion to my entire face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Overall an okay product</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with different scrubs.</li>
            <li> The first week I used it, I broke out more than I normally do, so it is obviously getting deeper into my skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes stopped working after the first month of use</li>
            <li> Broke after the first use.</li>
            <li> Purchase this facial kit, you will be glad u did.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this during a recent promotion.</li>
            <li> Love this facial brush.</li>
            <li> My skin feels sooo much cleaner after using it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not really a massager, but it does have a kind of massaging extension, which is the one with four balls.</li>
            <li> HER &amp;#34;scar tissue&amp;#34; is mostly referring to a physical scar, one you SEE on the skin when looking at it it.</li>
            <li> For all that women have to endure in there day to day lives under the best of circumstances, I love to find a product like this that can give them at least a few minutes of &#x27;ME&amp;#34; time.</li>

            <li> love this massager and use it daily except for when I use a derma roller.</li>
            <li> love this massager and use it daily except for when I use a derma roller.</li>
            <li> Love all the different heads you can use, I do wish the speed was a tad faster.</li>
            <li> Had fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> I have not yet used the more abrasive body attachments, as I just have an issue using my facial tool on my body, too.  </li>
            <li> I love the duo speed and how you can not only wash your face with it but also massage.</li>
            <li> After viewing a lot about similar products, bought this because I wanted something more to help me wash my face.</li>
            <li> A week later the color of face obviously much better, smaller pores, the skin became a lot better.</li>
            <li> Pretty impressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> save lots of money on salon nail fills get done and keep em up your self with the included inter-changeable attachments great exfoliating and deep cleansing brushes for the face and a very nice soft buffer for the face to help buff the dead skin left after you exfolliate.</li>
            <li> The sound is just a slight \\&quot;humming whine\\&quot;, but the thunderous hum you hear in my video :)</li>
            <li> I do get a deeper clean, but it&#x27;s the same clean</li>
            <li> far I like it great for the price I found the little scrubber attachment to work better then the bigger one for my face</li>
            <li> ( I make my own, nice and simple oil based) to work up a lather and gently exfoliate any dead skin.</li>
            <li> I found it needs to be used very gently, pressure more than the lightest just makes the heads stop rotating, but once I’d worked out how much pressure to use it was simple.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to be beautiful, too late!</li>
            <li> There are two rough ones, two smooth brushes, two smooth sponges, and one four-balled extension.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face was so clean a d soft</li>
            <li> This on works really well also, but is not as firm, which I loved.</li>
            <li> but since I received this I&#x27;ve gotten better at washing my face (only because it&#x27;s much easier and faster now...)</li>
            <li> My face was left feeling clean and refreshed after using it!</li>
            <li> Nice  clean body i can exfoliate without scrubbing my Skin so hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &amp;#34;To make better skin circumstances from aging.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Please take out batteries if long time no use.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Do not disassemble the device if not being professional.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use this consistently, my skin is definitely much softer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really left my face soft  and smooth, but it seems so cheaply made that i may have to buy it again in six months or</li>
            <li> This one comes with more attachments and as long as you haven&#x27;t run the batteries out, works just as well.</li>
            <li> it is small so good for traveling.</li>
            <li> Feels good in hand since its small plus</li>
            <li> This little gadget does a really good job of cleaning my pores and my skin is always so soft right after.</li>
            <li> Love this little tool for apply my facial cleansers, two power setting and multiple different heads make this a great bargain!</li>
            <li> And there is a rough disk-like attachment (shown at the top in the first product image) that I would also not use on the face.  </li>
            <li> It come with seven massage heads of different functions, it&#x27;s easy to figure out how to put in the batteries and</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wash out (off the device), and let it dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> item requires batteries and it is easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to exert any pressure to exfoliate the dry skin on my feet without the spinning head coming to a</li>
            <li> Instructions are short, so it is easy to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> The polishing wheel in particular, has proved to be more useful than I expected.</li>
            <li> But the strength or power isn&#x27;t that strong,  only when the bristles starts to get rougher.</li>
            <li> The power isn&#x27;t overly strong, but it definitely still works even when applying pressure.</li>
            <li> I also have friends that I have a certain &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It deeply cleansed my skin, and made it super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very high quality product.</li>
            <li> It just sounded like plastic rubbing on plastic while it was in motion and not like a very high quality device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Agree with other comments before steaming the face is necessary, it may be easier to put the best face on the skin brush, if you wash your face for the first time to become very dry, and then use it.</li>
            <li> It takes two AA batteries (not included) and does not come with any kind of carry pouch or case (however, if you save the box, there are neat little slots for every attachment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to receive this facial and body brush as I&#x27;ve always wanted to try one but never could really afford them.</li>
            <li> Get the goods after the evening could not wait to use, with a mild massage brush and sponge brush, the overall feeling is washed clean than before, because the tight feeling after washing the face is more intense than their face.</li>
            <li> massager - four trapped balls in the head rotate and roll over your skin (actually feels great on my face)&lt;br /&gt;A fine stone and a coarse stone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small and comfortable in your hand and it is not awkward to use and you can easily and quickly go over your entire face.  </li>
            <li> , I found a huge difference in the size of my pores and my overall texture of the skin.</li>
            <li> I was expecting much faster (within reason).  </li>
            <li> Therefore, the brush is gentle and not abrasive on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The brush glides gently on skin.   </li>
            <li> I did not think it made a real dent on soles of feet but feet was softer.</li>
            <li> (I guess I was hoping for something much faster than my hands but not as fast as a Phillips sonicare tooth-brush)   </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as fast speed as others, but it does it job.</li>
            <li> The sponge really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t really feel like anything when using it.</li>
            <li> Personally since I use this item around water, I would like water proof available for this type of item.</li>
            <li> It has really made a difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> i really like this product a lot for</li>
            <li> Product works really well as a cleaning or a dee cleaning routine.</li>
            <li> My skin says thanks everytime</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had my eye on the Clarisonic but at over $100, I do not want to spend so much money.</li>
            <li> This massager and cleaner has seven attachments and they are all usefull and works so very well for a very afordable price.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with my skin care products I use before bed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are like me and have a nightly skin cleansing ritual!</li>
            <li> My face smoother, clearer, looks much</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> really wish this had my power to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and really helps out with exfoliating.</li>
            <li> not irritating at all</li>
            <li> this product is more than I expected.</li>
            <li> so well I have used it several times and it&#x27;s so light weight</li>
            <li> but really does the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I believe my camera made this brush sound louder than it actually is.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and my daughter loves the way this cleans her skin</li>
            <li> but much longer needles to </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t even really get close to your face without it jamming up.</li>
            <li> The motor must not be made very well.</li>
            <li> The clariaonic is much wider</li>
            <li> I have owned a few different brands of these and this is definitely not the best.</li>
            <li> I feel like if I use too much pressure it may break.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate any company that looks to make their customers happy when they are not happy with their purchase.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much smoother after I am finished.</li>
            <li> Long-term effects are not known, but there is still very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Device shuts off when applied gently to the face.  </li>
            <li> This works much better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Gently brushes away residue from exfoliation&lt;</li>
            <li> ladies and gentlemen, I absolutely had to update my review on this product.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any one who wants a face cleanser.</li>
            <li> So can&#x27;t be to rough :)</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want too much power</li>
            <li> Maybe I spent way too many years working for the Police Department and am overly suspicious?</li>
            <li> Maybe I spent way too many years working for the Police Department and am overly suspicious?</li>
            <li> very well making</li>
            <li> product works very well at cleaning out your pores and massaging your face..  </li>
            <li> All the brushes and head attachments that come with the unit work very well.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this unit!</li>
            <li> really like it uses 2 AA batteries so is easier to find and cheaper too.</li>
            <li> you so much</li>
            <li> i can really see the difference on my face.</li>
            <li> very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> found it to be very underpowered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well priced and makes my skin feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle and cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Really recommend this.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply soap and lather brush and wet face.</li>
            <li> It would also be helpful to have better and clear instructions on what/where to use the different heads.  </li>
            <li> For example, after soaking your feet in a warm bath, use the pumice head to get rid of calluses and dead skin.</li>
            <li> Effectively exfoliates all the dead skin and gets rid of makeup on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whenever I pressed too hard, the Pixnor stopped, perfect because after the first use much of the dead tissue was gone but the skin on the foot was not even red with irritation or injured.g effects of fine lines, wrinkles and discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> The handle is made of silicone, comfortable to hold and the small size makes it easy to control with precision.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Light weight &amp; easy to hold, small size but</li>
            <li> In the scrub is huge, especially for those who wear a lot of makeup or those with low time to clean the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s, so I really just needed something to thoroughly clean off my make up and clear my pores to prevent acne.</li>
            <li> It was really nice of her since I still use it &amp; think that it is a decent facial brush, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it concerns me enough that I want to bring it up right here, right NOW.</li>
            <li> But it concerns me enough that I want to bring it up right here, right NOW.</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and  smooth after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> She said she felt skin clean than before wash with hands, the next day to find that the skin became more tense, a bit too smooth.</li>
            <li> I have really good skin naturally, and I only get a pimple or two on occasion, so this was very strange.  </li>
            <li> Each day I use the sponges along with my facial cleanser to clean my face, then the rolling massager on my face and neck, when I apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is comfortable to use on the skin though and does a good job as a face cleanser (less so as an exfoliator) and has a lot of attachments included (just missing a case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it to clean my face then attached the facial massage head</li>
            <li> You can use it on other parts of your body but the brushes are small so using it on the face is really the ideal application and for that it is a must have item for women.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The high speed isn&#x27;t that fast, and the motor doesn&#x27;t develop a lot of torque.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple times and its not very fast or strong.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads cannot be purchased but this is so inexpensive that if you want new heads, it&#x27;s easy enough to buy a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.ds cannot be purchased but this is so inexpensive that if you want new heads, it&#x27;s easy enough to buy a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> And even though I have long fingers, it still feels comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised,  nor am I complaining, It was a cheap pricee</li>
            <li> This facial and body brush is everything I expected it to be and more!</li>
            <li> This massager stops if I exert too much pressure, by letting it gently remove the dead skin cells without pressure, his healthy skin is not damaged or irritated at all.</li>
            <li> and I actually use it on days when I do a full face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used the exfoliation attachments I don&#x27;t think those would be fast enough to actually be useful.</li>
            <li> [[[This item is definitely a good substitute for the more expensive facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and will travel nicely.</li>
            <li> She uses a more expensive brand, she said, this is as good as (currently she is in her teens picky interference - LOL).&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> The brush wasn&#x27;t too hard and was happy with the initial results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brush like this for my skin and originally bought it because honestly I am quite lazy and will sometimes skip a night because it&#x27;s just been a long day</li>
            <li> Also please use the pink buffer with caution, it&#x27;s easy to overdo it.</li>
            <li> switching out the brush heads is super simple, like a peg.</li>
            <li> This simple, safe, inexpensive, well thought out massager has become a necessity, used daily and sometimes twice or three times a day in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> I take the head off and wash out after use, the main unit needs to be kept out of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, a simple drawstring fabric bag would be adequate and ensure everything kept in place.  </li>
            <li> I have a larger one by another company but the smaller one is much better to travel with.</li>
            <li> Having facial at the salon is so pricey, glad that i have this Pixnor Massager, I can do facial at home or wherever I go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward for this to more deeply cleanse and exfoliate my skin (especially to remove stubborn blackheads).</li>
            <li> I wonder if this is how our faces felt when we were kids before we got older and started putting gunk on our face and clogging our pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall for the price (currently 11 bucks), this is a decent facial massager although not as high powered or sturdy as some that cost a bit more.  </li>
            <li> think the major issue with the product is the fact the motor in the gun (2 x AA batteries) isn&#x27;t strong enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The brush includes the 7 different function massaging heads keep my skin clean and clear!</li>
            <li> Only used the brush so far &amp; worth the money ;)</li>
            <li> It really gets deep into your pores and gets the job done right.</li>
            <li> And the kicker is that this brush isn&#x27;t strong enough to rotate on your skin unless you barely touch it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> pixnor beauty massager is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> For the first few times I used this brush I noticed the machine started to get really hot to the touch, after that it still got hot but wasn&#x27;t as hot</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I thought I would need the brush to always be at the high setting</li>
            <li> But high speed never stalls.&lt;br</li>
            <li> high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The instructions are great for letting you know how the facial scrubber works, but there are numerous typos throughout the English version of the instructions (they are in multiple languages).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend all three products.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I pressed too hard, the Pixnor stopped, perfect because after the first use much of the dead tissue was gone but the skin on the foot wasnot even red with irritation or injured.</li>
            <li> There are 2 heads that I thought surely was gonna rub and hurt my skin,since I do have sensitive skin, but those 2 were just as painless as the other 5.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little more high powered, however for the price</li>
            <li> Nice little gadget for cleaning my face, works reasonable well, but I have to agree with other reviews, it should be a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li> I like that you are given options as far as attachments, but I know certain ones</li>
            <li> I do have to use a little more moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush.</li>
            <li> power is weak but good for a soft gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li> I pair this with my clean and clear facial wash.</li>
            <li> it helped clear up my skin and gave it a deep clean.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to change the heads and the heads seem to last a very long time!!  </li>
            <li> I use my regular face soap and moisturizers but this brush gets it into the pores and removes dead skin leaving my face soft clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> With a whole slew of attachments, this battery operated beauty set has something for nearly every type of skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, so far the results look promising.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall great product so far, my only complaint would be that it is not water-proof so you cannot use this in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and its soft head brush doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li> Batteries do not come with the set, and the manufacturer suggest taking the batteries out after each usage.(assuming the device will be wet after use)&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company for purposes of review.</li>
            <li> I started using it two weeks ago as a welcome addition to my dry-brushing routine, which is difficult to do on the face.</li>
            <li> I bought the Bel essence originally as a great moisturizer (I am skeptical of the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; claims in creams), but I have to warn you</li>
            <li> This should be mentioned clearly on the description of the product, and really?</li>
            <li> It is as powerful as I hoped and proper price for the product quality.</li>
            <li> Normal sweat secretion and oil production that lubricates the skin of the foot is impaired.  </li>
            <li> Normal sweat secretion and oil production that lubricates the skin of the foot is impaired.  </li>
            <li> The LONG BRUSH  exfoliates and deep cleans better need after being ouside.</li>
            <li> multi use product works for helping with manicure and pedicure as well as face 7 different  attachments all that are useful</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, I feel my skin appears more radiant and is cleaner than ever.</li>
            <li> only attachment that I found useful was the latex sponge.</li>
            <li> My reason, not enough power to make the assortment of attachments useful.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my face is looking so much better nowadays...</li>
            <li> For normal use it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive facial cleaner, callus remover, etc., and don&#x27;t need a waterproof version, this is worth checking</li>
            <li> This item for only around $10.00 delivered at the time of my review is so well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> NO complaints:-)s item for only around $10.00 delivered at the time of my review is so well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> For only $12.99 vs the upward price of a Clarisonic being $130 its well worth.</li>
            <li> It works quite nicely, it moves slow</li>
            <li> I like how this comes with 7 different heads that you can easily switch out and each does something different for your skin.</li>
            <li> : Use with your facial cleanser to deep clean and gently exfoliate</li>
            <li> :Use with your facial cleanser to deep clean and gently exfoliate</li>
            <li> Now from my wife who has very large scars on her face, forehead up through the upper scalp area.</li>
            <li> I follow with the long &amp; short soft brush to make sure everything is removed.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a black head with a significant effect (which is my main reason to buy this), but my skin feel great, my foundation is to last for a long time because my skin less oily.</li>
            <li> I placed brand new batteries and item does not funtion.</li>
            <li> So after reading the directions and the function of each piece I put my 2 AA batteries in my new gadget and turned it on.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, my skin feels brand new.</li>
            <li> You would wanna use new batteries to get the speed and power it needs to work.</li>
            <li> It is smaller in overall size than other facial brushes making it great for travel IMO.  </li>
            <li> Also, the body of the facial cleaner is not waterproof, which seems like a bad idea to me, being as it could easily be dropped in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, however, this provides a great cleaning for the price.</li>
            <li> The unit cannot be immersed in water, so you have to clean it carefully with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li> it isnt too harsh on the face, so i think it would be safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very cute, small enough I carry it in my makeup box.  </li>
            <li> I just removed them from the device and used mild dish soap and water, then let them air dry.  </li>
            <li> I only use the two brush attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Paired with a gentle foaming cleanser, this spinning brush makes my skin so much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> This brush will really clean your face, which means it takes off all the natural oils as well and can leave your skin dry.  </li>
            <li> Do not have this time is too long, but so far is not bad.</li>
            <li> The cycle and speed is very very gentle, it clarifies the skin and at the same time it cleanse it.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and acne prone, so cleansing is very very vital.</li>
            <li> That area was burning and was very sensitive to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft in my face..</li>
            <li> fi e and brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether you have dry, normal, oily or sensitive skin, mild exfoliation</li>
            <li> This is a great unit; however, the only change I would make is to add more power, a stiffer complexion brush and less useless accessories.</li>
            <li> (I do not think it provides a deep exfoliation which is why I bought the brush in the first place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than clarasonic and it does the job, I had read the reviews other buyer left and decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li> For my husband gently removing the calloused and dead skin from his feet without injuring healthy skin is a must for his health, for others it is only a should.</li>
            <li> On top of these visible benefits of healthier, younger looking skin, facial massages can help you relax, reduce stress and simply bring about the feeling of indulging yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> There was no power to the tool and found it to be a complete bust!</li>
            <li> Most of the time I would wear make up and remove it using makeup wipes, and then I cleanse my face using my facial cleanser and use this device to deeply cleanse whatever residue left.</li>
            <li> I did not buy any more of facial cleanser, but I think it will work just as well with other cleaning agents.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it would come with just one brush, but I can get multiple uses out of it.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> First off, I want to say I&#x27;ve only used this on my feet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful with sensitive skin areas, and also MAKE SURE ALL HAIR IS TIED BACK!</li>
            <li> The quality of this seems ok but doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as other similar devices.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda small, but it&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li> Also keep it on the lower setting when you first start using it until you can see how your skin takes the different speeds</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> If it succeeds or not at reducing MY type of internal scar tissue, or my wife&#x27;s external type scar tissue is really not of huge importance.</li>

            <li> This brush means its easy to use a little soap</li>
            <li> It is a very inexpensive tool and works decently for facial cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There just didn&#x27;t seem to be enough power and it would never give me that deep clean that I was hoping for</li>
            <li> The gentle exfoliation possible with its two brushes can be very beneficial to improve the look and tone of facial skin, and the fact that it&#x27;s so easy to use would certainly encourage someone who would not normally bother, male or female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Typos would not stop me from highly recommending this to anyone who wants the feel of a facial every day, without the redness and irritation that comes along with someone else poking and prodding at your face.</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little plain but effective to hold the various heads without crushing them.</li>
            <li> I have used a few days before to evaluate, it&#x27;s different with what I imagined, and I thought for the first time would not have any effect, but to my surprised was that this was effective, skin tight feeling after used, the first time feel the itch.</li>
            <li> It came with a few different brush heads that is suitable to whatever your skin needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Later, my skin feels so smooth, and at the end of the day and less greasy.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:31c7b25a7c2a25a11d7981f9b20bda13]] Includes the cleansing unit (2 AA batteries are required but not included), an microdermabrasion brush, latex sponge brush, make-up sponge brush, rolling massager, short soft brush, long fine brush, pumice applicator, and the instructions.  </li>
            <li> The brush exfoliates very well, the cleanser gets rid of dirt and oil, and the Bel Essence gives my skin new life - smooth, line free (still faint lines in my forehead and between my eyebrows, but barely noticeable) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;This facial and body brush, while operated by 2 AA batteries, it is pretty quiet which is a great feature since you can use it basically whenever and wherever without disturbing anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am excited to use the other attachments!</li>
            <li> The removal of dead skin cells speeds up the skin renewal process allowing healthier skin cells to take their place reducing the aging effects of fine lines, wrinkles and discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am filled with oily skin all my life, of course I&#x27;m not a person with acne (just odd red point), but I was very upset my blackheads.</li>
            <li> The gentle exfoliation possible with its two brushes can be very beneficial to improve the look and tone of facial skin, and the fact that it&#x27;s so easy to use would certainly encourage someone who would not normally bother, male or female.</li>
            <li> But I wish it had more power, it stops if you press too hard (which isn&#x27;t alot of pressure).</li>
            <li> I also like how easy it is to go from one head to the other (there are 7 different heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush has 2 settings, low and high, both the exact same speed</li>
            <li> There are seven heads: two brushes of different depths, two sponge applicators for make-up and creams, two buffing ones, (one is mildly abrasive, the other is made of pumice stone and suitable for small calluses).</li>
            <li> Simple and convenient to use, it is suitable for lazy people like me to use.</li>
            <li> Really there are 4 different attachments and</li>
            <li> gentle enough to use on a baby should you desire to do so.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft.</li>
            <li> The different attachments, help make this product a very versatile health and beauty tool.  </li>
            <li> being gentle is crucial to your skins health.</li>

            <li> The brush action seems too slow.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;The SHORT BRUSH so gentle and cleans my skin</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels when it is moisturizing and the different adapters.</li>
            <li> my skin felt soft and no harm no foul.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR</li>
            <li> face has definitely been much clearer after I used this.</li>
            <li> I do get the feeling it will break, so I&#x27;ve been extra gentle with it.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels soft now</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, blemishes, pimples, and like everyone else, wow.</li>
            <li> I really did, but it feel short in my book.</li>
            <li> I have always been plagued by extremely sensitive skin, and this brush hasn&#x27;t caused pain, dryness or redness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it helpful to use items like this on my face as they are usually far too abrasive</li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really recommend this, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a face brush but don&#x27;t want to spend $100s on one.</li>
            <li> It has no where near the power or scrubbing feeling that you get with a Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> Latex soft sponge:</li>
            <li> It feels soft on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use the make-up sponges to massage around my eye areas since they are more delicate.  </li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and I have combination/oily skin.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the massaging head does not connect completely, and it falls off a lot.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li> so far works</li>
            <li> And maybe it&#x27;s because my skin might be sensitive or</li>
            <li> stall on the low speed with too much pressure.</li>
            <li> It is a device that offers ME a degree of hope, it makes my wife feel pampered.</li>
            <li> It is a device that offers ME a degree of hope, it makes my wife feel pampered.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it every day, but like it so far.</li>
            <li> impresses so far with the quality of the pieces,not abrasive and soft to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And the box was a joke, obviously directly copied from Google Translate or something because it made no sense</li>
            <li> So far this is an a+ product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> That skin is especially sensitive and fragile and you can end up with cleanser in your eyes.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;2.Latex soft sponge:</li>
            <li> the next morning I found skin is very slippery.</li>
            <li> People are going to say all types of negative remarks but the truth is most are not using the brush correctly.</li>
            <li> The included brush is soft, but get the job done.</li>
            <li> TL;DR Don&#x27;t waste your time and money and go with something better like the Dermabrush that will actually scrub your face.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the expensive name brands.</li>
            <li> Also, I suppose I don&#x27;t mind that this isn&#x27;t water proof since I&#x27;ve gotten used to only soaking the brush head itself, and I definitely worry about keeping the heads clean, but I clean them with baby shampoo after each use and keep them in a small plastic container.</li>
            <li> Had an issue with the product initially but the company went above and beyond to make it right.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s smaller than other facial and body brushes so that I can take it with me wherever I go!</li>
            <li> It does take a little extra time to gently exfoliat with this as opposed to scrubbing but this is much better for your skin in long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never thought such a product could clean my face in such a short time.</li>
            <li> What I do like about this product that I did not get with other brands is the different heads available.  </li>
            <li> At first I did not use it every day, because it dried out my face a little, but now I use it every day, love it.</li>
            <li> I only use them very lightly on my skin, as I don&#x27;t want to tug at it and make excessive wrinkles, but I do want to improve circulation to my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had spinning facial brushes in the past that I liked, but none had even close to seven different attachments.  </li>
            <li> At 9pm I went to take a shower and looked in the mirror to find that the area right beneath my left eyebrow was severely swollen, hot, sensitive to the touch, and that some of my eyebrow was missing.  </li>
            <li> It is also a short but sweet review for ME anyway as this is a very limited use device in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I always use this everyday to clean my face..</li>
            <li> Decent enough does the job well</li>
            <li> , I just open the package, took out a handheld device and the main components of the brush.</li>
            <li> The first one I received did not work properly, as the low setting did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this facial brush to anyone who is exactly like me and has been dreaming of the day to try a product like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the high end one, but for this price, it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> The motor is very quiet though even on high speed.  </li>
            <li> aND it sure did take off the dead skin dry patches.</li>
            <li> Its gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin and simple to use too.</li>
            <li> Not sure what thes are like in stores, but this one seemed cheap.</li>
            <li> His feet are starting to look normal.  </li>
            <li> For the one or two brush heads that are useful, this device is not worth spending the money.by the wayside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the one or two brush heads that are useful, this device is not worth spending the money.</li>
            <li> so I try to use products that aren’t too heavy or full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is not only keeping face clean and more soft but also taking away dirty and oil with it.</li>
            <li> Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li> I am attempting to break down this tissue to be absorbed within my body for pain relief.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Two foam pads, one a soft sponge, the other a little more rigid - for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Rolling</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pointless other than making it look more high tech.</li>
            <li> Yes,I get a little red, but I&#x27;m light skinned, so I&#x27;m used to it.</li>
            <li> your skin look puffy and loose; a daily facial massage when you apply moisturizer of 5 minutes once a day or  two to three minutes twice a day is all it takes to increase facial muscle tone, reduce fluid and puffiness, creating a brighter more even complexion, increased cell renewal and softer skin .</li>

            <li> This Pixnor Portable 7-in-1 System has everything you need to clean deep down in your pores and also massage your skin.  </li>
            <li> This means that it has less power than many other battery-operated tools like this.  </li>
            <li> once or twice a week and deep exfoliation once or twice a month literally brings new life to your complexion, leaving you with visibly brighter, healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation rids the skin of dead skin cells which keeps the pores clean and clear, preventing blackheads, acne, as well as creating the appearance of smaller pores.</li>
            <li> If you are ONLY looking to use the gentle facial brushes, this lower power won&#x27;t bother you.  </li>

            <li> Short soft brush: To clear up all scurf clings on the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> : Right after I posted the review, it was voted down.</li>
            <li> but on my right it rotates down</li>
            <li> Tons of different attachments for scrubbing your face at a very low cost, it also came in the mail very fast definitely reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so facials are a big no-no for me.  </li>
            <li> Super cool facial machine, the only thing I did not like is that the speed is very slow.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would like and feels a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> I find that all of the ones that I have tested have about the same high and low speeds, for example, and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , left my skin feeling lush but not waterproof.</li>
            <li> Cleans deeply, yet softly.</li>
            <li> I just got this product today and used it one time on the low setting and it completely messed up my face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin nor did I have any bumps or breakout prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> Not much power however works really well and does the job.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to help make my skin soft and younger looking.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used the brush attachment so far.</li>
            <li> Because when you turn it on you can barely hear it</li>
            <li> and it can irritate it if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> Short soft brush:</li>
            <li> Pumice: Gently removes rough callused skin on feet and elbows&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that usually with face brushes like this, then all of the extensions are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of different low priced facial &amp;#34;massagers&amp;#34;, and unlike vibrating devices this one really is for cleaning and massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> different length, soft, brushes</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin use the makeup like sponge or the short bristled brush instead of the longer bristled one.</li>
            <li> thought that the pumice head was much too rough to be used on the tender skin of the face.</li>
            <li> It gets a lot of work so the skin quickly gets tough esp as I tend to go barefoot much of the time)</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected it to be!!</li>
            <li> Good portable but a little weak vibration</li>
            <li> Received the goods on the night with the first use, break out of the bubble is very delicate, is much clean than usual hand wash, there will be bald first wash out ~~~  </li>
            <li> First, I would look around to see what other brushes there are within similar price range and see what they can do</li>
            <li> The handle of this device is comfortable to hold and should not slip if your hand is a little wet.  </li>
            <li> Cleansing instrument does a good job, very delicate of washing, the first time I feel very comfortable, not willing to put down, it may be a long time to wash a little Kazakhstan, after a slight tingling of the face, consult the seller, saying that this is a normal phenomenon, like wash your face with a towel and a long face like there will be a little uncomfortable, the next was to control the use of time, using the cleansing instrument washing face is good, but can not use a timeout.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely important safety feature for the feet of diabetics where the slightest injury could cause serious health risks.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought it for exfoliating my face but it also comes with an attachment similar to the Amope for callus and dry skin removal.</li>
            <li> I use is the &amp;#34;Rolling massager: To make better blood circumstances from skin aging&amp;#34; as it is described with poor Chinese translation in the included</li>
            <li> You can get a little carried away with this, so I recommend using a soft cleansing brush daily, and a more exfoliating brush (depends on your skin type what you use) no more than twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I used the short hair brush head on low with my usual cleanser and was immediately excited.  </li>
            <li> A few of them are very gentle</li>
            <li> THAT ruins the review process as the very invaluable tool it is.</li>
            <li> THAT ruins the review process as the very invaluable tool it is.</li>
            <li> Stopped working not long after purchase.</li>
            <li> did not long </li>
            <li> Having used a 4 battery model, this 2 battery does not quite have the power in comparison especially with the microdermabrasion brush, but the cleaning brushes are soft and do the job and foamed the facial cleanser well and did not irritate my skin and is easier to apply a facial cleanser using this than with my hands.  </li>
            <li> a few compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for three months, had just bought my first replacement head, now found my blackheads are almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> I have awful heels and this was a good way to clean them up</li>
            <li> But not being a water proof is really a step down.</li>
            <li> and I may stop any &amp; all reviews like this in future other than my Vine offers from LEGIT companies that CLEARLY Identify themselves and why their product is being reviewed.</li>

            <li> Good quality for price, if planning to use regularly, go for other expensive ones...</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a little more power behind the high speed setting.</li>
            <li> These infections can develop into gangrene, because of the poor blood flow antibiotics cannot get to the site of the infection easily.</li>
            <li> These infections can develop into gangrene, because of the poor blood flow antibiotics cannot get to the site of the infection easily.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how slooooow the high setting was, it was hardly spinning!</li>
            <li> They simply pull straight out and push down in place.</li>
            <li> Any pressure of the brush heads onto the skin causes the motor to slow down even more, almost bringing the brush head to a stop in some cases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reviews saying this thing is slow must want to rub their skin raw in order to get it clean!!</li>
            <li> It takes off all the hard rough patches and easily smooths out the surfaces.</li>
            <li> is equivalent to my big electric vacuum cleaner, a little better, because I like its small size and weight.</li>
            <li> do recommend this particular massager for everyone but especially for older women with delicate, thinner skin and diabetics for foot care.  </li>
            <li> (the first few times I didn&#x27;t even have it on for that long).</li>
            <li> It’s fine for using on face but a little small for using on body in my view.</li>
            <li> I only use the soft brush to wash my face, I don&#x27;t use any of the other attachments.</li>
            <li> This is a decent little face scrubber with lots of attachments.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use the facial brush heads because I use this everyday to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> Then I looked at these member profiles to find only a couple previous reviews and ALL only done on items I also got offers to review from Chinese manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Then I looked at these member profiles to find only a couple previous reviews and ALL only done on items I also got offers to review from Chinese manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Long fine brush, short soft brush, pumice applicator, rolling massager, make-up sponge, latex soft sponge and a crude polish accessory.</li>
            <li> The heads can be washed under tepid running water and left to dry before storing, but the body of the appliance must not be immersed in water, for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> problems commonly develop in people with diabetes and can quickly become serious, a routine home foot care regiment is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It leaves my face feeling so soft and clears up any blemishes and dark spots.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s small and compact that it fits into luggage really well.  </li>
            <li> I only use the long bristled exfoliating head.</li>
            <li> Star rating based on ease of use, as I&#x27;ve not been using it long enough to rate on effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> the skin big improve after long time to use. </li>
            <li> Big companies selling much more expensive products do not really reach out to dissatisfied customers or make them jump through hoops to replace the product.</li>
            <li> The long brush head is soft and gentle on the skin, but the short brush head is a bit irritating on my type of skin</li>
            <li> Try it in the morning for a little wake up motivator, or try the soft brush before bed for relaxing!  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and the effect is equally well suited for me.</li>
            <li> I suggest this product should be used probably 2-3 times a week is enough, as it can dry your skin.</li>
            <li> It does not have enough power to remove any dry skin with the pumice stone attachment.  </li>
            <li> I have far less acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the job it does for such a cheap price, how could you go wrong.</li>
            <li> After using for few minutes and getting used to the sensation on the skin I apply different cremes to complete the process.  </li>
            <li> Last, I buff the rough spots with the pumice and apply a facial moisturizer and massage it in.</li>
            <li> I massaged my 10 months old cheeks a little</li>
            <li> The unit has two speeds a low for the delicate skin of your face and a high for tougher callused skin on your feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you exert much pressure on the head while exfoliating the massager stops spinning, and doesn’t seem to do any damage to the massager, furthermore by stopping it protects delicate skin from damage and irritation by the accessories.</li>
            <li> The two brushes that come with the Pixor work very well on delicate skin</li>
            <li> No worth the money barely moves.</li>
            <li> Small brush completely disintegrated after second use.  </li>
            <li> As long as it is below $11, I would probably buy again....</li>
            <li> The device is not waterproof, so do not directly expose it to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About 5 inches long and 1 1/2 inches</li>
            <li> Take the batteries out if not using for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Long ultra-fine brush:</li>
            <li> So far I like it and have used it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I use the long brush attachment every day and the exfoliate once a week.</li>
            <li> Long ultra-fine brush:</li>
            <li> I wet the brush, got some acne soap on it, and put it on my face on the low setting.</li>
            <li> Follow up with the soft brush to brush off the remaining remnants of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I used the soft and slightly firm attachments with my cleaner.</li>
            <li> Also, since the product is not waterproof, I feel I have to be extra careful when i use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> All the soft brushes are fine on both speeds, but the pumice stone and the crude polish stone need a stronger power</li>
            <li> Helps me with my oily skin due to my big pores!</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;edit&amp;#62;.. revised rating to 3 stars because the original started to fail after 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> I just use this for a week now with my other facial products (cream/serum/cleanser)</li>
            <li> Of course that totally includes members of the other gender.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The grammar is low-level, making me ponder if this is a foreign product, as it seems the instructions were translated into English with Google.  </li>
            <li> Some of the brush heads are useful, others are gimmicky and others will be hard to use because of the underpowered motor.</li>
            <li> Some of the brush heads are useful, others are gimmicky and others will be hard to use because of the underpowered motor.</li>
            <li> THAT is my scar tissue (very long story,</li>
            <li> Any amount of pressure applied to your dry skin areas results in the head stopping.  </li>
            <li> then let them air dry on a towel.</li>
            <li> , I have dry but oily skin</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this to exfoliate the dry skin on the heels of my feet.  </li>
            <li> Will probably use this on dry areas of my body excluding my face, as it may be a bit abrasive for me.</li>
            <li> the other 3 attachments are like the 4 previously mentioned but with a different name and different size.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m surprised at how this small machine works</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not powerful enough for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Only down side</li>
            <li> If this grooming tool has a weak point, it is a certain lack of muscle.</li>
            <li> Comes with instructions and small description for the attachments that are in English and not Chinese.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will ever totally get used to the idea of using a facial cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> I have used these previously, but only had three attachments.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with the short brush head, I felt a slight burning sensation on my skin.</li>
            <li> You get a ton of extra heads (not sure that I will ever use them all, but it feels like such a value since I get the option!</li>
            <li> I had dry patches on my skin, and my skin was feeling rough.</li>
            <li> Of late, I get 10-100 of these offers each WEEK!</li>

            <li> 1PIXNOR Facial and Body Brush, 1 Crude Polish Accessory, 1 Latex Soft Sponge, 1 Make-up Sponge, 1 Rolling Massager, 1 Short Soft Brush, 1 Long Ultra-fine Brush,1 Pumice Applicator, and 1 User Manual.</li>
            <li> short brush head seems to work well for removing loose dead skin</li>
            <li> This is a neat little gizmo with lots of different heads that you can use in a variety of ways.  </li>
            <li> Item was as described a little smaller than I anticipated but it does the job!!</li>
            <li> This is a neat little facial brush.  </li>
            <li> its a little smaller than i expected, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I feel like the face brushes are a little too soft to get off even dead skin.</li>
            <li> It is OK (3 stars)...not bad for $11.  </li>
            <li> And it is too bad since I rely SO heavily on reviewers here at Amazon for the THOUSANDS of dollars I spend of my own money on purchases here each year.</li>
            <li> And it is too bad since I rely SO heavily on reviewers here at Amazon for the THOUSANDS of dollars I spend of my own money on purchases here</li>
            <li> This feature also protects delicate facial skin from tiny injuries and damage.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> only negative is that it is not waterproof only the head of the item.</li>
            <li> It is pink...</li>
            <li> You do need to be careful with the polishing stone and pumice stone, as they can be quite abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> and I think I aged 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Pumice applicator: For filing and smoothing rough, calloused</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to get the battery slot wet</li>
            <li> I thought it might feel too rough or scratch my face.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times, </li>
            <li> The pink part of the brush is rubber</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> Speed is minimal.  </li>
            <li> Not a whole lot of power.</li>
            <li> Not much power.</li>
            <li> My PIXNOR arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> You could probably use it in the shower, but try not to get it wet, and don&#x27;t drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with the attachments, you need to be careful not to get water inside the unit.  </li>
            <li> After using this gadget a few weeks, I will say that my skin has improved overall.</li>
            <li> Can get wet (But dont submerge in water)&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> Getting the unit wet doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It IS NOT water proof, so you do have to be careful as to not get the massager wet</li>
            <li> Not very durable.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;7.Pumice:Gently removes rough callused skin on feet and elbows&lt;</li>
            <li> cause it was wet.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry or tight and it helps to improve my skin texture making pores less obvious.</li>
            <li> Between using assorted pain rubs bought here at Amazon, along with this, I hope to little by little &amp;#34;possibly&amp;#34; break down some of this massive amount of internal scar tissue.</li>
            <li> The button that you slide to get the low, high and off is difficult to move.</li>
            <li> The machine itself is not very powerful at all.</li>
            <li> If you press hard, the rotating action slows down, but that could be seen as a safety feature.</li>
            <li> Junk, wanted this to clean fingernails and dirty hands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The crude polish accessory less rough than the pumice head, and better used for elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> A personal little handheld spa treatment!  </li>
            <li> Only used it once, it had very little power.</li>
            <li> My only complaint - if you really need to grind away on a tough heel callus or apply a lot of pressure, you may find this underpowered.</li>
            <li> Yes, the head slows down a bit, if you add the pressure, but in high, you do not should press very hard.</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
            <li> I just received it the other day, packed well</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s never really extra space in a bathroom, so small is good.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Lastly I used the sponge massager head to massage in my usual moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is a Jock, don&#x27;t waist your money, buy the originals from other brands ..</li>
            <li> The only thing could be improved on it, is the rotation which could be a not more.</li>
            <li> You can see this on other reviews below three stars.</li>
            <li> Im hooked and will continue using this every other day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but ordered it because I could get it at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> I used it to exfoliate my face with a facial scrub that I usually use with my hands and when I used it with this</li>
            <li> I just ran the brush, pumice stone, and other wheels I used</li>
            <li> I did throw away the latex sponge, due to contact with people who are severely allergic to latex.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely helpful that that sponge was labelled as a latex product.  </li>
            <li> Like mentioned in other reviews, when you press into your skin it stops.</li>
            <li> not everything is going to extremely exfoliate your face or feet.</li>
            <li> So, don&#x27;t get it for massaging, but do get it for cleaning and your other face</li>
            <li> While the unit isn&#x27;t waterproof it can be used in showers and other places with water..</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like it.</li>
            <li> Be careful around the eyes though!  </li>
            <li> Pixnor&#x27;s hand held massager comes with 7 different massaging heads: a crude polisher, a soft massaging sponge, a make up sponge, a rolling massager, a short and a long brush, and a pumice applicator.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of time researching and facial skin is delicate at every age,</li>
            <li> Almost ALL are written in what seems to me anyway, broken English as translated by Chinese....</li>
            <li> Almost ALL are written in what seems to me anyway, broken English as translated by Chinese....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The softer longer brush head also helped to remove loose dead skin</li>
            <li> studying these facial cleansing, I noticed that there are some other views, you cannot press too hard, or brush will stop rotating.</li>
            <li> The spinning action was not to harsh nor was it uncomfortable or painful which was nice.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t come with batteries but can use conventional or rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Does what it says but some of the interchangable heads are a little rough.</li>
            <li> Two brushes that I use to wash my face with cleanser and a little bit of water (again, careful not to get the massager itself</li>
            <li> The brushes are not too hard on your skin and it has two different speeds.</li>
            <li> This little tool is so small it feels like a toy, however, it has enough power to do what I wanted.</li>
            <li> After all, you don&#x27;t want to put a lot of pressure on the brush heads as they rotate on your delicate facial skin.  </li>
            <li> Not powerful at all .</li>
            <li> This was actually the one that I used the least.</li>
            <li> the dark spots on my face are faded to the point where I can go without foundation if I want and still have an even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> There are many attachments that are essentially worthless because of this issue.</li>
            <li> This brush only rotates one way, and slowly at that.</li>
            <li> the other hand, if you want a tool that will work for your pedicure, too, pass this one by!  </li>
            <li> So for me, the only item on this (by item I mean the attachment)</li>
            <li> It saves money by using less cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE</li>
            <li> so well leaves it softer use less product after.</li>
            <li> Slight amount of pressure and</li>
            <li> I have now used the cleanser three days a week, my skin is quite less greasy.</li>
            <li> The unit itself has a slight rubbery texture to it helping with your grip..</li>
            <li> The only issue in the brush I&#x27;ve been using has a weird odor I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of regardless of washing multiple times.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this instrument, but it&#x27;s mediocre.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this brush, and it is definitely not what I expected from looking at other reviews.</li>
            <li> It would hurt me, at least for me, I use a sponge to wash, please scrub brush, rinse, apply moisturizer, dry, and then use the messenger head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a neat little unit</li>
            <li> This got sent back as soon as I put the batteries in and could feel how weak it was.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t hard or rough on your face.</li>
            <li> You can use this everyday.     </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months with no issues and it&#x27;s still functioning and operating</li>
            <li> /&gt;which help to remove the dead skin from your face leaving it</li>
            <li> This is way too harsh of an exfoliant and will agitate your skin.</li>
            <li> It looked like dried skin flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven’t tried it on scars, I’ve a few but not in visible places and they don’t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Everything works well, and my face has already proven to feel cleaner, softer, and clearer in just the few days that I have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use my hand I can still feel the dead skin and patches.</li>
            <li> I just received mine today and it was missing the instruction manual.  </li>

            <li> rolling massager just seemed gimmicky to me.</li>
            <li> The box opened easily and two of the attachments, which appeared dirty, with a white powdery substance and black and dark gray material almost like dirt falling from them and on them, stupid out immediately.</li>

            <li> few small annoyances, however.</li>
            <li> The slow speed of the motor makes using this head rather ineffective when applying any pressure as the speed slows down too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> little piece!  </li>
            <li> IT IS A LITTLE SLOW, AND IT ROTATES WITH A WOBBLE.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed, very much wanted to try this out</li>
            <li> The washing time should not more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> So when I saw this I immediately purchased one for not much more money.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what to give this product.</li>
            <li> I have never used a face massager before and look forward to trying it but not sure what order to even go in with the attachments.  </li>
            <li> means you can just pop the 12cm x 7cm gun and small brushes into a small make-up bag and take it with you on your travels.</li>
            <li> I didnt think it would be as small as it was</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure why someone would want this thing to go faster?</li>
            <li> But from previous experience, I seriously doubt it.</li>
            <li> But from previous experience, I seriously doubt it.</li>
            <li> Not sure how often the batteries will need to be replaced on this massager.</li>

            <li> Bristles get gross and are very thin unlike the claresonic.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done and in just four days of use I have noticed less pimples and blackheads on my face, my skin feels tighter and firmer immediately after use, and my pores have decreased in size a little!</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is not very good.</li>
            <li> I had a gynae OP and as a side effect, my face was covered with acne, which I never really had a problem like this, I was feeling pretty miserable.</li>
            <li> Near impossible.</li>
            <li> If you press too hard, which isn&#x27;t a ton of pressure, it will stop rotating.</li>

            <li> the head would hardly spin.</li>
            <li> Two are quite hard and pumice-like, and I have yet to use them.</li>
            <li> I gave this item as a gift and since I have not received info or complaint from the recipient, I gave the product  three stars.</li>

            <li> Slow turning and weak</li>
            <li> You have to take the batteries out of it each time to &amp;#34;preserve its life&amp;#34; (as the instructions say), which in itself would be only a LITTLE annoying if the batteries weren&#x27;t so tough to get out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may actually be bad for aging skin, because it only moves one direction and pulls.</li>
            <li> It is not a good quality brush.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this! For the price, this is a great cleanser. This applies to any cleaning agents, with a your skin type best. This is a good substitute if you can&#x27;t afford to put out the money. I have dry skin, and the effect is equally well suited for me. For dry skin, it is the perfect exfoliating, but I don&#x27;t recommend grinding it into your skin or staying on one spot too long. It makes my skin smooth and my makeup goes on easier than before, does not collect and spots spots. Great!</li>
            <li> its a little smaller than i expected, but it does the job. switching out the brush heads is super simple, like a peg. Of couse it isn&#x27;t as superb as the raved about, clarisonic, but for someone on a budget, this will be great. you get a lot for the price and it isn&#x27;t as cheap value as you would think. it isnt too harsh on the face, so i think it would be safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is OK (3 stars)...not bad for $11.  Have had the brush for a week now and I wish it was a bit faster and more dynamic but it is not that bad. I was expecting much faster (within reason).  There are 2 speeds: &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34; and medium rate.  Therefore, the brush is gentle and not abrasive on the skin.  The brush and the attachments are much smaller than I was expecting. Really there are 4 different attachments and the other 3 attachments are like the 4 previously mentioned but with a different name and different size.  Pros:  it is small so good for traveling. It is pink...a pretty color.  Comes with instructions and small description for the attachments that are in English and not Chinese.  It is very gentle....gentle enough to use on a baby should you desire to do so.  It is Affordable.... enough to be a stocking stuffer.....providing the illusion of being a cool and fabulous gift:)  I use the 2 brush attachments to remove makeup with facial cleanser. (I do not think it provides a deep exfoliation which is why I bought the brush in the first place. I wanted a brush to improve complexion, rid skin of impurities and unclog pores.  I find this brush makes no difference. (My hands are just as effective)  The brush glides gently on skin.   The pumice stone attachment is tiny.......I did not think it made a real dent on soles of feet but feet was softer. I have yet to use the mini massage attachment meant to &amp;#34;massage eyes and increase circulation.&amp;#34;  Maybe this is the attachment that will make me fall in love with this brush.  There is a latex sponge attachment that you are suppose to use to spread moisturizer on face...yet to use this but planning on it.  I find using my hands in circular motion is faster and more effective.  If it was faster and the heads/attachments did more, I would be loving this.   (I guess I was hoping for something much faster than my hands but not as fast as a Phillips sonicare tooth-brush)   Honestly, this is not bad for $11 (and itis not that slow...OK speed) but don&#x27;t expect something like the fancier brushes.  I bought this to exfoliate and unclog pores.  Although I do not think it does this, it does remove makeup with closer (so very gentle exfoliation).  You can use this everyday.     would I buy this again?  First, I would look around to see what other brushes there are within similar price range and see what they can do but this is good for someone who wants something gentle...(gave this to my mom).  As long as it is below $11, I would probably buy again....Really, it is not that bad...just don&#x27;t expect too many bells and whistles and don&#x27;t expect it to be very fast (within reason) and it is OK for the price;) Good at removing makeup and washing face...that is what I use it for.</li>
            <li> Cleansing instrument does a good job, very delicate of washing, the first time I feel very comfortable, not willing to put down, it may be a long time to wash a little Kazakhstan, after a slight tingling of the face, consult the seller, saying that this is a normal phenomenon, like wash your face with a towel and a long face like there will be a little uncomfortable, the next was to control the use of time, using the cleansing instrument washing face is good, but can not use a timeout. The washing time should not more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say this is a value for money product. It is so basic... But I am very sad I did not take photos of my skin to compare the difference between before and after using this product. I have used it twice, and my skin has big improved. Everybody should have one. The brush is soft. It cleans the skin perfectly. All the blackheads disappeared. I was using a light foundation every day, but after using this product twice, I&#x27;ve decided I don&#x27;t need foundation anymore. My skin looks so good. I suggest this product should be used probably 2-3 times a week is enough, as it can dry your skin. Anyway, that is what I&#x27;ve noticed about my skin. But definitely recommend it! I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> With a whole slew of attachments, this battery operated beauty set has something for nearly every type of skin issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a rotating system as opposed to the sonic vibration type of beauty tools, such as the Clairsonic. It operates on batteries, but doesn&#x27;t seem to drain them quickly, which is a pleasant surprise. Unlike some of the similar devices, it is not water proof in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;At this low price point, you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for teens and adults, for the face as well as smooth elbows and knees. Even your feet will like some of the attachments during pedicure time. It saves money by using less cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own. I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
            <li> This handheld rotary tool by Pixnor, comes with a set of seven interchangeable circular heads.  The different attachments, help make this product a very versatile health and beauty tool.  Included are two types of brushes, two sponge heads, one fine stone for polishing, a massager head, and pumice stone head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is powered by two AA batteries, and runs at two different run speeds.  The high speed isn&#x27;t that fast, and the motor doesn&#x27;t develop a lot of torque.  Assuming you use the device properly, it isn&#x27;t too likely that you might hurt yourself.  The brushes and sponges are very gentle on the skin, and being handheld, this tool is relatively easy to control.  You do need to be careful with the polishing stone and pumice stone, as they can be quite abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used properly, and with appropriate cleansers, soaps, or lotions, this product can produce some good results.  Made in China, the build quality appears to be very good, and the instructions are fairly well written.  It probably won&#x27;t be followed by many users, but it is recommended that the batteries be removed after each use.  The device is not waterproof, so do not directly expose it to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for evaluation, and really believe that this product provides excellent value for the money, as there are similar rotary brushes that cost twice as much.  The various heads make this a versatile tool, that can be used on various parts of the body.  The polishing wheel in particular, has proved to be more useful than I expected.</li>
            <li> I received item but doesn&#x27;t even work. I placed brand new batteries and item does not funtion. I will be returning.I am highly disappointed</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a smaller-sized hand-held facial cleanser and massager, this one will work for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a shorter handle than any I&#x27;ve tried before.  And even though I have long fingers, it still feels comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works on only two AA batteries (not included).  This means that it has less power than many other battery-operated tools like this.  If you are ONLY looking to use the gentle facial brushes, this lower power won&#x27;t bother you.  After all, you don&#x27;t want to put a lot of pressure on the brush heads as they rotate on your delicate facial skin.  It is a very inexpensive tool and works decently for facial cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you want a tool that will work for your pedicure, too, pass this one by!  It does not have enough power to remove any dry skin with the pumice stone attachment.  Any amount of pressure applied to your dry skin areas results in the head stopping.  It just does not have enough umph to keep the head twirling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Pixnor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, so far the results look promising. I would recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> Its Superb. It&#x27;s better than clarasonic and it does the job, I had read the reviews other buyer left and decided to buy this one. Just received it today and have used it on my facial,  the first time will hurt but your face will get used to it, but every part is super and my skin looks more healthy after using this product,  its cleaning your face and getting a rid of the dead skin so no pain no gain, amazing. The product does what you expect it to do, if it is waterproof better. I would definitely recommend it every one.</li>
            <li> Came within 2 days of ordering! I just received it the other day, packed well, the item looks good and I tried turning it on with batteries, it is working fine.. I have used it only two weeks and used it every day so far so good. Came with all it&#x27;s parts and it is so easy to use! Decent enough does the job well, left my skin feeling lush but not waterproof. I love this product. So quick to use and get into a good skin care routine with it. It is as powerful as I hoped and proper price for the product quality. I&#x27;m so pleased with this order!</li>
            <li> This simple, safe, inexpensive, well thought out massager has become a necessity, used daily and sometimes twice or three times a day in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am 60 and my skin hasn’t looked this good since I turned 50, at which time I had a major heart attack and I think I aged 10 years.  My skin actually looks healthy again with a shine. Each day I use the sponges along with my facial cleanser to clean my face, then the rolling massager on my face and neck, when I apply my moisturizer.  A couple times a week I have been using the brushes to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the pumice accessory and massager on my husband’s feet and the improvement could be limb and or life saving for him.  His feet are starting to look normal.  He is a diabetic on insulin 4 times a day, so foot care is imperative to his health. This massager stops if I exert too much pressure, by letting it gently remove the dead skin cells without pressure, his healthy skin is not damaged or irritated at all.I am so thankful that I was offered this complimentary massager to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this particular massager for everyone but especially for older women with delicate, thinner skin and diabetics for foot care.  I have spent a lot of time researching and facial skin is delicate at every age, being gentle is crucial to your skins health. This massager has all of the power set on low you need or should use on your face. For my husband gently removing the calloused and dead skin from his feet without injuring healthy skin is a must for his health, for others it is only a should. Just think if it works this well on us, how much more can it do for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Pixnor:&lt;br /&gt;1. About 5 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide,&lt;br /&gt;2. The handle is made of silicone, comfortable to hold and the small size makes it easy to control with precision.&lt;br /&gt;3. It uses 2 AA batteries.  It doesn’t come with batteries, so you need to order them separately&lt;br /&gt;4. The heads are about 1 ¼ inches wide, also allowing good control and precision application.&lt;br /&gt;5. If you exert much pressure on the head while exfoliating the massager stops spinning, and doesn’t seem to do any damage to the massager, furthermore by stopping it protects delicate skin from damage and irritation by the accessories. This is an extremely important safety feature for the feet of diabetics where the slightest injury could cause serious health risks. This feature also protects delicate facial skin from tiny injuries and damage.&lt;br /&gt;6. The unit has two speeds a low for the delicate skin of your face and a high for tougher callused skin on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;7. The heads just snap into the unit and easily snap out&lt;br /&gt;8. Take the batteries out if not using for a long period of time. Use a damp cloth to remove dirt, do not wash it with water. Keep it out of children’s reach.&lt;br /&gt;9. It comes with 7 separate disks:&lt;br /&gt;1. Crude polish accessory: to rip tough skin off&lt;br /&gt; 2. Latex soft sponge: To massage eye area and cheeks&lt;br /&gt; 3. Make up sponge: To massage and clean your skin&lt;br /&gt; 4. Rolling massager: To promote better blood circulation and inhibit aging affects on the  skin&lt;br /&gt; 5. Short soft Brush: To clear up all the scurf clings on the surface of your skin&lt;br /&gt; 6. Long ultra-fine brush: To better clear up and exfoliate skin&lt;br /&gt; 7. Pumice applicator: For filing and smoothing rough, calloused skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation:&lt;br /&gt;Whether you have dry, normal, oily or sensitive skin, mild exfoliation once or twice a week and deep exfoliation once or twice a month literally brings new life to your complexion, leaving you with visibly brighter, healthier looking skin. Exfoliation rids the skin of dead skin cells which keeps the pores clean and clear, preventing blackheads, acne, as well as creating the appearance of smaller pores. The removal of dead skin cells speeds up the skin renewal process allowing healthier skin cells to take their place reducing the aging effects of fine lines, wrinkles and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial massage:&lt;br /&gt;Does your skin look puffy and loose; a daily facial massage when you apply moisturizer of 5 minutes once a day or  two to three minutes twice a day is all it takes to increase facial muscle tone, reduce fluid and puffiness, creating a brighter more even complexion, increased cell renewal and softer skin . It strengthens and firms up your skin keeping wrinkles and even your double chin away.  On top of these visible benefits of healthier, younger looking skin, facial massages can help you relax, reduce stress and simply bring about the feeling of indulging yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foot problems commonly develop in people with diabetes and can quickly become serious, a routine home foot care regiment is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A person with diabetes may not be able to feel his or her feet properly. Normal sweat secretion and oil production that lubricates the skin of the foot is impaired.  Sores may develop and the damage to blood vessels and impairment of the immune system from diabetes makes it difficult to heal these wounds. Bacterial infection of the skin can then occur. These infections can develop into gangrene, because of the poor blood flow antibiotics cannot get to the site of the infection easily. Often, the only treatment for this is amputation of the foot or leg. People with diabetes must be fully aware of how to prevent foot problems before they occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Pixnor twice a week after a good foot soak is a perfect regiment for diabetics. Massage the feet with the massager to promote blood flow. Use the pumice on calloused skin. Inspect the feet thoroughly for any injuries or infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am adding photos of the foot of a diabetic, before and after the first treatment using the Pixnor pumice applicator.  Whenever I pressed too hard, the Pixnor stopped, perfect because after the first use much of the dead tissue was gone but the skin on the foot was not even red with irritation or injured.g effects of fine lines, wrinkles and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial massage:&lt;br /&gt;Does your skin look puffy and loose; a daily facial massage when you apply moisturizer of 5 minutes once a day or  two to three minutes twice a day is all it takes to increase facial muscle tone, reduce fluid and puffiness, creating a brighter more even complexion, increased cell renewal and softer skin . It strengthens and firms up your skin keeping wrinkles and even your double chin away.  On top of these visible benefits of healthier, younger looking skin, facial massages can help you relax, reduce stress and simply bring about the feeling of indulging yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foot problems commonly develop in people with diabetes and can quickly become serious, a routine home foot care regiment is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A person with diabetes may not be able to feel his or her feet properly. Normal sweat secretion and oil production that lubricates the skin of the foot is impaired.  Sores may develop and the damage to blood vessels and impairment of the immune system from diabetes makes it difficult to heal these wounds. Bacterial infection of the skin can then occur. These infections can develop into gangrene, because of the poor blood flow antibiotics cannot get to the site of the infection easily.

            <li> My favorite part of this is the pumice stone, which I use on my heels. It works quite nicely, it moves slow but it&#x27;s gentle so that&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s attractive and light weight. I only wish it was rechargeable  and waterproof.</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied! The attachments are perfect for my uneven rough skin with a mix of skin that needs a good clean brush/ buff. Will continue to purchase and pass on good words! Totally worth the $</li>
            <li> Like the variation of brushes it has. Portable and my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Very cute, small enough I carry it in my makeup box.  I love it my face looks clean, I suffer from acne and this has helped reduced my acne because I have my face clean.</li>
            <li> I use this as an exfoliator for my face. It comes with 7 interchangeable scrubbing pads. It leaves my face feeling so soft and clears up any blemishes and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Keeps my face super clean :)</li>
            <li> -----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;QUICK REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Overall awesome facial and body brush. Cleans deeply, yet softly. Very good exfoliator for various areas of your body. I have been using it for a few months with no issues and it&#x27;s still functioning and operating perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is reasonable, the PIXNOR brush is also coated with a silicone which helps keep a good grip on this while in use and the handle is nicely contoured for ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product so far, my only complaint would be that it is not water-proof so you cannot use this in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;* You will get: 7pcs massaging heads with different function to meet your all cleansing needs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Compact lightweight facial brush about L:5.25&amp;#34;xW:1.75&amp;#34; 206g,easily to put this cleanser kit into your handbag,idea for home and travel use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Powered by 2*AA batteries(not included in package) with 2 speeds,to give a gentle and smooth feelings,not a harm pressure on your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Advanced cleansing system keeps a good effectiveness as skin professionals sold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Functions: exfoliating tough skin;massaging eyes and cheeks;remove make up and acne;anti aging with a better blood circumstance;clear the scurf clings, micro dermabrasion collagen cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;* 7 piece set&lt;br /&gt;* Compact/Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;* Multi-function&lt;br /&gt;* Powered by 2xAA batteries&lt;br /&gt;* Effective&lt;br /&gt;* Build Quality&lt;br /&gt;* Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;* Not water-proof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
            <li> So far I like it and have used it a few times a week. It&#x27;s not as fast speed as others, but it does it job.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good value and just about anyone can find some use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s compact. There&#x27;s never really extra space in a bathroom, so small is good.&lt;br /&gt;* The two brush attachments feel great on the skin and can remove dead skin on the outermost surface.&lt;br /&gt;* The volcanic rock applicator exfoliates deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about:&lt;br /&gt;* The brush action seems too slow.&lt;br /&gt;* The massage applicator didn&#x27;t work as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s worthwhile and a fair deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item requested for review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great. Helps me with my oily skin due to my big pores! Leaves my skin super clean &amp; smoothe, the brushes are soft so when your washing your face it&#x27;s not hurting you or damaging your skin. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Received at discount for review what a great product, it comes with all these incredible attachments to do different things for your face. It leaves my skin clean and smoother than its been.</li>
            <li> Nice  clean body i can exfoliate without scrubbing my Skin so hard. This is a great starter or travel  kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SHORT BRUSH so gentle and cleans my skin so well leaves it softer use less product after. The LONG BRUSH  exfoliates and deep cleans better need after being ouside. LATEX SPONGE i used to apply eye cream to massage  it in.. MAKEUP SPONGE to remove makeup Wish there were more than one, works great need another one. ROLLING MASSAGE used on facials get better results from the product i used. Polish remover used on the cuticles great. PUMICE head is best for rough feet they are smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this on discount for review and love it</li>
            <li> The rotation wasn&#x27;t as strong as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> WOrks great for a small price...definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these for my 16 year old (who hates any kind of hygiene regimen) for her acne-prone face, and she raved about it from the first use! I ordered two more for myself and another daughter.  Came quickly and packaged well.  Takes 2 AA batteries, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This works great! Lots of awesome add ons. The brushes are not too hard on your skin and it has two different speeds. The sponge really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me so I dont use it and the massage add on just doesn&#x27;t really feel like anything when using it. I only gave it 4 stars because it is not waterproof. Personally since I use this item around water, I would like water proof available for this type of item.</li>
            <li> Very nice , great price , you can see the difference after the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will ever totally get used to the idea of using a facial cleansing brush.  However, I will definitely say that this is an effective tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may notice that there are a lot of similar products for sale on Amazon.  If you are wondering how to choose a product, my suggestion is to look at the brush heads.  If the collection of brush heads matches your interest, then that is the device to get.  I find that all of the ones that I have tested have about the same high and low speeds, for example, and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something mostly for the face, this particular set has a lot of options.  I tried the cleansing sponge (the denser one) with some Burt&#x27;s Bees orange facial cleanser and I think it did a great job.  I also tried the shorter bristle brush after that and noticed that it cleansed even more junk out of my pores.  Plus I think it helped increase circulation a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the pumice attachment, I actually wouldn&#x27;t use that on the face.  But it is just about right for getting rid of elbow calluses.  (It&#x27;s a non-crumbly kind of pumice.)  And there is a rough disk-like attachment (shown at the top in the first product image) that I would also not use on the face.  But it would be an excellent foot callus buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the brush heads are fairly small and best used on face, feet, elbows, etc.  The handle of this device is comfortable to hold and should not slip if your hand is a little wet.  However, this is not waterproof and should not be used in the shower.  It takes two AA batteries (not included) and does not come with any kind of carry pouch or case (however, if you save the box, there are neat little slots for every attachment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the attachments is pretty easy.  I just removed them from the device and used mild dish soap and water, then let them air dry.  I would recommend cleaning after each use and not sharing attachments between people.  Replacement heads cannot be purchased but this is so inexpensive that if you want new heads, it&#x27;s easy enough to buy a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.ds cannot be purchased but this is so inexpensive that if you want new heads, it&#x27;s easy enough to buy a new brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> Had an issue with the product initially but the company went above and beyond to make it right.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for hopefully it lasts</li>
            <li> Nice little gadget for cleaning my face, works reasonable well, but I have to agree with other reviews, it should be a little more powerful.  Other than that, it works.</li>
            <li> multi use product works for helping with manicure and pedicure as well as face 7 different  attachments all that are useful save lots of money on salon nail fills get done and keep em up your self with the included inter-changeable attachments great exfoliating and deep cleansing brushes for the face and a very nice soft buffer for the face to help buff the dead skin left after you exfolliate. i received this item in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This works great after I used my face was glowing. I really like how it feels when it is moisturizing and the different adapters. Great price highly recommend to give it a try</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My skin feels amazing and its great for teenager skin also. It&#x27;s gentle and its soft head brush doesn&#x27;t irritate.  It has really made a difference to my skin. I do have to use a little more moisturiser. Great exfoliator gentle enough to use every day. I have seen a big improvement in the texture of my skin since using this. My skin is amazing after using this and unlike others I have had no breakout. I think that is just a personal thing though and nothing to do with the product. Brilliant value and quick delivery perfect to give your face a good scrub. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great product, worth every penny. My skin is a lot smoother and clearer. I&#x27;m giving these out for Christmas. Great for my teenager. You don&#x27;t need to spend tons of money on one of these-- this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> After this product arrived, I was quite disappointed. Without thinking twice I returned it and found something more suitable. There was no power to the tool and found it to be a complete bust! Although you get multiple attachments, its no Vitagood &amp;#34;Spin For Perfect Skin&amp;#34; which was only a couple of dollars more..</li>
            <li> I love this product so much! It made my skin routine easier and better. The moment it came in the mail, I immediately had to try it. I was so excited to see how it works. It came with a few different brush heads that is suitable to whatever your skin needs. I mainly use the facial brush heads because I use this everyday to cleanse my face. The cycle and speed is very very gentle, it clarifies the skin and at the same time it cleanse it. I pair this with my clean and clear facial wash. My skin is oily and acne prone, so cleansing is very very vital. Most of the time I would wear make up and remove it using makeup wipes, and then I cleanse my face using my facial cleanser and use this device to deeply cleanse whatever residue left. It&#x27;s amazing! Whenever I use a toner I do not get any residue anymore because every was scrubbed off by this device. I love it. I purchase this using a promo code for review and testing.</li>
            <li> Very high quality product. It meet my expectation :).</li>
            <li> i really like this product a lot for there is a brush for scrubbing you face&lt;br /&gt;which help to remove the dead skin from your face leaving it feel smooth an soft&lt;br /&gt;the body brush is another awesome brush to use to clean your body&lt;br /&gt;there is also a stone /brush for your feet to give for feet that nice pedicure&lt;br /&gt;look and feeling&lt;br /&gt;this product would make a great gift for that women or even daughter in your life&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i received this product as a promotion&lt;br /&gt;in return for my review</li>
            <li> Pixnor&#x27;s hand held massager comes with 7 different massaging heads: a crude polisher, a soft massaging sponge, a make up sponge, a rolling massager, a short and a long brush, and a pumice applicator. As an adult acne sufferer, I was thrilled when offered to try this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion. Cell turnover is critical in maintaining the skin&#x27;s elasticity and beauty, and this massager is the perfect tool. It ensures pores are cleaned thoroughly and deeply. This massager even has a head that you can use to apply cream to hydrate and moisturize your skin. After just a few uses, I feel my skin appears more radiant and is cleaner than ever. I actually look forward to washing my face now. If you are looking for a beauty tool that cleanses, exfoliates, smooths and helps promote cell turnover, the Pixnor 7 in 1 Beauty Massager is for you!</li>
            <li> I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER IN MY LIFE USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN OR GIVE IT TO MY WORST ENEMY!!!!!! THIS IS THE WORST SH*TTIEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!!! If I could give this product -1,000,000,000 stars I would. As I type this review I am holding ice to the swollen parts of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sso excited when I purchased this product two days ago and was thrilled when I got it today, due to Amazon Prime.  So immediately I ran to my bathroom and ripped open the package.  I was thrilled when I found that all the pieces were there with and explaination for each piece and which area of the face it was used for.  So after reading the directions and the function of each piece I put my 2 AA batteries in my new gadget and turned it on. I used the short hair brush head on low with my usual cleanser and was immediately excited.  The brush wasn&#x27;t too hard and was happy with the initial results.  Lastly I used the sponge massager head to massage in my usual moisturizer.  After all that I was thrilled my skin felt soft and no harm no foul.  WRONG!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I go about the rest of my day and about an hour or so passes and I feel a lot of irritation in the area between my eyebrows and looked in the mirror to find a cluster of bumps that looked like allergic breakout.  I have really good skin naturally, and I only get a pimple or two on occasion, so this was very strange.  That area was burning and was very sensitive to the touch.  The pain didn&#x27;t subside until I put some ice on the area for a good twenty minutes.  So I thought that was it and finished up my day.  At 9pm I went to take a shower and looked in the mirror to find that the area right beneath my left eyebrow was severely swollen, hot, sensitive to the touch, and that some of my eyebrow was missing.  Also upon further examination I noticed that my skin looked to be suffering from an allergic reaction.  Right now I want to cry, my face looks horrible.  This product just ruined my face and I don&#x27;t know how longit&#x27;s going to look like this.  I just got this product today and used it one time on the low setting and it completely messed up my face.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT WILL LEAVE YOU EXTREMELY SAD AND DEPRESSED BC IT&amp;#34;LL MAKE YOUR FAACE LOOK DISGUSTING!!!!!! And the sad part os I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin nor did I have any bumps or breakout prior to using this product.  I am so upset and too embarrassed to go anywhere that&#x27;s how terrible my face looks.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOU&#x27;LL BE SORRY!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! I HOPE SOMEBODY SUES THIS COMPANY!!!!!! WORSE PRODUCT EVEER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and before anyone says anything I read the label and I am not allergic to anything that this product is made from.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it. I only use the long bristled exfoliating head. I should get around to trying the others. lol</li>
            <li> Do not use this on your face!! This is way too harsh of an exfoliant and will agitate your skin. Use a chemical exfoliant instead.</li>
            <li> Works well for regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> Tried this product and it works well on cleaning and massaging my skin. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry or tight and it helps to improve my skin texture making pores less obvious. Its gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin and simple to use too. Definitely a must for your beauty cleaning supply! Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> This is a Jock, don&#x27;t waist your money, buy the originals from other brands .. They burn my daughter face , doesn&#x27;t have any intrusions ... Just the name of it...NO NO NO. &amp;#62;&#x3D;{</li>
            <li> Product works really well as a cleaning or a dee cleaning routine. I use it once per week and apply the rest of my cleaning products after, because of my pores. It is not only keeping face clean and more soft but also taking away dirty and oil with it. That is why I apply it after washing my face with warm water, and apply it on a dry face. After using for few minutes and getting used to the sensation on the skin I apply different cremes to complete the process.  Very useful kit  in the skin cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> My skin says thanks everytime I use it! Great deal totally recommended!</li>
            <li> Good quality, prompt delivery. I love this and feel pampered and polished when I use it. Definitely would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had my eye on the Clarisonic but at over $100, I do not want to spend so much money. So when I saw this I immediately purchased one for not much more money. It come with seven massage heads of different functions, it&#x27;s easy to figure out how to put in the batteries and change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has definitely been much clearer after I used this. I use the long brush attachment every day and the exfoliate once a week. I feel like my face is getting a thorough cleanse. I did not buy any more of facial cleanser, but I think it will work just as well with other cleaning agents. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this massager as a perfect starter set and ideal for first time use, as it is suitable for inexperienced hands. The gentle exfoliation possible with its two brushes can be very beneficial to improve the look and tone of facial skin, and the fact that it&#x27;s so easy to use would certainly encourage someone who would not normally bother, male or female.</li>
            <li> I like that you are given options as far as attachments, but I know certain ones I will never use myself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend uses it often and it is working well. Why pay 50 dollars or more when this one is so cheap?  &amp;#60;edit&amp;#62;.. revised rating to 3 stars because the original started to fail after 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> I received my order yesterday. I can not emphasize how much I love it already. I used 2 other brand brushes but this by far is the best. I mainly bought it for exfoliating my face but it also comes with an attachment similar to the Amope for callus and dry skin removal. It has 2 attachments for smoothing moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. It would be better if they provide one more set of attachments</li>
            <li> I love this portable 7-in-1 DIY facial and body brush! The brush includes the 7 different function massaging heads keep my skin clean and clear! It&#x27;s handy and lightweight. I will bring it with me to travel Canada next month! Will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Not the best but not the worst. I&#x27;ve used this a couple times and its not very fast or strong. I do like all the different attachments that come with it because you have a variety of uses for it. I do with it came in some sort of carrying case to hold all the attachments because I do feel some will get lost. You have to be careful not to get the battery slot wet so can&#x27;t use it in shower. I&#x27;ve been using it and it does ok. I turn my hand the same way its spinning to help it with power. I love the brush attachments and use them for cleaning my face with my face wash and it does good. I do get the feeling it will break, so I&#x27;ve been extra gentle with it. Its a good starter.</li>
            <li> awesomeee! I love it, I couldnt be happier :D thanks, it works really good on my skin!</li>
            <li> I love this pixnor.. I always use this everyday to clean my face.. It&#x27;s very soft in my face.. Must try this product and you will love it.</li>
            <li> Very good product meets all the expectations I had therefore recommend</li>
            <li> Awesome product for the price, but I only use three of the items because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this and now that i have this it is so useful. This massager and cleaner has seven attachments and they are all usefull and works so very well for a very afordable price.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product...fast shipping and very good price. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product did reach my expectation and is working wonderfully. The only thing could be improved on it, is the rotation which could be a not more.</li>
            <li> When I received this, the box was not sealed, which is a must for me with any hygiene item. The box opened easily and two of the attachments, which appeared dirty, with a white powdery substance and black and dark gray material almost like dirt falling from them and on them, stupid out immediately. These substances were on everything in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While inspecting the box, I noticed the plastic window was filthy on the inside. There was a white, flaky substance all over the plastic window and the handle of the product, which was easy to see against the bright color. This was not just dust. It looked like dried skin flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even through the window, marks on the appliance handle were obvious. Upon closer inspection, the marks looked like scratches, possibly from fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Right after I posted the review, it was voted down. You can see this on other reviews below three stars.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I was expecting. When I first got it I read my husband all the selling points on the box- and it was quite funny.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;To make better skin circumstances from aging.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Please take out batteries if long time no use.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Do not disassemble the device if not being professional.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor went out this morning after its second use. Very disappointing. I have to manually scrub using the brush heads. Better than nothing but I wish it would actually work and rotate.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for multiple beauty uses.</li>
            <li> Compares well to the branded option, and it arrived quickly (Imported).  Really impressed.</li>
            <li> Love all of the removeable interchangeable heads. Covers all the possible uses needed.</li>
            <li> IT IS A LITTLE SLOW, AND IT ROTATES WITH A WOBBLE.</li>
            <li> I use this brush after I wash my face in the morning and at night. The different brushes that come with it works great. It helps me to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> Not much power however works really well and does the job.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Every time I use it, my skin feels brand new. It takes off all the hard rough patches and easily smooths out the surfaces. A+</li>
            <li> I had a gynae OP and as a side effect, my face was covered with acne, which I never really had a problem like this, I was feeling pretty miserable. I decided to buy this and have been using it for two weeks now. I am so impressed by how soft my skin is and how quickly the acne has cleared up - it&#x27;s almost gone. I also noticed the appearance of fine lines become softer. It is great for they produced two sponge head attachment, but under normal circumstances, just one. So, it is very exciting, and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product discounted for reviewing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;The pixnor beauty massager is a high quality product. With 7 different massagers it&#x27;s a great product with different options. My skin has many red belminishes and it takes them away leaving my face very smooth. I would recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t for sure about using this Pixnor facial and body cleaner.  I thought it might feel too rough or scratch my face. But I bought it and wanted to give it a chance.  I have used it twice so far, and am very happy with the results.  I have used it on my face four times with a cleanser and am impressed with the results.  It took just moments to lather up my face, but the brush felt so good I did not want to stop. After using the softer of the brushes included my face felt squeaky clean but not stripped.  I am going to continue on with this portable brush cleaner on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced cost in return for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed! This makes washing my face fun:) I love all the options, especially the exfoliating brush! My skin always feels soft now</li>
            <li> Decent product. Does what it says but some of the interchangable heads are a little rough. Honestly will probably use more on my toes/feet than my face</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> thank you~!! it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> PIXNOR P2016 Portable 7-in-1 Facial and Body Ultra Brush for Women &amp; Men&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is an interesting product. I’m lucky in that I’ve good skin, never had acne or any large open pores, but my skin is very sensitive so I try to use products that aren’t too heavy or full of chemicals. This brush means its easy to use a little soap ( I make my own, nice and simple oil based) to work up a lather and gently exfoliate any dead skin. You could use a cream face cleanser instead of course, or even an oil or moisturiser, its personal preference what to use. I used the two rougher heads to work at the tough skin on my foot ( yep – only have one that’s not a typo! It gets a lot of work so the skin quickly gets tough esp as I tend to go barefoot much of the time) It’s fine for using on face but a little small for using on body in my view. I haven’t tried it on scars, I’ve a few but not in visible places and they don’t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Its doesn&#x27;t come with batteries but can use conventional or rechargeable. I found it needs to be used very gently, pressure more than the lightest just makes the heads stop rotating, but once I’d worked out how much pressure to use it was simple. I take the head off and wash out after use, the main unit needs to be kept out of water.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a thin plastic pre-moulded container, in a box. I’d have liked it to be sealed inside preferably. I think a wash proof bag would be useful with it too, as its easy to mislay the heads once opened. Nothing fancy, a simple drawstring fabric bag would be adequate and ensure everything kept in place.  Star rating based on ease of use, as I&#x27;ve not been using it long enough to rate on effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt; Stars: Five, an easy to use product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product supplied for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to help make my skin soft and younger looking. I purchased this and have been very pleased with it. I use the attachments as instructed and for about 3 minutes each. Immediately after using it for the first time my skin was the softest its been in over 10 years. Im hooked and will continue using this every other day. It really does a wonderful job. I am beyond impressed.</li>
            <li> Only had 3 days now but.....</li>
            <li> gave this to my wife and she says she loves it, so it has to be great.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush if you are looking for a brush to clean your face. The heads are very easy to change and clean. I like the fact that it comes with a great variety to choose from. The only downside is that I think you cannot take it in the shower. Overall it is a great brush and definitely affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap. How so? Just imagine what cheap would feel like and this is it.</li>
            <li> As a beauty product novice I was really happy with the instructions that accompanied this product. Each brush head had a description of its purpose so that there was no confusion. Had there not been a description, I would have never known what to use any 1 of the 7 head attachments for! Each one serves its own purpose! The spinning action was not to harsh nor was it uncomfortable or painful which was nice. My face was left feeling clean and refreshed after using it! I used it with my favorite cleanser. Batteries are needed to operate. I am excited to use the other attachments! *I purchased this product for review during a promo period and my opinions expressed are my own*</li>
            <li> This product works very well with my skin care products I use before bed. I love the interchangeable brush heads. Very sleek and stylish body brush. It is a great size that makes it portable for when you are traveling as well. I highly recommend this if you are like me and have a nightly skin cleansing ritual!</li>
            <li> Had a problem with my first order but company replaced it and it is great. Very nice with many attachments. Works great on face hands and feet! Works as well as more expensive items. I have a larger one by another company but the smaller one is much better to travel with. I was skeptical at first but ordered it because I could get it at a reduced price. Glad I did now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two weeks now &amp; I love it! After I use it my skin looks and feels so fresh :) Does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> This is a very good speed. Powerful, is the strength of what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it out of its plastic storage containers, I think, oh wow, this is incredibly cheap. It is very light. I tried it. Pumice attachment continues fine, although cut unit, but cut off two kinds. Open it high.&lt;br /&gt;This is equivalent to my big electric vacuum cleaner, a little better, because I like its small size and weight. When you use it does not feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist suggested I use an electric facial cleansing system, but the one she provides is very expensive. I choose this as an alternative. Low price and works well. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks. At first I did not use it every day, because it dried out my face a little, but now I use it every day, love it. My face smoother, clearer, looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I just open the package, took out a handheld device and the main components of the brush. It&#x27;s easy to want to put your head, take it off, switches, etc. I use granular product (my mask / scrub / cleanser product I like), but you might be able to use the sugar and lemon / lime juice too. .. And the result? I&#x27;ve never had a smooth skin in my life. I have combination skin, blemishes, pimples, and like everyone else, wow. I use &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and my face, bristle head 6 minutes later, quite tingling. In the scrub is huge, especially for those who wear a lot of makeup or those with low time to clean the face. Just be sure to wash out (off the device), and let it dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;I use all the heads of their work, Like I would imagine in the $ 100-200 will brush cleanser, you will get to choose more of the head. Yes, the head slows down a bit, if you add the pressure, but in high, you do not should press very hard. It would hurt me, at least for me, I use a sponge to wash, please scrub brush, rinse, apply moisturizer, dry, and then use the messenger head.&lt;br /&gt;Later, my skin feels so smooth, and at the end of the day and less greasy. Yes,I get a little red, but I&#x27;m light skinned, so I&#x27;m used to it. Because I added my cleaning system, in my day job, my skin has been gradually improved. I would definitely recommend this product for those on a budget but looking for a good skin care system.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping,  great seller!!</li>
            <li> This product arrived way faster than the expected delivery date in perfect condition! I am very pleased with this purchase. Brushes are easy to take on and off. Great Product</li>
            <li> For the price I doubt you can do better. I used it on my face and feet! It comes with attachments for callus&#x27;s and rough skin which are perfect for feet. My only criticism is that I wish you could reverse the direction of the spinning head. I like to push things up and out on my face, which this does on the left side but on my right it rotates down and in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are so many options for attachments and that they all have a purpose. My face felt clean and  smooth after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this. I really did, but it feel short in my book. There is a great selection of heads and the whole product as a whole feels sturdy, but the power just isn&#x27;t there. If you press too hard, which isn&#x27;t a ton of pressure, it will stop rotating. This makes it almost impossible to use  the callus attachment on your feet. you could never get the callouses off because it couldn&#x27;t withstand the pressure needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only attachment that I found useful was the latex sponge. It gave me a flawless application and I actually use it on days when I do a full face. I thought that it would absorb a ton of product but it really doesn&#x27;t. It is easily washed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish this had my power to it. There are many attachments that are essentially worthless because of this issue. I would love to see the product remade to handle the load it has to carry.&lt;br /&gt;*Product received during a special promotional period. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Love the attachments! I have used these previously, but only had three attachments. Easy to use, and portable! It&#x27;s gentle and really helps out with exfoliating. So thankful for the instructions, because I wouldn&#x27;t have known what to do with all of the pieces! Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will use it frequently!</li>
            <li> first time used it felt really good and soft. not irritating at all</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning my face and the accessories are nice to have as well.</li>
            <li> Love love this face brush, I always use to take my makeup off with neutrogena face wash and I still do before I cleansed my face but when I use the brush takes all the makeup off the stall was in my face, the first time I use it after I taked my makeup off I was like &amp;#34;Omg all This time I use to think my makeup was removed completely &amp;#34; love it</li>
            <li> This little gadget does a really good job of cleaning my pores and my skin is always so soft right after.</li>
            <li> i love this brush it works with the right amount of speed and force I haven&#x27;t really used the exfoliation attachments I don&#x27;t think those would be fast enough to actually be useful. Its a great price and does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> My wife is saying that it is too weak, thus fairly useless. It&#x27;s OK for the face, but not for the feet.</li>
            <li> this product is more than I expected. At first I thought it would come with just one brush, but I can get multiple uses out of it. Face and body, and I do use it from head to toe. If the brushes get warn, the price is so good that I will order 2 the next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent facial cleaning tool...and I&#x27;ve only used the brush attachment so far. I love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome at this price</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s a great brush for the price. It has tons of different heads to use for various things on your face.</li>
            <li> This is really a very cheaply made device. Stopped working not long after purchase. I think I paid $9. I&#x27;m not surprised,  nor am I complaining, It was a cheap pricee and I got my money&#x27;s worth. So thats why it gets 3 stars</li>
            <li> I love this massager with all its different  heads that are very easy to use and clean. Feels good in hand since its small plus it arrived in good time as well!  Good product!</li>
            <li> I was pleased that this item arrived early. The packaging was kind of beaten up, but everything inside was perfectly fine. Everything works well, and my face has already proven to feel cleaner, softer, and clearer in just the few days that I have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few small annoyances, however. You have to take the batteries out of it each time to &amp;#34;preserve its life&amp;#34; (as the instructions say), which in itself would be only a LITTLE annoying if the batteries weren&#x27;t so tough to get out. Also, the body of the facial cleaner is not waterproof, which seems like a bad idea to me, being as it could easily be dropped in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, however, this provides a great cleaning for the price.</li>
            <li> Having facial at the salon is so pricey, glad that i have this Pixnor Massager, I can do facial at home or wherever I go. I just use this for a week now with my other facial products (cream/serum/cleanser), it helps to absorb/ make the facial products deeply penetrate unto my skin. I noticed that using this PIXNOR 7-in-1 massager with other facial products makes it more effective and i love how it feels unto my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m surprised at how this small machine works so well I have used it several times and it&#x27;s so light weight but really does the job. It comes with seven attachments which is so cool cause it&#x27;s not just For your face it can be used on your body as well or feet and I love that&lt;br /&gt; Because when you buy a product you want to get all the use of it you can and this definitly does that. I used it to exfoliate my face with a facial scrub that I usually use with my hands and when I used it with this my face was so clean a d soft I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Because when you turn it on you can barely hear it so you think man this isn&#x27;t going to do anything aND it sure did take off the dead skin dry patches. When I use my hand I can still feel the dead skin and patches. The only thing is a wish it could be chargeable.  But that doesn&#x27;t matter. With all the use you can get from it.</li>
            <li> For skin care&lt;br /&gt;Propose&lt;br /&gt;There can be many cheaper</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a2ed19879f5dd1297dafd08318dccfd8]]Overall, I really loved this brush. The first one I received did not work properly, as the low setting did not work at all. I received a replacement and really fell in love with the brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I believe my camera made this brush sound louder than it actually is. The sound is just a slight \\&quot;humming whine\\&quot;, but the thunderous hum you hear in my video :)</li>
            <li> i have to give it a five star do to because  i love it like how it makes my skin feel after using it makes it smooth and relaxed it feels like you are at the spa and someone is massaging your face love it thank you for letting me try it out</li>
            <li> Amazing it helped clear and exfoliated my skin so smoothly. My pores are visibly smaller. It&#x27;s small but perfect to traveling. However not water proff. All in all I recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a decent little face scrubber with lots of attachments.  Nothing fancy, but it will do the job a lot cheaper than some of the big name brands.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product is great for the value. I love the many attachments. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! I love the different head options and I love that I can feel it cleaning better than when I use just my fingers! And you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price....definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Works great!! Shipping was fast and my daughter loves the way this cleans her skin</li>
            <li> No worth the money barely moves.</li>
            <li> This is a great unit; however, the only change I would make is to add more power, a stiffer complexion brush and less useless accessories. However, you can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I have always been plagued by extremely sensitive skin, and this brush hasn&#x27;t caused pain, dryness or redness. I haven&#x27;t used the numerous accessories, and have no intentions of using them. My reason, not enough power to make the assortment of attachments useful.  They seem to be a gimmick to sway you to purchase this unit.</li>
            <li> The item arrived just three week ago, came with well packed. I have only used it a few times, did not long enough to see the changes. However, when I use it could feel something happened in my skin, even though it looks like it was burned, I noticed that my jaw to change the shape and color of scars, I think it is a good thing, that shows it&#x27;s working. Looking forward the skin big improve after long time to use. Will definitely buy another one, but much longer needles to treat me deeper scars. Would recommend as an introduction to derma rolling.</li>
            <li> Not powerful at all . Olay has more power . and attachments are cheaply made . Disappointed in product .</li>
            <li> This looks like a toy for my grandkids please reimburse. Me please</li>
            <li> This massager is great, my skin is defently showing signs of improvment!  The directions are very easy to follow as to what head to use for each treatment including picture of head to match with directions. It felt wonderful to use and made my skin feel so soft and clean. Great product and I look forward to each use of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the price!</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected it to be!!</li>
            <li> I love my PIXNOR P2016 Portable 7- in-1 Facial and Body. I love the way my face feels after using it. My face feels so smooth and soft. It also gives a beautiful shine to the skin. I always wanted a nice facial machine, but did not want to spend $200.00 for one. With my PIXNOR, it does a beautiful job on the skin and the price was definitely right. I paid $12.99 for it with free shipping. I highly recommend the PIXNOR to anyone that is looking for a good face and body machine. Out of 10, I give it a 10.  It works wonderfully! I am happy I ordered it. Very satisfied! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this product in the mail! I always wanted to try a product like this but have always been slightly confused about it. Well, confused I am no more! This is one of the best products I have ever gotten for my skin! The brush settings are so fantastic to wash and exfoliate your face. I love how with the sponge setting, I can evenly apply my lotion to my entire face. The pumice stone is perfect for those rough areas of the body...especially the feet! I found everything to be easy to use and the heads were not difficult at all to change out. I am so very pleased with this product. I feel like my skin is now treated like it should be! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t start immediately. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks and then it stopped turning on immediately. The motor would start 10 minutes later. Not good!</li>
            <li> Just terrible, a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this product! My skin has never been this good! Friends and family have noticed how healthy my skin is. I use my regular face soap and moisturizers but this brush gets it into the pores and removes dead skin leaving my face soft clean and healthy. I no longer wear or need face makeup,  concealers or bronzers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty unimpressed by this brush, honestly. It rotates SO SLOWLY and you can&#x27;t even really get close to your face without it jamming up. The motor must not be made very well. For exfoliation, my scrubby stuff just falls right off of the brush because it&#x27;s just rotating SO SLOWLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this is best suited (in my opinion) for applying moisturizer or lotion, since that&#x27;ll grip well to the sponge that comes with the brush. Nothing special though. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> First off, I want to say I&#x27;ve only used this on my feet. I don&#x27;t find it helpful to use items like this on my face as they are usually far too abrasive and I end up looking worse than when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the pumice attachment on my heels and it worked great. I have awful heels and this was a good way to clean them up so I can finally wear sandals without embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to press hard (in fact, you shouldn&#x27;t or you&#x27;ll probably damage the machine) to get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample to use and review.</li>
            <li> This brush worked one time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product. I have slightly sensitive skin and it can irritate it if I&#x27;m not careful. I love the massaging head and the eyelid head. Both feel great  on my skin and are very relaxing. But I wish it had more power, it stops if you press too hard (which isn&#x27;t alot of pressure). Overall an okay product</li>
            <li> I use this every day, every time I wash my face.  It gently exfoliates, and the soft brush as it spins lifts oil and dirt out of my pores, making my skin look flawless.  I also like all the attachments.  I especially love the two different sanding attachments and find they work great on callouses, elbows, and I even sometimes use the fine one on my toenails as a nail file.  This takes two AA batteries.  It is the same almost as the Olay version, only smaller.  I even use this with the Olay scrub and face wash.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without this.  I had another similar one and lost it somehow and was happy to get a review sample again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*Sample sent for review.)</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  Small brush completely disintegrated after second use.  Massage attachment fell apart.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using this exfoliating brush for three days and I noticed a big change in my face. It is more clear and clean. I&#x27;ve never thought such a product could clean my face in such a short time. Five stars baby!!</li>
            <li> I love this little brush. It is little, however fits ergonomically perfect in your hand. The pink part of the brush is rubber so the brush won&#x27;t slip out of your hand while using. After using only once my face felt cleaner and smoother. This is a great value as well, getting all the attachments for such a low price. Quick delivery too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the high end one, but for this price, it definitely does the job. Your face will feel extra super clean after you use it!</li>
            <li> Ahhh!  A personal little handheld spa treatment!  Seven attachments to suit your needs!  Try it in the morning for a little wake up motivator, or try the soft brush before bed for relaxing!  Fun little piece!  Two different speed settings too!  Ahhh!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I got this set for a lady friend of mine who has a hair and nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes this for personal use and occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excluding the handle, this set comes with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Crude Polish Brush (for tough skin)&lt;br /&gt;+ Latex Soft sponge: (for eyes and cheek)&lt;br /&gt;+ Make-Up Sponge: (massage and clean skin)&lt;br /&gt;+ Rolling Massager: (for blood circulation)&lt;br /&gt;+ Short Soft Brush: (surface skin brush)&lt;br /&gt;+ Long ultra-fine brush: (exfoliating skin)&lt;br /&gt;+ Pumice Applicator: (filling and smoothing rough callous skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a nice gift for Mother’s Day.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would like and feels a little flimsy. But for the cost, it&#x27;s about right.</li>
            <li> So far so good. My wife likes it a lot. I have ordered the blue one for myself.</li>
            <li> Great Buy for such a low price! Has all the different brushes along with it. It&#x27;s similar to the Olay brush that&#x27;s out, not the clariaonic though. The clariaonic is much wider but i liked the olay more bc it was a deeper clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with sensitive skin areas, and also MAKE SURE ALL HAIR IS TIED BACK! It will get caugh up in your hair like anyway brush would. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is not very good. I have owned a few different brands of these and this is definitely not the best. It works okay. I feel like the face brushes are a little too soft to get off even dead skin. The button that you slide to get the low, high and off is difficult to move. I feel like if I use too much pressure it may break.  What I do like about this product that I did not get with other brands is the different heads available.  Update: The company emailed me in regards to my review. I appreciate any company that looks to make their customers happy when they are not happy with their purchase. Big companies selling much more expensive products do not really reach out to dissatisfied customers or make them jump through hoops to replace the product. I would gladly purchase another Pixnor Product just because they were willing to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> i havent use this one but i assure that this will work good i have heard lots of my friends using this.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it brings all the attachments, that is a plus. However, this machine has no power at all. I switched batteries and same thing, very slow moving. Is it supposed to be like that?</li>
            <li> I was hoping with all the different attachments this would work since the price was so low but it didn&#x27;t.  There just didn&#x27;t seem to be enough power and it would never give me that deep clean that I was hoping for so I actually gave mine away.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:31c7b25a7c2a25a11d7981f9b20bda13]] Includes the cleansing unit (2 AA batteries are required but not included), an microdermabrasion brush, latex sponge brush, make-up sponge brush, rolling massager, short soft brush, long fine brush, pumice applicator, and the instructions.  A carry case for this would be nice but is unfortunately not included.  The instructions need a bit better translation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face massager is lightweight and made of a combination plastic and silicone casing with a two speed power switch.  The quality of this seems ok but doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as other similar devices.  This massager is not made to be used in the bath as the battery compartment is not sealed and so is not waterproof.  Having used a 4 battery model, this 2 battery does not quite have the power in comparison especially with the microdermabrasion brush, but the cleaning brushes are soft and do the job and foamed the facial cleanser well and did not irritate my skin and is easier to apply a facial cleanser using this than with my hands.  The motor is very quiet though even on high speed.  Each brush head attaches and detaches easily and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the price (currently 11 bucks), this is a decent facial massager although not as high powered or sturdy as some that cost a bit more.  It also is not water proof like some face massagers as well.  This is comfortable to use on the skin though and does a good job as a face cleanser (less so as an exfoliator) and has a lot of attachments included (just missing a case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what to give this product. I just received mine today and it was missing the instruction manual.  I have never used a face massager before and look forward to trying it but not sure what order to even go in with the attachments.  If anyone can help me out I would greatly appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this product. My face and body feels so much better after using it. I like that there are 7 options to use on my face and body depending on where I want to use it. I like that I can use this on my face take off the brush and get the pumice stone and use it on my feet. The wheels come off quickly and easily. They are easy to clean also. I just ran the brush, pumice stone, and other wheels I used then let them air dry on a towel. I like that this is so easy to take on vacation with me, it&#x27;s small and compact that it fits into luggage really well.  This is what you will get in your package: 1PIXNOR Facial and Body Brush, 1 Crude Polish Accessory, 1 Latex Soft Sponge, 1 Make-up Sponge, 1 Rolling Massager, 1 Short Soft Brush, 1 Long Ultra-fine Brush,1 Pumice Applicator, and 1 User Manual. It takes 2 AA batteries that aren&#x27;t included, so after ordering this make sure that you have the batteries so that you&#x27;re ready to use it after you get in the mail. I recommend this product, it&#x27;s so fun to use and I will continue to use it in the future. This would be a great gift for that special lady in your life.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion. All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Item is as described.</li>
            <li> Love this little tool for apply my facial cleansers, two power setting and multiple different heads make this a great bargain!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Amazing price fast prime shipping!</li>
            <li> Returned it.  Not enough power from this battery-operated device.</li>
            <li> I gave this item as a gift and since I have not received info or complaint from the recipient, I gave the product  three stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so loving this...great quality and do the job well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Works well with my home made face mask. Love that it comes with different scrubs. No my hand can take a break from all the face scrubbing and my face is smoother. Would have given it 5 stars if it came with a storage bag but still a must have.</li>
            <li> Great product works great!</li>
            <li> This product works much better than I thought it would. The first week I used it, I broke out more than I normally do, so it is obviously getting deeper into my skin. After the first week, my skin was clearer and feels so much better. I like how this comes with 7 different heads that you can easily switch out and each does something different for your skin. I also like how it feels on your skin. My skin feels so much smoother after I am finished.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Helps to exfoliate and cleanse. :)</li>
            <li> Get the goods after the evening could not wait to use, with a mild massage brush and sponge brush, the overall feeling is washed clean than before, because the tight feeling after washing the face is more intense than their face. Long-term effects are not known, but there is still very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This is an AWESOME product! Really amazing price, I don&#x27;t know how they do it?! Comes with great attachments. When I use this consistently, my skin is definitely much softer. I really recommend this, especially if you&#x27;re looking for a face brush but don&#x27;t want to spend $100s on one. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I just wish it had a little more power behind the high speed setting.</li>
            <li> Good quality for price, if planning to use regularly, go for other expensive ones...</li>
            <li> LOVE this! Tons of different attachments for scrubbing your face at a very low cost, it also came in the mail very fast definitely reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works really well. It is really amazing. I can take care of my skin by myself at home</li>
            <li> Broke after a few uses. Bristles get gross and are very thin unlike the claresonic. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a bad product. I&#x27;ve used the proactiv brush and I LOVE it! It played a huge part in helping me clear up my acne. My proactiv brush broke and I needed a replacement. This on works really well also, but is not as firm, which I loved. But, still a really good product and it comes with so many different brush heads. Definitely a great buy</li>
            <li> Cool product. I like all the different heads it comes with. You would wanna use new batteries to get the speed and power it needs to work. But overall this product is good. I received this free for review.</li>
            <li> The long brush head is soft and gentle on the skin, but the short brush head is a bit irritating on my type of skin, I have dry but oily skin and i have acne on my forehead and on my cheeks. For the first few times I used this brush I noticed the machine started to get really hot to the touch, after that it still got hot but wasn&#x27;t as hot (the first few times I didn&#x27;t even have it on for that long). There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with the sponges or the massager, but the pumice was quite hard to use. I haven&#x27;t tried the crude yet. After washing my face with the short brush head, I felt a slight burning sensation on my skin. The machine itself is not very powerful at all. I am not impressed with this brush, and it is definitely not what I expected from looking at other reviews.</li>
            <li> Just like the competitor brush but lower price</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the expensive name brands. I recommend saving your money and buying the Pixnor.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the cheap price, but it ended up being a great value! You get a ton of extra heads (not sure that I will ever use them all, but it feels like such a value since I get the option! Also didn&#x27;t seem all that powerful when I first turned it on, but works great and did what I needed it to do, so I&#x27;m glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this instrument, but it&#x27;s mediocre.  Updated 7.14.15, I thought it was mediocre and put it up. After a while, I went back to it and switched the attachments here and there and found favorites. Doesn&#x27;t clean as I would hope, but it definitely feels good and is a nice face massage. People who don&#x27;t have oily skin would probably benefit from it more.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again. It has no where near the power or scrubbing feeling that you get with a Clairsonic. You just won&#x27;t feel as clean. That&#x27;s what I get for going cheap!</li>
            <li> For the best, it can not be beat.</li>
            <li> It Works Really Good.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected at all.  Device shuts off when applied gently to the face.  Speed is minimal.  Directions are translated into English horribly.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great purchase...more pieces than I can think of, but what a value! Nicely packed, using two AA batteries, not supplied. Haven&#x27;t used all the pieces yet, but it&#x27;s wonderful to try n figure out what each piece will do.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I truly didn&#x27;t expect it to be this good, but it really cleans your face.</li>
            <li> It is pink/white, and I personally think would be an excellent starter kit for young girls or teens who want to take care of their skin like their female role models, without spending a lot of money or buying a product designed to tackle skin issues that come with age. Of course that totally includes members of the other gender.&lt;br /&gt;It has 7 brushes or attachments.Long fine brush, short soft brush, pumice applicator, rolling massager, make-up sponge, latex soft sponge and a crude polish accessory. The pumice and polish stones are meant to be used on the feet, so don&#x27;t make the mistake of using it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I think the major issue with the product is the fact the motor in the gun (2 x AA batteries) isn&#x27;t strong enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It does have two speed settings, which depends on the brush you decide to use. All the soft brushes are fine on both speeds, but the pumice stone and the crude polish stone need a stronger power source.&lt;br /&gt;The fact it is battery charged means you can just pop the 12cm x 7cm gun and small brushes into a small make-up bag and take it with you on your travels. Batteries do not come with the set, and the manufacturer suggest taking the batteries out after each usage.(assuming the device will be wet after use)&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company for purposes of review.</li>
            <li> Works great!  My sister talked me into giving it to her for her birthday and it went home with her.  I guess I&#x27;ll be ordering another one.</li>
            <li> The brushes stopped working after the first month of use</li>
            <li> Edit: The customer service rep. At the pixnor store was really nice and gave me a refund since I was not enchanted by the brush. It was really nice of her since I still use it &amp; think that it is a decent facial brush, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous Review:&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the clairisonic, then the nutrasonic facial brush. I just graduated college and don&#x27;t have a job, so I needed a more economical replacement. I&#x27;m in my early 20s, so I really just needed something to thoroughly clean off my make up and clear my pores to prevent acne. This brush only rotates one way, and slowly at that. It seems like the rotation does nothing, making it a regular face brush. I can use it, but it&#x27;s nothing special. I do get a deeper clean, but it&#x27;s the same clean I would get with a $1 face brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may actually be bad for aging skin, because it only moves one direction and pulls. If you&#x27;re over 30, I would choose something that oscillates. It does have 7 different attachments, so if you want the pumice stone or a body attachment, maybe this would work for you. As as a face brush, it&#x27;s sub par at best.</li>
            <li> Amazing and great price!</li>
            <li> This works much better than I expected it to. I only use the soft brush to wash my face, I don&#x27;t use any of the other attachments. Makes washing my face Much easier and does a great job</li>
            <li> not the best out there but can be bought for travel and all</li>
            <li> I got  this for my face, after 2 days use I noticed that some of the dry skin around my nose has cleared, it feels good makes skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot of power. The only head that feels like it&#x27;s working is the most abrasive one that isn&#x27;t even intended for the face. But that one does a good job of exfoliating and stimulating collagen production.  I did enjoy reading the instructions. You will see what I mean.</li>
            <li> Really good product, it doesn&#x27;t move as fast as I was hoping but otherwise I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> This Pixnor Portable 7-in-1 System has everything you need to clean deep down in your pores and also massage your skin.  It has seven attachments with it including the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. Exfoliating Head: Use with your facial cleanser to deep clean and gently exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;2. Latex soft sponge: Massages under eyes and cheeks to improve circulation and skin elasticity&lt;br /&gt;3. Make-up sponge: Massages and cleans your skin&lt;br /&gt;4. Rolling massager: Stimulates blood circulation to stimulate collagen production and reduce fine lines (for anti-aging)&lt;br /&gt;5. Short soft brush: Gently brushes away residue from exfoliation&lt;br /&gt;6. Long ultra-fine brush: To better clear up and exfoliate skin&lt;br /&gt;7. Pumice: Gently removes rough callused skin on feet and elbows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start out with the exfoliating head by cleansing my face with my regular cleanser. It removes the deepest dirt and oils. It feels soft on my skin.  I follow with the long &amp; short soft brush to make sure everything is removed. Then, I use the rolling massager to increase blood flow. It feels great on my face and feels like I&#x27;m getting a facial at home. I use the make-up sponges to massage around my eye areas since they are more delicate.  Last, I buff the rough spots with the pumice and apply a facial moisturizer and massage it in. This kit works great with all of the attachments and I feel pampered every time I use it. The attachments can be used all over the body especially rough hands and feet.  Even though I received it free to review, my opinions are not altered. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is great! When I first took it out of the box I was shocked! The attachments were of good quality, the machine itself felt good in my hand. I put batteries in and turned it on. I wet the brush, got some acne soap on it, and put it on my face on the low setting. The reviews saying this thing is slow must want to rub their skin raw in order to get it clean!! This gets the job done and in just four days of use I have noticed less pimples and blackheads on my face, my skin feels tighter and firmer immediately after use, and my pores have decreased in size a little! That&#x27;s pretty significant for four days of use!! The soap I use is Dial Acne Control Oil-free. These products together are a dynamic duo! After trying this product I wouldn&#x27;t get a Clarisonic because I&#x27;ve heard they go faster, and this one has plenty of power. I am 20 years old and I have combination/oily skin. I took off a star because the attachments wobble as they spin, although it isn&#x27;t significant and doesn&#x27;t make the product less effective!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Use it twice a week with microdermabrasion cream and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> this was made very gooed and it works wonderful. I use it everyday and my face is looking so much better nowadays... I havent had any problem with this product and will recomend it to my friends</li>
            <li> I love this brush it helped clear up my skin and gave it a deep clean. The bristles aren&#x27;t hard or rough on your face. I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I used it to exfoliate and cleanse my face. My skin feels so smooth and refreshed. Better than using my hands to clean my face. Great product for its price.</li>
            <li> Slow turning and weak</li>
            <li> Not sure what thes are like in stores, but this one seemed cheap. Not much power. The attachments were flimsy plastic. &amp; any sort of pressure caused the motor to slow. Ended up tossing it.</li>
            <li> stopped working after a week of use</li>
            <li> I love it. I didnt think it would be as small as it was but it works perfectly fi e and brushes are very soft. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> it has all of what it says it has</li>
            <li> Great for the price! I use all attachments once a week, and the sponge and brush everyday. I have far less acne then when I started using this product, and for the price, it&#x27;s amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> The item was defective and as soon as the batteries were inserted inside they burst! the item heated up so significantly posing damage to the face and skin! will never ever buy this product or recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is cheaply made and did not work well at all.  Slight amount of pressure and the head would hardly spin. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> power is weak but good for a soft gentle cleaning. They did give me a refund because it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for, which was very nice</li>
            <li> love my Pixnor and would recommend it to all women</li>
            <li> Broke after the first use.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the $100. ones!</li>
            <li> EDIT: After writing my review, the seller contacted me and took care of me! They informed me that they would work on improving the grammar for the instructions.  I&#x27;ve still been using mine, especially the short brush to wash my face every night.      ORIGINAL POST: [[[This item is definitely a good substitute for the more expensive facial cleansers. I like that I can take this product on the go and that it&#x27;ll easily fit into my purse for travel.  I did throw away the latex sponge, due to contact with people who are severely allergic to latex.  It was extremely helpful that that sponge was labelled as a latex product.  The batteries do die if left in overnight, so that instruction to remove the batteries for best life is also useful. There are some things that the seller could improve: The instructions are poorly written.  The grammar is low-level, making me ponder if this is a foreign product, as it seems the instructions were translated into English with Google.  It would also be helpful to have better and clear instructions on what/where to use the different heads.  For example, after soaking your feet in a warm bath, use the pumice head to get rid of calluses and dead skin. Follow up with the soft brush to brush off the remaining remnants of dead skin. Where the head attaches to the body, mine is beginning to smell like an overrun motor.  I&#x27;ve been giving it a rest to see it that help it.  Additionally, the massaging head does not connect completely, and it falls off a lot.  All in all, it is a good start to an affordable way to have a deep clean for your face washing routine, with added extra heads for bonus! However, I would probably not repurchase.  If you can afford the $30 ones, that would be a better and perhaps safer bet.]]]]</li>
            <li> Just sad you cant dunk it in water, but still does the trick.</li>
            <li> Good deal and has made a huge difference for my skin.</li>
            <li> Works well, recommended!</li>
            <li> Enjoying using this. It really works nicely!</li>
            <li> I like it very much it&#x27;s really great it&#x27;s really does a good job, very good</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work,I got sent a defective product. Really disappointed, very much wanted to try this out</li>
            <li> Wow!!! Okay ladies and gentlemen, I absolutely had to update my review on this product. AMAZING!!!  I purchased some quality batteries for my Pixnor facial brush, and the results are awesom. It cleans and brighten my skin so good. I used the soft and slightly firm attachments with my cleaner. Purchase this facial kit, you will be glad u did. Great Christmas Gifts!   :)</li>
            <li> Super cool facial machine, the only thing I did not like is that the speed is very slow. Otherwise perfect.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is incredibly hard to switch! Near impossible. VERY poor quality. Brushes are too soft. Motor is weak. Retuning item</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;This portable facial and body brush is cute, and came with clear easy to follow directions.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is sturdy and the attachments are all of great quality as well!&lt;br /&gt;This item requires batteries and it is easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my face and saw a difference in one day.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more even and brighter! I know I will enjoy this product!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it is not waterproof only the head of the item.</li>
            <li> Only used the brush so far &amp; worth the money ;)</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to receive this facial and body brush as I&#x27;ve always wanted to try one but never could really afford them. This facial and body brush is everything I expected it to be and more! I love that it&#x27;s smaller than other facial and body brushes so that I can take it with me wherever I go! I like that there are different speed options. I also like how easy it is to go from one head to the other (there are 7 different heads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial and body brush, while operated by 2 AA batteries, it is pretty quiet which is a great feature since you can use it basically whenever and wherever without disturbing anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one of the 7 heads and all 7 of them are very gentle on your skin. There are 2 heads that I thought surely was gonna rub and hurt my skin,since I do have sensitive skin, but those 2 were just as painless as the other 5. I would definitely recommend this facial brush to anyone who is exactly like me and has been dreaming of the day to try a product like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Item works great! I used it to clean my face then attached the facial massage head and with some night cream massaged my face. This item came with multiple heads to pamper from head to toe. Love this item.</li>
            <li> My PIXNOR arrived sooner than expected and I am pleased with it, i love the 7 different heads you can easily snap onto it. A few of them are very gentle I massaged my 10 months old cheeks a little and he liked how it felt on his skin. A++ and 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> My daughter loves 2 massage my face with it</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great alternative to the more expensive ones out there. I had dry patches on my skin, and my skin was feeling rough. After I tried this device, I knew I was instantly hooked. It deeply cleansed my skin, and made it super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Ive always wanted to get one of these, but never had the money for a since. i decided i would try this one and i really love it :) I just pout my face wash in my hand then put on the brush and run it across my face. :) Very pleased with this</li>
            <li> This is a neat little gizmo with lots of different heads that you can use in a variety of ways.  I was looking forward to using this to exfoliate the dry skin on the heels of my feet.  Unfortunately this unit is underpowered with its two AA batteries and I wasn&#x27;t able to exert any pressure to exfoliate the dry skin on my feet without the spinning head coming to a stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a neat little unit but it&#x27;s not powerful enough for my purposes. A sample item was given for review.</li>
            <li> The spinning was very wobbly after a few days and with any pressure applied at all it wouldn&#x27;t spin.</li>
            <li> What a nice way to have such smooth skin. I was able to get this during a recent promotion. I&#x27;m very fortunate to have gotten this at such a good deal. Very easy to use and and makes my skin is smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work good. Weak power</li>
            <li> Love this facial brush. I use it with face cleanser and my face feels tingly and looks healthy and bright.</li>
            <li> Good portable but a little weak vibration</li>
            <li> The product is good so far. But the strength or power isn&#x27;t that strong,  only when the bristles starts to get rougher. It&#x27;s kinda small, but it&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li> Junk, wanted this to clean fingernails and dirty hands.  When you apply pressure, the motor just stops...doesn&#x27;t have enough power.</li>
            <li> This got sent back as soon as I put the batteries in and could feel how weak it was. The reviews made me think it had at least some power, I didn&#x27;t care about all of the attachments, just wanted something to exfoliate my face with.</li>
            <li> Very happy with how well it works.</li>
            <li> An amazing product for the price. I only use the two brush attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Paired with a gentle foaming cleanser, this spinning brush makes my skin so much cleaner and smoother. My complexion has definitely improved. I use this brush three times a week because it really exfoliates the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic product!!</li>
            <li> Kind of cheap and not very effective.</li>
            <li> Even though I have not had the need to try every attachment, the ones I have tried have worked wonders for my complexion. This little tool is so small it feels like a toy, however, it has enough power to do what I wanted. I really like it.</li>
            <li> So far I have loved this!  I&#x27;ve been wanting one for a while and kept seeing them in the store but they were all so expensive. This one was perfectly priced and came with a lot more options than the ones that I found at the store anyway.</li>
            <li> What is the coarse attachment for???</li>
            <li> Just got it,  n so far works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really left my face soft  and smooth, but it seems so cheaply made that i may have to buy it again in six months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess we well see in six months</li>
            <li> Although it did the job I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with my purchase. The packaging was smashed, the heads were everywhere inside the box, they won&#x27;t stay on when in use, and it didnt have the power i was expecting. No fault of the seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now, twice a day every day, and have seen improvement in my skin! My skin feels sooo much cleaner after using it! I&#x27;ve never used a brush like this for my skin and originally bought it because honestly I am quite lazy and will sometimes skip a night because it&#x27;s just been a long day but since I received this I&#x27;ve gotten better at washing my face (only because it&#x27;s much easier and faster now...) And maybe it&#x27;s because my skin might be sensitive or something but I&#x27;m not sure why someone would want this thing to go faster? Based on the reviews I thought I would need the brush to always be at the high setting but the area around my cheeks started hurting after two days of washing my face but since then I&#x27;ve been using it at the low setting and haven&#x27;t had any problems. I haven&#x27;t used all the heads yet because I worry about using them incorrectly so I still have to try them out but I have tried the pumice stone and it isn&#x27;t that great... Also, I suppose I don&#x27;t mind that this isn&#x27;t water proof since I&#x27;ve gotten used to only soaking the brush head itself, and I definitely worry about keeping the heads clean, but I clean them with baby shampoo after each use and keep them in a small plastic container. So overall I&#x27;m super happy with this product so far! It&#x27;s cute and inexpensive and small and perfect! My only worry now is losing a head or damaging one or something because it doesn&#x27;t seem you can replace the heads themselves.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, great price and very effective!</li>
            <li> Great for the price! It does take a little extra time to gently exfoliat with this as opposed to scrubbing but this is much better for your skin in long run. It&#x27;s not to loud and the attachments change easily</li>
            <li> Not super impressed. Like mentioned in other reviews, when you press into your skin it stops. Only thing I use is the face brush for cleansing. I do feel a diffrence after I cleanse my face though. Tried using the foot callus attachment. Can&#x27;t use enough pressure to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! I would recommend this to any one who wants a face cleanser. It really gets deep into your pores and gets the job done right. Item came when it was suppose to in safe packaging too. Only down side I&#x27;ll say is it isn&#x27;t as powerful as I wanted it to be but then again it&#x27;s for your face people. So can&#x27;t be to rough :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that usually with face brushes like this, then all of the extensions are pretty much the same. But, this one definitely has very different extensions. One is actually a pumice stone! There are also some nice soft brushes, too, so not everything is going to extremely exfoliate your face or feet. There are two rough ones, two smooth brushes, two smooth sponges, and one four-balled extension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really a massager, but it does have a kind of massaging extension, which is the one with four balls. This was actually the one that I used the least. So, don&#x27;t get it for massaging, but do get it for cleaning and your other face needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works on two AA batteries, which aren&#x27;t included, and it&#x27;s not waterproof. You could probably use it in the shower, but try not to get it wet, and don&#x27;t drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s great, and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Lots of different extensions&lt;br /&gt;+The extensions work for what they&#x27;re intended&lt;br /&gt;+Good power, and also a low setting if you don&#x27;t want too much power&lt;br /&gt;+Good at exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Can stall on the low speed with too much pressure. But high speed never stalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Pixnor gave me this massager to review*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of different low priced facial &amp;#34;massagers&amp;#34;, and unlike vibrating devices this one really is for cleaning and massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are seven different snap on attachments:&lt;br /&gt;Two different length, soft, brushes&lt;br /&gt;Two foam pads, one a soft sponge, the other a little more rigid - for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Rolling massager - four trapped balls in the head rotate and roll over your skin (actually feels great on my face)&lt;br /&gt;A fine stone and a coarse stone. When you need to grind away at calluses - great for your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powered by 2 AA batteries (not included.)  For the price, it&#x27;s a steal. It&#x27;s not in the least bit waterproof, so you can&#x27;t use it in the tub, and if you&#x27;re using soapy water, etc. with the attachments, you need to be careful not to get water inside the unit.  Sure, there are versions out there that are water resistant/water proof, but you&#x27;ll pay 3x the price.  My only complaint - if you really need to grind away on a tough heel callus or apply a lot of pressure, you may find this underpowered. For normal use it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive facial cleaner, callus remover, etc., and don&#x27;t need a waterproof version, this is worth checking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free unit provided for evaluation.</li>
            <li> ****Updates at bottom****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following review is provided by both my wife AND myself. Trust me, at this point in my life I have no further &amp;#34;beauty issues&amp;#34;....It is also a short but sweet review for ME anyway as this is a very limited use device in my opinion.  And my wife and I both come at this review from a somewhat unorthodox and different perspective. Scar Tissue. OK, this is for beauty &amp; &amp;#34;rejuvenation&amp;#34;. Say what you will but essentially we all will find our own particular use for it. The review below is addressing the common purpose this was designed for but also from the standpoint of use from Cancer survivors....It is too soon to know if any benefit will be gained for THAT purpose but will update as time passes. This was the preface to the review. Now from my wife who has very large scars on her face, forehead up through the upper scalp area. HER &amp;#34;scar tissue&amp;#34; is mostly referring to a physical scar, one you SEE on the skin when looking at it it. This is the predominate area that she address it for her scar tissue. She LOVES use of it all over her remaining facial area from the standpoint it makes her feel so relaxed and pampered. You know, that ICKY Girlie stuff...HER words below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;This massager is great, my face feels so soft and relaxed.  It requires 2 AA batteries and works fine with rechargeable&#x27;s.  The directions are very easy to follow as to what head to use for each treatment including picture of head to match with directions.  It felt wonderful to use and made my skin feel  so soft and clean.  In particular, I&#x27;m working to smooth out scar tissue on my forehead and it seems to be working.  Great product and I look forward to each use of it.  The brushes are amazingly soft and enjoyable to use.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;MY words below:&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;  I have had several HUNDRED staples removed from my throat, my entire spine and in both vertical and horizontal directions. I look very much like many of the jigsaw puzzles reviewed by my fellow reviewer Joseph Dewey reviews (check his review of this very item here as well- he does a GREAT demonstration!) that has gotten my wife hooked on jigsaw puzzles:-) I don&#x27;t need to be beautiful, too late! But I am trying very much to survive the many surgeries I just completed with more on the horizons if I can regain enough strength to survive those surgeries. At this point, I am too weak after 6 spinal fusions and a Mastectomy in just 5 months (yes I AM male but it happens to us too) and the loss of 60 pounds of muscle....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now the scar tissue I want to work on is across my entire back and up my entire back. In MY case, not to try to eliminate the physical scar you see, NOTHING will or could ever erase the deep scars I have. But MY scar tissue is one 2 plastic surgeons have even helped remove for me surgically by opening me up and literally grinding them out. If you run your fingers across my back, anywhere over several FEET of visible scars you will feel jagged, reef like material. THAT is my scar tissue (very long story, no point in telling it here). The problem with my scar tissue its it feels like a serrated knife trying to SAW its way OUT of my back through my skin. THIS is what I want to use this item for. I am attempting to break down this tissue to be absorbed within my body for pain relief. Between using assorted pain rubs bought here at Amazon, along with this, I hope to little by little &amp;#34;possibly&amp;#34; break down some of this massive amount of internal scar tissue. Too soon for me to know if I will achieve any measure of success. Time will tell. So for me, the only item on this (by item I mean the attachment) I use is the &amp;#34;Rolling massager: To make better blood circumstances from skin aging&amp;#34; as it is described with poor Chinese translation in the included manual.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  End of MY part of the review. This item for only around $10.00 delivered at the time of my review is so well worth the investment. If it succeeds or not at reducing MY type of internal scar tissue, or my wife&#x27;s external type scar tissue is really not of huge importance. It is a device that offers ME a degree of hope, it makes my wife feel pampered. An SHE IS BEAUTIFUL so I&#x27;d like to see her stay that way. For all that women have to endure in there day to day lives under the best of circumstances, I love to find a product like this that can give them at least a few minutes of &#x27;ME&amp;#34; time. Time to take a breath, relax, feel pampered. For just a few dollars?

This is STILL working well and still providing relief as stated above. NO complaints:-)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it every day, but like it so far.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush: good intensity of rotation and great brush head and the price is unbelievably low.  2 speeds. Makes skin feel marvelous: face, neck, hands, you name it - anywhere you want deep cleaning of pores or skin polishing.  Can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> It cleans well enough. If you have sensitive skin use the makeup like sponge or the short bristled brush instead of the longer bristled one. Also keep it on the lower setting when you first start using it until you can see how your skin takes the different speeds</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! I have it in my travel bag and I love it to pieces. The best part is the heads fit my other bigger brush which was a nice bonus. I haven&#x27;t tested the battery life, but so far it&#x27;s doing great.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I had a much more expensive facial brush/massager. After two moves, we have no idea where it might be! I missed it, but nevr got around to getting one. However, I was offered to review the PIXNOR model, and jumped at the opportunity. I am very well pleased with this model. After using it for a few days, I am happy to report that it did make a difference in the condition of my skin. It feels like it stimulated the circulation, and it has a fresher, clearer appearance and is most assuredly smoother to the touch. As a result, my foundation goes on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of drawbacks, which I will be honest to mention. The unit cannot be immersed in water, so you have to clean it carefully with a damp cloth. Also, perhaps it could be a bit stronger -- but remember you are getting the PIXNOR at a really good price compared to the pricey versions out there. All in all, these drawbacks are of little or no importance because the results are perfect! I&#x27;d certainly recommend this to a friend and consider it good enough to give as a gift to family.</li>
            <li> After using this gadget a few weeks, I will say that my skin has improved overall. I am filled with oily skin all my life, of course I&#x27;m not a person with acne (just odd red point), but I was very upset my blackheads. I have now used the cleanser three days a week, my skin is quite less greasy. I have not noticed a black head with a significant effect (which is my main reason to buy this), but my skin feel great, my foundation is to last for a long time because my skin less oily. Fingers crossed for another great result, when I have more to tell, I&#x27;ll update this review!</li>
            <li> Love it alot. Feel the difference right after my first try</li>
            <li> For the price it will do.</li>
            <li> Good, compact. For lazy people, this cleansing instrument is really convenient, you can do the clean by yourself at home, very good. I have used a few days before to evaluate, it&#x27;s different with what I imagined, and I thought for the first time would not have any effect, but to my surprised was that this was effective, skin tight feeling after used, the first time feel the itch. Washing face very smooth, very clean, blackheads not so dark. Simple and convenient to use, it is suitable for lazy people like me to use. Highly recommended! ! !</li>
            <li> Offered to me to sample and review, I find this very portable skin buffer delightful. I started using it two weeks ago as a welcome addition to my dry-brushing routine, which is difficult to do on the face. The two brushes that come with the Pixor work very well on delicate skin and I am very happy with its gentle but effective action. It runs on 2 AA batteries (not provided), which are really easy to install. Just as well, because it is recommended to remove them after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of the appliance is light and well shaped, easy to hold and manoeuvre, and the different heads can be removed and exchanged with no fuss at all. They simply pull straight out and push down in place. There are seven heads: two brushes of different depths, two sponge applicators for make-up and creams, two buffing ones, (one is mildly abrasive, the other is made of pumice stone and suitable for small calluses). I would not tackle a hardened callus with it as the power from the batteries is too feeble to do much more than a surface smoothing. The seventh accessory is a massaging head with 4 small balls which delivers a very pleasant, mild, surface massage (great for face and neck). The heads can be washed under tepid running water and left to dry before storing, but the body of the appliance must not be immersed in water, for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my fragile skin, all the accessories are suitable for face and neck, except the pumice stone, which works best on the soles of the feet, kneecaps and elbows. Also please use the pink buffer with caution, it&#x27;s easy to overdo it. If this grooming tool has a weak point, it is a certain lack of muscle. If you press hard, the rotating action slows down, but that could be seen as a safety feature. Because it is so gentle in action, it is perfectly suitable for all parts of the face and neck. The packaging is a little plain but effective to hold the various heads without crushing them. It could be improved by making the box a bit sturdier and adding a top lid, but at this price level, it&#x27;s probably not feasible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this massager as a perfect starter set and ideal for first time use, as it is suitable for inexperienced hands. The gentle exfoliation possible with its two brushes can be very beneficial to improve the look and tone of facial skin, and the fact that it&#x27;s so easy to use would certainly encourage someone who would not normally bother, male or female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this massager and use it daily except for when I use a derma roller. I find that it removes older skin cells very gently, lathers up facial cleansers and helps serums and creams to sink in, which in turn makes them more effective. A lovely beauty accessory which works well and safely, and the price is really quite affordable.it sturdier and adding a top lid, but at this price level, it&#x27;s probably not feasible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this massager as a perfect starter set and ideal for first time use, as it is suitable for inexperienced hands.

            <li> This works pretty good but I wish it had more power. The 7 different heads are great but I so wish it was more powerful and then it would have been amazing. I guess for $10 I got what I paid for. It does help you can&#x27;t put any pressure on it at all or it will stop rotating . I hope they works on the power of the item and then they would have a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> **Product Received in Exchange for testing**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Packaged very well making this an excellent and very very nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Comes with several attachments&lt;br /&gt;3.) Can get wet (But dont submerge in water)&lt;br /&gt;4.) Works very very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works very well at cleaning out your pores and massaging your face..  All the brushes and head attachments that come with the unit work very well.  Its very easy to change the heads and the heads seem to last a very long time!!  The unit itself has a slight rubbery texture to it helping with your grip.. Its very comfortable to use and hold in hand.. While the unit isn&#x27;t waterproof it can be used in showers and other places with water.. Getting the unit wet doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this unit!</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve had my eye on another brand which is way out of my friends range. This one comes with more attachments and as long as you haven&#x27;t run the batteries out, works just as well.</li>
            <li> This is made of like silicone,so it doesn&#x27;t slip while in use.&lt;br /&gt;Very impresses so far with the quality of the pieces,not abrasive and soft to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it uses 2 AA batteries so is easier to find and cheaper too. They recommend to take them off as soon you finish using the machine.&lt;br /&gt;A nice gift to all of those who take care of themselves. Affordable and nice.</li>
            <li> Liked the pumice stone especially well.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price!</li>
            <li> Affordable massager that is very simple to use. I was looking forward for this to more deeply cleanse and exfoliate my skin (especially to remove stubborn blackheads). It IS NOT water proof, so you do have to be careful as to not get the massager wet though.&lt;br /&gt;  Comes with seven different heads that are simple to remove/snap in. Two are quite hard and pumice-like, and I have yet to use them. Will probably use this on dry areas of my body excluding my face, as it may be a bit abrasive for me. Two sponges that can be dipped with beauty cream and water and massaged onto your face. Two brushes that I use to wash my face with cleanser and a little bit of water (again, careful not to get the massager itself wet).&lt;br /&gt;  I can feel the difference as opposed to just cleaning with my hands. Effectively exfoliates all the dead skin and gets rid of makeup on my face.&lt;br /&gt;  Two speed settings. Not sure how often the batteries will need to be replaced on this massager.</li>
            <li> Wow, this really polished my face nicely!  I was visually impressed with how clear my face looked after using the brush last night.  Very cool product!</li>
            <li> my sister likes it she said its very nice product and she said its so effective&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the job it does for such a cheap price, how could you go wrong.</li>
            <li> Only used it once, it had very little power. The second time it stopped spinning.</li>
            <li> Oh My God! This is very cool..and very easy to use.after using this i can really see the difference on my face. It feels great and smooth. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It works well and I like that it has a variety of different brushes to attach on to it. I just wish it was a little more high powered, however for the price, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love all the different heads you can use, I do wish the speed was a tad faster. I got this item on a discount for my review.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a a cheaper alternative of the clarisonic and I am very pleased with it. Nice product, gentil cleansing that doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all. My skin feels a lot cleaner after I use it. Super brush, really soft but cleans the skin beautifully. Very easy to use with my own cleanser. I have very dry skin and was delighted with this product it takes my cream cleanser and it gives my face a good scrub with no harshness. Also, since the product is not waterproof, I feel I have to be extra careful when i use it in the shower. Other than that, I like it. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I was able to use each attachment before I was able to give a proper review. My face really does feel more alive, and awake. My skin is smooth, and looks more even colored. I wonder if this is how our faces felt when we were kids before we got older and started putting gunk on our face and clogging our pores. This is definitely something that anyone should get to pamper themselves.</li>
            <li> It is a product as the price.&lt;br /&gt;That hope that is perfect in this price greed be.&lt;br /&gt;If become waterproof, la tries ideas though will be very good.&lt;br /&gt;Fundamental performance is satisfied perfectly ^^</li>
            <li> Great item, just like description, what i want.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works okay, came with everything pictured. The only issue in the brush I&#x27;ve been using has a weird odor I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of regardless of washing multiple times.</li>
            <li> I really loved this item! It&#x27;s size is perfect and a good quality.</li>
            <li> Great device! Works great! Had fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Very good and worth the price :)</li>
            <li> ok for the price, did not rock my world!</li>
            <li> Very Good! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the variety of heads. Left my face feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush shortly after my sister bought the Dermabrush, thinking I was getting the better deal and a more highly ranked brush, therefore it had to be better, right? Boy, was I wrong! This brush has 2 settings, low and high, both the exact same speed so it&#x27;s pointless other than making it look more high tech. The first thing I noticed was how slooooow the high setting was, it was hardly spinning! And the kicker is that this brush isn&#x27;t strong enough to rotate on your skin unless you barely touch it. I found myself putting more effort in than the brush, you&#x27;d be better off not turning it on, saving your batteries, and physically scrubbing your face yourself. Maybe mine was a fluke, I don&#x27;t think so though. And the box was a joke, obviously directly copied from Google Translate or something because it made no sense (ex: Short soft brush: To clear up all scurf clings on the surface of your skin. Rolling massager: To make better blood circumstances from skin aging.) TL;DR Don&#x27;t waste your time and money and go with something better like the Dermabrush that will actually scrub your face.</li>
            <li> Item was as described a little smaller than I anticipated but it does the job!! Deff a must buy.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a facial scrubber before, I have found this one to be very nice. I love the different heads and the multi speed is nice for different areas and control.  I like having two AA batteries so I don&#x27;t have to remember to charge the unit. It&#x27;s small and will travel nicely.</li>
            <li> Awesome, works like some of the more professional expensive ones. It includes 7 detachable heads that can be used interchangeably between the face and body.</li>
            <li> U get what u pay for :(</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this and it has become a permanent addition to her &amp;#34;nightly routine&amp;#34;.  Works just as well as the more expensive versions and a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review:&lt;br /&gt;So far I like it great for the price I found the little scrubber attachment to work better then the bigger one for my face it&#x27;s a lot more dense. The massage attachment is worthless to me doesn&#x27;t really work. Doesn&#x27;t come with batteries.</li>
            <li> Love it and seems to be exfoliating my skin...</li>
            <li> Works great as promised.  Enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Works well. I like the results of facial.</li>
            <li> This product is a great affordable alternative to the more expensive models out there. The power isn&#x27;t overly strong, but it definitely still works even when applying pressure.</li>
            <li> Love it so far and I already see a difference on my skin face. One reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five stars it&#x27;s because you have to take the battery out after each use and it&#x27;s not water proof</li>
            <li> A wonderful surprise! I enjoy using this so much.</li>
            <li> PIXNOR P2016 Facial Brush 7 in 1 Facial Massager Face Brush with 7 brush heads Rosy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial massager comes with 7 different massager heads and runs off of 2 AA batteries. The handle portion of the massager is not waterproof so I would recommend removing the brushes and exfoliating heads before cleaning with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be very underpowered. Though there are two speeds, I would classify them as slow and slower. Any pressure of the brush heads onto the skin causes the motor to slow down even more, almost bringing the brush head to a stop in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Accessory Brush Heads&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the pumice head was much too rough to be used on the tender skin of the face. This would be a good one for use in exfoliating the skin on the legs, elbows and feet except that the motor speed is too slow to do a good job with the pumice head on these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crude polish accessory less rough than the pumice head, and better used for elbows and feet. The slow speed of the motor makes using this head rather ineffective when applying any pressure as the speed slows down too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the latex soft sponge for applying face cream and foundation. It did a smooth, even job and with a bit of soap and water the head washed up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make-up sponge did a good job of working make-up remover into the skin and taking the make-up off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rolling massager just seemed gimmicky to me. My skin didn’t feel any different after using it. It just sounded like plastic rubbing on plastic while it was in motion and not like a very high quality device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short brush head seems to work well for removing loose dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The softer longer brush head also helped to remove loose dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not think that all these brush heads were necessary to be included in this kit. They were all quite novel but I think over time the use of some of them would fall by the wayside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are replacement heads that can be purchased when the heads that come with the kit wear out. The brush heads appear to be fairly durable. I could find no information regarding antibacterial qualities of the brush heads or of how often the heads should be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: I would not recommend purchasing this item as it is severely underpowered and the handle is not waterproof, leading to a risk of getting water into the battery when the device is in use. Some of the brush heads are useful, others are gimmicky and others will be hard to use because of the underpowered motor. For the one or two brush heads that are useful, this device is not worth spending the money.by the wayside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are replacement heads that can be purchased when the heads that come with the kit wear out.

            <li> I really love this brush.  I have very sensitive skin, so facials are a big no-no for me.  Even &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; ones leave my skin red and irritated for days.  So, I am always looking for products that I can use at home, that I can use to unclog and clogged pores, and to keep my skin looking bright and refreshed, as if I&#x27;ve had a facial.  This brush is perfect for me.  I&#x27;ve had spinning facial brushes in the past that I liked, but none had even close to seven different attachments.  With this brush, I am able to be as gentle or aggressive as I need to be cleansing my face.  I also love the massaging attachments.  I only use them very lightly on my skin, as I don&#x27;t want to tug at it and make excessive wrinkles, but I do want to improve circulation to my face.  I have not yet used the more abrasive body attachments, as I just have an issue using my facial tool on my body, too.  But, this brush does come with attachments that would do a great job exfoliating dead skin all over.  This seller offered me a discount on this product to test it and provide honest feedback abut the product.  So, I have tried to find a constructive criticism to offer, but the only thing I found any fault with was not with the brush, it is with the instructions.  The instructions are great for letting you know how the facial scrubber works, but there are numerous typos throughout the English version of the instructions (they are in multiple languages).  While I was almost always able to figure out what the seller was trying to say, I think the lack of attention to detail in the instruction booklet detracts from the quality of the product itself (I say, as I write a review that almost certainly has a typo somewhere).  Typos would not stop me from highly recommending this to anyone who wants the feel of a facial every day, without the redness and irritation that comes along with someone else poking and prodding at your face.</li>
            <li> love this!!!  So far so good.  This is a neat little facial brush.  Comes with some nice attachments and it works really well.  I like the longer face brush for my face as it feels more gentle and cleans well.  It is smaller in overall size than other facial brushes making it great for travel IMO.  I think this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> So far this is an a+ product. It&#x27;s well priced and makes my skin feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> this item may not be water proof, but it has been holding up great in the shower!  very happy with this!</li>
            <li> I was able to get this product for an awesome price to try it out &amp; review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, love the different heads it comes with, I use this daily. Light weight &amp; easy to hold, small size but packed with power. Has different speeds depending on what I&#x27;m using it for, my face has also cleared up a lot since I started using this. I think I&#x27;ll get another on for my sister&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! Product feels very cheap and did not function properly.  I tried to get refund, but was unable and did not bother to follow up.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the price - I figure if it doesn&#x27;t do a good job, I&#x27;m not out that much money.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It works very nicely, and I&#x27;ve used more expensive brushes/massagers, and this holds up in comparison.  I like the fact that it uses batteries, makes it easier to keep going.  I found that I can get a month or two of use out of 2 batteries depending on how often you use it (every day, it lasts about a month).  I love that there are different brushes, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it not being good for your skin type, one of the brushes will work for you.  This is great for exfoliating, cleansing and massaging - a total spa in a box!  It&#x27;s easy to use, the instructions tell you exactly what to do and have pictures to follow as well, it&#x27;s small and comfortable in your hand and it is not awkward to use and you can easily and quickly go over your entire face.  Be careful around the eyes though!  That skin is especially sensitive and fragile and you can end up with cleanser in your eyes.    You can get a little carried away with this, so I recommend using a soft cleansing brush daily, and a more exfoliating brush (depends on your skin type what you use) no more than twice a week.  Use a cleanser that works best for your skin type, and I recommend using one that is gentle as well.  You don&#x27;t need a scrub type cleanser with this brush.  I use [[ASIN:B00TP15TV0 CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, 12 Ounce - 2 Pack]], it&#x27;s gentle and cleans very well.  Another important point - use a great moisturizer with this.  This brush will really clean your face, which means it takes off all the natural oils as well and can leave your skin dry.  I use [[ASIN:B00IIPI6CS Bel Essence Intensive Anti Aging Treatment - All-Natural Cream for Erasing Wrinkles. Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]], this gives me the best results.  The brush, cleanser and moisturizer together have given me the best skin ever in my life - it clears away dead skin, dirt and grime and leaves you with a \\&quot;clean slate.\\&quot;  I bought the Bel essence originally as a great moisturizer (I am skeptical of the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; claims in creams), but I have to warn you, it has side effects:  IT GETS RID OF LINES AND WRINKLES.  I was amazed, the lines around my eyes are GONE.  The brush exfoliates very well, the cleanser gets rid of dirt and oil, and the Bel Essence gives my skin new life - smooth, line free (still faint lines in my forehead and between my eyebrows, but barely noticeable) and the dark spots on my face are faded to the point where I can go without foundation if I want and still have an even skin tone.  I cannot believe how good my skin looks now, and I know I&#x27;m not exaggerating because I had at least 5 people at work comment about how good I looked - younger and my skin is brighter, after about a week of using all three.  Highly recommend all three products.  All together, a one two three punch for great looking skin.</li>
            <li> As a clarisonic owner, this device is comparable. For only $12.99 vs the upward price of a Clarisonic being $130 its well worth. I love the duo speed and how you can not only wash your face with it but also massage.</li>
            <li> I just received mine today in the mail and have already used it! I am in love with it!! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not very durable. It is not a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> I only use to play with my child. You can use to clenched your face but not to your feet.</li>
            <li> Well for $12.99 you sure do get a heck of a lot for the money!  Wow!  Talk about packing a lot into a small package.  This is a great tool to use for deep cleaning your face and body but especially your face.  This massage comes with 7 great tools each with a different use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Exfoliating Head:Use with your facial cleanser to deep clean and gently exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;2.Latex soft sponge:Massages under eyes and cheeks to improve circulation and skin elasticity&lt;br /&gt;3.Make-up sponge:Massages and cleans your skin&lt;br /&gt;4.Rolling massager:Stimulates blood circulation to stimulate collagen production and reduce fine lines (for anti-aging)&lt;br /&gt;5.Short soft brush:Gently brushes away residue from exfoliation&lt;br /&gt;6.Long ultra-fine brush:To better clear up and exfoliate skin&lt;br /&gt;7.Pumice:Gently removes rough callused skin on feet and elbows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two different speed settings and runs on 2 standard AA batteries.  My wife did the testing of this item as its really more suited to women as it is great for cleaning makeup off the skin.  It saves a lot of time from trying to clean up your face by hand using normal brushes and scrubbers.  Definitely an item for those that like their makeup.  And it also has the benefits of exfoliating the skin and leaving the skin smooth, soft and looking very healthy.  You can use it on other parts of your body but the brushes are small so using it on the face is really the ideal application and for that it is a must have item for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item was provided for a fair review</li>
            <li> Not a Water proof! This should be mentioned clearly on the description of the product, and really? Not a Water proof? This is an facial cleaner, there will be a lot of contact with water somehow, and this product is not a Water proof. I feel disappointed. This is supposed to be a great product with a great feature, and the brush and the movement is pretty good. But not being a water proof is really a step down. Please fix it. In the meanwhile, I&#x27;m going to find a replacement for my broken one cause it was wet.</li>
            <li> I try it as soon as I received it and the brush for the face is smooth and it comes with 6 more massager definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> My skin was glowing after 3 uses! At first I wasnt sure if it was working but I soon realized it was because of years of not exfoliating. But now my moisturizer absorbs faster and my makeup is more even. My pores even look way smaller! For the price I&#x27;m super impressed.</li>
            <li> i am very surprised because i worried of the cheap price but the product works very good and my skin feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Do not have this time is too long, but so far is not bad. Fast delivery. After viewing a lot about similar products, bought this because I wanted something more to help me wash my face. Only three days, and now use it every day, can already see a difference. Skin feels clearer, more color, looks brighter. Instructions are short, so it is easy to figure out how to use it. Agree with other comments before steaming the face is necessary, it may be easier to put the best face on the skin brush, if you wash your face for the first time to become very dry, and then use it. Really recommend this.</li>
            <li> The Facial Massager Cleaner easy to carry, it is very handy to use and affordable. Received the goods on the night with the first use, break out of the bubble is very delicate, is much clean than usual hand wash, there will be bald first wash out ~~~  the next morning I found skin is very slippery. Liked. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This cleansing instrument looks beautiful, fine workmanship, good quality. Girlfriend like it, said skin feeling more clean after use. Easy to use, comfortable soft brush, face massage skills, able to deep clean feeling supple and moisturized after washing the face, apply the mask can be better absorbed. Very satisfied with the time shopping, it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleansing instrument, easy to use, and very comfortable, after washing the face pores that are smaller some and feeling face also clean a lot, like it very much. Hope to go on long-term use can have better results. Logistics is quickly, things quickly received, Yesterday given and today arrived.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift to my girlfriends. Sellers good service, arrived on time, packaging is very beautiful, indeed as I had asked to wrap, and very grateful. Girlfriends said immediately try it after in her hands, on the next day have had see the results. She said she felt skin clean than before wash with hands, the next day to find that the skin became more tense, a bit too smooth. A week later the color of face obviously much better, smaller pores, the skin became a lot better. She liked it very much, and recommended me to buy one.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. I love all the brush heads that it came with! As long as you put fresh batteries in the brush works great.</li>
            <li> Great product the seller was extremely concerned with my happiness and the communication was open. People are going to say all types of negative remarks but the truth is most are not using the brush correctly. Make sure you apply soap and lather brush and wet face. Its works perfectly fine for me. Clears up skin I use with Salicylic Acid Scrub. :)</li>
            <li> The included brush is soft, but get the job done. So far, so good. Pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Use it twice a day after one week, I found a huge difference in the size of my pores and my overall texture of the skin. I also noticed that I was not oily.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for two weeks, I found my lines around the eyes and neck improved. I also have friends that I have a certain &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; a few compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for three months, had just bought my first replacement head, now found my blackheads are almost non-existent. And most importantly, I have micro pores compared to what they are. I did not, because I have good skin texture (smooth !!), and not so much wear as much makeup flaws.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter likes this product. She uses a more expensive brand, she said, this is as good as (currently she is in her teens picky interference - LOL).&lt;br /&gt;When studying these facial cleansing, I noticed that there are some other views, you cannot press too hard, or brush will stop rotating. With this beauty. I try to stop by my hand brush, but darn thing persevered.</li>
            <li> Cleansing instrument looks beautiful, fine workmanship, easy to use, most of blackheads had gone after used it, the skin became smooth and clean. Very easy to use, run out of the face is very refreshing. Face wash is also very clean, very thoroughly clean the dirt. Coupled with the use of cosmetics, my skin much better than before it. Very satisfied with the time shopping, it is worth buying, praise one.</li>
            <li> I feel good, good packaging, arrived timely and good seller services. With a couple of days, I feel very nice, cleansing is very clean, very comfortable, no uncomfortable feeling, and a lot of brush, a good variety of features - good price, worth sharing to friends.</li>
