    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>POH is the best dental floss ever.  </li>
            <li>PoH floss is the best!!</li>
            <li>This product works great!  </li>
            <li>That is the good.  </li>
            <li>Probably the best floss available.  </li>
            <li>I really like unwaxed floss because it removes the plaque and tarter better than the waxed, and this does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>I love this floss, more effective than any I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find this floss.</li>
            <li>so it gets where it needs to go and grabs food better than anything.</li>
            <li>I can use it on part of mu  mouth but still have to resort to a stronger waxed type for the tighter fitting teeth.</li>
            <li>Will be able to use up the container but will not buy again.</li>
            <li>This one stands up much better than the rest.</li>
            <li>I would recomment the 630 for most users though.</li>
            <li>I believe that good dental care has extended the lives of members of this generation, and I want to keep the rest of my teeth for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Flossing is the first step in achieving this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very particular about taking good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this floss gets such great reviews.</li>
            <li>At age 77 I have all but one original tooth, and that one was a primary that lasted 65 years.</li>
            <li>Cool floss.  </li>
            <li>teeth are very close together, so this gets the job done with greater ease.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>sure if I&#x27;ll order more or just go back to my Duane Reade house brand after this - it&#x27;s a bit thicker but it doesn&#x27;t shred as much, plus I feel it has a bit more of a rough edged grip to scrape off the plaque - whereas the POH is slightly more smooth without quite the edge.</li>
            <li>Eventhough I had to buy alot, still worth it.</li>
            <li>I will probably use another kind of floss in the future.</li>
            <li>Not only that, the slim, non-waxed strands easily slip between crowded teeth all the better to haul out residual soft plaque.  </li>
            <li>Good product..  Little or no space between my teeth does pose a problem for all floss products.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I can see the food, and plaque, but nothing much more than the white.  </li>
            <li>It will work just as well, and it is a whole lot cheaper!</li>
            <li>Thin floss is good because it lets you clean your teeth close to the gum.</li>
            <li>After my previous favorite no-wax fine floss - Butler Gum - no longer became available in long lengths, I tried this floss in the 100yd length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well it shreds very easily if you have any teeth with slightly tight connections.</li>
            <li>Going to give the Classic NonWaxed a shot.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was even possible for floss to be thinner than everything else I&#x27;ve tried, but this stuff really does slip right between my tightest teeth.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s simple but powerful.</li>
            <li>This seems to be substantially tougher, yet is sheer enough to easily get between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love their regular floss, this black one just doesn&#x27;t make sense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With tightly spaced teeth such as I have, most floss shreds and/or breaks when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Its thinner and able to reach my hard my spot that always make my gum swollen.</li>
            <li>This work so much betteer than the regular one in store.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this brand, as only a few reviewers said it shredded easily.</li>
            <li>I prefer their Classic 490 denier unwaxed, or possibly their thickest 630 denier unwaxed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker without being too think and it works nicely on in the tight spaces.</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS HAD TO USE WAXED FLOSS IN THE PAST, BUT USED THE PLAIN POH FLOSS RECENTLY AND LIKED IT</li>
            <li>Although the floss is very thin, it&#x27;s break very easily.</li>
            <li>It has the double problem of breaking very easily and being extremely difficult to remove from in between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Black floss shows the plaque you remove much easier than white floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just thinking of the world of trouble that lurks in crevices after a meal makes me want to floss; this unique black floss will convince you as well.</li>

            <li> - usually I&#x27;d get through my whole mouth only changing out the floss once, but I have to go for 3 or 4 strands with POH to stay ahead of the shredding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thin but strong, no wax buildup, toxic fluoride free, but too thin for me, if your flossing is tight or difficult, this is super sleek.</li>
            <li> I urge them to buy this product in order to view exactly that which is left behind between the teeth after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Also, in a pinch, it can double as a dark colored thread.</li>
            <li> AND ABSOLUTELY DO NOT LIKE IT.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this particular version - micro thin.</li>
            <li> black?</li>
            <li> I think all dental floss should be black after using this one.</li>
            <li> black?  </li>
            <li> I have no idea why this floss is black.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s black.</li>
            <li> I recomend the black one</li>
            <li> Black dental floss</li>
            <li> You can see plaque on black color</li>
            <li> This black floss has the feeling of thread.  </li>
            <li> Also, the black tends to come off onto your hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is finer than Butler and shreads/spreads out less.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this BLACK floss to repaid clothes, etc.  </li>
            <li> The string is not strong like other dental flosses.  </li>
            <li> I have tight teeth, but that&#x27;s not the issue.  </li>
            <li> I WILL STICK WITH THE PLAIN FROM NOW ON.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> My dentist used to give it to me, but hasn&#x27;t for the past few years</li>
            <li> their regular white one, hate this black wax.  </li>
            <li> POH floss is small in diameter</li>
            <li> Worse than any other floss.  </li>
            <li> The bad is that it does shred -- I have to move to a new area on the length of floss every few teeth because it does start to shred, and the little filaments that loosens from the main strand will start to stay between my tighter teeth - which then becomes annoying to try to get out.  </li>
            <li> No Wax Percept 420 Black Floss because it is micro thin and now that is all I use.</li>
            <li> It does the trick, but it&#x27;s a little too thin for my liking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thin - like really thin fishing line</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with meat getting stuck in my teeth to the point that it is painfull and will not come out with normal dental floss.  </li>
            <li> BAD if your teeth are tight and close together.  </li>
            <li> This one shreds like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Isearched every local drugstore and I couldnt find it. Finally foound it here. Eventhough I had to buy alot, still worth it. This work so much betteer than the regular one in store.  Its thinner and able to reach my hard my spot that always make my gum swollen. This is faster. The orther one I used is thicker annd pushing the particles inner my gym causing swollen n bleeding. Love this.</li>
            <li> Cool floss.  I sew with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find this floss. My dentist used to give it to me, but hasn&#x27;t for the past few years and I have been out for quite some time. I really like unwaxed floss because it removes the plaque and tarter better than the waxed, and this does a wonderful job. It arrived quickly. Yay.</li>
            <li> This brand and type of floss used to be given to me by my dentist, and my hygienist says it&#x27;s the only one to get.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are very close together, so this gets the job done with greater ease.&lt;br /&gt;Why black? I think all dental floss should be black after using this one. You can actually see plaque on the floss in addition to whatever you want to get out of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very particular about taking good care of my teeth. At age 77 I have all but one original tooth, and that one was a primary that lasted 65 years. I believe that good dental care has extended the lives of members of this generation, and I want to keep the rest of my teeth for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;Flossing is the first step in achieving this.</li>
            <li> I love their regular floss, this black one just doesn&#x27;t make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why black?  Yes, I can see the food, and plaque, but nothing much more than the white.  This one shreds like crazy.  I have tight teeth, but that&#x27;s not the issue.  It catches on any dental work.  I have some porcelain fillings on the side of 2 teeth, and it shreds instantly on it.  Worse than any other floss.  Meanwhile, the white has no issue, never shreds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE their regular white one, hate this black wax.  Will not buy again, will not recommend.</li>
            <li> How can I convince my patients to floss?  I urge them to buy this product in order to view exactly that which is left behind between the teeth after brushing.  Not only that, the slim, non-waxed strands easily slip between crowded teeth all the better to haul out residual soft plaque.  Just thinking of the world of trouble that lurks in crevices after a meal makes me want to floss; this unique black floss will convince you as well.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this floss is black.  It&#x27;s extremely thin - like really thin fishing line that&#x27;s black. It does the trick, but it&#x27;s a little too thin for my liking.  If you have access to an HEB grocery store, try the unwaxed floss called Essential floss. It&#x27;s a little thicker without being too think and it works nicely on in the tight spaces.</li>
            <li> POH is the best dental floss ever.  I recomend the black one but they both get the job done.  I have a terrible time with meat getting stuck in my teeth to the point that it is painfull and will not come out with normal dental floss.  POH floss is small in diameter so it gets where it needs to go and grabs food better than anything.</li>
            <li> Thin floss is good because it lets you clean your teeth close to the gum. But this stuff is not waxed, so I kept pulling shaved strands out of my mouth. I will probably use another kind of floss in the future.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brand, as only a few reviewers said it shredded easily. Well it shreds very easily if you have any teeth with slightly tight connections. Though it does work well with teeth that are not too close together. I can use it on part of mu  mouth but still have to resort to a stronger waxed type for the tighter fitting teeth. Will be able to use up the container but will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Although the floss is very thin, it&#x27;s break very easily.</li>
            <li> the floss shredded when I used it.  I find it unusable</li>
            <li> With tightly spaced teeth such as I have, most floss shreds and/or breaks when I use it.  This seems to be substantially tougher, yet is sheer enough to easily get between the teeth.  Also, in a pinch, it can double as a dark colored thread.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this floss gets such great reviews. It didn&#x27;t make stuff come off between teeth but rather shredded and became additional pieces that got stuck. Awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the THINNEST floss I&#x27;ve ever used. I didn&#x27;t think it was even possible for floss to be thinner than everything else I&#x27;ve tried, but this stuff really does slip right between my tightest teeth.  That is the good.  The bad is that it does shred -- I have to move to a new area on the length of floss every few teeth because it does start to shred, and the little filaments that loosens from the main strand will start to stay between my tighter teeth - which then becomes annoying to try to get out.  So I&#x27;ve had to change my flossing technique - usually I&#x27;d get through my whole mouth only changing out the floss once, but I have to go for 3 or 4 strands with POH to stay ahead of the shredding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;ll order more or just go back to my Duane Reade house brand after this - it&#x27;s a bit thicker but it doesn&#x27;t shred as much, plus I feel it has a bit more of a rough edged grip to scrape off the plaque - whereas the POH is slightly more smooth without quite the edge.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and buy a spool of thread.  It will work just as well, and it is a whole lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> Black dental floss, it&#x27;s simple but powerful. Black floss shows the plaque you remove much easier than white floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and see how much plaque you&#x27;ve been missing with white floss. Do your teeth a favor!</li>
            <li> Thin but strong, no wax buildup, toxic fluoride free, but too thin for me, if your flossing is tight or difficult, this is super sleek. You can see plaque on black color I wipe off &amp; keep going same spot.  I prefer their Classic 490 denier unwaxed, or possibly their thickest 630 denier unwaxed I&#x27;m trying for maximum surface &amp; easiest fingering.</li>
            <li> BAD if your teeth are tight and close together.  Get waxed if they are.</li>
            <li> Good product..  Little or no space between my teeth does pose a problem for all floss products.  This one stands up much better than the rest.</li>
            <li> PoH floss is the best!!</li>
            <li> This black floss has the feeling of thread.  I have close molars It has shreaded between the molars each time I have used it.  I may try the waxed version.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS HAD TO USE WAXED FLOSS IN THE PAST, BUT USED THE PLAIN POH FLOSS RECENTLY AND LIKED IT, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THE WAXED VERSION AND ABSOLUTELY DO NOT LIKE IT.  I WILL STICK WITH THE PLAIN FROM NOW ON.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> If you have closely spaced teeth I would not recommend this particular version - micro thin. It has the double problem of breaking very easily and being extremely difficult to remove from in between your teeth. Also, the black tends to come off onto your hands. Going to give the Classic NonWaxed a shot.</li>
            <li> This product works great!  I&#x27;m allergic to wax.  My Dental Hygienist recommended POH No Wax Percept 420 Black Floss because it is micro thin and now that is all I use.</li>
            <li> After my previous favorite no-wax fine floss - Butler Gum - no longer became available in long lengths, I tried this floss in the 100yd length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is finer than Butler and shreads/spreads out less. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this floss, more effective than any I&#x27;ve used for years. I would recomment the 630 for most users though.</li>
            <li> Probably the best floss available.  Also used as unbreakable thread.</li>
            <li> The string is not strong like other dental flosses.  I was hoping to use this BLACK floss to repaid clothes, etc.  Not.</li>
