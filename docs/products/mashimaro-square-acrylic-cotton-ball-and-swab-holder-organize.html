            <li> Much needed and used.  Makes life a little easier.</li>
            <li> Does everything I asked for and more. There&#x27;s even room for the rubber gloves we need daily to apply cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty, and well made product.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I was unsatisfied was that shipping took forever but I think it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re shipping it from China.&lt;br /&gt;I like it!!</li>
            <li> nice clean look, works as intended. I keep cotton balls, swabs, and pads in mine for my daily skincare routine.</li>

            <li> This item was larger than I expected and arrived with a crack. So it was returned.</li>
            <li> Item was cracked when I recived it in the mail</li>
            <li> It provides you with all the items you need for daily cleaning in one box. it&#x27;s not that big but you need to make sure its dimensions fit your medicine cabinets.</li>
            <li> This container is perfect. It has a division so I can put my swabs and another for my cotton balls. It has also another space for an extra something. I love it and I think its perfect to put beside your sink in order to access everything easily. Definitely 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great for bathroom organization. The glass holder fits perfectly on my vanity without making things look cluttered and messy.</li>
