            <li>Very good double-edged razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Good show!</li>
            <li>I wonder why  great</li>
            <li>Great for using on beards with curl, reduces ingrown hair bumps.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and blade are great</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>and I could get three good shaves before I nicks became a problem.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good Product , Good Price</li>
            <li>Good  </li>
            <li>I have gotten good shaves with these.</li>
            <li>like to feel good after shaving and these do it for me.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Nice responsive blade</li>
            <li>Super satisfied customer!!</li>
            <li>Best razors I have used so far</li>
            <li>Good high quality blades at a good price.</li>
            <li>Cheap price!</li>
            <li>I love these blades.  </li>
            <li>these just worked better.  </li>
            <li>I like them better than the Mecur blades.</li>
            <li>You really have to take it easy and use good shaving technique to avoid cuts.  </li>
            <li>I am figuring out an easy easy for me to mark the sides of the blades.  </li>
            <li>I am a daily shaver with sensitive skin and these blades are awesome for me.  </li>
            <li>I loved the Wilkinson Sword blade sharp and smooth, giving a close nick free shave.</li>
            <li>For me these are the best of the 6 different brands of double edge razor blades I have tried.</li>
            <li>There is not much to say about Wilkinson blades, good quality providing a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Recommend with this blade is to change after 4 days &amp;#34;2 days per side&amp;#34;, Defiantly worth a try.</li>
            <li>They are more expensize per blade than other blades, but you get more nick free shaves, I&#x27;ll only spend about $5 per year on blades with Wilkinson Sword.</li>
            <li>I keep ordering this same brand of blades because I honestly love them.  </li>
            <li>I felt the Wilkinson Sword blade made in Englad was better than the German blade, but the blade made in Germany is better than the other four blades I tried.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t tug and pull, meaning I don&#x27;t have to worry about so much irritation.  </li>
            <li>They come highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I seemed to get more nicks than from other blades.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I have to use TWO half blades for a shave.</li>
            <li>Its hard to explain it just felt like a more comfortable shave, that allowed me to do multiple passes compared to feather.</li>
            <li>, I used to buy razors at the art of shaving, but these razors are much sharper and last much longer!</li>
            <li>shaves out of one blade, changed to a new blade, because I didn&#x27;t want to push my luck.  </li>
            <li>Previously I was using the Gillete Silber Blues, and while I wanted to like those, because of how easy they were to get and because of their price, for my shaving needs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Sharps and Merkur blades in the past, but this is my new favorite blade.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to get four knick-free shaves from these blades, but I cannot determine if the Wilkinson is any better than--or at least equal to--the more expensive brand, or my face has gotten tougher, or if my shaving skills have increased.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend these blades for either a beginner or a seasoned wet shaver.</li>
            <li>old product still around....</li>
            <li>but so far these are my go to blades</li>
            <li>went with a sample pack and so far the Merkur and the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock are the front runners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, which can lead to a few nicks here and there, but they glide over my skin pretty smooth</li>
            <li>They give a close, comfortable shave and last for a few shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Far superior to the last Wilkinson&#x27;s I bought at a drug store a few years ago (which are hard to find in retail stores</li>
            <li>After trying the four brands I made my choice,  then I bought a vintage razor with an old Wilkinson Sword Double Edge Blade in a wrapping,  the blade was made in England.</li>
            <li>Not a bad blade, just a little rough after 2 shaves.</li>
            <li>Being new to wet shaving, this is NOT the blade to start with unless you have a ultra-heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The blades are just sharp enough to cut through several days growth with little effort.  </li>
            <li> When I first started, I used an expensive (but still cheaper than triple blade cartridges) double edged blade</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful with these blades!</li>
            <li> Sharp blades</li>
            <li> Very sharp blade.</li>
            <li> Way too sharp for me!!</li>
            <li> I chose these blades because of past experience with Wilkinson&#x27;s bonded blades in the 1970&#x27;s until I couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.  </li>

            <li> old product still around....I wonder why  great</li>
            <li> I chose these blades because of past experience with Wilkinson&#x27;s bonded blades in the 1970&#x27;s until I couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.  The blades are just sharp enough to cut through several days growth with little effort.  I recently got 6 shaves out of one blade, changed to a new blade, because I didn&#x27;t want to push my luck.  The blades are sharper than the Derby&#x27;s that came with my EJ DE89Lbl razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these blades for either a beginner or a seasoned wet shaver.</li>
            <li> Can get multiple shaves from this brand name double edge blade. Great for using on beards with curl, reduces ingrown hair bumps.Cheap price!</li>
            <li> I am trying to decide what  brand of double edge razor blade I want to use. I got a variety pack of razor blades, three different brands.  I received a pack of blades with a razor. After trying the four brands I made my choice,  then I bought a vintage razor with an old Wilkinson Sword Double Edge Blade in a wrapping,  the blade was made in England. I loved the Wilkinson Sword blade sharp and smooth, giving a close nick free shave. Wilkinson Sword blades are now made in Germany.  I felt the Wilkinson Sword blade made in Englad was better than the German blade, but the blade made in Germany is better than the other four blades I tried. I have a moderate beard and get teo to three weeks of shaves out of one blade. The only improvement I would mark the blades like 1 and 2 on one side and 3 and 4 on the other side, some blades do this so you can turn the blade over and get double the blades. I am figuring out an easy easy for me to mark the sides of the blades.  They are more expensize per blade than other blades, but you get more nick free shaves, I&#x27;ll only spend about $5 per year on blades with Wilkinson Sword.</li>
            <li> Super satisfied customer!!</li>
            <li> Nice responsive blade</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  I am a daily shaver with sensitive skin and these blades are awesome for me.  They are very sharp, which can lead to a few nicks here and there, but they glide over my skin pretty smooth and they don&#x27;t tug and pull, meaning I don&#x27;t have to worry about so much irritation.  Previously I was using the Gillete Silber Blues, and while I wanted to like those, because of how easy they were to get and because of their price, for my shaving needs these just worked better.  Haven&#x27;t compared them to the Feathers yet, but so far these are my go to blades</li>
            <li> Very good double-edged razor blades.  They come highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Seems like a &amp;#34;forgiving&amp;#34; blade.  Haven&#x27;t cut myself, ...on the other hand, it seems that it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as some other blades do.</li>
            <li> Not a bad blade, just a little rough after 2 shaves. Recommend with this blade is to change after 4 days &amp;#34;2 days per side&amp;#34;, Defiantly worth a try.</li>
            <li> on time and met expectations</li>
            <li> I keep ordering this same brand of blades because I honestly love them.  I will be placing my fourth order soon.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blade. Use extra caution or you will blead. Got 4 shaves per blade, usualy only get 2 or 3. Good value.</li>
            <li> Way too sharp for me!! Being new to wet shaving, this is NOT the blade to start with unless you have a ultra-heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;I went with a sample pack and so far the Merkur and the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock are the front runners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with these blades!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and smooth.  I&#x27;ve tried Sharps and Merkur blades in the past, but this is my new favorite blade.</li>
            <li> The Wilkinson Sword Blades (made in Germany) are doing the job, quite well.  I&#x27;ve used Wilkinson before.  Good show!</li>
            <li> I have been using Feather blades for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that this blade gave me a slicker shave, and a lot safer feeling that I wouldn&#x27;t knick myself. Its hard to explain it just felt like a more comfortable shave, that allowed me to do multiple passes compared to feather.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve using the double edged razor.  When I first started, I used an expensive (but still cheaper than triple blade cartridges) double edged blade and I could get three good shaves before I nicks became a problem.  I have been able to get four knick-free shaves from these blades, but I cannot determine if the Wilkinson is any better than--or at least equal to--the more expensive brand, or my face has gotten tougher, or if my shaving skills have increased.  Whatever the circumstance, these give me a better and less expensive shave than those multi-blade contraptions sold in the drug store or supermarket.</li>
            <li> For me these are the best of the 6 different brands of double edge razor blades I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Good high quality blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve been using Wilkinson Sword blades since the large animals roamed the Earth and have never had a complaint. - Kaleb</li>
            <li> Best razors I have used so far, I used to buy razors at the art of shaving, but these razors are much sharper and last much longer! Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Close shave. ....SHARP!</li>
            <li> Good Product , Good Price</li>
            <li> Sharp blades but I seemed to get more nicks than from other blades.  You really have to take it easy and use good shaving technique to avoid cuts.  I will not be using these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and blade are great</li>
            <li> Good  i know the name for 70 years</li>
            <li> I have gotten good shaves with these. I like them better than the Mecur blades.</li>
            <li> They give a close, comfortable shave and last for a few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to feel good after shaving and these do it for me.</li>
            <li> Far superior to the last Wilkinson&#x27;s I bought at a drug store a few years ago (which are hard to find in retail stores anyway).&lt;br /&gt;Will buy these again.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about Wilkinson blades, good quality providing a smooth shave. This pack of 3 is a bargain.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I have to use TWO half blades for a shave. You get what you pay for!!!</li>
