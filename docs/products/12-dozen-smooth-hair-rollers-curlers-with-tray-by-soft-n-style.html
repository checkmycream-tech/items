            <li>great curlers; I have bought them twice because they are so good, smooth and easy to use; you have to buy the clips to use them separtely</li>

            <li>OKAY</li>
            <li>It works well with dryer set, most improtant with this product should be used dryer clips.  </li>
            <li>you can use these rollers just make sure you also buy some roller clips or pins to keep rollers in place</li>
            <li>They are every thing i wanted and more if you need anything</li>
            <li>I love the stackable effect.</li>
            <li>Awesome,  use them daily in my beauty shop</li>
            <li>Used these in school years ago and was so excited to find the set!</li>
            <li>and it comes with the organizing tray, so it makes it easy to keep track of your rollers.</li>
            <li>They are easy to store away</li>
            <li>I have a salon with a strong clientele demanding I keep these rollers in stock.</li>
            <li>Very nice I love all of the different size rollers this product comes with</li>
            <li>Better to just get full length roller rods.</li>
            <li>And cheap, cost affected.</li>
            <li>They are readily available for pick up when curling hair.  </li>
            <li>Great rollers only thing</li>
            <li>so this set works great if you have short to average/long hair,</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have the holder for the rollers just a cheap cardboard box so wasn&#x27;t worth the money because I could have bought what the picture shows at Sally&#x27;s for two bucks more</li>
            <li>These rollers are the exact style that her hair dresser had used on her hair for many years.  </li>
            <li>the types of super powerful hand held dryers we now have.  </li>
            <li>The roller sizes are great, with the largest giving you lots of body, and the smallest giving you an afro of tight curls.</li>
            <li>Although my mom prefers to go to her hair dresser to have her hair done, these professional tools have provided us with an alternative to doing her own hair at home in the most convenient and easiest way possible.</li>
            <li>Short ones, often, in fact, work better.  </li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for to do a smooth style for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>These are the exact rollers i used in beauty school &amp; still use today.</li>
            <li>I love all the different lengths and widths.</li>
            <li>We also bought the Gold &#x27;N Hot Elite</li>
            <li>Other than that its a nice set</li>
            <li>I like the large range of sizes, in both diameter and length.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not familiar with rollers and rolling up your own hair, I don&#x27;t recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ved used this on my hair and others easy to rinse off and air dry then store.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very long and I can&#x27;t even imagine  whether one strand one fit on one of those curlers.  </li>
            <li>I got the same rollers from Sally&#x27;s and they LOOK the same, but are a nice, thick, smooth plastic.</li>
            <li>The ones from Amazon website are cheap flimsy plastic rollers that have plastic pieces sticking out of them like they were attached to each other an someone broke them apart to put them on the stand.</li>
            <li>Just one more thing sitting in a drawer since I almost always usually use a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I should have known $12 wouldn&#x27;t get me a professional set of rollers on a tray like the picture shows...</li>
            <li>I ordered these Hair Roller Curlers for my mom as she prefers this &#x27;Old School&#x27; method of rolling her</li>
            <li>so i put my blow drier on low and blow dry most of it &amp; then let the rest dry naturally.</li>
            <li>Be sure to actually grab a ruler when reading the description so you can see how small they truly are.</li>
            <li>Takes a while for my hair to dry, its very porous.</li>
            <li>On the con side: These are flimsy and very short and probably won&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>The small ones are choking hazards I think, but the big ones are safe for kids as long as you check they aren&#x27;t cracked.</li>
            <li>the are super small and my hair so long!</li>

            <li> the are super small and my hair so long!</li>
            <li> There are 16 sets of long rollers and 8 sets of short rollers for a total of 144 rollers.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have long or short hair</li>
            <li> They are plain plastic (no velcro texture around the outside) and range in size as described from larger to fairly small and all fit inside each other.  </li>
            <li> Of course you need double&amp; single pronged clips to keep them in your hair.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The rollers I bought from Amazon are wore out has-beens that I had to throw out a long time ago.</li>
            <li> , it looks to me like a super sick set of rollers, including a large red-sized roller set.  </li>
            <li> Similar to other reviews, these rollers do not stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> 1875-Watt&lt;br /&gt;Professional Stand Bonnet Dryer to dry her hair in comfort once I&#x27;ve rolled it.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair don&#x27;t buy it !!</li>
            <li> In the long run, they were less expensive because after almost 2 years of constant use, I haven&#x27;t had to throw out the first roller bought from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I wish the description let me know ahead of time so that I could either purchase a different set or at least buy the clips at the same time.</li>
            <li> the pro side, you don&#x27;t need wide curlers.  </li>
            <li> too smalls no as expected</li>
            <li> I thought it would have much bigger rollers than the ones sent , it will work for people who want their hair very tight curls</li>
            <li> They nest them inside each other and chew on them.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any ridges (not sure if proper word use), to keep your hair from falling off.</li>
            <li> I am, however, only slowly mastering the art of clip placement.</li>
            <li> In person, the red is very small, too small for my past-shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> /&gt;The rollers came in odd sizes that could not be used.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic was hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Also, they were unbelievably inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Of course, its a little awkward to sleep in them</li>
            <li> But these rollers are useless to me.  </li>
            <li> The worst.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought these to make hats for a high school production of Grease, and they were wonderful.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. Best to go visit a Sally&#x27;s store or their web site to order these. The ones from Amazon website are cheap flimsy plastic rollers that have plastic pieces sticking out of them like they were attached to each other an someone broke them apart to put them on the stand. I got the same rollers from Sally&#x27;s and they LOOK the same, but are a nice, thick, smooth plastic. I have a salon with a strong clientele demanding I keep these rollers in stock. The rollers I bought from Amazon are wore out has-beens that I had to throw out a long time ago. Sally&#x27;s was the same price, except because I ordered on line, I paid for shipping. In the long run, they were less expensive because after almost 2 years of constant use, I haven&#x27;t had to throw out the first roller bought from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived to my home I wanted to cry because that roll look like rolls for dolls !!the are super small and my hair so long! If you have long hair don&#x27;t buy it !!</li>
            <li> Used these in school years ago and was so excited to find the set! Big plus that they came before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> This is not what it looks like.  Online, it looks to me like a super sick set of rollers, including a large red-sized roller set.  In person, the red is very small, too small for my past-shoulder length hair. I should have known $12 wouldn&#x27;t get me a professional set of rollers on a tray like the picture shows...</li>
            <li> This product looks as described and is was inexpensive for the quantity. There are 16 sets of long rollers and 8 sets of short rollers for a total of 144 rollers.  I purchased them to use for a color matching craft for toddlers, so I can&#x27;t speak to the usefulness for setting your hair, but I think they appear as described. They are plain plastic (no velcro texture around the outside) and range in size as described from larger to fairly small and all fit inside each other.  You would need to purchase hair pins to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> I have 12 dozen rollers and no clips to keep them in place. I wish the description let me know ahead of time so that I could either purchase a different set or at least buy the clips at the same time.</li>
            <li> On the con side: These are flimsy and very short and probably won&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;On the pro side, you don&#x27;t need wide curlers.  Short ones, often, in fact, work better.  Also, who sleeps in curlers anymore, anyway, with the types of super powerful hand held dryers we now have.  Also, they were unbelievably inexpensive.  However, all told, I probably wouldn&#x27;t get them again.  Just one more thing sitting in a drawer since I almost always usually use a blow dryer.  My hair is very long and I can&#x27;t even imagine  whether one strand one fit on one of those curlers.  However, I might try them out some day.  In the meanwhile, they&#x27;re sort of in the guest room in case someone comes and spends the night and forgets to bring their curlers.  Does that tell you what I think of them?  I don&#x27;t know.  I might use them some day.  Maybe when I let my hair go gray and cut it really short and want it all poufy.  (I&#x27;m not the type for a hairdo like that, but these would work well for that, I think.)</li>
            <li> I use the larger sizes of these as toys for infants and toddlers.  The babies are fascinated by them.  They nest them inside each other and chew on them.  The small ones are choking hazards I think, but the big ones are safe for kids as long as you check they aren&#x27;t cracked.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the holder for the rollers just a cheap cardboard box so wasn&#x27;t worth the money because I could have bought what the picture shows at Sally&#x27;s for two bucks more</li>
            <li> Great value if you are used to working with clips. I like the large range of sizes, in both diameter and length. My hair style turns out so why when I use these rollers: curly, shiny, non-frizzy. I am, however, only slowly mastering the art of clip placement.</li>
            <li> shipping on time, product as described.</li>
            <li> Great!! Just what I was looking for to do a smooth style for naturally curly hair. And cheap, cost affected.</li>
            <li> These are the exact rollers i used in beauty school &amp; still use today. Of course you need double&amp; single pronged clips to keep them in your hair. I love all the different lengths and widths. You can create so many styles with these rollers. Of course, its a little awkward to sleep in them so i put my blow drier on low and blow dry most of it &amp; then let the rest dry naturally. Takes a while for my hair to dry, its very porous. But the rollers are made very nicely. Would definately recommend that every female in the world have a set of these!</li>
            <li> This is a really great price for these and they came just as the picture shows. I do like these.</li>
            <li> They are readily available for pick up when curling hair.  My hairdresser comes to my home and enjoys the availability of them being stacked so neatly.</li>
            <li> OKAY BUT DEFINITELY FOR SHORTER HAIR</li>
            <li> Great rollers only thing they all should be one size</li>
            <li> great curlers; I have bought them twice because they are so good, smooth and easy to use; you have to buy the clips to use them separtely</li>
            <li> Maybe I do not know how to use.  But these rollers are useless to me.  Better to just get full length roller rods.</li>
            <li> Rollers did not stay in hair, even when I used the clips&lt;br /&gt;The rollers came in odd sizes that could not be used.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic was hard to work with.</li>
            <li> The worst. I threw them all out. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It em as des crib ed........ Quic k sh ippi ng.................wh at el se is th ere to say ab out it... done</li>
            <li> This product is execellent it keeps the all rollers nice neat in its place.  It works well with dryer set, most improtant with this product should be used dryer clips.  I&#x27;ved used this on my hair and others easy to rinse off and air dry then store.  I recommend this product for any type of hair.  If you&#x27;re not familiar with rollers and rolling up your own hair, I don&#x27;t recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I ordered these Hair Roller Curlers for my mom as she prefers this &#x27;Old School&#x27; method of rolling her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Her hair dresser can no longer work and we had to begin doing my mom&#x27;s hair on our own.  These rollers are the exact style that her hair dresser had used on her hair for many years.  We also bought the Gold &#x27;N Hot Elite 1875-Watt&lt;br /&gt;Professional Stand Bonnet Dryer to dry her hair in comfort once I&#x27;ve rolled it.  Although my mom prefers to go to her hair dresser to have her hair done, these professional tools have provided us with an alternative to doing her own hair at home in the most convenient and easiest way possible.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have much bigger rollers than the ones sent , it will work for people who want their hair very tight curls</li>
            <li> Similar to other reviews, these rollers do not stay in my hair. I do not know if its because of the sizes or because the rollers are too &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;.. It doesn&#x27;t have any ridges (not sure if proper word use), to keep your hair from falling off.</li>
            <li> Very nice I love all of the different size rollers this product comes with it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have long or short hair you can use these rollers just make sure you also buy some roller clips or pins to keep rollers in place</li>
            <li> No stand to place rollers</li>
            <li> It is by far different from what I expected I wish I can drop it somewhere easier to return</li>
            <li> These rollers are really nice. I have been using them for years and they are of the same quality that you would find in a salon. The roller sizes are great, with the largest giving you lots of body, and the smallest giving you an afro of tight curls. I am AA so this set works great if you have short to average/long hair,</li>
            <li> They are every thing i wanted and more if you need anything this the place to amazone .prices are low and affordable..</li>
            <li> The shorter rollers are really really short. Be sure to actually grab a ruler when reading the description so you can see how small they truly are. Other than that its a nice set and it comes with the organizing tray, so it makes it easy to keep track of your rollers.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy and the storage tray is an added plus. I love the stackable effect. They are easy to store away</li>
            <li> Awesome,  use them daily in my beauty shop</li>
            <li> too smalls no as expected</li>
