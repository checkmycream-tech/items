            <li>but it will smooth your lips out.  </li>
            <li>Great for removing the puffy eyes in a very short time.</li>

            <li>I really like the texture &amp; the way it leaves my skin feeling -- very smooth &amp; hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Love this Wrinkle Rx Extreme Retinol Eye Gel, I have been using her products for years, this is one of my favorite item, I will buy it again!</li>

            <li>At any rate, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and will continue to purchase if the price stays low.</li>
            <li>I love Dr Denese products and when I saw this new one I wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too rich and provides just the right moisturizing at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>They were not that deep to begin with since I take good care of my skin, but now they are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>This has more of a serum consistency, and I use it only at bedtime.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well on those.  </li>
            <li>I had much difficulty during my first use and</li>
            <li>It is good for me so long as I don&#x27;t use it over my entire lid.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t see how much product is remaining</li>
            <li>This product was very helpful with my sinus lines and it wasnt greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is doing anything really.</li>
            <li>and I really would not use anything else, now.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the eyes</li>
            <li>However the main flaw with the  product seems to be the cylinder in which it comes.</li>
            <li>Also, the consistency is such that it goes on really smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I really like Dr. Denese&#x27;s products because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Like this product line and this compliments her other products...like the applicator tip which makes it easy to apply...</li>
            <li>The stuff inside is good but the packaging design is frustrating.</li>
            <li>After just a few days, I can really see the fine lines around my eyes diminishing.  </li>
            <li>~ it&#x27;s tall and thin, so it falls over easily, but maybe that enables one to get more of the product when it&#x27;s getting low.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if they and the fine lines will vanish.</li>
            <li>but I swear some of the fine wrinkles are less noticeable!  </li>
            <li>I have old, damaged skin</li>
            <li>It dries completely without any residue.</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 20s and this eye gel does target fines lines and helps smooth them out.</li>
            <li>I really notice less dryness / wrinkles around my eyes.</li>

            <li> good product.and it is cheap.</li>
            <li> I love Dr Denese products and when I saw this new one I wanted to try it.  Great product as is  Dr Denese&#x27;s entire line.</li>
            <li> This eye gel works wonders.  It&#x27;s not too rich and provides just the right moisturizing at a reasonable cost.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Hooked on all of Dr Denese products.  This does a good job for the are I&#x27;m treating  Would order again</li>
            <li> I use this eye gel regularly in AM.  I really like the texture &amp; the way it leaves my skin feeling -- very smooth &amp; hydrated.  I will continue to use it &amp; recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great prices for this on Amazon!  Great product, goes on very smooth, makes your skin nice and smooth.  Way cheaper on Amazon and this stuff seems to last forever!</li>
            <li> Love this Wrinkle Rx Extreme Retinol Eye Gel, I have been using her products for years, this is one of my favorite item, I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now and am noticing a big difference in my crows feet. They were not that deep to begin with since I take good care of my skin, but now they are almost completely gone. It also does not irritate my eyes which most retinol eye creams do. This has more of a serum consistency, and I use it only at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see results, but it feels very smooth and luxurious, so I am hoping for the best. I love Dr. Denese products.</li>
            <li> I have old, damaged skin and I&#x27;m working my way through this Brand to see what works for me.  Bought this item for deep wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  Works pretty well on those.  HOWEVER!  This product works amazingly on deep lines within lips.  I use a lip stain &amp; it tends to settle in the vertical lines within my lips.  This product SMOOTHS OUT LINES WITHIN LIPS so that stain or lipstick, etc goes on and looks as smooth as glass!  No more dark lines on my finished stained or glossed lips!  Amazing!  Worth buying just for using on lips!  It won&#x27;t plump but it will smooth your lips out.  Love this, and will def. purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and this eye gel does target fines lines and helps smooth them out. The gel comes out as a pale yellow color that completely absorbs into the eye area after a minute or two once applied and leaves the skin with a velvety soft feeling. I use the tip of my ring finger to apply it rather than the applicator tip because I find I waste less product doing it that way. After a couple of hours you should begin to feel a slight tightening of the skin, mainly in the under eye region and after continued use the lines around the eye area do begin to plump up quite a bit. However the main flaw with the  product seems to be the cylinder in which it comes. The pump can be defective which makes the product very difficult to come out. One might think they&#x27;ve received a used item because of the difficulty in getting it to come out and it&#x27;s in an opaque container so you can&#x27;t see how much product is remaining and you can&#x27;t open it up either without ruining it. I had much difficulty during my first use and once I got the pump to start working the product came shooting up into the air in spurts so I ended up needlessly losing alot of the gel. The stuff inside is good but the packaging design is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Like this product line and this compliments her other products...like the applicator tip which makes it easy to apply...price was great and delivery fast</li>
            <li> First day I have used this and around my eyes feels so smooth.  It dries completely without any residue. Cannot wait to see the results after a few months!</li>
            <li> This product was very helpful with my sinus lines and it wasnt greasy. It also helped with plumping of  my skin. The customer service is very nice. I say try it at least once. God bless.</li>
            <li> It is good for me so long as I don&#x27;t use it over my entire lid.  It burns and I started getting some darkening of the skin on my eyelid, close to my nose.  I don&#x27;t know if it is doing anything really.</li>
            <li> Most of Dr. Denese are great products.  I would highly recommend anyone to, at least try them.  They have made a substantial difference on my skin and I really would not use anything else, now.</li>
            <li> I think the reservoir here is about the size of a piece of pencil lead.  Lasted about 2 wks.  Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Denese&#x27;s products because I have very sensitive skin and I was getting a rash from some of my other eye creams and lotions. I switched to Dr. Denese and my rash went away and I feel like my skin looks better... I will be 49 this year and I think I look pretty good.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product from Paula Begoun.  It works great and it is a very reasonable price for eye gel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...I really notice less dryness / wrinkles around my eyes. I use this product every morning after putting on my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to apply.  I dislike the applicator but I do consider the product moisturizing. It does not help with lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Great for removing the puffy eyes in a very short time. Worked well on my crows feet. They have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Takes the puff out of mine and my husband&#x27;s bags under the eye.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if they and the fine lines will vanish.</li>
            <li> I had no improvement under the eye area. I stuck with it until the bottle was empty.Another product that did not do anything for skin.</li>
            <li> I love thiseye gel.  It is gentle on the eyes but I swear some of the fine wrinkles are less noticeable!  Wuold definintely buy again!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this after seeing a PBS infomercial by Dr. Denese.  I can&#x27;t afford most of her products, but this one was at a huge discount, so I was excited to try it.  After just a few days, I can really see the fine lines around my eyes diminishing.  Also, the consistency is such that it goes on really smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  I&#x27;m looking forward to even better results with continued use.  The only downside for me is the shape of the bottle ~ it&#x27;s tall and thin, so it falls over easily, but maybe that enables one to get more of the product when it&#x27;s getting low.  At any rate, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and will continue to purchase if the price stays low.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr Denese products for years and this one is very creamy &amp; light and makes my eyes feel very good.  Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> After using for three weeks saw absolutley no results.&lt;br /&gt;There where good reviews on this product that&#x27;s why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
