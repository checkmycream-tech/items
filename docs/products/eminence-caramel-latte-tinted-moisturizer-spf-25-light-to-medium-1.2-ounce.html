            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>It doesnt have a pleasant scent, but works great.</li>
            <li>Good price, arrived in time with no problems.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize before using it otherwise it&#x27;ll get stuck in your pores.</li>
            <li>but it is more like a moisturizer that is tinted but the tint does not do anything.</li>
            <li>I do love the way it feels on.</li>
            <li>More like a lotion than a foundation.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>At first I wasnt that thrilled with this product, but after using it for a week I love it.  </li>
            <li>It feels light and adds the moisture I need.</li>
            <li>I was thinking this was going to be a light coverage</li>
            <li>Not greasy, light coverage.</li>
            <li>The item was not even in close proximaty to the original color.</li>
            <li>Give me a nice natural look.</li>
            <li>the color is light at first but the longer it is on me it gets darker.  </li>
            <li>Received my order pretty  quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love everything from Eminence, especially this tinted moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>I am not sure it&#x27;s any better than simply adding my own mineral makeup to my existing moisturizer, but this is quick, easy and not messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;terrific</li>
            <li>This product had such a strong odor of chocolate that I could not wear it.</li>
            <li>It really evens out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have liked all other products so far except for this one.</li>
            <li>Love the texture of the lotion and the slight hint of color.</li>
            <li>The color was way to dark for (light to medium.)</li>
            <li>but I like to go natural, so</li>
            <li>This is the only moisturizer that i&#x27;ve used near my eyes that does not irritate them at all.</li>
            <li>but I love it as a base coverage for moisturizer  light pre-foundation.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i use a lot of Eminence products buy this one is too greasy. I have oily skin so I think I will stick to the powder SPF.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Be sure to moisturize before using it otherwise it&#x27;ll get stuck in your pores.</li>
            <li> Give me a nice natural look.</li>
            <li> The color was way to dark for (light to medium.)</li>
            <li> I like this product, it doesn&#x27;t go on greasy and leaves a matte finish. provides just a little color but I like to go natural, so it&#x27;s perfect for my need. I&#x27;m not into &#x27;pancake face&#x27;. This is the only moisturizer that i&#x27;ve used near my eyes that does not irritate them at all. I&#x27;ve already bought a second bottle and would consider using other Eminence products.</li>
            <li> Received my order pretty  quickly.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like the way this blend totally into my skin and makes blemishes less apparent.It feels light and adds the moisture I need.</li>
            <li> I was thinking this was going to be a light coverage but it is more like a moisturizer that is tinted but the tint does not do anything. I do love the way it feels on. I bought for a sheer coverage but I love it as a base coverage for moisturizer  light pre-foundation.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about Eminence.  It does work well but you have to be careful how you put it on your skin and the color is light at first but the longer it is on me it gets darker.  Bottle should last a long time.  My age is over 50.  I would tell friends about Eminence.</li>
            <li> I like this.  I am not sure it&#x27;s any better than simply adding my own mineral makeup to my existing moisturizer, but this is quick, easy and not messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;terrific for SPF protection and a little natural coverage.</li>

            <li> I bought this as i use Eminence. I don&#x27;t like to wear foundation, but unfortuantely the moisterizer i have don&#x27;t have SPF in it. This one does the trick. More like a lotion than a foundation. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love everything from Eminence, especially this tinted moisturizer!  Blends in beautifully and adds a hint of coverage and glow!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Not greasy, light coverage. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!  Good price, arrived in time with no problems. Will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, tinted moisturizer with SPF.  Love the texture of the lotion and the slight hint of color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sheer you don&#x27;t even see it on your skin. It smells good but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My face had begun to have an allergic reaction,, so I&#x27;ve discontinued use.</li>
            <li> The item was not even in close proximaty to the original color. The formula was evidently not the same. I&#x27;m wondering what was even in it.</li>
