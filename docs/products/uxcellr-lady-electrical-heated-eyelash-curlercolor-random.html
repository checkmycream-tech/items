            <li>Incredible for the price !</li>
            <li>Not quite as impressed as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>Great product &amp;amp; wonderful customer service.  </li>
            <li>Rosallini eyelash curler Works beautifully and</li>
            <li>Great idea, but</li>
            <li>Chella makes a great heated eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>All in all a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>works great, had to get one for my BFF</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Great on the lashes but quit working within 6 months.  </li>
            <li>this nothing special--does not do a good job</li>
            <li>I would say I get a good one that works probay two out of every four I order.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work too good.</li>
            <li>so was very glad to find it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This heated eyelash curler is nice.  </li>
            <li>I already had one and loved it, so purchased one for my sister and one for my friend, who, by the way love it too.</li>
            <li>Pinches eyelids very easily.</li>
            <li>VERY CHEAP QUALITY.  </li>
            <li>and I love using it..</li>
            <li>I got better results by blasting my $1 metal curler with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>(Those cost more - about $5 - and lasted 1-2 years each.)  </li>
            <li>I just put in another order for 4 more.</li>
            <li>LOVE this one.</li>
            <li>At this price I will order more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I would buy more &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>sure yet how to refill the rubber</li>
            <li>Yes, the strip would change color indicating it was heating, however, the top of the curler and bottom where you place your eyelashes to curl would not line up, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay type of lash curler.</li>
            <li>but it is okay.</li>
            <li>It came faster than expected, and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>Well, one of the 2 I received did not work from the get-go - light flickered on and off</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I&#x27;m glad I found them again and will be ordering a years worth.</li>
            <li>For 2.50 (or whatever it costs) and free shipping</li>
            <li>Doesnt heat as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>IT WAS CHEAP</li>
            <li>This $2.59, free shipping, heated eye lash curler will change my life.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes would curl into a perfect arch high above my eyes.</li>
            <li>Kinda cheaply made, but worth it</li>
            <li>It was good but short lived.</li>
            <li>Read several reviews which were all good</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and it does curl my lashes but not as well as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even get hot!</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t get warm enough for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The moment I removed the heated tool and laid that cheap plastic around my lashes, I looked like an entirely new girl.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we was looking for.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t stay hot.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get too terribly hot</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than heating a metal curler w my blow dryer!</li>
            <li>Started using these years ago &amp;amp; this one is comparable to the last one I purchased, for far more than $3.99!  </li>
            <li>but at just under $4 i certainly dont mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked great for only a few months then just stopped working (even with a change of batteries).</li>
            <li>I really like this product... when it works.</li>
            <li>Look so cheap, totally can&#x27;t use</li>
            <li>Smeared my eye makeup and didn&#x27;t really curl much.  </li>
            <li>GOT VERY UPSET</li>
            <li>I think that, along with the heat, would really help the curling technique.  </li>
            <li>I requested a refund, I was informed the shipping would be too much</li>
            <li>Finally, I thought, I will fit in.</li>
            <li>A good one lasts maybe 6 months, a bad one 3, so order more than one.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a little more pressure on the grip of the lashes.  </li>
            <li>But, the funny thing is it calls for two AA batteries and the battery compartment is so small that even one AA won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes were ungodly straight and overwhelming thick.</li>
            <li>and so far my lashes have held curl for hours (without washing my face</li>
            <li>I’ve always been so self conscious of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>From the young age of five</li>
            <li>Good thing it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li>The curler would not heat to a high enough temperature to make it functional as an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Thats when a ray of hope hit me like those old mascara tubes: the Lady Electrical Heated Eyelash Curler in Light Green and White.</li>
            <li>Also, you must be very careful about slipping it into a cosmetic bag or drawer as it can turn on easily</li>
            <li>After my parents went to bed I snuck downstairs to our old PC and searched for the ultimate solution to my problem.</li>

            <li> The other works for now, but I won&#x27;t be surprised if it breaks within a month or 2.  </li>
            <li> my eyelashes are so long that they couldn&#x27;t get through the tiny lash opening.</li>
            <li> I would walk down the hallway while my classmates threw old mascara tubes at me yelling profanities.</li>
            <li> I have really thick straight lashes and regular lash curlers</li>
            <li> /&gt;i can already tell the white is going to get dirty pretty fast though</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is loose and will turn on inside a travel bag, so keep extra batteries.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2, hoping only that each would last half the time my last electric curlers lasted.  </li>
            <li> ive gone roughly two days/1 night with same curl)!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very difficult to see, to make sure the heated part doesn&#x27;t touch the eyelid.</li>
            <li> Oh well, only out a few bucks.</li>
            <li> It worked but not as expected</li>
            <li> Doesnt work, plain and simple</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not high quality material, but for less than $3, who can complain?  </li>
            <li> It does take time to heat up, just like any other heating product would take, but</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected!</li>
            <li> I noticed I was not like the other girls.</li>
            <li> hard to use, not any different</li>
            <li> and the battery runs down then</li>
            <li> Needless to say when I hit middle school I was trying everything in my power to hide those big black branches hanging over my eyes.</li>
            <li> ; i&#x27;m thinking ill have to buy a new one</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I was really hoping this would work for when I don&#x27;t have access to a hair dryer to heat up my regular metal curler.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Waste of money as I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Ive used it a few times with and without mascara</li>
            <li> It was what I had dreamed about for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve had one before and it broke because i was squeezing too hard.</li>
            <li> LEAST FOR 1 MONTH.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow but they come from communist China...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick lashes.</li>
            <li> Not Good.</li>
            <li> Before my parents could get home, I ripped open the box using my pent up anger and humiliation I&#x27;d accumulated over the years.</li>
            <li> This arrived broken and therefore was useless.  </li>
            <li> Totally useless product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it takes about three to four weeks to arrive</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too expensive</li>
            <li> Gone was the jungle canopy hiding my sad, mistreated eyes.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> It does heat up, but the angle needed to clamp close to the lash line makes it almost impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> Without the heat, it is nearly impossible to curl your lashes with this item.</li>
            <li> bad is what I already mentioned.</li>
            <li> I bought this through livingsocial and am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these all the time at Rite aid for $3.99 and was very disappointed when they stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li> This was terrible!  </li>
            <li> Worst eyelash curler ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what we was looking for. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Did nothing to curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> You truly get what you pay for.  This arrived broken and therefore was useless.  But, the funny thing is it calls for two AA batteries and the battery compartment is so small that even one AA won&#x27;t fit.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> this nothing special--does not do a good job</li>
            <li> This is my second one and I love using it..</li>
            <li> The curler would not heat to a high enough temperature to make it functional as an eyelash curler. I got better results by blasting my $1 metal curler with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I had one of these that I bought years ago and recently broke it so was very glad to find it on amazon.  It&#x27;s a perfect curler and is so affordable that I bought 2 in case something happens to one of them.  I would recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Great idea, but my eyelashes are so long that they couldn&#x27;t get through the tiny lash opening.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2, hoping only that each would last half the time my last electric curlers lasted.  (Those cost more - about $5 - and lasted 1-2 years each.)  Well, one of the 2 I received did not work from the get-go - light flickered on and off and it didn&#x27;t stay hot.  The other works for now, but I won&#x27;t be surprised if it breaks within a month or 2.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> A bit of a learning curve. But it&#x27;s hold my cruels all day. Kinda cheaply made, but worth it</li>
            <li> Totally useless product. Pinches eyelids very easily. Save your money. Chella makes a great heated eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these all the time at Rite aid for $3.99 and was very disappointed when they stopped carrying them. I thought it was best thing in world and told everybody so. However, you get what you pay for. A good one lasts maybe 6 months, a bad one 3, so order more than one. The on/off switch is loose and will turn on inside a travel bag, so keep extra batteries. All in all a great product for the price. Even if you go through 3 a year at $3.99 each, you&#x27;re only spending 12 bucks on a heated eyelash curler; plus batteries. In conclusion, I&#x27;m glad I found them again and will be ordering a years worth.</li>
            <li> I bought this through livingsocial and am really disappointed. I used it once and i went back to use it again and it wouldnt turn on. i changed the battery twice and nothing.</li>
            <li> only type of heated lash curler that actually curls my lashes. I have really thick straight lashes and regular lash curlers do nothing for me. this curls my lashes and keeps them that way throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had one before and it broke because i was squeezing too hard. This one will probably break soon too. It&#x27;s not high quality material, but for less than $3, who can complain?  I just put in another order for 4 more.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work, plain and simple</li>
            <li> This was terrible!  Tried 2 different sets of batteries and it just wouldn&#x27;t heat up.  Waste of money as I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Worthless. Very poorly made. Not enough heat generated to do anything. Only gave it a star because I couldn&#x27;t seem to write a review without giving some sort of rating.</li>
            <li> I prefer my regular eyelash curler 👌🏽</li>
            <li> I really like this product... when it works. Unfortunately it takes about three to four weeks to arrive so I can&#x27;t just send one back when it doesn&#x27;t work and expect a replacement anytime soon. What I do like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make that crease along your eyelashes that the non-heated metal curlers so. It also doesn&#x27;t get too terribly hot (I have never burned my eyelids).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad is what I already mentioned. I would say I get a good one that works probay two out of every four I order. They&#x27;re not too expensive so I would probably recommend ordering two at a time just in case one doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> LOVE this one. On and off button are a MUST. works great, had to get one for my BFF and she loves it too</li>
            <li> Great product &amp;amp; wonderful customer service.  At this price I will order more.  Started using these years ago &amp;amp; this one is comparable to the last one I purchased, for far more than $3.99!  Shipping was slow but they come from communist China...enough said.</li>
            <li> Worst eyelash curler ever. Doesn&#x27;t even get hot!</li>
            <li> Look so cheap, totally can&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> It does heat up, but the angle needed to clamp close to the lash line makes it almost impossible to use.  Smeared my eye makeup and didn&#x27;t really curl much.  I am disappointed because I was really hoping this would work for when I don&#x27;t have access to a hair dryer to heat up my regular metal curler.  Oh well, only out a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I have tried probably 20 eyelash curlers in my lifetime. Some have pulled eyelashes out; some have not worked properly.&lt;br /&gt;The Rosallini eyelash curler Works beautifully and every time. This product I would recommend for the price, quality, and reliability.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister &amp; it took FOREVER to get shipped to me. Then we had to get a battery for it &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. It&#x27;s garbage.</li>
            <li> awesome eyelash curler! does the trick!</li>
            <li> Worked great for only a few months then just stopped working (even with a change of batteries).</li>
            <li> I love this product. It came faster than expected, and it works perfectly! I don&#x27;t see why people are giving it one star. For 2.50 (or whatever it costs) and free shipping it&#x27;s a great product. It does take time to heat up, just like any other heating product would take, but that&#x27;s to be expected! I love it! I would buy more &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It was good but short lived. This is my second one.  Great on the lashes but quit working within 6 months.  It was a gift, so I did go back and buy another</li>
            <li> hard to use, not any different</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. However, it does not work well. It does not curl my lashes. Good thing it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Doesnt heat as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> NO IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK @ ALL. GOT VERY UPSET&lt;br /&gt;I THREW IT IN THE TRASH. VERY CHEAP QUALITY.  I KNOW IT WAS CHEAP BUT IT COULD OF WORK @ LEAST FOR 1 MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER WORKSINCE DAY 1.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t get warm enough for my eyelashes. I don&#x27;t have thick lashes. No I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> it took a while to get here but it was being shipped from china. Ive used it a few times with and without mascara and so far my lashes have held curl for hours (without washing my face ive gone roughly two days/1 night with same curl)! This is so much easier than heating a metal curler w my blow dryer! And you dont need to apply a lot of pressure for it to curl which saves my lashes from being crimped and from being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure yet how to refill the rubber; i&#x27;m thinking ill have to buy a new one but at just under $4 i certainly dont mind.&lt;br /&gt;i can already tell the white is going to get dirty pretty fast though</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too good.</li>
            <li> This heated eyelash curler is nice.  Heats up quickly and it does curl my lashes but not as well as I&#x27;d like.  I wish it had a little more pressure on the grip of the lashes.  I think that, along with the heat, would really help the curling technique.  Also, you must be very careful about slipping it into a cosmetic bag or drawer as it can turn on easily and the battery runs down then and you have no heat.  ?Without the heat, it is nearly impossible to curl your lashes with this item.</li>
            <li> break after 1 month. but used only 3 times.</li>
            <li> It worked but not as expected</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Yes, the strip would change color indicating it was heating, however, the top of the curler and bottom where you place your eyelashes to curl would not line up, so it was like using a regular curler with no heat.</li>
            <li> Works well. Needs instructions in English included</li>
            <li> I already had one and loved it, so purchased one for my sister and one for my friend, who, by the way love it too.</li>
            <li> THIS DONT WORK DONT BUY</li>
            <li> Read several reviews which were all good so I purchased 4 total thinking they would work and I could give as presents to my sisters.  This thing does not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I requested a refund, I was informed the shipping would be too much so they offered me $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this item.</li>
            <li> Incredible for the price !</li>
            <li> Not Good. The price speaks for itself. You get what you pay for. The device warmed up but it didn&#x27;t curl at all. It&#x27;s also very difficult to see, to make sure the heated part doesn&#x27;t touch the eyelid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay type of lash curler. Kinda gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Not quite as impressed as I thought I would be. I have ordered heated eyelash curlers before- this one is okay.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t heat up that well- but it is okay.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I’ve always been so self conscious of my eyelashes. From the young age of five I noticed I was not like the other girls. My eyelashes were ungodly straight and overwhelming thick. Needless to say when I hit middle school I was trying everything in my power to hide those big black branches hanging over my eyes. What was I supposed to do? I would walk down the hallway while my classmates threw old mascara tubes at me yelling profanities. So one night I’d finally had enough. After my parents went to bed I snuck downstairs to our old PC and searched for the ultimate solution to my problem. Thats when a ray of hope hit me like those old mascara tubes: the Lady Electrical Heated Eyelash Curler in Light Green and White. It was what I had dreamed about for the past 10 years. Finally, I thought, I will fit in. This $2.59, free shipping, heated eye lash curler will change my life. My eyelashes would curl into a perfect arch high above my eyes. I proceeded to snag my moms credit card, input my information, hit order and return the piece of plastic to her crinkled, knock-off coach before dozing off into anticipation. The following days turned into weeks. I had officially lost hope, but then the day had finally came. My eyes locked on the package while I walked up the sidewalk to my house. Before my parents could get home, I ripped open the box using my pent up anger and humiliation I&#x27;d accumulated over the years. The moment I removed the heated tool and laid that cheap plastic around my lashes, I looked like an entirely new girl. Gone was the jungle canopy hiding my sad, mistreated eyes. Next on the agenda? Revenge.</li>
