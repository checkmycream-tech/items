            <li>I love the smell!  </li>
            <li>Yet it is not at all overly citrusy, and will be very fine in the office, but also good for a night&#x27;s out.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in retail packaging, smells wonderful, and I get lots of positive comments on it.</li>

            <li>great smelling and  cool.</li>
            <li>My husband loved it but he still thinks Polo blue is the best</li>
            <li>arrived quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li>By far the best smelling cologne out there.</li>
            <li>Good clean smell without being over powering</li>

            <li>I thought it was to good to be true</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never smelled such an awesome cologne.  </li>
            <li>I love polo, I get many compliments for this product.</li>
            <li>in top of that there is no way to return the product...</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite cologne for 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you know that you want the fragrance before you order it... because you will be stuck with it if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed it as did my wife.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day. :)</li>
            <li>hubby will not be using it for sure, just have to trash it.</li>
            <li>Love this for the price, gift for my husband, he also loves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a lovely sexy scent for a man.</li>
            <li>Repeat buy, so obviously I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this since it came out.  </li>
            <li>My husband love sit</li>
            <li>and I love the smell on him.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s appropriate for all times of the day or occasions .. :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say how many times he has dropped it on ceramic tile and it has yet to break.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>HIS FAVORITE</li>
            <li>cant wait he is gonna love it</li>
            <li>Amazon My Son will Love This. :)</li>
            <li>Better price than any store.</li>
            <li>The women in my life LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>the women love polo black.&lt;br</li>
            <li>SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>That is why I love shopping at Amazon.</li>
            <li>My wife love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance on my husband.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>I just love this smell on my man :-*</li>
            <li>and i  smelled really good and the price is right as  </li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorited cologne and the price was great so this will be my new place of choice when reordering.</li>
            <li>The new cologne was great, my girlfriend couldnt stop smelling me for the longest time and the strong smell makes me feel like a boss.</li>
            <li>It is comparable to Diesel (Only the Brave), Versace Pour Homme, and can best be described as a mix between Light Blue (Dolce) and CK Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love the stink of this!  ;-)</li>
            <li>It has a strong alochl smell.</li>
            <li>Polo Black for Men by Ralph Lauren is an excellent cologne, and I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the smaller sizes are the perfect size for \\&quot;sampling\\&quot; and for the seasoned</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actual polo black is an awesome product -</li>
            <li>Polo Black by Ralph Lauren for Men smells great!!</li>
            <li>It is not too strong, but a light scent.</li>
            <li>The cologne isn&#x27;t too strong or too light and lasts about 6-8 hours for me.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily I received the proper cologne and it smells great and lasts almost all day :)</li>
            <li>it not only smells great</li>
            <li>My husband loves this scent and I enjoy it as well</li>
            <li>products are made of great quality and obviously so is their packaging.</li>
            <li>Spicy and handsome, with a lingering sweetness that is compelling.  </li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite kind of cologne.</li>
            <li>Recieve very fast and love smell.</li>
            <li>After spraying significant amount I still can&#x27;t smell it nor people around me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not the original fragrance and the product came opened.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I looked several places and this was by far the best price for the size.  </li>
            <li>and it arrived August 18th (with free super saver shipping)</li>
            <li>It is clean and citrus smelling, but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>~) Our 15 year old son has the Red version and that smells great too!!</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and have received a lot of positive comments about it.</li>
            <li>it is not too strong and the price was right ....</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh and pleasant scent, it is not overpowering, and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>It is also great for young or older men.</li>
            <li>it is clean and masculine nice to have  and smell.</li>
            <li>Its bright opening, to its fluid drydown is an all around winner in my book.</li>
            <li>what colognes are not?) and settles to a smooth, fresh smell that is not spicey or musky.</li>
            <li>tell me how much they love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Never Had Before but TRUELY</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it so I can be the only one who smells this good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh, clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>The scent sticks around all day/night, but the &#x27;projection&#x27; of the scent dies off relatively quickly, within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>The pump mechanism doesn&#x27;t work as well as other cologne bottles, and the nozzle doesn&#x27;t disperse in a very effective pattern.</li>
            <li>the 4.2 lasts a good long time.  </li>
            <li>Worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto, or lighter scented cologne.</li>
            <li>Box was perfectly in tact, and the cologne itself smells great, not strong enough to taste but definitely a noticeable scent.</li>
            <li>reviews generally consider the following areas: price/value, appeal/smell, \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), longevity, uniqueness, best time of year worn or occasion, and easy on the nose (and bottle on the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo</li>
            <li>This cologne has a great, subtle scent that is not overpowering and smells very clean.</li>
            <li>Usually I&#x27;m allergic to most colognes my hubby wears but this one, WOW, it doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies and is incredible.  </li>
            <li>You are not trying to scent the mall!&lt;br /&gt;Also, wear a cologne because you like it first!</li>
            <li>Thankfully I also ordered a smaller one, because when it was opened it didn&#x27;t have the button on top to spray out the cologne!  </li>
            <li>so do your shopping around first!</li>
            <li>Trust me, its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but worth it indeed.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I guess you know your cologne smells good when random strangers tell you that you smell good.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite and I own over 15 different fragrances!</li>
            <li>that is, and not too powerful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even worth 1 star.</li>
            <li>This cologne is definitely worth a 5 star review.</li>
            <li>Black smells great and while comparable to other fragrances, it does offer it&#x27;s own unique essence.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was a decent size for the price, and the overall quality was good.</li>
            <li>Right product what i&#x27;m expert</li>
            <li>/&gt;they will lick it right off of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As soon as I sprayed it, it dripped like water right off the paper.</li>
            <li>All right.</li>
            <li>At first spray, this can be a pretty potent cologne, but after 1-2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it&#x27;s green original polo brother.</li>
            <li>a cool  vibe which is a welcoming feeling, because not every scent can do  the trick,however this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The product shipped super fast, i ordered it August 16th</li>
            <li>After paying so much money when I use this it wears off so quickly that you can&#x27;t tell that I am even wearing Polo.</li>
            <li>Costs a little more, but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li>oh, btw, the shipping was very fast on this item which is a plus</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an exact replacement.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was expecting to get</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still get it ;)</li>
            <li>On a lighter note,  smelling this once caused my hungover friend to vomit, which was funny.</li>
            <li>THE COLONE DOESN&#x27;T LAST MORE THAN A MINUTE.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks for resending the item to me without questioning!</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an exact replacement.  </li>
            <li>exactly like it should,</li>
            <li>but this was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>We like the crisp fragrance.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!</li>
            <li>The Black, however seems to fit a person over 30 better...</li>
            <li>purchased this for my husband which he really wanted however ended going out to purchase one from Belk because this just did not smell right</li>
            <li>Have purchased or been gifted original green Polo products for over 40 years.</li>
            <li>I was happy with my Polo Black for the simple reason that it was real.</li>
            <li>my opinion, Polo Black provides a fragrance that is clean and fresh with mild fruity undertones.  </li>
            <li>This was the real stuff toooo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe these are real.</li>
            <li>My son really like the smell of this cologne</li>
            <li>thanks amazon</li>
            <li>This product is not what the real stuff smells like.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Hahaha.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe these are real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and need something lighter and fresh like dolce&amp;gabana light blue or armani code(black).</li>
            <li>The item was packed very well and came sealed in plastic.</li>
            <li>it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I ran out and found that you were caring it and ordered it thanks</li>
            <li>Dont thimk its real.</li>
            <li>though, so I don&#x27;t really ding this for that shortcoming.</li>
            <li>I will just go to Macy and get the real deal.</li>
            <li>BY FAR THIS COLOGNE!!!</li>
            <li>wanted to be sure if the rash is due to this perfume</li>
            <li>I like the other Polos much more</li>
            <li>Second time purchasing this fragrance, has a clean, almost spicy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>Smells nice but does not last long.</li>
            <li>Its prefect not overpowering and has just enough sweet smell to it where its not girly.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle mango smell this cologne has which gives it a sweet edge to it.  </li>
            <li>Polo Black is his favorite (and mine, too).</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Polo Black.</li>
            <li>Love Polo Black.  </li>
            <li>Love polo black</li>
            <li>I have been using Polo Black for many years.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance and a larger bottle than I expected</li>
            <li>Lasts most of the work day, will try the regular polo, if that does not satisfy, will come back to this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>He applies it in the morning and won&#x27;t have to for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is made of high quality as well.</li>
            <li>The price is slightly high (for a new cologne buyer/college student(could have gotten a new polo shirt!))</li>
            <li>i love the amount of compliments i get wearing polo black!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll live with it...</li>
            <li>MY NEW SIGNATURE SCENT.</li>
            <li>The Polo Black 4.2-Ounce Eau De Toilette Spray for Men by Ralph Lauren has subtle spice and citrus fragrance notes, and it has become very popular since it was first introduced in 2005.</li>
            <li>Smells like fresh citrus with just the right touch of black pepper!</li>
            <li>If you significant other likes it</li>
            <li>My 15 year old loves this cologne!</li>
            <li>Little strong at first(but</li>
            <li>Receive numerous positive comments.</li>
            <li>long, though initial application only takes one or two sprays as any more is quite intense.&lt;br /&gt;Between this and Nautica Voyage are my favorites.</li>
            <li>If you like Polo Blue, you will love Polo Black.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a greet price, and it&#x27;s the same as Dillards, but much cheaper</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Gave as a gift for Christmas, so I don&#x27;t really have a personal</li>
            <li>DRIVES THE WOMEN WILD.</li>
            <li>People even stop him and ask what he&#x27;s wearing, even complete strangers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to get a good balance with that</li>
            <li>I bought Polo Black for sweet husband for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Ladies love the smell of Polo black, and I will keep buying it as long as i keep getting compliments!</li>
            <li>Initially, the scent wasn&#x27;t strong, but still essence of Polo Black.</li>
            <li>Obviously, the large bottles are expensive and a strain on the wallet, Ralph Lauren has introduced smaller, more economical sizes, for those of us perceiving we are getting a deal</li>
            <li>The scent is dark indeed, and the image darkly powerful.  </li>
            <li>It is about half as potent and doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the old bottle that was almost empty.  </li>
            <li>It is about half as potent and doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the old bottle that was almost empty.  </li>
            <li>but apparently so does everyone else.</li>
            <li>This product is for someone maybe in their mid to late 30&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a tad strong scent.</li>
            <li>you need a gift for your father, brother, cousin, significant other, uncle, or whatever male in your family, Polo Black is the way to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Black scores high in the \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot;, as I received numerous compliments from the opposite sex.  </li>
            <li>I believe this to be their finest cologne for men, with Romance Silver being not a distant, albeit rather different, second.  </li>
            <li>Polo Black seems a bit less aromatic than the original.</li>
            <li>It really pissed me of because I couldn&#x27;t return it to replace it with Double Black by Ralph Lauren.</li>
            <li>I have had a bottle of Polo Blue for at least 7 years now, and just got this 2nd Polo Black in the same amount of year&#x27;s, so you can tell what gets used more.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and a great price!</li>

            <li> I love the smell!  </li>

            <li> great smelling and  cool.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it but he still thinks Polo blue is the best</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li> By far the best smelling cologne out there.</li>
            <li> Good clean smell without being over powering</li>

            <li> I thought it was to good to be true</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled such an awesome cologne.  </li>
            <li> I love polo, I get many compliments for this product.</li>
            <li> in top of that there is no way to return the product...</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite cologne for 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you know that you want the fragrance before you order it... because you will be stuck with it if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed it as did my wife.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day. :)</li>
            <li> hubby will not be using it for sure, just have to trash it.</li>
            <li> Love this for the price, gift for my husband, he also loves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a lovely sexy scent for a man.</li>
            <li> Repeat buy, so obviously I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this since it came out.  </li>
            <li> My husband love sit</li>
            <li> and I love the smell on him.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s appropriate for all times of the day or occasions .. :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say how many times he has dropped it on ceramic tile and it has yet to break.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> HIS FAVORITE</li>
            <li> cant wait he is gonna love it</li>
            <li> Amazon My Son will Love This. :)</li>
            <li> Better price than any store.</li>
            <li> The women in my life LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> the women love polo black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> That is why I love shopping at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my husband.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> I just love this smell on my man :-*</li>
            <li> and i  smelled really good and the price is right as  </li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorited cologne and the price was great so this will be my new place of choice when reordering.</li>
            <li> The new cologne was great, my girlfriend couldnt stop smelling me for the longest time and the strong smell makes me feel like a boss.</li>
            <li> It is comparable to Diesel (Only the Brave), Versace Pour Homme, and can best be described as a mix between Light Blue (Dolce) and CK Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love the stink of this!  ;-)</li>
            <li> It has a strong alochl smell.</li>
            <li> Polo Black for Men by Ralph Lauren is an excellent cologne, and I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the smaller sizes are the perfect size for \\&quot;sampling\\&quot; and for the seasoned</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actual polo black is an awesome product -</li>
            <li> Polo Black by Ralph Lauren for Men smells great!!</li>
            <li> It is not too strong, but a light scent.</li>
            <li> The cologne isn&#x27;t too strong or too light and lasts about 6-8 hours for me.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily I received the proper cologne and it smells great and lasts almost all day :)</li>
            <li> it not only smells great</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent and I enjoy it as well</li>
            <li> products are made of great quality and obviously so is their packaging.</li>
            <li> Spicy and handsome, with a lingering sweetness that is compelling.  </li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite kind of cologne.</li>
            <li> Recieve very fast and love smell.</li>
            <li> After spraying significant amount I still can&#x27;t smell it nor people around me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not the original fragrance and the product came opened.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I looked several places and this was by far the best price for the size.  </li>
            <li> and it arrived August 18th (with free super saver shipping)</li>
            <li> It is clean and citrus smelling, but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> ~) Our 15 year old son has the Red version and that smells great too!!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and have received a lot of positive comments about it.</li>
            <li> it is not too strong and the price was right ....</li>
            <li> It has a very fresh and pleasant scent, it is not overpowering, and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It is also great for young or older men.</li>
            <li> it is clean and masculine nice to have  and smell.</li>
            <li> Its bright opening, to its fluid drydown is an all around winner in my book.</li>
            <li> what colognes are not?) and settles to a smooth, fresh smell that is not spicey or musky.</li>
            <li> tell me how much they love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Never Had Before but TRUELY</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it so I can be the only one who smells this good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fresh, clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> The scent sticks around all day/night, but the &#x27;projection&#x27; of the scent dies off relatively quickly, within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> The pump mechanism doesn&#x27;t work as well as other cologne bottles, and the nozzle doesn&#x27;t disperse in a very effective pattern.</li>
            <li> the 4.2 lasts a good long time.  </li>
            <li> Worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto, or lighter scented cologne.</li>
            <li> Box was perfectly in tact, and the cologne itself smells great, not strong enough to taste but definitely a noticeable scent.</li>
            <li> reviews generally consider the following areas: price/value, appeal/smell, \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), longevity, uniqueness, best time of year worn or occasion, and easy on the nose (and bottle on the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo</li>
            <li> This cologne has a great, subtle scent that is not overpowering and smells very clean.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m allergic to most colognes my hubby wears but this one, WOW, it doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies and is incredible.  </li>
            <li> You are not trying to scent the mall!&lt;br /&gt;Also, wear a cologne because you like it first!</li>
            <li> Thankfully I also ordered a smaller one, because when it was opened it didn&#x27;t have the button on top to spray out the cologne!  </li>
            <li> so do your shopping around first!</li>
            <li> Trust me, its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but worth it indeed.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I guess you know your cologne smells good when random strangers tell you that you smell good.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite and I own over 15 different fragrances!</li>
            <li> that is, and not too powerful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even worth 1 star.</li>
            <li> This cologne is definitely worth a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> Black smells great and while comparable to other fragrances, it does offer it&#x27;s own unique essence.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was a decent size for the price, and the overall quality was good.</li>
            <li> Right product what i&#x27;m expert</li>
            <li> /&gt;they will lick it right off of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as I sprayed it, it dripped like water right off the paper.</li>
            <li> All right.</li>
            <li> At first spray, this can be a pretty potent cologne, but after 1-2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it&#x27;s green original polo brother.</li>
            <li> a cool  vibe which is a welcoming feeling, because not every scent can do  the trick,however this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> The product shipped super fast, i ordered it August 16th</li>
            <li> After paying so much money when I use this it wears off so quickly that you can&#x27;t tell that I am even wearing Polo.</li>
            <li> Costs a little more, but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> oh, btw, the shipping was very fast on this item which is a plus</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an exact replacement.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting to get</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still get it ;)</li>
            <li> On a lighter note,  smelling this once caused my hungover friend to vomit, which was funny.</li>
            <li> THE COLONE DOESN&#x27;T LAST MORE THAN A MINUTE.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks for resending the item to me without questioning!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an exact replacement.  </li>
            <li> exactly like it should,</li>
            <li> but this was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> We like the crisp fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!</li>
            <li> The Black, however seems to fit a person over 30 better...</li>
            <li> purchased this for my husband which he really wanted however ended going out to purchase one from Belk because this just did not smell right</li>
            <li> Have purchased or been gifted original green Polo products for over 40 years.</li>
            <li> I was happy with my Polo Black for the simple reason that it was real.</li>
            <li> my opinion, Polo Black provides a fragrance that is clean and fresh with mild fruity undertones.  </li>
            <li> This was the real stuff toooo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe these are real.</li>
            <li> My son really like the smell of this cologne</li>
            <li> thanks amazon</li>
            <li> This product is not what the real stuff smells like.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Hahaha.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe these are real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and need something lighter and fresh like dolce&amp;gabana light blue or armani code(black).</li>
            <li> The item was packed very well and came sealed in plastic.</li>
            <li> it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I ran out and found that you were caring it and ordered it thanks</li>
            <li> Dont thimk its real.</li>
            <li> though, so I don&#x27;t really ding this for that shortcoming.</li>
            <li> I will just go to Macy and get the real deal.</li>
            <li> BY FAR THIS COLOGNE!!!</li>
            <li> wanted to be sure if the rash is due to this perfume</li>
            <li> I like the other Polos much more</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing this fragrance, has a clean, almost spicy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> Smells nice but does not last long.</li>
            <li> Its prefect not overpowering and has just enough sweet smell to it where its not girly.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle mango smell this cologne has which gives it a sweet edge to it.  </li>
            <li> Polo Black is his favorite (and mine, too).</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Polo Black.</li>
            <li> Love Polo Black.  </li>
            <li> Love polo black</li>
            <li> I have been using Polo Black for many years.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and a larger bottle than I expected</li>
            <li> Lasts most of the work day, will try the regular polo, if that does not satisfy, will come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> He applies it in the morning and won&#x27;t have to for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is made of high quality as well.</li>
            <li> The price is slightly high (for a new cologne buyer/college student(could have gotten a new polo shirt!))</li>
            <li> i love the amount of compliments i get wearing polo black!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll live with it...</li>
            <li> MY NEW SIGNATURE SCENT.</li>
            <li> The Polo Black 4.2-Ounce Eau De Toilette Spray for Men by Ralph Lauren has subtle spice and citrus fragrance notes, and it has become very popular since it was first introduced in 2005.</li>
            <li> Smells like fresh citrus with just the right touch of black pepper!</li>
            <li> If you significant other likes it</li>
            <li> My 15 year old loves this cologne!</li>
            <li> Little strong at first(but</li>
            <li> Receive numerous positive comments.</li>
            <li> long, though initial application only takes one or two sprays as any more is quite intense.&lt;br /&gt;Between this and Nautica Voyage are my favorites.</li>
            <li> If you like Polo Blue, you will love Polo Black.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a greet price, and it&#x27;s the same as Dillards, but much cheaper</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift for Christmas, so I don&#x27;t really have a personal</li>
            <li> DRIVES THE WOMEN WILD.</li>
            <li> People even stop him and ask what he&#x27;s wearing, even complete strangers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get a good balance with that</li>
            <li> I bought Polo Black for sweet husband for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Ladies love the smell of Polo black, and I will keep buying it as long as i keep getting compliments!</li>
            <li> Initially, the scent wasn&#x27;t strong, but still essence of Polo Black.</li>
            <li> Obviously, the large bottles are expensive and a strain on the wallet, Ralph Lauren has introduced smaller, more economical sizes, for those of us perceiving we are getting a deal</li>
            <li> The scent is dark indeed, and the image darkly powerful.  </li>
            <li> It is about half as potent and doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the old bottle that was almost empty.  </li>
            <li> It is about half as potent and doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the old bottle that was almost empty.  </li>
            <li> but apparently so does everyone else.</li>
            <li> This product is for someone maybe in their mid to late 30&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a tad strong scent.</li>
            <li> you need a gift for your father, brother, cousin, significant other, uncle, or whatever male in your family, Polo Black is the way to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Black scores high in the \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot;, as I received numerous compliments from the opposite sex.  </li>
            <li> I believe this to be their finest cologne for men, with Romance Silver being not a distant, albeit rather different, second.  </li>
            <li> Polo Black seems a bit less aromatic than the original.</li>
            <li> It really pissed me of because I couldn&#x27;t return it to replace it with Double Black by Ralph Lauren.</li>
            <li> I have had a bottle of Polo Blue for at least 7 years now, and just got this 2nd Polo Black in the same amount of year&#x27;s, so you can tell what gets used more.</li>
            <li> Polo Black receives high marks in this</li>
            <li> I have a years older Polo Green</li>
            <li> This does not smell the way it should it has a strange after smell like something else is mixed</li>
            <li> There is a strong bad smell right when you put it on that gradually desolves but a little always stays.</li>
            <li> it last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. one spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $62.91 and complete waste of money to every</li>
            <li> long time!l</li>
            <li> lasts all day long and into the night.</li>
            <li> but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I expected it would.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few Polo scents that I like (I hate the regular \\&quot;green bottle\\&quot; polo, and don&#x27;t care for Polo Blue too much either), but I LOVE this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to other fragrances that I&#x27;ve tried in the past, but has subtle notes that make it slightly different, but still familiar.</li>
            <li> However, with this product, I did&#x27;t see it to last as how my other one did...and the other one (that obviously ran out, so I came here to buy one for cheaper..</li>
            <li> It, will definitely buy other products like this on this site again</li>
            <li> Everything else was fine, but it would have been a useless gift without the other button.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very weak, I don&#x27;t think this is the original Polo black because I purchased a smaller bottle from Macy and with one spray</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed that I spent this kind of money on it</li>
            <li> Wanted Double black and got this instead...</li>
            <li> I gotta say, once you go Polo Black, you never go back.....</li>
            <li> I had recently purchased what was represented to be Polo Black by another web site, but it turned out to be counterfeit (and unacceptably bad-smelling).</li>
            <li> For such a small item it should not take so long</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and it was everything I expected</li>
            <li> so he kept it, however, for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I took a gamble ordering cologne over the internet, because you never really know if it&#x27;s going to smell</li>
            <li> Not Double Black ... oy!  </li>
            <li> Simply trash! $58 wasted!</li>
            <li> b/c other women hit on him alot..</li>
            <li> A little expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> Hard to explain, but it just has a &#x27;fancier&#x27; scent to it than something like Acqua Di Gio or Polo Blue.</li>
            <li> , this is watered down rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> My son had my husband try Polo Black</li>
            <li> However, i keep this in my attache wherever I go for the days i need the POLO BLACK HIT.  </li>
            <li> This polo black I got from amazon appears to be duplicate.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this bottle, this is not polo black.</li>
            <li> But not polo black</li>
            <li> I ordered the Polo Black and now that is all he wears.  </li>
            <li> Instead of Black it should have been Black Black.  </li>
            <li> things considered, I would rate Polo Black as 4.75 stars (on a 5-star scale) and recommend adding it to your collection.</li>
            <li> so you might as well wear Polo Black.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone that like Polo Black.</li>
            <li> It does not stand a chance with my previous cologne ( Dolce and Gabbana ).</li>
            <li> fiance has always been a Polo Black customer, and his scent may have even been part of what lured me to him, or not lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the previous one I bought</li>
            <li> The first use was extremely disappointing.  </li>
            <li> The first use was extremely disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Now, I know Polo Black, and all you need is just one little spray and the scent lasts with you.</li>
            <li> Polo black wear it everyday</li>
            <li> The scent is weak and does not last like bottles I&#x27;ve purchased from department stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a little over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not an everyday wearer for me as i like change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap..</li>
            <li> Everyday I wear this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total rip-off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as an everyday scent, but I have no problem using it at holidays, weddings, or nights out.</li>
            <li> So, unless someone is in close quarters or hugging you a few hours after application, they probably won&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> When I smelled the perfume it was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> After a few months no fragrance, zero!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not overwhelming like a lot of products that people wear.</li>
            <li> Am a cologne fanatic this was a gift and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a option to negative rate this product...</li>
            <li> Also not too common</li>
            <li> I can think of no better business cologne than this one!  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years and it is much less expensive at Amazon than at Macy&#x27;s, etc.</li>
            <li> I just shook the bottle and there is now some scent and not pleasant.</li>
            <li> So far not even one bad experience!</li>
            <li> Least expensive way to get cologne.</li>
            <li> this product was a fake..</li>
            <li> and it is a fake.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s so unfair.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> , so we tried couple of times and every time he tried it on - there&#x27;s a rash in that area.&lt;br /&gt;There is something wrong with the product I received</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S ALL FAKE.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about all the reviews about fake knockoffs..</li>
            <li> might be a fake one.</li>
            <li> &quot; I immediately went on youtube to see if there was a way to test if cologne is a fake.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s fake</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone who&#x27;s saying this cologne is fake or bad is talking about.</li>
            <li> Bad, never I will buy this again</li>
            <li> (that smelled bad)</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch but at the price I paid</li>
            <li> Frustrated, I put on about 8 sprays.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and will not buy this again</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are terrible .&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bad, never I will buy this again</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price! I purchased this as a gift for my husband. Polo Black is his favorite (and mine, too). Shipped fast! Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> After ordering this product, retailer never communicated.  Amazon informed me that they had not heard from retailer either and went ahead and cancelled the order for me.  I wrote to retailer, and they never responded.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift and the person I got it for loved it.  The bottle was a decent size for the price, and the overall quality was good.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH!  I&#x27;ve never smelled such an awesome cologne.  Usually I&#x27;m allergic to most colognes my hubby wears but this one, WOW, it doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies and is incredible.  I&#x27;d recommend 100%.  Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorited cologne and the price was great so this will be my new place of choice when reordering.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my husband it not only smells great it last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a greet price, and it&#x27;s the same as Dillards, but much cheaper</li>
            <li> I love polo, I get many compliments for this product. A little expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> My son had my husband try Polo Black and he really liked it so I thought I would order it for him. He would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for awhile now. Its bright opening, to its fluid drydown is an all around winner in my book. It is not an everyday wearer for me as i like change. However, i keep this in my attache wherever I go for the days i need the POLO BLACK HIT.  It is regal, yet, simple. Cooling, yet warming. It is also great for young or older men. I have not found one person yet who dislikes this frag. Every guy should own a bottle of this! Just get it. After my review, you are always going to wonder what if, if you dont. Trust me, its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. one spray goes a long way. You are not trying to scent the mall!&lt;br /&gt;Also, wear a cologne because you like it first! So many buy cologne for others, if you wreak in your own nose, who cares what others think!</li>
            <li> bargain an good stuff</li>
            <li> love it, smell really good</li>
            <li> Very happy with it was a Christmas gift and my son loves it</li>
            <li> The Polo Black 4.2-Ounce Eau De Toilette Spray for Men by Ralph Lauren has subtle spice and citrus fragrance notes, and it has become very popular since it was first introduced in 2005. It has a very fresh and pleasant scent, it is not overpowering, and it lasts all day long. Polo Black for Men by Ralph Lauren is an excellent cologne, and I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and it was everything I expected</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, and best price I could find.  This was the real stuff toooo.</li>
            <li> Incredible smell! Little strong at first(but what colognes are not?) and settles to a smooth, fresh smell that is not spicey or musky. By far the best smelling cologne out there. I have had dozens of ladies from 18 to 35 tell me how much they love this cologne. Costs a little more, but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased.  This for my husband for fathers day I wouldn&#x27;t buy this at the store any more after finding it here! Even after s&amp;h it way cheaper than at the mall!</li>
            <li> I looked several places and this was by far the best price for the size.  My husband loves this scent and I enjoy it as well, it&#x27;s not overpowering, but very nice.</li>
            <li> This polo black I got from amazon appears to be duplicate. After spraying significant amount I still can&#x27;t smell it nor people around me. Also amazon won&#x27;t take it back. Plz beware before u buy this item from amazon.</li>
            <li> The perfume is very nice. It is among my favorites. Great price compared with that from department stores. Will definitely keep purchasing from amazon. So far not even one bad experience! Thank you amazon.</li>
            <li> Am a cologne fanatic this was a gift and this one will be going into my collection.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an exact replacement.  The first use was extremely disappointing.  It is about half as potent and doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the old bottle that was almost empty.  I had my wife also smell the difference between the bottles. She laughed and said they were not even close.  I don&#x27;t believe these are real.</li>
            <li> Wow. Where to start. The product shipped super fast, i ordered it August 16th and it arrived August 18th (with free super saver shipping) Box was perfectly in tact, and the cologne itself smells great, not strong enough to taste but definitely a noticeable scent. The price is slightly high (for a new cologne buyer/college student(could have gotten a new polo shirt!)) but worth it indeed. i may infact keep this in stock. 5 out of 5 for amazing shipping, quality and even price since its valued at 75$ and up.</li>
            <li> My son really like the smell of this cologne it is not too strong and the price was right ....</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and a larger bottle than I expected but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I expected it would.  Maybe I ordered the after shave rather than the cologne.</li>
            <li> AWERSOME!!!  Great smell, My Wife loves it!!!!!</li>
            <li> all great, original and new in box, im very happy with my purchase, i used the cologne for all occasion and girls love it, is really cool and must have it on  your collection   thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Good sent, not overpowering.  Lasts most of the work day, will try the regular polo, if that does not satisfy, will come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is not the original fragrance and the product came opened.&lt;br /&gt;And in top of that there is no way to return the product...&lt;br /&gt;A total rippoff</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift for Christmas, so I don&#x27;t really have a personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The person we gave this to does like the Polo brand.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite cologne for 10 years.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Polo Black. I always get compliments from the woman. However, with this product, I did&#x27;t see it to last as how my other one did...and the other one (that obviously ran out, so I came here to buy one for cheaper..which I never will do again) lasted all day..and it was great..this one only lasts for like 30 minutes and then you don&#x27;t smell it anymore unless you smell it closely..but not when you walk by.... this product was a fake..i think the seller mixed it with water or something..I am extremely disappointed that I spent this kind of money on it and it is a fake.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband for me. Nice, makes you want to cuddle</li>
            <li> Polo black wear it everyday</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong product. Didn&#x27;t know there was a difference between Ralph Lauren&#x27;s \\&quot;Black\\&quot; and \\&quot;Double Black\\&quot; cologne. It really pissed me of because I couldn&#x27;t return it to replace it with Double Black by Ralph Lauren. I couldn&#x27;t return it because it was liquid??......I think that&#x27;s so unfair. Make sure you know that you want the fragrance before you order it... because you will be stuck with it if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Just one word: AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this bottle, this is not polo black. Packaged great, shipped out and delivered on time...... But not polo black, this is watered down rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Never Had Before but TRUELY Enjoyed it as did my wife. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good price!  Should have bought 2!</li>
            <li> Great scent for spring or summer.</li>
            <li> Price was awesome. Delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> My husband used to wear Polo Blue...I ordered the Polo Black and now that is all he wears.  If you like Polo Blue, you will love Polo Black.  The scent lasts all day. :)</li>
            <li> A great scent for the Autumn.  My wife loves it, and therefore so do I !!  A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item.  Instead of Black it should have been Black Black.  He has used this one before so he kept it, however, for the money spent. not what we wanted.  No quality control.</li>
            <li> Smells great, I love it, definitely one of the best cologne&#x27;s I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> If there was a 0 that&#x27;s what this review would be. Initially, the scent wasn&#x27;t strong, but still essence of Polo Black. After a few months no fragrance, zero! I have a years older Polo Green that&#x27;s still good. I just shook the bottle and there is now some scent and not pleasant. So there&#x27;s separation in the bottle of the elements. I don&#x27;t know where Amazon got this bottle, but I&#x27;d have to say not from Polo. Simply trash! $58 wasted!</li>
            <li> The scent is weak and does not last like bottles I&#x27;ve purchased from department stores.  I would not buy this again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Ralph Lauren has created another fragrance that will maintain popularity for years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, Polo Black provides a fragrance that is clean and fresh with mild fruity undertones.  It is comparable to Diesel (Only the Brave), Versace Pour Homme, and can best be described as a mix between Light Blue (Dolce) and CK Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reviews generally consider the following areas: price/value, appeal/smell, \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), longevity, uniqueness, best time of year worn or occasion, and easy on the nose (and bottle on the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo Black scores high in the \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot;, as I received numerous compliments from the opposite sex.  It also scores well with longevity.  I am especially fond of applying a moderate amount of any fragrance in the morning prior to work and it lasting the day without reapplying.  Polo Black receives high marks in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo Black smells great and while comparable to other fragrances, it does offer it&#x27;s own unique essence.  It is definitely a fragrance that can be worn any time of year and for any occasion without being overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is the value of the larger bottles.  Obviously, the large bottles are expensive and a strain on the wallet, Ralph Lauren has introduced smaller, more economical sizes, for those of us perceiving we are getting a deal (i.e. something under $30-$35 per bottle).  Additionally, the smaller sizes are the perfect size for \\&quot;sampling\\&quot; and for the seasoned traveler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I would rate Polo Black as 4.75 stars (on a 5-star scale) and recommend adding it to your collection.</li>
            <li> Love Polo Black.  My man smells so good!!  I would recommend this product to all men to wear.  You have to smell good for your wife, girlfriend or partner so you might as well wear Polo Black.</li>
            <li> Wanted Double black and got this instead...Not too happy but I&#x27;ll live with it...</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting to get</li>
            <li> Good clean smell without being over powering</li>
            <li> The new cologne was great, my girlfriend couldnt stop smelling me for the longest time and the strong smell makes me feel like a boss.</li>
            <li> This product is not what the real stuff smells like. It has a strong alochl smell. I thought it was to good to be true and it was. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!! Wast of money!&#x27;!!!!!!!!!!!,</li>
            <li> product came in no time and no damage came with it!</li>
            <li> Good product and service. I recommend to anyone that like Polo Black. Smell is GREAT and SEXY! Good for all age confident men</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a option to negative rate this product...&lt;br /&gt;Actual polo black is an awesome product - so, I ordered it as a gift for my hubby -  but what I bought on this link does not have fragrance and my husband got a rash using this product.&lt;br /&gt;We wanted to be sure if the rash is due to this perfume, so we tried couple of times and every time he tried it on - there&#x27;s a rash in that area.&lt;br /&gt;There is something wrong with the product I received and it&#x27;s non returnable product as it&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap.. It&#x27;s $62.91 and complete waste of money to every penny.&lt;br /&gt;My hubby will not be using it for sure, just have to trash it.</li>
            <li> got a bottle of this  and i  smelled really good and the price is right as  well.  a cool  vibe which is a welcoming feeling, because not every scent can do  the trick,however this is the real deal.  great smelling and  cool.</li>
            <li> Not a value for the money Product, Smell doesn&#x27;t last longer.</li>
            <li> i purchased this cologne for my boyfriend...it smells so good. i almost don&#x27;t want him to wear it out b/c other women hit on him alot..lol but its alright, i know he&#x27;s mine. oh, btw, the shipping was very fast on this item which is a plus</li>
            <li> My husband loved it but he still thinks Polo blue is the best</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! The day I bought it I had 3-4 chicks tell me I smelt good! So if the bitches notice you know the s*** smells legit ððf</li>
            <li> My husband smells great</li>
            <li> Love this for the price, gift for my husband, he also loves. It, will definitely buy other products like this on this site again</li>
            <li> Yesssssssss buy this now. Oh my god let me tell you am a women and when I smell this on my man it makes me want to tear his clothes off and jump on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lovely sexy scent for a man. Its prefect not overpowering and has just enough sweet smell to it where its not girly.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this product. It does not stand a chance with my previous cologne ( Dolce and Gabbana ). Smells nice but does not last long.</li>
            <li> Right product what i&#x27;m expert</li>
            <li> Cologne is perfect in all areas and smells just like it should!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years and it is much less expensive at Amazon than at Macy&#x27;s, etc. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne.  This cologne has a great, subtle scent that is not overpowering and smells very clean.</li>
            <li> OMG! SMELLS SO GOOD! GREAT BUY! GOOD SIZE!</li>
            <li> Repeat buy, so obviously I love it.</li>
            <li> The pump mechanism doesn&#x27;t work as well as other cologne bottles, and the nozzle doesn&#x27;t disperse in a very effective pattern. The scent is nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  It was timely and was in perfect condition.  Love the smell of this product.  It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and a great price!</li>
            <li> I guess you know your cologne smells good when random strangers tell you that you smell good. I knew I liked this stuff but apparently so does everyone else.</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT on a man.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband.  We both love the way it smells!  It&#x27;s very fresh, clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> Not Double Black ... oy!  Love this since it came out.  It is my go to and the 4.2 lasts a good long time.  If you significant other likes it I highly recommend it.  If not ... I&#x27;d still get it ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right up there with my Bleu De Chanel on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a Christmas gift for my son. Thankfully I also ordered a smaller one, because when it was opened it didn&#x27;t have the button on top to spray out the cologne!  Everything else was fine, but it would have been a useless gift without the other button.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This helps me achieve the smell I have been yearning for; sunshine and happiness.  On a lighter note,  smelling this once caused my hungover friend to vomit, which was funny.</li>
            <li> I should have paid closer attention to the reviews- this product goes on nice with a good fragrance. However, within minutes the fragrance disappears. Others cannot smell it either. I will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, I wear it, my cologne of choice.</li>
            <li> i love the amount of compliments i get wearing polo black!  Price is cheaper on Ebay tho so do your shopping around first!</li>
            <li> It smells so good and the the scent stays&lt;br /&gt;A long time!l</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne before and when my bottle ran out I ordered another one. I love this cologne and have received a lot of positive comments about it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it smells so great, very sexy! It is not too strong, but a light scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> husband smells great!</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE&lt;br /&gt;I WANT MY MONEY BACK. NEVER BUY ANY COLOGNE/PERFUMES FROM AMAZON. IT&#x27;S ALL FAKE. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. DIDN&#x27;T EXPECT THIS FROM AMAZON. THE COLONE DOESN&#x27;T LAST MORE THAN A MINUTE. IT&#x27;S LIKE WATER. CHEATERS</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne.  I got it for his birthday.  I got  a really good deal on it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Polo Black by Ralph Lauren for Men smells great!! My husband love sit and I love the smell on him.</li>
            <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
            <li> i love the stink of this!  ;-)</li>
            <li> I have had a bottle of Polo Blue for at least 7 years now, and just got this 2nd Polo Black in the same amount of year&#x27;s, so you can tell what gets used more. I gotta say, once you go Polo Black, you never go back.....</li>
            <li> I was concerned about all the reviews about fake knockoffs.. Luckily I received the proper cologne and it smells great and lasts almost all day :).. It&#x27;s a hint of spicy and fruity so i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s appropriate for all times of the day or occasions .. :) Also not too common so people won&#x27;t already know it alot of times.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old loves this cologne!</li>
            <li> Thanks for resending the item to me without questioning! You company has an excellent customer service and IÂ´m very pleased with all my purchases, up to date.</li>
            <li> My fiancÃ©e only likes this brand! So glad on found it here for way cheaper than having to go in the stores!</li>
            <li> I can think of no better business cologne than this one!  The scent is dark indeed, and the image darkly powerful.  Some people make transactions, and others conduct business.  When image can be everything, presence becomes extremely necessary.  Admittedly, this is not the regular Polo image.  The entrepreneurial depth connotes a greedy self-interest.  The price was nice, too!</li>
            <li> I was happy with my Polo Black for the simple reason that it was real. I had recently purchased what was represented to be Polo Black by another web site, but it turned out to be counterfeit (and unacceptably bad-smelling). You go Amazon!</li>
            <li> LOVE this smell!  Smells like fresh citrus with just the right touch of black pepper!</li>
            <li> I have tested this spray before but after owning it I really don&#x27;t like it. There is a strong bad smell right when you put it on that gradually desolves but a little always stays. I like the other Polos much more</li>
            <li> Good cologne but it is taking a couple of weeks to get to my house as I write this.  For such a small item it should not take so long</li>
            <li> Everyday I wear this I get a compliment from the ladies. Guys if you want to be attractive, add this cologne. Actually I should be telling you not to buy so I can have the advantage. Hahaha.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend and he loved it he buys it from this site all the time and it always makes him happy</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fiance has always been a Polo Black customer, and his scent may have even been part of what lured me to him, or not lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is an excellent product though. The scent is amazing and it lasts all day. He applies it in the morning and won&#x27;t have to for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is made of high quality as well. I couldn&#x27;t say how many times he has dropped it on ceramic tile and it has yet to break. You would think glass falling on ceramic from a 3 foot minimum would cause it to shatter. Not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polo products are made of great quality and obviously so is their packaging. Definitely worth the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a gift for your father, brother, cousin, significant other, uncle, or whatever male in your family, Polo Black is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an exact replacement.  The first use was extremely disappointing.  It is about half as potent and doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the old bottle that was almost empty.  I had my wife also smell the difference between the bottles. She laughed and said they were not even close.  I don&#x27;t believe these are real.</li>
            <li> I took a gamble ordering cologne over the internet, because you never really know if it&#x27;s going to smell exactly like it should, but this was exactly as advertised. Arrived in retail packaging, smells wonderful, and I get lots of positive comments on it. It&#x27;s similar to other fragrances that I&#x27;ve tried in the past, but has subtle notes that make it slightly different, but still familiar. This is one of the few Polo scents that I like (I hate the regular \\&quot;green bottle\\&quot; polo, and don&#x27;t care for Polo Blue too much either), but I LOVE this one!</li>
            <li> Purchased this cologne as a Christmas gift for my son. He couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! Good price and great size bottle.Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is for someone maybe in their mid to late 30&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a tad strong scent. I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and need something lighter and fresh like dolce&amp;gabana light blue or armani code(black).</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. It is by far my favorite and I own over 15 different fragrances!</li>
            <li> I believe this to be their finest cologne for men, with Romance Silver being not a distant, albeit rather different, second.  Spicy and handsome, with a lingering sweetness that is compelling.  Yet it is not at all overly citrusy, and will be very fine in the office, but also good for a night&#x27;s out.  Formal and pleasant, that is, and not too powerful.</li>
            <li> A gift for my fiancÃ©. HIS FAVORITE</li>
            <li> I love the subtle mango smell this cologne has which gives it a sweet edge to it.  The cologne isn&#x27;t too strong or too light and lasts about 6-8 hours for me.  It defiantly smells the best once it settles in after a while.  This is great for the colder months but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to wear this on the warmer days as it would be too overpowering.  Everyone who smells this cologne seems to like it.</li>
            <li> After paying so much money when I use this it wears off so quickly that you can&#x27;t tell that I am even wearing Polo.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume a year a go and decided to open it recently. When I smelled the perfume it was pretty bad. I decided to buy another perfume from another retailer to compare both. Here I realized that the one bought from Tek-Tok Corp (that smelled bad) might be a fake one.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Love polo black</li>
            <li> Smells Great!!! My husband has this smell and loves it himself... I do too! It is clean and citrus smelling, but not too overpowering. Very nice MAN smelling smell! :~) Our 15 year old son has the Red version and that smells great too!! The Black, however seems to fit a person over 30 better...</li>
            <li> I like it and wear it daily to work. Don&#x27;t buy it so I can be the only one who smells this good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments since wearing this cologne. The only reason why I gave it 4 star&#x27;s, instead of 5, was because of the price. Amazon sells it cheaper than everyone else, but I still think the price should be reduced by about 10%.</li>
            <li> Came on time as promised.  Happy with purchase</li>
            <li> cant wait he is gonna love it</li>
            <li> Came On Time Looks Exactly how Id Expect It Wonderful Reserve Great Job Amazon My Son will Love This. :)</li>
            <li> Least expensive way to get cologne. Better price than any store.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Son can&#x27;t get enough</li>
            <li> The item was packed very well and came sealed in plastic. The smell is good.....it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I rotated colognes based on the season...until I found this.</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing this fragrance, has a clean, almost spicy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Last long, though initial application only takes one or two sprays as any more is quite intense.&lt;br /&gt;Between this and Nautica Voyage are my favorites.</li>
            <li> At first spray, this can be a pretty potent cologne, but after 1-2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it&#x27;s green original polo brother. lasts all day long and into the night. Worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto, or lighter scented cologne. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just great. Everyone likes it. I ran out and found that you were caring it and ordered it thanks</li>
            <li> I bought Polo Black for sweet husband for Christmas.  Loving it!  Thank you Ralph Lauren for always providing wonderful fragrances.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn several different colognes, but this cannot be beat. He loves it because the compliments he receives when wearing it. A must buy!</li>
            <li> Literally a panty dropper for me.  The women in my life LOVE this.  MY NEW SIGNATURE SCENT.</li>
            <li> the women love polo black.&lt;br /&gt;they will lick it right off of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the only cologne that i&#x27;ve worn where i get constant compliments</li>
            <li> Despite some of the reviews stating that this cologne was a fake....I ordered it anyway. I have been using Polo Black for many years. As soon as I put on the cologne...the scent instantly went away. \\&quot;Uh Oh!!!\\&quot; I immediately went on youtube to see if there was a way to test if cologne is a fake. I found a video saying to spray it on a piece of paper and see if it drips like water...or is oily like cologne should be. As soon as I sprayed it, it dripped like water right off the paper. The paper had no smell. \\&quot;Uh Oh!!!!\\&quot; Frustrated, I put on about 8 sprays. The scent was there and then...it was gone. I asked my friends if anybody could smell it...and not of them could. Now, I know Polo Black, and all you need is just one little spray and the scent lasts with you. Now, there are different sellers selling this cologne here. I got mine from, \\&quot;The Perfume Spot.\\&quot; I immediately contacted them. They said that if I didn&#x27;t use it then I can return it. I wrote back, not wanting to have a problem, and told them of my like twelve sprays. They said that I could send it back, but I would have to pay for shipping. I was pissed, and so I contacted Amazon. Immediately, they told me to contact them with the price I paid for shipping, and they would credit me that amount off my next order. SATISFIED. That is why I love shopping at Amazon. Next time I will heed the reviews....like this one!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a little over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragrence and I get lots of compliments from women I know and even from women I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;They want to know what I wearing and want to buy it for thier husbands and boyfriends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this item. Will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> BY FAR THIS COLOGNE!!! DRIVES THE WOMEN WILD. ITS THE BEST ON THE MARKET AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT COMES EVEN CLOSE</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li> Perfect cologne100% authentic I give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 bundles of Ralph Lauren socks from Belks.&lt;br /&gt;They are terrible .&lt;br /&gt;One sock in each set gets hole  across seam at toe.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy anymore.</li>
            <li> We like the crisp fragrance. Have purchased or been gifted original green Polo products for over 40 years. Polo Black seems a bit less aromatic than the original.</li>
            <li> Recieve very fast and love smell.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations at a competative price.</li>
            <li> Bought it 4 a friend and he was very pleased as opposed 2 the previous one I bought</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my son.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s fake, I had this product before and I know how it smells like, but this is not it. It&#x27;s a total rip-off.  it&#x27;s not even worth 1 star.</li>
            <li> Dont thimk its real. Love the smell but it fades quickly. Even after over spraying. Think I was scammed.</li>
            <li> Receive numerous positive comments.</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome - I get a lot of compliments on it and it&#x27;s not overwhelming like a lot of products that people wear.</li>
            <li> A+!! Timely shipping and An amazing deal!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for gifts it is simply a yummy smell for men it is clean and masculine nice to have  and smell.</li>
            <li> Item as described at a very good price!</li>
            <li> This does not smell the way it should it has a strange after smell like something else is mixed in.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for my husband which he really wanted however ended going out to purchase one from Belk because this just did not smell right</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancÃ© to wear. I literally can&#x27;t keep my hands off of him! People even stop him and ask what he&#x27;s wearing, even complete strangers. Trust me, this is the perfect scent ever.</li>
            <li> My wife love this stuff</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! So happy with this pruchase</li>
            <li> Ladies love the smell of Polo black, and I will keep buying it as long as i keep getting compliments!</li>
            <li> Great gift for grandson, one of his many favorites. Arrived in timely manner. Grat.</li>
            <li> All right. Thank you for your service. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Looking forward again</li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite kind of cologne. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone who&#x27;s saying this cologne is fake or bad is talking about. This cologne is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. One spray on the neck lasts me a good 8+ hours. It also smells great. People say it wears off but it&#x27;s just cause people think it wears off because after a while, your nose gets used to the smell and you become de-sensitized to the smell. This cologne is definitely worth a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> This is a good cologne for nicer occasions. Hard to explain, but it just has a &#x27;fancier&#x27; scent to it than something like Acqua Di Gio or Polo Blue. I don&#x27;t use this as an everyday scent, but I have no problem using it at holidays, weddings, or nights out. The scent sticks around all day/night, but the &#x27;projection&#x27; of the scent dies off relatively quickly, within a couple of hours. So, unless someone is in close quarters or hugging you a few hours after application, they probably won&#x27;t notice it. I guess that&#x27;s a good thing, but I like SOME projection without overpowering a room. It&#x27;s difficult to get a good balance with that though, so I don&#x27;t really ding this for that shortcoming. I also find that &#x27;layering&#x27; this scent works best. A spray on the chest and wrists out of the shower, then a walk-through spray once clothed. That seems to work best with this scent.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my husband.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment! Product was a great gift :)</li>
            <li> Son loves it and that&#x27;s all that matters</li>
            <li> Really nice, I got it for a gift for my son-in-law. He was very happy</li>
            <li> I love the smell!  When doing these reviews you have to write a minimum amount of words.  What more can I say.</li>
            <li> I just love this smell on my man :-*</li>
            <li> The scent only lasts for a couple of hours it&#x27;s very weak, I don&#x27;t think this is the original Polo black because I purchased a smaller bottle from Macy and with one spray I could smell the cologne all day. Maybe I got a bad batch but at the price I paid I was very disappointed and will not buy this again I will just go to Macy and get the real deal.</li>
