            <li>Amazing product and very good price</li>
            <li>This is my go-to, but they have others that are excellent as well if you seek more volumizing.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for people with fuller lashes but mine are too sparse for this.</li>

            <li>and this is by far the best I have used.</li>

            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>

            <li>Better then brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall, I say give this mascara a shot because it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I will surely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>but if you do it with a careful, light hand you may end of with your best lashes yet!</li>
            <li>Not me, because all that makeup starts adding up QUICKLY!  </li>
            <li>I use an eyelash curler and it is important to have a mascara that will curl and stay through the day.</li>
            <li>This is a great product especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real mascara because it provides me with even more length/lashes curl upward more, it seperates my lashes, and makes them look thicker without being clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if someone with shorter lashes would get the same great results that I&#x27;ve experienced; they may be better off with a mascara geared more towardvolume, rather than seperation/length.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brilliant telescopic mascara for my 14 years old daughter, my 21 years old niece, for myself and my 73 years old mother .. we are loving it !</li>
            <li>And the packaging is cool, the wand stays clean and not overloaded with marcara.</li>
            <li>The special thing about this mascara, in my opinion, is the brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I saw this girl on YouTube saying it was so good and made your eyelashes look longer and bigger</li>
            <li>Even with a quick wipe on a tissue, the brush seems to glob product on my lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara does not smudge and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Better than several much more costly brands.</li>
            <li>I think that plays a big role in making my lashes look great, even more so than the actual formula.  </li>
            <li>I have long lashes and good volume.</li>
            <li>Brand new, better price.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, but the wand is so fragile that it bends really easily.</li>
            <li>Amazing product I only buy this mascara now</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best mascara it makes my lashes sooooo long from the first coat.</li>
            <li>The reviews are right.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li>upon opening it and with the first use it was like i was at the end of it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you that this mascara is just as good (if not better) as &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I sometimes get the &amp;#34;super long and defined&amp;#34; lashes that everyone else gets but most of the time, the brush just deposits wayyy too much product on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Coats very well and doesn&#x27;t take forever to put on.</li>
            <li>I normally really like L&#x27;oreal mascaras and purchased this one on a recommendation from Beauty Bybel</li>
            <li>This made my eyelashes really clumpy, which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Does not do too much for thickening.</li>
            <li>i was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>The brush is all plastic, but it coats very well.  </li>
            <li>The applicator wand does not allow too much product on the lashes.  </li>
            <li>Was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s about it, very dissapointed</li>
            <li>I will never switch, and I&#x27;ve tried most of the top rated Sephora/Department store brand on the market over the years--I just got tired of spending all that money.</li>
            <li>ðŸ˜ƒ Brand new packaging!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t soft and &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; like most mascara wands; it is actually a harder brush that is made out of plastic.  </li>
            <li>Love the quality of this mascara it has a dark pigment and it stays put with no flaking or pulling the only flaw with this product is the wand it&#x27;s on the small side other than that it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what your looking for then I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal makes high quality mascara.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this to anyone who has naturally long lashes.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are super long.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes super long with just an application or two and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of trial and error, I still can&#x27;t seem to get a consistent effect out of this mascara.</li>
            <li>Black color was fine.</li>
            <li>the other hand delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Although if you err towards the natural look or like a bit of volume, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>the mascara seems old.</li>
            <li>and I frequently get compliments on my eyelashes when I wear this.</li>
            <li>Some people complain that the wand is flimsy, butI disagree completely.</li>
            <li>Also adds volume, but not *heavy* thickening.</li>
            <li>I tried so many premium brands and they are far behind this product.</li>
            <li>It elongates your lashes like no other mascara.</li>
            <li>I roll behind my lashes to give a more lengthy look.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical to try this product after using &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; for a year, but let&#x27;s be honest, who likes paying $20+ for a tube of mascara?  </li>
            <li>So, after much internet research, I decided to take a chance on this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Telescopic mascara in blackest black.  </li>

            <li> So, after much internet research, I decided to take a chance on this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Telescopic mascara in blackest black.  </li>
            <li> the mascara on pretty thick,</li>
            <li> I have fairly long lashes to begin with, so I didn&#x27;t need anything that performs miracles.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes, and for about a year now, I have been spending over $20 on Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I LOVE L&#x27;Oreal Paris Telescopic mascara and won&#x27;t be buying expensive mascara anymore!  </li>
            <li> They make my eyelashes look very long</li>
            <li> Lashes are very long with a minimum of clumping.  </li>
            <li> the mascara seemed a bit dry.</li>
            <li> when i curled them and apply after they went back down.</li>
            <li> The wand is a little smaller and actually a little bit stiffer than Benefit&#x27;s, which I actually like.  </li>
            <li> It is crappy, my eyelashes are very thin and light colored, this did nothing for them and splattered black marks all over my face every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> Afterall, if I didn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;d only be wasting a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now, and I have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money, I ended up getting my YSL from sephora in the end.</li>
            <li> I basically couldn&#x27;t use it any more because the tip of the wand was so bendy :(</li>
            <li> I bought this because another reviewer had compared it to YSL which is my go-to but pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> It goes on very wet and coats the lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark, and separates and lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li> I found this a very wet formula, which I don&#x27;t mind except it was a mess and got in my eye, which burned.</li>
            <li> the brush is thin and reaches all the lashes, even the tiny ones.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve spent over $100 in the past year on mascara when I could have been buying this!  </li>
            <li> The color is very black.  </li>
            <li> Girls if you&#x27;ve been searching for the lengthening mascara, this little guy is everything you want!</li>
            <li> I use a little cold cream with a tissue when necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always getting asked if my eyelashes are fake because of how long this mascara makes them look</li>
            <li> I feel like an idiot for paying so much for high-end mascara when I could have been buying this all along.  </li>
            <li> , I wiggled it at the base of my lashes and ran it up, through the entire set of lashes.</li>
            <li> Thin brush makes it easier to not get mascara on lid.</li>
            <li> and i hate the wand.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first but after a week or so it is much better with beautiful results.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara. Coats very well and doesn&#x27;t take forever to put on. I use an eyelash curler and it is important to have a mascara that will curl and stay through the day. This is perfect!</li>
            <li> Girls if you&#x27;ve been searching for the lengthening mascara, this little guy is everything you want! Although if you err towards the natural look or like a bit of volume, this may not be for you. The wand and it&#x27;s lack of bristles layers the mascara on pretty thick, but if you do it with a careful, light hand you may end of with your best lashes yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three years now and I love it. They make my eyelashes look very long and there&#x27;s never any clumps. I&#x27;m always getting asked if my eyelashes are fake because of how long this mascara makes them look and I&#x27;m always getting compliments. If that&#x27;s what your looking for then I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Im rating this product solely on the price, as I am a man and have no use for mascara (not even on the weekends)</li>
            <li> After several weeks of trial and error, I still can&#x27;t seem to get a consistent effect out of this mascara. I sometimes get the &amp;#34;super long and defined&amp;#34; lashes that everyone else gets but most of the time, the brush just deposits wayyy too much product on my eyelashes. Even with a quick wipe on a tissue, the brush seems to glob product on my lashes. Maybe good for people with fuller lashes but mine are too sparse for this. Black color was fine. Didn&#x27;t flake or smudge.</li>
            <li> I normally really like L&#x27;oreal mascaras and purchased this one on a recommendation from Beauty Bybel, it is her favorite and she has beautiful lashes, even without falsies. I found this a very wet formula, which I don&#x27;t mind except it was a mess and got in my eye, which burned. I won&#x27;t use it again, but had compliments on it when I used it the one time :)</li>
            <li> I bought this brilliant telescopic mascara for my 14 years old daughter, my 21 years old niece, for myself and my 73 years old mother .. we are loving it ! currently I am waiting for my second order, just need to have spare with me ..</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing this again! I initially did not like it, because I put it on like I would any mascara, I wiggled it at the base of my lashes and ran it up, through the entire set of lashes. This made my eyelashes really clumpy, which I didn&#x27;t like. I tried again and just ran it through my lashes; applying only 2 coats. It is perfect now. It&#x27;s dark, and separates and lengthens my lashes. Does not do too much for thickening. I have fairly long lashes to begin with, so I didn&#x27;t need anything that performs miracles.</li>
            <li> Brand new, better price. Why wouldn&#x27;t you buy it here? Thin brush makes it easier to not get mascara on lid. I roll behind my lashes to give a more lengthy look.</li>
            <li> Lengthens AND separates. Love it.</li>
            <li> The reviews are right. Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It elongates your lashes like no other mascara.</li>
            <li> i always use this mascara and decided ot order it off amazon. the mascara seems old. upon opening it and with the first use it was like i was at the end of it&#x27;s use. the mascara seemed a bit dry. i didn&#x27;t look to see if threre was a date on the package but i would bet it was expired. i was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;on the other hand delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this mascara it has a dark pigment and it stays put with no flaking or pulling the only flaw with this product is the wand it&#x27;s on the small side other than that it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best mascara it makes my lashes sooooo long from the first coat. After I apply a second cote it looks like I used the 3d fiber lashes mascara. Amazing product and very good price</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw this girl on YouTube saying it was so good and made your eyelashes look longer and bigger but for me it did not work at all. when i curled them and apply after they went back down.</li>
            <li> Happy with product! ðŸ˜ƒ Brand new packaging!</li>
            <li> Simply the best mascara.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best mascara i&#x27;ve ever used.  I love it!  the brush is thin and reaches all the lashes, even the tiny ones.  I would definitely buy this again!  Stays on and doesn&#x27;t smear.  wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I have used tons of named brand mascaras that were double and triple the price of this and this is by far the best I have used. My lashes are super long.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara! Coats lashes really nicely and I frequently get compliments on my eyelashes when I wear this.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  It thickens and lengthens.  The brush is all plastic, but it coats very well.  Better then brushes.</li>
            <li> FINALLY found a mascara I like!</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes, and for about a year now, I have been spending over $20 on Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real mascara because it provides me with even more length/lashes curl upward more, it seperates my lashes, and makes them look thicker without being clumpy.  The special thing about this mascara, in my opinion, is the brush.  It isn&#x27;t soft and &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; like most mascara wands; it is actually a harder brush that is made out of plastic.  I think that plays a big role in making my lashes look great, even more so than the actual formula.  I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical to try this product after using &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; for a year, but let&#x27;s be honest, who likes paying $20+ for a tube of mascara?  Not me, because all that makeup starts adding up QUICKLY!  So, after much internet research, I decided to take a chance on this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Telescopic mascara in blackest black.  Afterall, if I didn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;d only be wasting a few bucks.  Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you that this mascara is just as good (if not better) as &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; mascara!  I have been using it for a week now, and I have absolutely no complaints.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve spent over $100 in the past year on mascara when I could have been buying this!  It provides me with the same length, thicker apperance, and seperation that Benefit&#x27;s mascara does!  The wand is a little smaller and actually a little bit stiffer than Benefit&#x27;s, which I actually like.  Some people complain that the wand is flimsy, butI disagree completely. All I can say is that I LOVE L&#x27;Oreal Paris Telescopic mascara and won&#x27;t be buying expensive mascara anymore!  I feel like an idiot for paying so much for high-end mascara when I could have been buying this all along.  I would most definitely recommend this to anyone who has naturally long lashes.  I am not sure if someone with shorter lashes would get the same great results that I&#x27;ve experienced; they may be better off with a mascara geared more towardvolume, rather than seperation/length.  Overall, I say give this mascara a shot because it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, I&#x27;ve been searching for a good mascara every since I started wearing make up.  I will never buy anything else!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!  It makes my lashes super long with just an application or two and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, but the wand is so fragile that it bends really easily. I basically couldn&#x27;t use it any more because the tip of the wand was so bendy :(</li>
            <li> I bought this because another reviewer had compared it to YSL which is my go-to but pretty expensive. I will say this is nothing like YSL. It is crappy, my eyelashes are very thin and light colored, this did nothing for them and splattered black marks all over my face every time I put it on. It was a total waste of money, I ended up getting my YSL from sephora in the end.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially for the price.  The color is very black.  Lashes are very long with a minimum of clumping.  The applicator wand does not allow too much product on the lashes.  This mascara does not smudge and dries quickly.  The product washes off in the shower with soap and water and does not leave raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Amazing product I only buy this mascara now I tried so many premium brands and they are far behind this product. Great brush and good quality mascara itself works perfectly I have long lashes and good volume. My friends always ask me what I use.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have tried. Catches even the smallest lash</li>
            <li> It worked great. Was more than I expected. I will surely buy this product again. I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years-and it&#x27;s always performed beautifully.  If what you seek is lengthening, this is the one. Also adds volume, but not *heavy* thickening. No clumping, and I have never had raccoon eyes at the end of the day. Great colors and washes off easily. I use a little cold cream with a tissue when necessary. I will never switch, and I&#x27;ve tried most of the top rated Sephora/Department store brand on the market over the years--I just got tired of spending all that money. It&#x27;s just not necessary. L&#x27;Oreal makes high quality mascara. This is my go-to, but they have others that are excellent as well if you seek more volumizing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smear and last all day. Better than several much more costly brands. And the packaging is cool, the wand stays clean and not overloaded with marcara.</li>
            <li> i got no length and i hate the wand. It goes on very wet and coats the lashes. that&#x27;s about it, very dissapointed</li>
