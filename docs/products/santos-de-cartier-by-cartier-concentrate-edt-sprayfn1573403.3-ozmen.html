            <li>fantastic price and great on arrival.</li>
            <li>My father was not too thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>He told me that he&#x27;s had many compliments from men and women over the years from this</li>
            <li>love both.</li>
            <li>You would not believe the many compliments I have received when wearing this scent.</li>
            <li>LOVE this scent.  </li>
            <li>in a concentrate, and the one I receive the most compliments wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Santos has been my choice for 30 years (or more).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i am sooo glad to have received this item</li>
            <li>good product meets our expectations, arrived on time and is what the provider advertises, good price, carries out further purchases with you</li>
            <li>and I was curious as to how awesome it was.</li>
            <li>Has a unique smell I use it regularly great price double the price @</li>
            <li>for everybody... woodsy and strong aroma that has true distinction among fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL  SANTOS DE CARTIER CONCENTRATED PERFUME</li>
            <li>One of the most classic scents for men.</li>
            <li>Usually I have always had a good experience with Amazon ! ,, but this time I do not believe</li>
            <li>Overall, nice perfume.</li>
            <li>Vwry liked by the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>so&lt;br /&gt;it even has some kind of a different scent to it.</li>
            <li>He said that the smell wore off right away.  </li>
            <li>for 30 years I am using Santos and will never find anything like it although I have more than 2 dozens different brands at any given point.</li>
            <li>Cartier has never failed and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>classic and extraordinary value</li>
            <li>For a more defined and longer lasting flavor I use the concentrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oui oui!  This scent absolutely brings out the animal in the women that are in the midst of the magical and mysterious fragrance.......</li>
            <li>Was not as expected from a famous brand.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I mean, he wore it for a good 16 hours</li>
            <li>I was kind of embarresed : /</li>
            <li>It was only 1/4 full.</li>
            <li>a defect.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is great, just be wary.</li>
            <li>Very masculine, very stable, lasting perfume.</li>
            <li>This is not the same concentrate as I normally purchase from Neimans.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely disappointed with my purchase this time since the fixative is the most important thing in a lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to old Cartier.</li>

            <li> this product is one of finest and satisfing, I have come across. I will recommend it  to anyone looking for a good quality of perfume. JG.</li>
            <li> fantastic price and great on arrival.</li>
            <li> for 30 years I am using Santos and will never find anything like it although I have more than 2 dozens different brands at any given point.</li>
            <li> This was NOT the CONCENTRATE as it was pictured and stated when we ordered.  It was still Santos de Cartier , but not the one we wanted. Very disappointed .</li>
            <li> Cartier has never failed and this is no exception.  Excellent product, very nice to wear.  A must have if Cartier is your line!</li>
            <li> This is not the same concentrate as I normally purchase from Neimans.  Not the same quantity of &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Has a unique smell I use it regularly great price double the price @ Niemans about the only place I found it!</li>
            <li> Oui oui!  This scent absolutely brings out the animal in the women that are in the midst of the magical and mysterious fragrance.......Santos is a winner!</li>
            <li> THE PRICE OF THE PERFUME WAS GREAT</li>
            <li> classic and extraordinary value</li>
            <li> Was not as expected from a famous brand. I&#x27;ll go back to old Cartier. Overall, nice perfume.</li>
            <li> My father was not too thrilled with this product.  He said that the smell wore off right away.  It wasn&#x27;t as concentrated as the Eau de Cartier.  I was kind of embarresed : /</li>
            <li> Not Concentrate but Eau De Toilette, no response from Seller.</li>
            <li> My nose caught the scent of a great smelling cologne from a gentleman passing by. I asked him what the name was of the cologne he had on and was told Santos. He told me that he&#x27;s had many compliments from men and women over the years from this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing he didn&#x27;t tell me was that there were two different flavors. One was concentrate and the other was regular. So, I bought both. I found that the concentrate lasted longer. They were similar in their scent, yet slightly different. If I want a lighter scent then I use the regular. For a more defined and longer lasting flavor I use the concentrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love both.</li>
            <li> Rip Off. It was only 1/4 full.</li>
            <li> Long time ago I have wear this item. Before I order it, I have known that this perfume is one of the scent that I know, and very famous too.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!!! I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t have to pay Mall prices for this cologne!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very masculine, very stable, lasting perfume. Vwry liked by the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> I just recieved the cologne !! the bottle looks totlly different than what is shown in the image !! it was sealed and everything but it is not the Santos Concentrate I am used to. Usually I have always had a good experience with Amazon ! ,, but this time I do not believe so&lt;br /&gt;it even has some kind of a different scent to it. had they just posted the actual image of it,, I would have not ordered it. It is not the genuine one !! I thought I got a good deal but ,,,,!!!!  Disappointed ,, I does not even say CONCENTRATE on the bottle like in the image!!! I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used. You would not believe the many compliments I have received when wearing this scent. Takes very little to last and last.</li>
            <li> wonderful fragrance&lt;br /&gt;not for everybody... woodsy and strong aroma that has true distinction among fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I AM SORRY, BUT I RECIEVED A FAKE PERFUME - IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL  SANTOS DE CARTIER CONCENTRATED PERFUME THAT  I ORDERED!</li>
            <li> We are dancers and get to smell lots of different colognes on men every weekend.  When I asked a gentleman what this scent was, I bought it immediately for my husband.  Now the poor man has my nose in his neck all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this scent.  I can not get enough of smelling this on my husband.</li>
            <li> in a concentrate, and the one I receive the most compliments wearing it.  The price is considered a steal compared to store retail</li>
            <li> Santos has been my choice for 30 years (or more).  The best I&#x27;ve ever worn.  And often complemented on my choice.</li>
            <li> I bought from this company before and I got an excellent product. This time I purchased 2 of these, one for me and another for a gift, and at least one has its fixative all gone so the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as usual. This is the \\&quot;Concentrate\\&quot; version but because of the fixative all gone doesn&#x27;t last as it should be. I&#x27;m completely disappointed with my purchase this time since the fixative is the most important thing in a lotion.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite cologne and it was sold at a great price&lt;br /&gt;i am sooo glad to have received this item</li>
            <li> Very manly and great fragrance smell very good  definitely concentrated so you use a lot less  came on time and it is what you spect from santos de cartier</li>
            <li> So I bought this Perfume on a friend&#x27;s referral. He was wearing it and I was curious as to how awesome it was. I mean, he wore it for a good 16 hours and it didn&#x27;t fade.&lt;br /&gt;So happy me decided to buy this. Now mind you that I am not middle-class; rather a mere student. I needed to work about 7 hours extra to get this perfume. Needless to say, I did. Here are the pros and cons about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:-&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Prime, AKA you get your stuff in 2 days. W00t!&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Fresh&lt;br /&gt;Great Smell&lt;br /&gt;Uses Sandlewood as base!&lt;br /&gt;AND has MUSK!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:-&lt;br /&gt;Stays on for a poor 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT Concentrate. (It&#x27;s supposed to last ATLEAST 4 hours)&lt;br /&gt;Spray nozzle broke after 30 sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:-&lt;br /&gt;Better off buying from other legit websites because the retailer either sells poor products or I got a defect.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is great, just be wary.</li>
            <li> good product meets our expectations, arrived on time and is what the provider advertises, good price, carries out further purchases with you</li>
