    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Got samples of this from the Pediatrician, and it works wonderfully on my baby.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where this cream is an excellent alternative.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for baby, why not for grown-ups too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Goes on beautifully with no tugging, and also no extraneous wiping of watery finish, and also no greasiness</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great on diaper rashes, and preventing them.</li>
            <li>Great all-purpose go-to for parents.</li>
            <li>This has been great to have on hand for my toddler&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>For what they are, I happily give them 5/5.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, if you are a parent of a child (or children) who have Eczema I would strongly advise speaking with a dermatologist if you can, if nothing else, educating oneself about this condition is one of the best ways to combat it.</li>
            <li>Probably it wouldn&#x27;t have been fair to expect it to.</li>
            <li>It feels good to the touch on his skin as well.</li>
            <li>Good cream, but do not overestimate it&#x27;s power</li>
            <li>It stops the itch and feels good going on.  </li>
            <li>and so therefore maybe it isn&#x27;t really a fair trial</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li>Very smooth on the skin also has a great smell.</li>
            <li>This version is more oily, but works great for spot treatments.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t going to magically make ones eczema disappear but it has helped a great deal with the itching at the least.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Special lotion good!</li>
            <li>This cream is incredibly soothing the moment I put it on -- I think it&#x27;s the colloidal oatmeal, which always seems to calm my tormented skin.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it&#x27;s unscented with a creamy texture.</li>
            <li>It has the nice consistency and efficacy</li>
            <li>Eucerin was a perfect replacement, as it is creamy and soaks in very well.</li>
            <li>and they seem to stop being quite as effective.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I have already accepted my “fate” and I don&#x27;t expect there is any cure to my ezcema.</li>
            <li>but I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>The tube is a nice, portable form and the flip top would make it easier to handle if you&#x27;re wrangling a squirming baby.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t recommend this as a primary eczema therapy, but for anyone who is avoiding steroids, or wanting a gentle, therapeutic cream for between steroid applications, this is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years and this is one of the most effective products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>the fact that it is so mild yet to hydrating is a huge win for us.  </li>
            <li>I keep this around for bug bite season as well; many uses beyond eczema.</li>
            <li>The product does work well but has some residue that can be challenging to deal with.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I guess the proof is in the results, and I can say for sure that there has been noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I have tried more cream than I can remember.</li>
            <li>Eucerin is more of a competition to Cerave.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li>Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief creme is perfect for those come-and-go blotches of red that appear--usually the rash or irritation is gone within hours of application.</li>
            <li>the skin and releaving the redness and more imiportantly the itching.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily and has no scent at all which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>With a primary ingredient colloidal oatmeal, this also contains many ingredients which I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li>All of us have episodes of allergic eczema, and so far both myself and my three children have tried the product with great success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite part is that it is free of fragrance and steroids.</li>
            <li>Special lotion!</li>
            <li>Special lotion!</li>
            <li>It sounds too good to be true, right?</li>
            <li>no smell and easy to rub in.  </li>
            <li>cream was easy to use, didn&#x27;t sting/burn with application like some creams do and</li>
            <li>This is a very mild formula that seems to reduce itching and provides a soothing barrier over the skin abnormalities.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing that could hurt a baby&#x27;s skin and it will stop itching very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very light mild and unscented</li>
            <li>Works great for general moisturizing and for diaper rash.</li>
            <li>the cream is smooth and easily absorbable.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has a tendency towards mild eczema, namely in patches, and this is among the better lotions and creams we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I believe if a child has a more mild case of Eczema this lotion can be of a stronger benefit.  </li>
            <li>and I believe if a child has a more mild case of Eczema this lotion can be of a stronger benefit.  </li>
            <li>Works quickly and is non greasy!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my little fella.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and also seems to soothe his itchiness somewhat</li>
            <li>Still totally worth it :)</li>
            <li>(1%).&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of these products available.  </li>
            <li>This eczema cream is nice and gentle.  </li>
            <li>The baby version is perhaps more suitable to the soft skin of babies</li>
            <li>Eucerin is a brand I&#x27;m familiar with for quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight and feels great, and I have seen results in the appearance of my eczema, which is rare too say with other products.</li>
            <li>Special lotion</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, if you are a parent of a child (or children) who have Eczema I would strongly advise speaking with a dermatologist if you can, if nothing else, educating oneself about this condition is one of the best ways to combat it.y son’s dermatologist and pediatrician both have said that they have seen worse cases of Eczema than my son’s.  </li>
            <li>Asked my husband to try it too (because I thought maybe I was making myself think the itching stopped fast), and he experienced the same relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>years, the pediatrician has recommended Aquaphor and it&#x27;s worked decently, but I always had to wrap her hands in something to make sure the oily residue didn&#x27;t ruin her clothing or the furniture.</li>
            <li>Cleared up baby&#x27;s mild eczema but not the severe patch.</li>
            <li>I am perpetually on the hunt for a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Theyare good at keeping the skin protected, but they do not stop the itch or helps with the condition in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thick and rich and smooth; feels great</li>
            <li>Love this for my new baby.  </li>
            <li>This needs to come in a larger container at a lower price per ounce for those of us with more skin surface area!</li>
            <li>I accidentally bought this Instant Relief formula, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Containing neither steroids nor fragrance, it&#x27;s better than many at relieving discomfort from dry or cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>All in all, this is an excellent product, although I would really need to sit down and do a product to product comparison to see if I think its really work the difference in cost.</li>
            <li>Eucerin products are almost all fragrance and dye free, and contain no irritating additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two Eucerin offerings have reasonable smell (in fact the body cream smells quite like Aveeno), which is important</li>
            <li>mention this because I&#x27;d like to compare the Baby Eczema Relief to the more adult oriented product.  </li>
            <li>The big difference I thought was that the Baby Relief Creme went on more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have another go to brand that we alternate with.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, if you are already seeking out for ezcema treatment, that is the last thing you want.</li>
            <li>I am an adult that has had eczema for many years.  </li>
            <li>but I thought it worth a try.  </li>
            <li>so I count it as a success</li>
            <li>After many years of trying all kinds of various products, Eucerin wins!</li>
            <li>particular product feels good on the skin, and gives almost instant relief to chapped, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I routinely get hives and rashes other than eczema and the itch fighting aspect is superior to anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used another product which contains only natural and organic ingredients and this is almost as good.</li>
            <li>As an adult who suffers from patches of eczema and dry, irritated skin, this is great to add to the arsenal for maintaining healthy and happy</li>
            <li>If we get a chance to use it in the future, I&#x27;ll post more.  </li>
            <li>One of the many things that can ameliorate Eczema is creams and topical ointments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Eucerin has oatmeal as the first.  </li>
            <li>I were in the market to look for moisturizers and if I want to use a colloidal oatmeal product, I would essentially price-compare between these and Aveeno and just buy the more affordable one.</li>
            <li>I got this to try because in addition eczema I react badly to most topical skin creams.  </li>
            <li>My son had stubborn eczema for the first 6 months.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my body just doesn&#x27;t make natural oils as readily and if I don&#x27;t keep on top of the dryness problem I can end up with chapped and even bleeding</li>
            <li>However, these two Eucerin offerings are in fact more of a direct competitor to Aveeno because their active ingredient is Colloidal Oatmeal 1%, which is a skin protectant that is also used in many Aveeno creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very good for my baby s delicate and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I put it on him once a day, and it pretty much lasts through out the day.</li>
            <li>The hope is that over time the child will grow out of it or it will become more of a minor situation as he/she ages.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>Although most do work to curb the itchiness to some extent most eczema sufferers will tell you that treatment is a LONG TERM process which means you are using lots of this stuff for a long time.  </li>
            <li>My 16 month old daughter gets really mild eczema on her legs...</li>
            <li>For mild cases of eczema, or just plain dry skin patches, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I normally use Johnson and johnsons intense moisture cream right after I bathe her.</li>
            <li>My children and I have issues with allergic eczema, and strong contact to many common products moisturizing products.</li>
            <li>I can certainly see trying the heavier creme on irritated bottoms for diaper rash if Desitin seems too much or isn&#x27;t tolerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I am an off label user, I can&#x27;t really fault Eucerin for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really has done wonders, so will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I associate with Eucerin, yet is wonderfully gentle for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I really had no idea</li>
            <li>this can really flare things up.  </li>
            <li>but it never made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not scented and there are no irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li>it seems to be gentle and soothing, and I trust the Eucerin</li>
            <li>If you have eczema, you probably know you won&#x27;t get real relief except with a steroid cream or ointment, preferably a prescription-strength one.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and emollient, and there are no ingredients like fragrance or color to set off any further irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the moisture it provides.  </li>
            <li>I found this cream to be very helpful in &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>There is no irritating fragrance and</li>
            <li>It perhaps offers less protection against harsh wind, but I think it will be perfect for when the weather warms and I don&#x27;t need the &#x27;waxy&#x27; super protection of the adult creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is regular moisturizing cream, large tube, easy to wash away after applying, nice texture, I just do  not take seriously comments about this cream resolving eczema.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told that if the first ingredient is water, it&#x27;s not going to do much for you, but almost all commercial moisturizers have water as the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li>However, sometimes steroids are not appropriate -- for example, for a child who is apt to stick hands in mouth.</li>
            <li>: it works similar to regular Aveeno Eczema cream or many others, but no way can really &amp;#34;get read of eczema&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I as really hoping this would help my seven year old son&#x27;s Eczema and it really seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>My 4-month baby had a recent flare-up of what I suspect is mild eczema on his cheeks and we tried all sorts of creams on him including his product.</li>
            <li>My older daughter (not a baby) has eczema that flares up seasonally and this cream has been wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone at any age to try.  </li>
            <li>cream is EXPENSIVE, and I am unclear why this particular formulation is better used for babies than some of the other, equally good, and much cheaper Eucerin products on the market.</li>
            <li>The perfumes added to creams is too much for my sensitive olfactory nerves to bear.</li>
            <li>My 6month old will be scratching intensely.</li>
            <li>Normally I still need a prescription product.</li>
            <li>Works - leaves yucky dry winter skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I like the baby ones because I have very sensitive skin and some over the counter products</li>
            <li>; line was one of the first I found to really work well on dry, chapped winter skin, and even the severe chapped areas of my children&#x27;s skin from irritation or rubbing along the diaper gathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also found that lotions which contain urea work well, and general cost less but sometimes have a more greasy</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and not greasy (definitely not as greasy as that white/blue bottle general Eucerin cream).  </li>
            <li>There is virtually no smell at all, and so far none of my very sensitive skinned family have had any reactions.</li>
            <li>The only thing that diminishes it quickly is steroid-based cream, which I use as sparingly as possible.</li>
            <li>but it does seem to alleviate the itching and redness well enough for my 16 month old to not notice it much.</li>
            <li>My son had some patches of eczema on his head that were clearly bothering him.</li>
            <li>It soothed the pain, but it didn&#x27;t help clear up the rash.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t clear what produces the pro ported &amp;#34;cooling effect&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>A &amp;#34;Must have&amp;#34; for anyone with a baby that has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Miraculous for a child that scratches or gets cut a frequently, often healing overnight.</li>
            <li>He will be 28 months old and he has struggled with Eczema since his birth.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I really didn’t see any change in my son’s skin after using this product for several days.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Lasts - doesn&#x27;t need frequent reapplications</li>
            <li>In addition, we all are extremely sensitive to dyes and perfumes.</li>
            <li>The two “babies” who tried this are 47 and 18 years old.  </li>
            <li>The adult version is waxier.</li>
            <li>There has been noticeable reduction in the affected area and some areas that have cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li>I used various cortisone treatments off and on for years and my skin would really start to suffer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>stuff uses natural oatmeal to curb the itching combined with a number of moisturizers and skin protectants.  </li>
            <li>is marketed for babies but as an adult eczema suffer</li>
            <li>Children and adults with sensitive skin can use this too.</li>
            <li>for the overall effect, well, I have to say that they are ok for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing that works longterm is cool, dry</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for at least light cases of exzema.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend (both the regular &amp; baby versions of the CREAM..</li>
            <li>I not only have dry skin in winter you see, but allergies year round, and the body creme was mild, non-irritating and super</li>
            <li>I do note this comes in a  5 oz tube which may useful for those with global itchy dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Relief Instant Therapy has been an overall positive experience for us.</li>
            <li>Both have little fragrance and both were mild and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin --even where it is already bumpy and irritated.  </li>
            <li>I am familiar with the Eucerin brand, but I think these are their newer offerings since in the past</li>
            <li>During the winter --particularly THIS long winter which seems like it</li>
            <li>Not only did this help to clear my sons eczema</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use this as a full body moisturizer except the volume is too small.</li>
            <li>His pediatrician recommend Eucerin and by the next morning there was a major improvement.</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that it takes more than I would anticipate (when compared with other lotions and creams) to relieve the dryness, but the result is long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Our daughter is under 2 years old and has had some minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Applying this consistently for a few days when there is a flare-up seems to take care of the issue.</li>
            <li>Personally I prefer the body cream since I don&#x27;t like thick creams, but it is true that the body cream wears off faster since it is thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Got samples of this from the Pediatrician, and it works wonderfully on my baby.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where this cream is an excellent alternative.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for baby, why not for grown-ups too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Goes on beautifully with no tugging, and also no extraneous wiping of watery finish, and also no greasiness</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great on diaper rashes, and preventing them.</li>
            <li> Great all-purpose go-to for parents.</li>
            <li> This has been great to have on hand for my toddler&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li> For what they are, I happily give them 5/5.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, if you are a parent of a child (or children) who have Eczema I would strongly advise speaking with a dermatologist if you can, if nothing else, educating oneself about this condition is one of the best ways to combat it.</li>
            <li> Probably it wouldn&#x27;t have been fair to expect it to.</li>
            <li> It feels good to the touch on his skin as well.</li>
            <li> Good cream, but do not overestimate it&#x27;s power</li>
            <li> It stops the itch and feels good going on.  </li>
            <li> and so therefore maybe it isn&#x27;t really a fair trial</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li> Very smooth on the skin also has a great smell.</li>
            <li> This version is more oily, but works great for spot treatments.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t going to magically make ones eczema disappear but it has helped a great deal with the itching at the least.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Special lotion good!</li>
            <li> This cream is incredibly soothing the moment I put it on -- I think it&#x27;s the colloidal oatmeal, which always seems to calm my tormented skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it&#x27;s unscented with a creamy texture.</li>
            <li> It has the nice consistency and efficacy</li>
            <li> Eucerin was a perfect replacement, as it is creamy and soaks in very well.</li>
            <li> and they seem to stop being quite as effective.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I have already accepted my “fate” and I don&#x27;t expect there is any cure to my ezcema.</li>
            <li> but I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> The tube is a nice, portable form and the flip top would make it easier to handle if you&#x27;re wrangling a squirming baby.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend this as a primary eczema therapy, but for anyone who is avoiding steroids, or wanting a gentle, therapeutic cream for between steroid applications, this is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years and this is one of the most effective products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> the fact that it is so mild yet to hydrating is a huge win for us.  </li>
            <li> I keep this around for bug bite season as well; many uses beyond eczema.</li>
            <li> The product does work well but has some residue that can be challenging to deal with.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I guess the proof is in the results, and I can say for sure that there has been noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I have tried more cream than I can remember.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is more of a competition to Cerave.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li> Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief creme is perfect for those come-and-go blotches of red that appear--usually the rash or irritation is gone within hours of application.</li>
            <li> the skin and releaving the redness and more imiportantly the itching.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It goes on very easily and has no scent at all which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> With a primary ingredient colloidal oatmeal, this also contains many ingredients which I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li> All of us have episodes of allergic eczema, and so far both myself and my three children have tried the product with great success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> favorite part is that it is free of fragrance and steroids.</li>
            <li> Special lotion!</li>
            <li> Special lotion!</li>
            <li> It sounds too good to be true, right?</li>
            <li> no smell and easy to rub in.  </li>
            <li> cream was easy to use, didn&#x27;t sting/burn with application like some creams do and</li>
            <li> This is a very mild formula that seems to reduce itching and provides a soothing barrier over the skin abnormalities.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing that could hurt a baby&#x27;s skin and it will stop itching very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very light mild and unscented</li>
            <li> Works great for general moisturizing and for diaper rash.</li>
            <li> the cream is smooth and easily absorbable.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has a tendency towards mild eczema, namely in patches, and this is among the better lotions and creams we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I believe if a child has a more mild case of Eczema this lotion can be of a stronger benefit.  </li>
            <li> and I believe if a child has a more mild case of Eczema this lotion can be of a stronger benefit.  </li>
            <li> Works quickly and is non greasy!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my little fella.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and also seems to soothe his itchiness somewhat</li>
            <li> Still totally worth it :)</li>
            <li> (1%).&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of these products available.  </li>
            <li> This eczema cream is nice and gentle.  </li>
            <li> The baby version is perhaps more suitable to the soft skin of babies</li>
            <li> Eucerin is a brand I&#x27;m familiar with for quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight and feels great, and I have seen results in the appearance of my eczema, which is rare too say with other products.</li>
            <li> Special lotion</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, if you are a parent of a child (or children) who have Eczema I would strongly advise speaking with a dermatologist if you can, if nothing else, educating oneself about this condition is one of the best ways to combat it.y son’s dermatologist and pediatrician both have said that they have seen worse cases of Eczema than my son’s.  </li>
            <li> Asked my husband to try it too (because I thought maybe I was making myself think the itching stopped fast), and he experienced the same relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> years, the pediatrician has recommended Aquaphor and it&#x27;s worked decently, but I always had to wrap her hands in something to make sure the oily residue didn&#x27;t ruin her clothing or the furniture.</li>
            <li> Cleared up baby&#x27;s mild eczema but not the severe patch.</li>
            <li> I am perpetually on the hunt for a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Theyare good at keeping the skin protected, but they do not stop the itch or helps with the condition in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thick and rich and smooth; feels great</li>
            <li> Love this for my new baby.  </li>
            <li> This needs to come in a larger container at a lower price per ounce for those of us with more skin surface area!</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought this Instant Relief formula, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Containing neither steroids nor fragrance, it&#x27;s better than many at relieving discomfort from dry or cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> All in all, this is an excellent product, although I would really need to sit down and do a product to product comparison to see if I think its really work the difference in cost.</li>
            <li> Eucerin products are almost all fragrance and dye free, and contain no irritating additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two Eucerin offerings have reasonable smell (in fact the body cream smells quite like Aveeno), which is important</li>
            <li> mention this because I&#x27;d like to compare the Baby Eczema Relief to the more adult oriented product.  </li>
            <li> The big difference I thought was that the Baby Relief Creme went on more smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have another go to brand that we alternate with.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, if you are already seeking out for ezcema treatment, that is the last thing you want.</li>
            <li> I am an adult that has had eczema for many years.  </li>
            <li> but I thought it worth a try.  </li>
            <li> so I count it as a success</li>
            <li> After many years of trying all kinds of various products, Eucerin wins!</li>
            <li> particular product feels good on the skin, and gives almost instant relief to chapped, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I routinely get hives and rashes other than eczema and the itch fighting aspect is superior to anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used another product which contains only natural and organic ingredients and this is almost as good.</li>
            <li> As an adult who suffers from patches of eczema and dry, irritated skin, this is great to add to the arsenal for maintaining healthy and happy</li>
            <li> If we get a chance to use it in the future, I&#x27;ll post more.  </li>
            <li> One of the many things that can ameliorate Eczema is creams and topical ointments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Eucerin has oatmeal as the first.  </li>
            <li> I were in the market to look for moisturizers and if I want to use a colloidal oatmeal product, I would essentially price-compare between these and Aveeno and just buy the more affordable one.</li>
            <li> I got this to try because in addition eczema I react badly to most topical skin creams.  </li>
            <li> My son had stubborn eczema for the first 6 months.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my body just doesn&#x27;t make natural oils as readily and if I don&#x27;t keep on top of the dryness problem I can end up with chapped and even bleeding</li>
            <li> However, these two Eucerin offerings are in fact more of a direct competitor to Aveeno because their active ingredient is Colloidal Oatmeal 1%, which is a skin protectant that is also used in many Aveeno creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very good for my baby s delicate and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on him once a day, and it pretty much lasts through out the day.</li>
            <li> The hope is that over time the child will grow out of it or it will become more of a minor situation as he/she ages.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Although most do work to curb the itchiness to some extent most eczema sufferers will tell you that treatment is a LONG TERM process which means you are using lots of this stuff for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My 16 month old daughter gets really mild eczema on her legs...</li>
            <li> For mild cases of eczema, or just plain dry skin patches, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I normally use Johnson and johnsons intense moisture cream right after I bathe her.</li>
            <li> My children and I have issues with allergic eczema, and strong contact to many common products moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> I can certainly see trying the heavier creme on irritated bottoms for diaper rash if Desitin seems too much or isn&#x27;t tolerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I am an off label user, I can&#x27;t really fault Eucerin for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really has done wonders, so will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I associate with Eucerin, yet is wonderfully gentle for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I really had no idea</li>
            <li> this can really flare things up.  </li>
            <li> but it never made much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not scented and there are no irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> it seems to be gentle and soothing, and I trust the Eucerin</li>
            <li> If you have eczema, you probably know you won&#x27;t get real relief except with a steroid cream or ointment, preferably a prescription-strength one.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and emollient, and there are no ingredients like fragrance or color to set off any further irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the moisture it provides.  </li>
            <li> I found this cream to be very helpful in &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There is no irritating fragrance and</li>
            <li> It perhaps offers less protection against harsh wind, but I think it will be perfect for when the weather warms and I don&#x27;t need the &#x27;waxy&#x27; super protection of the adult creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is regular moisturizing cream, large tube, easy to wash away after applying, nice texture, I just do  not take seriously comments about this cream resolving eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that if the first ingredient is water, it&#x27;s not going to do much for you, but almost all commercial moisturizers have water as the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li> However, sometimes steroids are not appropriate -- for example, for a child who is apt to stick hands in mouth.</li>
            <li> : it works similar to regular Aveeno Eczema cream or many others, but no way can really &amp;#34;get read of eczema&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I as really hoping this would help my seven year old son&#x27;s Eczema and it really seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> My 4-month baby had a recent flare-up of what I suspect is mild eczema on his cheeks and we tried all sorts of creams on him including his product.</li>
            <li> My older daughter (not a baby) has eczema that flares up seasonally and this cream has been wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone at any age to try.  </li>
            <li> cream is EXPENSIVE, and I am unclear why this particular formulation is better used for babies than some of the other, equally good, and much cheaper Eucerin products on the market.</li>
            <li> The perfumes added to creams is too much for my sensitive olfactory nerves to bear.</li>
            <li> My 6month old will be scratching intensely.</li>
            <li> Normally I still need a prescription product.</li>
            <li> Works - leaves yucky dry winter skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I like the baby ones because I have very sensitive skin and some over the counter products</li>
            <li> ; line was one of the first I found to really work well on dry, chapped winter skin, and even the severe chapped areas of my children&#x27;s skin from irritation or rubbing along the diaper gathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also found that lotions which contain urea work well, and general cost less but sometimes have a more greasy</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and not greasy (definitely not as greasy as that white/blue bottle general Eucerin cream).  </li>
            <li> There is virtually no smell at all, and so far none of my very sensitive skinned family have had any reactions.</li>
            <li> The only thing that diminishes it quickly is steroid-based cream, which I use as sparingly as possible.</li>
            <li> but it does seem to alleviate the itching and redness well enough for my 16 month old to not notice it much.</li>
            <li> My son had some patches of eczema on his head that were clearly bothering him.</li>
            <li> It soothed the pain, but it didn&#x27;t help clear up the rash.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t clear what produces the pro ported &amp;#34;cooling effect&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;Must have&amp;#34; for anyone with a baby that has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Miraculous for a child that scratches or gets cut a frequently, often healing overnight.</li>
            <li> He will be 28 months old and he has struggled with Eczema since his birth.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I really didn’t see any change in my son’s skin after using this product for several days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Lasts - doesn&#x27;t need frequent reapplications</li>
            <li> In addition, we all are extremely sensitive to dyes and perfumes.</li>
            <li> The two “babies” who tried this are 47 and 18 years old.  </li>
            <li> The adult version is waxier.</li>
            <li> There has been noticeable reduction in the affected area and some areas that have cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li> I used various cortisone treatments off and on for years and my skin would really start to suffer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> stuff uses natural oatmeal to curb the itching combined with a number of moisturizers and skin protectants.  </li>
            <li> is marketed for babies but as an adult eczema suffer</li>
            <li> Children and adults with sensitive skin can use this too.</li>
            <li> for the overall effect, well, I have to say that they are ok for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that works longterm is cool, dry</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for at least light cases of exzema.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend (both the regular &amp; baby versions of the CREAM..</li>
            <li> I not only have dry skin in winter you see, but allergies year round, and the body creme was mild, non-irritating and super</li>
            <li> I do note this comes in a  5 oz tube which may useful for those with global itchy dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Relief Instant Therapy has been an overall positive experience for us.</li>
            <li> Both have little fragrance and both were mild and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin --even where it is already bumpy and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I am familiar with the Eucerin brand, but I think these are their newer offerings since in the past</li>
            <li> During the winter --particularly THIS long winter which seems like it</li>
            <li> Not only did this help to clear my sons eczema</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use this as a full body moisturizer except the volume is too small.</li>
            <li> His pediatrician recommend Eucerin and by the next morning there was a major improvement.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it takes more than I would anticipate (when compared with other lotions and creams) to relieve the dryness, but the result is long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Our daughter is under 2 years old and has had some minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Applying this consistently for a few days when there is a flare-up seems to take care of the issue.</li>
            <li> Personally I prefer the body cream since I don&#x27;t like thick creams, but it is true that the body cream wears off faster since it is thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it spread well over his whole body with a small amount.</li>
            <li> This becomes somewhat concerning especially when one is using the cortisone treatments over long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> My son has dry, red cheeks on his face.</li>
            <li> His dry, red cheeks are gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say I used it on his face near his mouth, he later had green , mucus-ey stool.</li>
            <li> but I do have life long struggles with eczema.</li>
            <li> I would also add that Eczema is a very tricky and frustrating medical condition and no two babies are going to respond the same to it.  </li>
            <li> would say this lotion allowed my son’s skin to not become worse, if I had to provide an educated guess towards the worth of this product.  </li>
            <li> Ceramide-3  (a lipid or fat)  which helps retain moisture is apparently added because those who have eczema have less of it.</li>
            <li> My son was born with sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve tried many products--both conventional and homeopathic--on his seemingly endless parade of random blotches, rashes, and otherwise mysterious skin irritations.</li>
            <li> but it probably doesn&#x27;t actually have the &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; properties to restore the skin layer..which is why I used it in conjunction with other creams for helping eczema.</li>
            <li> In other words, the body cream creates a thinner moisture barrier, whereas the latter creates a thicker barrier.</li>
            <li> The percent concentration of colloidal oatmeal is the same as other OTC products with colloidal oatmeal marketed to adults and others</li>
            <li> I might have stolen a bit for myself, too, to help with dry, cracked winter skin.</li>
            <li> It is a condition of the skin, in which the skin becomes extremely dry, resulting in itching and rubbing to the point where the skin cracks and bleeds.  </li>
            <li> Worked well on my boy&#x27;s rashy dry patches.  </li>
            <li> My baby nephew has dry peeling skin and this helped his skin a lot.  </li>
            <li> This is so soothing to dry, scaly skin (eczema).</li>
            <li> My baby had chronic dry skin during the winter.  </li>
            <li> only difference between the two Eucerin offerings here is their thickness but NOT their concentration (both list the active ingredient at 1%).</li>
            <li> His skin did not become any worse, yet did not improve beyond the way his skin looked before the first application of this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since they have the same active ingredient, there is really no significant difference in their performance in my experience with them over the last month.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a pretty bad rash on my knee, and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Especially during the winter, he has a lot of little patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li> He has a prescription ointment for serious eczema breakouts (usually due to heat waves), but I avoid using it unless absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LINE:&lt;br /&gt;Works fabulously on very dry flaking skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heat-generated, and virtually impossible to keep her arms free of red, itchy patches in summer--which of course we have plenty of.</li>
            <li> Both the Eczema Relief CREAM and the Baby version of the Eczema relief Cream give almost instant temporary relief to our little one.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who is not familiar with Eczema, allow me to provide a short primer.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve been using this cream on my rough elbows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, not stinging, even on broken skin.</li>
            <li> We typically use a competitor&#x27;s brand but find that too long with any</li>
            <li> The following happened a few days ago:&lt;br /&gt;SON: Mommy, itchy itchy!</li>
            <li> It does not leave the skin sticky, overly shiny or greasy as other creams are.  </li>
            <li> The cream seems to work well, and quickly, and give almost instant relief and clears up the dry, painful skin in a few applications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up the two unfamiliar active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I find that it breaks that itch urge almost immediately and allows me to focus on something more productive than an annoying itch.</li>
            <li> Not super thick like the regular eucerin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and already my sons skin has improved!!</li>
            <li> Not as sticky as some of the other brands!</li>
            <li> the small package enabled me to keep it in my purse for times her dry skin got itchy while we were out and about.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it didnt  work for my baby ezcema.</li>
            <li> My 16 month old daughter gets really mild eczema on her legs...a few spots here and there. I normally use Johnson and johnsons intense moisture cream right after I bathe her. It helps but I can&#x27;t miss an application. I bought Eucerin&#x27;s eczema lotion because I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, plus it says eczema relief on the bottle. Well, I used it for a week and my daughter now has the worst eczema break out. It is clearing up though, now that I&#x27;ve went back with the J&amp;J cream. But the Eucerin lotion does not work for our eczema prevention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight and feels great, and I have seen results in the appearance of my eczema, which is rare too say with other products.</li>
            <li> The safety seal was not there.. I&#x27;m definitely not gonna use that on my child. I don&#x27;t even trust it as it doesn&#x27;t have the safety seal on</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my sons Eczema. It does not take it away immediately as it is not magic but it does seem to alleviate the itching and redness well enough for my 16 month old to not notice it much. Great product.</li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;Must have&amp;#34; for anyone with a baby that has sensitive skin. Great on diaper rashes, and preventing them. Miraculous for a child that scratches or gets cut a frequently, often healing overnight.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my little fella. Especially during the winter, he has a lot of little patches of dry skin. I put it on him once a day, and it pretty much lasts through out the day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Eucerin products didn&#x27;t work too well on our little one&#x27;s eczema. Although the skin didn&#x27;t get worse we saw no improvements after using them for several days.</li>
            <li> Got samples of this from the Pediatrician, and it works wonderfully on my baby.</li>
            <li> No babies here but I do have life long struggles with eczema. I find this cream somewhat helpful with rashes and lesions, especially if I use it as soon as I feel a rash coming (I get an aura). It goes on very easily and has no scent at all which is a huge bonus. Normally I still need a prescription product. Since I am an off label user, I can&#x27;t really fault Eucerin for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say this is a terrific product to combat itching. I find that it breaks that itch urge almost immediately and allows me to focus on something more productive than an annoying itch. I routinely get hives and rashes other than eczema and the itch fighting aspect is superior to anything else I have tried. I&#x27;d use this as a full body moisturizer except the volume is too small. I do note this comes in a  5 oz tube which may useful for those with global itchy dry skin.  I keep this around for bug bite season as well; many uses beyond eczema.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from eczema, although he&#x27;s no longer a baby, I thought this product might help. Eucerin is a brand I&#x27;m familiar with for quality. I liked the fact that it&#x27;s unscented with a creamy texture. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work to relieve his symptoms, but may work well on an infant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this cream on my rough elbows. This really has done wonders, so will continue to use. Changing my rating to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll all been babies, but we all have not suffered with eczema.  Although called Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Instant Therapy, 2 Ounce, this cream is usable on human skin regardless of age.  With a primary ingredient colloidal oatmeal, this also contains many ingredients which I cannot pronounce.  Containing neither steroids nor fragrance, it&#x27;s better than many at relieving discomfort from dry or cracked skin.  This is not a medication for eczema, merely a comforting cream which does work as intended.  I&#x27;ve also used another product which contains only natural and organic ingredients and this is almost as good.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a tendency towards mild eczema, namely in patches, and this is among the better lotions and creams we&#x27;ve tried. It has the nice consistency and efficacy I associate with Eucerin, yet is wonderfully gentle for my daughter.  My one complaint is that it takes more than I would anticipate (when compared with other lotions and creams) to relieve the dryness, but the result is long-lasting.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. Works great for general moisturizing and for diaper rash. Great all-purpose go-to for parents. I might have stolen a bit for myself, too, to help with dry, cracked winter skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try on my grandson&#x27;s rash on his back.  But, by the time I got it to them, he stopped getting the rash.  We noticed that it had no scent or dye to it.  Eucerin is a well respected brand that I trust.  The cream wasn&#x27;t too thick and wasn&#x27;t greasy.  If we get a chance to use it in the future, I&#x27;ll post more.  Sorry I don&#x27;t know any more at this time.</li>
            <li> Both the Eczema Relief CREAM and the Baby version of the Eczema relief Cream give almost instant temporary relief to our little one.  Even though it&#x27;s not a permanent solution, this product gave our child the relief they needed to go to sleep without scratching and waking themselves up.  Highly recommend (both the regular &amp; baby versions of the CREAM.. FYI - Amazon currently has this product titled as lotion, but when you look at the picture, it is showing the cream.. and the cream is teh product received.)</li>
            <li> I really had no idea what Eczema was until my son was born.  He will be 28 months old and he has struggled with Eczema since his birth.  For anyone who is not familiar with Eczema, allow me to provide a short primer.  It is a condition of the skin, in which the skin becomes extremely dry, resulting in itching and rubbing to the point where the skin cracks and bleeds.  In addition, when there is radical shift in the weather, hot to cold or vice versa this can really flare things up.  In my son’s case, if he becomes stressed or vexed this will promote him to scratch and itch.  One of the many things that can ameliorate Eczema is creams and topical ointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel I must note in regards of reviewing this product, my son is under the care of a dermatologist and his pediatrician for his Eczema. Yet, I am still on a quest to find anything to aid my son’s Eczema, because the symptoms can only be controlled, not stopped.  The hope is that over time the child will grow out of it or it will become more of a minor situation as he/she ages.&lt;br /&gt;With regards to this review, I stopped using all topical creams prescription and over the counter for three days to see how this lotion would work.  The only medication my son was given while this cream by Eucerin was used was an oral prescription given by his dermatologist to reduce itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion by Eucerin is promoted on the notion that it provides relief for baby Eczema.  I have to say that I really didn’t see any change in my son’s skin after using this product for several days.  His skin did not become any worse, yet did not improve beyond the way his skin looked before the first application of this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this lotion allowed my son’s skin to not become worse, if I had to provide an educated guess towards the worth of this product.  I would also add that Eczema is a very tricky and frustrating medical condition and no two babies are going to respond the same to it.  My son’s dermatologist and pediatrician both have said that they have seen worse cases of Eczema than my son’s.  Those statements are surprising, because there are times where my son is so miserable I cannot imagine how it could be any worse than it already is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, it could be possible that my son’s Eczema is beyond point of where this over the counter lotion can aid him.  However, I do believe that it helped maintain his skin for a few days and I believe if a child has a more mild case of Eczema this lotion can be of a stronger benefit.  Nevertheless, if you are a parent of a child (or children) who have Eczema I would strongly advise speaking with a dermatologist if you can, if nothing else, educating oneself about this condition is one of the best ways to combat it.y son’s dermatologist and pediatrician both have said that they have seen worse cases of Eczema than my son’s.

            <li> Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Instant Therapy has been an overall positive experience for us. Our daughter is under 2 years old and has had some minor skin irritation. The Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Instant Therapy helped relieve her symptoms. The product does work well but has some residue that can be challenging to deal with.</li>
            <li> My babies are grown and I don&#x27;t have eczema, but I do have dry flaky nasty cracking gross middle-aged winter skin.  Yuck!  I am perpetually on the hunt for a good moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been told that if the first ingredient is water, it&#x27;s not going to do much for you, but almost all commercial moisturizers have water as the first ingredient.  This Eucerin has oatmeal as the first.  And it does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GREAT:&lt;br /&gt;+ Thick and rich and smooth; feels great (I personally don&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;cooling sensation&amp;#34; though)&lt;br /&gt;+ Goes on beautifully with no tugging, and also no extraneous wiping of watery finish, and also no greasiness&lt;br /&gt;+ Works - leaves yucky dry winter skin smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;+ Lasts - doesn&#x27;t need frequent reapplications&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;Works fabulously on very dry flaking skin.  Love.</li>
            <li> My son had some patches of eczema on his head that were clearly bothering him. I tried coconut oil multiple times a day but it never made much of a difference. His pediatrician recommend Eucerin and by the next morning there was a major improvement. It is all we use now!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Eucerin products, and this is no exception. My children and I have issues with allergic eczema, and strong contact to many common products moisturizing products. In addition, we all are extremely sensitive to dyes and perfumes. Eucerin products are almost all fragrance and dye free, and contain no irritating additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used to live in a cold, desert climate, and the skin on my hands, and my children&#x27;s hands would become dry and even bloody during the worst of the cold, dry season. After many years of trying all kinds of various products, Eucerin wins! Their &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; line was one of the first I found to really work well on dry, chapped winter skin, and even the severe chapped areas of my children&#x27;s skin from irritation or rubbing along the diaper gathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product feels good on the skin, and gives almost instant relief to chapped, irritated skin. There is virtually no smell at all, and so far none of my very sensitive skinned family have had any reactions. The cream seems to work well, and quickly, and give almost instant relief and clears up the dry, painful skin in a few applications. All of us have episodes of allergic eczema, and so far both myself and my three children have tried the product with great success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is EXPENSIVE, and I am unclear why this particular formulation is better used for babies than some of the other, equally good, and much cheaper Eucerin products on the market. All in all, this is an excellent product, although I would really need to sit down and do a product to product comparison to see if I think its really work the difference in cost.</li>
            <li> I have been using all sorts of Eucerin products over the years and have never had a bad one yet. I like the baby ones because I have very sensitive skin and some over the counter products are too harsh for my skin. Not this one. Very smooth on the skin also has a great smell. Not oily after application which is one of my number one pet peeves about these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will use in the future!</li>
            <li> It is not an overstatement for Eucerin to call this cream &amp;#34;Instant Therapy.&amp;#34; The relief you get from skin irritation is immediate. Upon application, there is a cooling sensation, and itching is instantly gone. It sounds too good to be true, right? Asked my husband to try it too (because I thought maybe I was making myself think the itching stopped fast), and he experienced the same relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is that it is free of fragrance and steroids. The perfumes added to creams is too much for my sensitive olfactory nerves to bear. And you already know the dangers of constant steroid cream use. As an adult who suffers from patches of eczema and dry, irritated skin, this is great to add to the arsenal for maintaining healthy and happy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s good for baby, why not for grown-ups too!</li>
            <li> I tried this for a pretty bad rash on my knee, and it didn&#x27;t do much. It soothed the pain, but it didn&#x27;t help clear up the rash. Probably it wouldn&#x27;t have been fair to expect it to. For mild cases of eczema, or just plain dry skin patches, this is a great product. It&#x27;s not scented and there are no irritating ingredients. Recommended.</li>
            <li> The two “babies” who tried this are 47 and 18 years old.  This stuff works.  It is expensive, but it does the job.  I have also found that lotions which contain urea work well, and general cost less but sometimes have a more greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up the two unfamiliar active ingredients.  Licochalcone is derived from licorice.  It supposedly has some antibacterial properties. Ceramide-3  (a lipid or fat)  which helps retain moisture is apparently added because those who have eczema have less of it. Oatmeal I did not need to look up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost no smell and easy to rub in.  I am not sure why this is marketed as for babies, it seems to work just as well on us grownups.  This needs to come in a larger container at a lower price per ounce for those of us with more skin surface area!</li>
            <li> During the winter --particularly THIS long winter which seems like it will never end-- I find that my skin needs serious protection.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older my body just doesn&#x27;t make natural oils as readily and if I don&#x27;t keep on top of the dryness problem I can end up with chapped and even bleeding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this I became a total convert to Eucerin&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00DEXA0LY Body Creme, Eczema Relief]].  I not only have dry skin in winter you see, but allergies year round, and the body creme was mild, non-irritating and super effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention this because I&#x27;d like to compare the Baby Eczema Relief to the more adult oriented product.  Both have little fragrance and both were mild and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin --even where it is already bumpy and irritated.  The big difference I thought was that the Baby Relief Creme went on more smoothly.  The adult version is waxier. The baby version is perhaps more suitable to the soft skin of babies --although I can certainly see trying the heavier creme on irritated bottoms for diaper rash if Desitin seems too much or isn&#x27;t tolerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product. When I put it on it immediately soothes. It perhaps offers less protection against harsh wind, but I think it will be perfect for when the weather warms and I don&#x27;t need the &#x27;waxy&#x27; super protection of the adult creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for babies and adults.</li>
            <li> I as really hoping this would help my seven year old son&#x27;s Eczema and it really seems to be working.  There has been noticeable reduction in the affected area and some areas that have cleared up completely.  I like that it seems to be gentle and soothing, and I trust the Eucerin brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess the proof is in the results, and I can say for sure that there has been noticeable improvement. I highly recommend this product for at least light cases of exzema.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and is non greasy! My sons cheeks cleared up in two days! Would recommend to anyone over aquaphor</li>
            <li> I love this product. 3 of my 4 children suffer from eczema. The worst is my 6 year old daughter who gets it so bad on her hands that the skin literally peels off between her fingers and bleeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, the pediatrician has recommended Aquaphor and it&#x27;s worked decently, but I always had to wrap her hands in something to make sure the oily residue didn&#x27;t ruin her clothing or the furniture. Eucerin was a perfect replacement, as it is creamy and soaks in very well. It cleared the eczema in half the time and I could leave her skin exposed.</li>
            <li> This has been great to have on hand for my toddler&#x27;s eczema.  We typically use a competitor&#x27;s brand but find that too long with any and they seem to stop being quite as effective.  It&#x27;s nice to have another go to brand that we alternate with.  Applying this consistently for a few days when there is a flare-up seems to take care of the issue.</li>
            <li> If you have eczema, you probably know you won&#x27;t get real relief except with a steroid cream or ointment, preferably a prescription-strength one. However, sometimes steroids are not appropriate -- for example, for a child who is apt to stick hands in mouth. That&#x27;s where this cream is an excellent alternative. My child, thank goodness, does not have eczema, but I have periodic flare-ups. This cream is incredibly soothing the moment I put it on -- I think it&#x27;s the colloidal oatmeal, which always seems to calm my tormented skin. The texture is smooth and emollient, and there are no ingredients like fragrance or color to set off any further irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this as a primary eczema therapy, but for anyone who is avoiding steroids, or wanting a gentle, therapeutic cream for between steroid applications, this is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> very good for my baby s delicate and sensitive skin. it helps preventing the dermatitis that bothers him every now and then.</li>
            <li> My 4-month baby had a recent flare-up of what I suspect is mild eczema on his cheeks and we tried all sorts of creams on him including his product. It goes on smoothly and also seems to soothe his itchiness somewhat but it probably doesn&#x27;t actually have the &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; properties to restore the skin layer..which is why I used it in conjunction with other creams for helping eczema.</li>
            <li> Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a 2oz Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Instant Therapy and a 5oz Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Body Creme for review over the last month. Since the two products are very similar, I am writing this as a joint review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not an infant. I have been an ezcema patient for over thirty years and I have tried more cream than I can remember. I am familiar with the Eucerin brand, but I think these are their newer offerings since in the past Eucerin is more of a competition to Cerave. However, these two Eucerin offerings are in fact more of a direct competitor to Aveeno because their active ingredient is Colloidal Oatmeal 1%, which is a skin protectant that is also used in many Aveeno creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they have the same active ingredient, there is really no significant difference in their performance in my experience with them over the last month. I don&#x27;t think there is any surprise here. The two Eucerin offerings have reasonable smell (in fact the body cream smells quite like Aveeno), which is important: there is no fragrance since fragrance can potentially cause unnecessary skin irritation. Honestly, if you are already seeking out for ezcema treatment, that is the last thing you want. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference between the two Eucerin offerings here is their thickness but NOT their concentration (both list the active ingredient at 1%). The body cream is thinner, while the “instant therapy” is thicker. In other words, the body cream creates a thinner moisture barrier, whereas the latter creates a thicker barrier. Personally I prefer the body cream since I don&#x27;t like thick creams, but it is true that the body cream wears off faster since it is thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the overall effect, well, I have to say that they are ok for everyday use. Honestly, I have already accepted my “fate” and I don&#x27;t expect there is any cure to my ezcema. In this regard, these Eucerin products do not disappoint. Theyare good at keeping the skin protected, but they do not stop the itch or helps with the condition in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were in the market to look for moisturizers and if I want to use a colloidal oatmeal product, I would essentially price-compare between these and Aveeno and just buy the more affordable one. For what they are, I happily give them 5/5.</li>
            <li> Worked well on my boy&#x27;s rashy dry patches.  Not super thick like the regular eucerin so it spread well over his whole body with a small amount.</li>
            <li> Cleared up baby&#x27;s mild eczema but not the severe patch.</li>
            <li> Not only did this help to clear my sons eczema but it truly is INSTANT relief therapy. My 6month old will be scratching intensely. I&#x27;ll apply this to the area and after a few moments he will stop. It feels good to the touch on his skin as well. I&#x27;ll say I used it on his face near his mouth, he later had green , mucus-ey stool. Maybe from swallowing some as he was using his teethers. Still totally worth it :)</li>
            <li> Good cream, but do not overestimate it&#x27;s power: it works similar to regular Aveeno Eczema cream or many others, but no way can really &amp;#34;get read of eczema&amp;#34;. We are using it for our son, but almost no effect - still have to use corticosteroid cream prescribed by doctor to remove the etching and inflammation. I do like this cream  -again -  this is regular moisturizing cream, large tube, easy to wash away after applying, nice texture, I just do  not take seriously comments about this cream resolving eczema.</li>
            <li> My little girl has had eczema since she was ambulatory. It&#x27;s heat-generated, and virtually impossible to keep her arms free of red, itchy patches in summer--which of course we have plenty of. We&#x27;ve tried a gluten-free diet, dairy-free, Chinese medicine. The only thing that diminishes it quickly is steroid-based cream, which I use as sparingly as possible. The ONLY thing that works longterm is cool, dry weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this cream at least keeps her skin calmer and not as itchy. The eczema doesn&#x27;t go away with the use of it, but it gives her a reprieve from its symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s not a sure thing for us, but it does bring some relief. It&#x27;s worth trying if your little one is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about this product!! Works wonders on my baby&#x27;s skin and I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and already my sons skin has improved!!</li>
            <li> My son has dry, red cheeks on his face. I was using the Eucerin Baby Eczema Body Creme, but he still had the red cheeks. I accidentally bought this Instant Relief formula, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! This version is more oily, but works great for spot treatments. His dry, red cheeks are gone! You do need to use this product periodically to control the eczema, but I go back and forth between the Body Cream and the Instant Relief on his cheeks.</li>
            <li> I am an adult that has had eczema for many years.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of stuff from OTC, Rx, various cortisone treatments.  Although most do work to curb the itchiness to some extent most eczema sufferers will tell you that treatment is a LONG TERM process which means you are using lots of this stuff for a long time.  This becomes somewhat concerning especially when one is using the cortisone treatments over long periods of time.  I used various cortisone treatments off and on for years and my skin would really start to suffer.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff uses natural oatmeal to curb the itching combined with a number of moisturizers and skin protectants.  It stops the itch and feels good going on.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness or residue behind.  It has worked as well if not better than anything else I have tried including Rx and I haven&#x27;t felt any adverse side affects with using it.  This isn&#x27;t going to magically make ones eczema disappear but it has helped a great deal with the itching at the least.&lt;br /&gt;This is marketed for babies but as an adult eczema suffer I would highly recommend this to anyone at any age to try.  The percent concentration of colloidal oatmeal is the same as other OTC products with colloidal oatmeal marketed to adults and others (1%).&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of these products available.  One is a &amp;#34;Body Creme&amp;#34; and another &amp;#34;Instant Therapy Creme&amp;#34;.  The Instant one is supposed to have a cooling affect to help with flare ups but I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference.  It isn&#x27;t clear what produces the pro ported &amp;#34;cooling effect&amp;#34;.  Stick with the Body Creme as it is cheaper per ounce.</li>
            <li> My older daughter (not a baby) has eczema that flares up seasonally and this cream has been wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- unscented&lt;br /&gt;- creamy moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;- not sticky&lt;br /&gt;- no stinging/burning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potential Improvements:&lt;br /&gt;- larger package/pump bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream was easy to use, didn&#x27;t sting/burn with application like some creams do and the small package enabled me to keep it in my purse for times her dry skin got itchy while we were out and about.  I&#x27;m not sure it &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; her eczema, but the fact that it is so mild yet to hydrating is a huge win for us.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This comes out of the tube very thick but goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Goes on evenely and smoothly&lt;br /&gt;scent not noticable&lt;br /&gt;does not burn or irritiat flaking cracked skin&lt;br /&gt;I can wash my hands 3-4 times before needing to reapply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none that I have found</li>
            <li> This is a very mild formula that seems to reduce itching and provides a soothing barrier over the skin abnormalities. It&#x27;s gentle, not stinging, even on broken skin. There&#x27;s nothing that could hurt a baby&#x27;s skin and it will stop itching very quickly. The tube is a nice, portable form and the flip top would make it easier to handle if you&#x27;re wrangling a squirming baby. Every mommy should probably have a tube of this in their diaper bag.</li>
            <li> I got this to try because in addition eczema I react badly to most topical skin creams.  Yes, I know I dont have baby skin but I thought it worth a try.  I really like the moisture it provides.  It is very light mild and unscented and I haven&#x27;t had any allergic reactions to it. It has helped a little with the eczema so I count it as a success but it wasn&#x27;t really an instant relief.  I realize I am very difficult to treat and so therefore maybe it isn&#x27;t really a fair trial but I wanted to give it a shot  Will continue to use for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My son was born with sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve tried many products--both conventional and homeopathic--on his seemingly endless parade of random blotches, rashes, and otherwise mysterious skin irritations. He has a prescription ointment for serious eczema breakouts (usually due to heat waves), but I avoid using it unless absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief creme is perfect for those come-and-go blotches of red that appear--usually the rash or irritation is gone within hours of application. However, I will let my son speak for himself, in all his 2-year-old wisdom. The following happened a few days ago:&lt;br /&gt;SON: Mommy, itchy itchy! (points to red patch on leg)&lt;br /&gt;ME: Oh no!  What should we do?&lt;br /&gt;SON: Special lotion! Special lotion! (runs off, gets tube of Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief, brings back)&lt;br /&gt;ME: (applies lotion) Is that better?&lt;br /&gt;SON: Special lotion good! Special lotion no itchy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s not a 5-star endorsement, I don&#x27;t know what is.</li>
            <li> My son had stubborn eczema for the first 6 months. This product is the only thing that I found that cleared it up!</li>
            <li> My son started having eczema as soon add her turn two months. The doctor recommended aquaphor and Vaseline but they were too oily and made his eczema worse. A friend of mine recommended this since she&#x27;s a nurse and deals with children issues all the time. Since using this cream his eczema has improved immensely. It doesn&#x27;t cure it but it helps reduce his outbreaks immediately.</li>
            <li> We are dealing with mild/medium eczema symptoms, which are aggravated by pullen allergies, exposure to the sun and various &amp;#34;outside&amp;#34; elements.  I found this cream to be very helpful in &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; the skin and releaving the redness and more imiportantly the itching.  It absorbs quickly and not greasy (definitely not as greasy as that white/blue bottle general Eucerin cream).  we use it a lot, and i would recommend it to others.  I don&#x27;t have experience with severe excema which is a constant for some kids, so I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li> This eczema cream is nice and gentle.  My baby nephew has dry peeling skin and this helped his skin a lot.  There is no irritating fragrance and the cream is smooth and easily absorbable.  It does not leave the skin sticky, overly shiny or greasy as other creams are.  Children and adults with sensitive skin can use this too.</li>
            <li> This product has been nothing short of a miracle for my skin. I thought twice about getting a &#x27;Baby&#x27; product but I&#x27;m so glad I did. This is so soothing to dry, scaly skin (eczema). This winter was pretty bad across the country and winter air, and especially indoor central heated air which is so drying and irritating to the skin. I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years and this is one of the most effective products I&#x27;ve ever used. That includes several prescription products. So if you suffer from eczema you&#x27;ve got to give this a try!</li>
            <li> Baby eczema gone in 3 days</li>
            <li> My baby had chronic dry skin during the winter.  This got rid of it in a couple of days.  No allergic reaction, just did the job.</li>
            <li> Love this for my new baby.  Not as sticky as some of the other brands!</li>
