            <li>Keeps my wife&#x27;s underarms and legs silky smooth, just like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>I tried this five blade Embrace version when it was on sale, figuring five blades would be better than just three.</li>
            <li>Love everything about these razors but the price.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite razors.</li>
            <li>Love having them brought to my door.</li>
            <li>The perfect, close shave, they last 2+ weeks, and you don&#x27;t need shaving cream!</li>
            <li>On Amazon, it&#x27;s a much better price than I can get them for in the store, and I don&#x27;t have to remember to get them every couple months.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite razors.</li>
            <li>I love the venus embrace.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is a bit better.</li>
            <li>Also, the Embrace has 5 blades so it should be better at giving a close shave.</li>
            <li>having moisture ribbons on both the top and the bottom, but whatever the reason I&#x27;m glad I found these</li>
            <li>I have used the venus embrace razor and blades for many years.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see them on Amazon at a reduced price.</li>
            <li>They know these subjects way better than</li>
            <li>I have these on auto-delivery, and love the convenience of that.</li>
            <li>I love Venus products and have used them for many years.</li>
            <li>When the Embrace came out I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave and no nicks!</li>
            <li>the price is better than any discount store...</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the convenience</li>
            <li>This is a time-saver and safe for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love how I don&#x27;t get any cuts from this blade.</li>
            <li>and I get more razor burns and in grown hair with these.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the one with the showerpod &#x27;cause it costs more plus</li>
            <li>But all in all I love this razor.</li>
            <li>There is nothing like five blades to give you a nice close, comfortable shave without any nicks or cuts!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>These are ok.  </li>
            <li>I can use them for months and still get a better shave than the 1st time using those 4 blade disposable razors.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of being able to get them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the Venus embrace.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than a four blade</li>
            <li>Love me some Venus Embrace.</li>
            <li>I love receiving the gillette razors because it saves me a trip to the store.</li>
            <li>The downfall for these sometimes the heads can feel slimy because the top and bottom part of the razors (I call them moisture bars)</li>
            <li>I have gotten more shaves from disposable razors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a ploy to get us to buy more razors.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Venus Embrace does seem to be the best product currently on the market.</li>
            <li>Two razors; aloe strips; moisture strips; rubber grips on the handle; FREE suction cup holder for the shower!</li>
            <li>I like the one with olay much better.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this razor.</li>
            <li>laser hair removal is more affordable.....</li>
            <li>Venus Embrace is magical.</li>
            <li>i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I have not managed to cut myself with these - so I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re safe as well.</li>
            <li>Of course, the cost is not 5-star, it&#x27;s more like two.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I tend to forget to buy razors when I&#x27;m at the store, and this service ensures that I always have razors available!</li>
            <li>PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-Incredibly smooth shave!</li>

            <li>After using this blade they felt more moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle.  </li>
            <li>Replacement cartridges can be pricey, but they are better priced on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the razors and all the refills.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>The next best part?</li>
            <li>I love that this razor has 5 blades.</li>
            <li>i love that you can change the blades and attach any gillette blade.</li>
            <li>Gillette has the best razors for women, and I find that one of the Venus razor handles fits all different kinds of Venus razors.</li>
            <li>I love that all Gillette Venus blades fit all the razor handles!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any stray hairs and my legs were silky smooth!</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>My wife uses them all the time and its her favorite type.</li>
            <li>The five blades are effective so you don&#x27;t have to go over and over an area to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>the Venus Spa was better in her opinion.</li>
            <li>I Love It.</li>
            <li>These are a much better price and quality.</li>
            <li>but I love the product.</li>
            <li>(Every now and then, I still swipe my husband&#x27;s - Gillette pro fusion, I think - which has a more sturdy razor and seems to give an even closer shave, but . . . .)  </li>
            <li>I get the closest shave ever, and my legs are literally smooth for days!</li>
            <li>and I feel that if you can find a better deal, why not share it with others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>these are the Top Dogs.  </li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its soo much better then</li>

            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>My legs are so smooth!  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for...</li>
            <li>I really love my Gillette Venus Razor.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love that any Venus razor head fits any Venus razor handle.</li>
            <li>The shave closeness has been okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure where I&#x27;m at just yet with this, but I&#x27;m hoping I end up liking it more.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>But okay</li>
            <li>it sure seems like I&#x27;m not needing to shave as often.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>Would have cost more to return them.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>I love the Venus Embrace razor.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the best razor out of all of the different Venus razors.  </li>
            <li>Much better value than buying at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>I love these razor blades.</li>
            <li>These razor blades are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I can even \\&quot;go cheap\\&quot; in the winter and use 3-blade razors! :)</li>
            <li>Really smooth nice shave.  </li>
            <li>I also put Epson salt and some bubble bath in my bath water before I shave and it helps even more I have noticed.  </li>
            <li>Good price on amazon, and right to my door.</li>
            <li>The lotion strips are alright, and they&#x27;re quite pleasant for the first week</li>
            <li>First two blades, then THREE!!!</li>
            <li>Great razor blades only get better by using Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li>The price is pretty good compared to the stores too.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good razors.</li>
            <li>I love these razors, do not nick and leave my legs feeling sexy and smooth (just like the commercials).  </li>
            <li>My roommate and I both have slightly different Venus razors and these razor cartridges fit both of them perfectly.</li>
            <li>Not only it does fit all gillette blades, it is also the best razor ever.  </li>
            <li>The best part is all the Venus carriage heads fit on the same ravor.  </li>
            <li>Let me first tell you that I am pregnant, and overweight so shaving legs and armpits have just become null and void lol.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about the Gillette Venus razor is that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus handle so you can find your perfect shaving match without having to purchase a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>These razors give the smoothest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I love this razor because it has a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I have to buy more of these and am glad I had bought these before as I had not remembered which ones I had gotten and liked so much.</li>
            <li>Works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample through influenster although they were already my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>Perfect, delivered just as expected.</li>
            <li>If you have 5 or more things on auto-ship, you can save 15-20%, which puts these at a substantially lower price than I pay at walmart, plus free shipping to my door every month....</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it is and doesnt nick like alot of others.</li>
            <li>I got it free from influenster.com to try, and it gave me the best dry shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I love my original Venus razor and the three blade version refills.</li>
            <li>I have tried some of the other products by Gilette and this is the best one.</li>
            <li>The razor itself isn&#x27;t perfect, as I&#x27;ve replaced 3 times due to breakage.  </li>
            <li>The other awesome thing is that all the blades that are Venus brand are interchangeable so if I find another Venus product, I can mix and match.</li>
            <li>For some reason these rust easily too.</li>
            <li>Also glides easily.</li>
            <li>It works great, love the multiple blade and soap around it, as I shave at the sink.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to replace, as well.</li>
            <li>It glides easily across the skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as easy as pushing a button!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Great quality and better price than big box store</li>
            <li>Check the internet and see that what I&#x27;m telling you is true..:)</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs silky and I especially love that any Venus razor refill fits any blade handle, this makes it so convenient to try other types of Venus products!</li>
            <li>These are definitely one of the best blades I&#x27;ve used at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>Buying these online are no doubt the cheapest price you will fine.</li>
            <li>The best part about these is that you can get them on Auto-Ship, which is one less thing you have to worry about at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a razor that is easy to use and leaves your legs feeling silky smooth than the Venus Embrace is for you...</li>
            <li>They work super well!</li>
            <li>The gel strips will be used up much more quickly and will attach themselves to the surface they are placed onto (don&#x27;t worry, not permanently).</li>
            <li>and luckily you can use them more than once</li>
            <li>Bought these for my girlfriend after reading the many positive reviews here and found that they worked better than my Merkel safety razor at shaving my face.</li>
            <li>I tried the Embrace cartridges with the very first Venus handle that ever came out!</li>
            <li>Well, a little cheaper would be awesome</li>
            <li>I was used to a three blade razor and going to the 5 blade made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but it makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Replacement razors are cheap enough so they make great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my fiancee and she wasn&#x27;t a huge fan.  </li>
            <li>The 5 blades makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>They leave skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Now I get a smooth shave and NO razor burn in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the Embrace cartridges do fit the Breeze handle, they</li>
            <li>* fit in the Breeze shower pod.  </li>
            <li>By 10 pm they are still silky smooth.</li>
            <li>These fit all Venus razors, not just the Embrace.</li>
            <li>You get a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>They know how to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Her legs end up smooth and unirritated.</li>
            <li>and she can have a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>They give a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li>but I feel like they&#x27;re cheaply made</li>
            <li>This provides a smooth, nick-free shave.</li>
            <li>They leave my legs silky smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/cut by this razor unlike the cheap disposables.</li>
            <li>Felt smooth and got the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li>Smooth, no pain, no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I only use this brand.</li>
            <li>Wife loves the razor which is a win for me obviously.  </li>
            <li>hair and these blades make my legs silky smooth everytime.</li>
            <li>and i must say this razor has made my legs so unbelievably smooth</li>
            <li>It makes shaving easier and it leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>and I have smooth legs until I have to shave again.  </li>
            <li>It runs so smooth, and I like the feel of lotion afterwords.  </li>
            <li>I received this razor blade for free through Influenster.  </li>
            <li>head of the razor is designed to avoid nicks, keep your skin soothed, and provide a smooth, super-close shave.</li>
            <li>I figured hey it is free why not try.  </li>
            <li>I like how it leaves your skin smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li>It glides over skin so smoothly</li>
            <li>Leaves my skins feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Did you know that all Venus blades fit any Venus</li>
            <li>and I feel comfortable using this razor in that area.</li>
            <li>and I have NEVER cut myself with it, which is important as I have a bleeding disorder.</li>
            <li>I recieved it for free in my Influenster VoxBox along with a sample of their Olay razor.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my legs silky smooth every time.</li>
            <li>Venus® Embrace®  is lightweight and formed to fit in a woman&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>The blades glided effortlessly over my legs, and gave me a great shave, even with several days growth.</li>
            <li>No nicks or cuts and a close smooth shave every time.  </li>
            <li>Well, I have to say that it does seem that it takes fewer passes with the razor to make my legs feel smooth</li>
            <li>So when I went to shave, it wasn&#x27;t a smooth shave</li>
            <li>They provide a close shave and will fit any Gillette razor, even men&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I received one free from influenster.com, but as I said I will keep using this product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite blades, and they really do work better than the 3 blade ones.</li>
            <li>Id love to find something more reasonable, but i won&#x27;t hold my breath.</li>
            <li>I have the most success with the Venus Original used with Aveeno Theraputic Shave Gel.</li>
            <li>very rarely do I get razor burn.  </li>
            <li>My legs are super smooth and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They leave me legs feeling smooth and freshly shaved for days!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still okay after you use it, but it doesn&#x27;t make your legs as smooth as the first time.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have loved most of the venus refills but these are my absolute favorite, especially for summer time.  </li>
            <li>Subscribe and Save gives the best price for the 4 pack compared to any store in my rural area where I live.  </li>
            <li>I never had the before with three blade original.</li>
            <li>I love that I can shave my legs at night and the following afternoon still have smooth legs!!</li>
            <li>Or did the quality just significantly decrease?</li>
            <li>When I found this razor I was really excited.</li>
            <li>So they are worth it!  </li>
            <li>I received a complimentary Gillette Venus Embrace blade from Influenster!</li>
            <li>I have always used the original blades when it comes to my venus razor...</li>
            <li>I think the reason I love it so much is because you can mix and match your Venus refills, with any Venus razor handle!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again, great value for a high quality</li>
            <li>I honestly mistook \\&quot;5 blades\\&quot; for there being FIVE refill blades in the package with the new razor...</li>
            <li>I still have to go over those spots more than once, but I can do it fast and with light pressure.</li>
            <li>The results were a super close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Ever since I found these razors, my legs have been super smooth.</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t need a ton of lotion to get a clean, nick-free shave, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is always super smooth even at the end of the month for me.  </li>
            <li>Sure, they are good but for the amount of time they last, it gets pretty spendy.</li>
            <li>My legs are so soft and smooth!!  </li>
            <li>I no longer use these blades or the corresponding razor as I found they dulled very easily, cut me too frequently, and just did not give me the smooth, can&#x27;t-stop-touching-them legs.</li>
            <li>The first or second use is great, but after that the blade is already beginning to dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first few times you use the razor with either soap or shaving cream, it will be a bit goopy but after it washes off, it&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to know if using a razor with replaceable cartridges was better than a disposal</li>
            <li>There really aren&#x27;t that many choices out there for ladies razors but Venus Embrace</li>
            <li>I am a busy college student with a hectic schedule and shaving is sometimes a time consuming task but not with the Venus Gillette razor honestly the close shave and the gentle glide of the razor makes shaving easier and better.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how good it would have been if I&#x27;d used the shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I am going to through a laser hair removal treatment for my full face.</li>
            <li>The cool thing is that you can mix and match blades.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have to use as much shaving cream with this razor. :)</li>
            <li>cause razor burn really badly, no matter what shaving cream/gel I use.  </li>
            <li>they shave my legs sooo smoothly and make everything so easy and fast,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original Venus razors before and was satisfied enough with them, but these are considerably better.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and am extremely prone to razor burn on my thighs and in the \\&quot;bikini area.\\&quot; Venus Embrace blades are the best I&#x27;ve used both in terms of minimizing irritation and getting an amazingly smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth blades that slide right off my skin.</li>
            <li>The hippie era makes so much sense, I would have let my hair grow out if I didn&#x27;t have something as wonderful as these razors to take care of that mess.</li>
            <li>This is comparable with the prices of other razorblades but these aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Love these razors, they do a nice close shave that lasts longer than your average cheap razor shave.</li>
            <li>and I had some mild razor burn with them.</li>
            <li>and I had some mild razor burn with them.</li>
            <li>Overall, definitely the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target&#x27;s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper prices.     </li>
            <li>i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target&#x27;s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper</li>
            <li>(bro tip: if you get bumps or ingrown hairs often, quickly exfoliate your underarms with a face scrub or a loofa before you shave.</li>
            <li>It motivates me to change the razors more regularly and I get a better shave.</li>
            <li>It left my legs nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Some of the others do make my skin feel more smooth, but they lose the soft stuff quickly and become unusable.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a complimentary razor from Influenster, I was able to try the Venus razor handle with the Olay blade refill.</li>
            <li>Quick.  </li>
            <li>wanna shave your legs quickly?</li>
            <li>It shaves super close and it doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li>I am loyal to these blades, and that&#x27;s after years of searching.</li>
            <li>I was in a rush and had to do a quick shave.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I got the same wonderful</li>
            <li>They came quickly considering I ordered them over a holiday weekend.</li>
            <li>i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!!</li>
            <li>i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!!</li>
            <li>I love it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My wife liked it, the price compared to the quantity is ok, although if it was a little cheaper, sh&#x27;d have asked for more from this product, in general, she was ok with it.</li>
            <li>no skin irritation just smooth akin and pretty legs</li>
            <li>The Venus is smooth and really makes it so you don&#x27;t have bumps!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I get a nice close even shave every time and that there is no irritation as there would be with other choices.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try out a new type of razor, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>i love the new venus razor.</li>
            <li>Work good but not sure if much better then the 3 blade one I used before trying this.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most razors</li>
            <li>My favorite Venus razor by far!</li>
            <li>My favorite razor blade by far!</li>
            <li>I get a nice smooth clean shave that I can go every other day shaving if I wish.  </li>
            <li>Plus they are the only ones I have found that do amazing around the knee.</li>
            <li>It looks to me as though the designers prioritized making the shower pod \\&quot;cute\\&quot; over making it useful for storage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I rarely cut my legs with them.</li>
            <li>At first I used the disposable razors from the Target brand, but when I saw this here at Amazon, I thought it would be cool to buy the Venus razor itself at a store and just buy the refill cartridges here at Amazon</li>
            <li>Never been a fan of women&#x27;s razors until now, but gal-darn, these are worth it.</li>
            <li>You do get your money&#x27;s worth out of them.</li>
            <li>Pricy but worth it</li>
            <li>Just make sure when you hold the razor, you don&#x27;t grip it near the head to prevent it from swiveling.</li>
            <li>only kind my kids use.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>The Embrace blade is, so far, my favorite.</li>
            <li>I got Venus Embrace as part of my Voxbox complimentary from Influenster.  </li>
            <li>I rarely if ever get nicks and cuts when using these razors.</li>
            <li>I received my venus embrace and venus and olay razor complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>so I never have to worry about running out of fresh blades.</li>
            <li>When you first open a cartridge and use that razor for the first time, it makes whatever you shave feel extremely smooth and absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Discloser: I received my razor complimentary of Influenster</li>
            <li>I received this razor complimentary from Influenster</li>
            <li>Influenster was kind enough to include both an Embrace®  blade and a handle.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I rarely cut myself and if I do it</li>
            <li>The only time a razor has truly wowed me was when Gillette first came out with the Sensor Excel for men many years ago, but they are not the same quality anymore and don&#x27;t work as good as they used to.</li>
            <li>As I get older and have to shave more, the quality of the blades start to really matter.</li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster for my complimentary blade!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these and cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li>so it took a while to find the right blade.</li>
            <li>but I walked right by it in-store).</li>
            <li>In seconds you clean the whole area out of hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product it does so much better than any other razor out there!</li>
            <li>These actually are far better than even the ones I used to use of my husband&#x27;s...they leave your legs hair-free and very smooth.</li>
            <li>The head of the razor is very flexible and glides right over the curves of your legs and under arms!</li>
            <li>I had read that there was no difference other than price for more blades on a razor---Not true!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they were able to come up with such a superior product to all other Venus brands.</li>
            <li>Easy to swap out, press the button on the razor to disconnect the old blade.  </li>
            <li>Have used these for several years on the leg daily, and they do a great job cleaning and smoothing -</li>
            <li>Not only did it also leave my legs looking free of blood, it also made it smooth-</li>
            <li>(I can usually go an extra day compared to a cheaper razor blade) and is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have seen the other side and its razor burn free :)</li>
            <li>It means that I have been able to own the same razor for a very long time and just keep replacing the blades!</li>
            <li>Love these, they are the only ones I will use.</li>
            <li>I will first say that I&#x27;ve been using a men&#x27;s Mach 3 for years after having first tried the Venus forever ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I can shave fearlessly on my kneecaps, the backs of my lower legs (around the Achilles tendons), and in the bikini area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the slimmest Venus blades I can find, so they are better for shaving in a smaller area like the bikini area.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use foaming cream, instead I use Coochy Cream (I know, funny name)</li>
            <li>be shopping for more in the future.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;ribbon of moisture\\&quot; does a pretty thorough job, so you can get away without shave gel if you need to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time shaver</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a first time shaver like me, you should totally try this!! :)</li>
            <li>I started to use years ago since it first came out.</li>
            <li>The shave wasn&#x27;t close, causing me to get razor burn from going over the same spot too many times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these refills for a while now, and they&#x27;ve held up pretty well.</li>
            <li>These work really well!</li>
            <li>I am not ashamed to tell you all that I wept the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not totally sold on these blades, but they do not cut or nick and even though I may need to go over an area more than once, they will do until technology improves or</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same area more than once or twice.</li>
            <li>Same price as walmart but saved me a shopping trip and probably spending more money I didn&#x27;t intend to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is so practical, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same area more than once or twice.</li>
            <li>These razor refills work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Leave skin soft and smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;-Very</li>
            <li>Started using these about 10 years ago when it first came out.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased Embrace razor over 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>been using this since it first came out.</li>
            <li>That saves me so much money and time!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember when I started using Venus Razors, but I do know ever since that first day I discovered them, I had strayed to try others</li>
            <li>I have pretty course hair</li>
            <li>The 1st time i use it, it was ok, but the problem is the cartridges are to big</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products since I first began shaving.</li>
            <li>Target (I&#x27;m sure they were about the same on Amazon</li>
            <li>this is one item I&#x27;ll pay the higher price for.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different kinds and brands.</li>
            <li>My legs and under arms stay soft and smooth for days.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>So glad I tried it, never going back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the ones in the more blue box</li>
            <li>This is my favorite from their line because I feel like the blades last longer.</li>
            <li>These are the only blades I use --- I never get a cut or nic and the price is so much better on amazon</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s pricing on blades sure beats purchasing at a local grocery store.</li>
            <li>i think i&#x27;m going to go back to using a men&#x27;s razor, as they tend to stay sharper longer and give a much better shave.</li>
            <li>First I tried the Embrace®  blade, twice.</li>
            <li>The first day I used the Embrace</li>
            <li>so shshsh:-0  Thank you so much for offering for sale! :-0</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I wanted and was looking for (5 blade without those moisture bars), and the quality was not sacrificed for the price.</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Love the 5 blades and the moisture strip is terrific!</li>
            <li>Yeah, five blades sure seemed silly, but I guess sometimes more is better.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally discovered this product.  </li>
            <li>Good deal when I first purchased, now same price (or more) than  local stores such as target etc.</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin like me, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it got delivered on a Sunday which was really convenient actually!</li>
            <li>The 5-blade system also ensures a smooth shave - with other razors, I have to go over the same area more times to get my skin completely smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 5 blades give a clean smooth shave and whether im shaving dry, in the shower, with lotion, cream, or nothing</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and I have tried many different razors.</li>
            <li>Feels way more comfortable than 1 or two blades but not a huge step up from 3 blades altought</li>
            <li>Switched to another brand and instantly switched back because of it&#x27;s superior performance.</li>
            <li>I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn&#x27;t get bumped and rarely gets splashed.</li>
            <li>I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn&#x27;t get bumped and rarely gets splashed.</li>
            <li>I use them with shaving cream and get a close shave pretty much every time for months.</li>
            <li>Getting the cartidges through subscribe and save makes it simple and easy.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really use this as much as I did at first.  </li>
            <li>Nothing makes shaving your knees exactly easy, but these are a big improvement over anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I was so amazed at how easily this razor shaves...especially the back of the legs, which are always the hardest for me.</li>
            <li>I have been a very loyal, faithful Venus only user for years---</li>
            <li>Easy to use no cuts u can use it multiple times</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s large size.</li>
            <li>Gillette certainly has learned the art of shaving and that can be seen across their product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually always have a perfect shave with this item when purchased from my local store, but when I use the blades purchased from amazon I have frequent nicks</li>
            <li>design fits in your hand nice, and the swiveling head helps to make a quick, smooth shave even in the difficult areas like kneecaps, and the bikini area.</li>
            <li>You do not have to push very hard, or go over the area twice, to get a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing because the hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back as quickly as when I&#x27;ve used other razors.</li>
            <li>Great smooth results without cutting my skin.</li>
            <li>Venus Embrace makes for a smooth and fast shave, there is no need to apply pressure or repeatedly go over the same spot.</li>
            <li>When they&#x27;re nearing the end they really don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>Not so much...</li>
            <li>They are MUCH cheaper on Amazon than they are in the box stores.</li>
            <li>Venus is super pricey, even on Amazon, but I really like this particular model of razor because they don&#x27;t have copious amounts of moisturizer (aka gunk) that ends up falling off or getting everywhere and generally making every shave after the first one a bit of a pain in the ass.</li>
            <li>This razor provides a very close shave, I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>and I am very please with</li>
            <li>I feel like it provides a much &amp;#34;closer to the skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I got them so fast too</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The subscribe and save option makes life much easier and cheaper.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>However, my local stores have replaced the former with the latter, so I am thrilled to find that they are still made and are available.</li>
            <li>While I really like the smoothness of the shave I get from these blades -</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying in-store.</li>
            <li>But we have no choice really but to keep on buying them.</li>
            <li>The head is very flexible</li>
            <li>so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts.</li>
            <li>This is their only downside - which is why I bought this cartridge of 4 to have replacement razor heads available as soon as needed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The blade really glides over your skin.  </li>
            <li>The head is very flexible</li>
            <li>so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts.</li>
            <li>I do not like to use shaving cream, and this razor, with the built in shaving ribbons, make it much easier to skip that</li>
            <li>I will never go back to a cheap one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY disappointmented considering the price I paid for the items.</li>
            <li>It gives a really close shave as you need it.</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>None of the others seem to shave as close or smooth, plus the amazon price beats my local retailers any day of the week.</li>
            <li>And, bonus, with Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, I can get them so much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>But this razor has really changed my look on razors</li>
            <li>I also like it because it prevents cuts since the head is very flexible and that was one reason why I didnt want to use a razor.</li>
            <li>I use to think the 5 blades were a gimmick but after trying them I really do think they make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Very pricey, but</li>
            <li>A must have and Venus blade refills fit any Venus razor handle, which is a plus if you want to try different heads.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand why they cost so much.</li>
            <li>I really like the venus embrace razors.</li>
            <li>this was the only one available.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is also reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Here, the price does not flux as much.</li>
            <li>My sister turned me on to Venus razors and I&#x27;ll never go back to cheap disposables.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than local stores and appears to be genuine Gillette product.</li>
            <li>I do have to pass the razor in double strokes but it is because I forget to rinse out the razor to free it&#x27;s blades of hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the Olay blades that you can get for it.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to purchase refills now.</li>
            <li>I am neurotic about not having any nubs ever--these blades shave so much closer than the &#x27;3&amp;#34; blades....</li>
            <li>Also, shipping was so fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never knicked myself shaving with the Embrace, no matter how fast I go.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t go as fast for fear of knicking myself.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate that Gillette has not changed the attachment method to their razor handle...</li>
            <li>I love this particular Embrace razor blade refill over some of the later kinds, which offer more lotion and less efficiency.  </li>
            <li>I think there is one other style of Venus razors that is a bit better</li>
            <li>I dont even feel that burning sensation that I felt with most other brands.  </li>
            <li>More than other disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sharp, but comfortable and I like the gel strips that seem to last pretty consistently.</li>
            <li>They also seemed to dull more quickly.</li>
            <li>They also seemed to dull more quickly.</li>
            <li>I previously owned the original, but Inswitched to the embrace the other day and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>in all I love these, but they dull fast so cost a whole lot more in the long run.</li>
            <li>blades meant five blades of SUCK on two \\&quot;refill\\&quot; packages that came with the new crumby and too large razor and a \\&quot;razor and refill holder\\&quot; that won&#x27;t stay on the wall of my shower for the life of</li>
            <li>Normally can get really pricey in the stores.</li>
            <li>It provides an amazingly close shave, while moisturizing your skin (which is incredibly helpful, especially in the winter when you HATE shaving cream).</li>
            <li>/&gt;the razors stay sharp a good long while and they take weeks to even get a hint of rust.</li>
            <li>I have never had to purchase a new handle EVER!</li>
            <li>When I had the opportunity to once again use the Venus® Embrace® , it was a whole new world!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot less irritation when more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND these blades make it almost impossible to cut yourself...and the best part....get them on auto ship.. never have to think about picking them up at the store....</li>
            <li>Stop wasting your money when you can get a lot more for less.</li>
            <li>Agree with previous reviewers to either store it in the case or leave it blades-up somewhere safe in the shower otherwise</li>
            <li>This is my main product from now on.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the smoothness wears off fairly quick.</li>
            <li>Shai Trial Pack (for a quick example) is only 20 bucks and includes a handle and 18 cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I was really skeptical that more blades would lead to a better shave.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think that razors should be so high priced, but I will buy again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy anything else but these, and highly recommend them and the razor.</li>
            <li>I just wish more came in a package and they could be a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to use unlike many of the other razors I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sensitive but this is just the right amount of blades, and glides like butter!</li>
            <li>the razor reaches too much water in the shower, by falling from it&#x27;s post or being in a wetter spot, it almost ruins the razor by adhering itself to whatever it&#x27;s near or just becoming a goopy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They shave really close to the skin and afterwards you&#x27;ll have baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>Wow- this really is a much closer shave than the Quattro, which I have been using forever.</li>
            <li>It gives me a really close shave, while also keeping my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra couple bucks for 5 blades.</li>
            <li>My friends laugh, but it makes total sense.  </li>
            <li>They are definitely pricey, but really worth it.  </li>
            <li>i have recently received this razor complimentary from a website</li>
            <li>They last a long time and make my legs feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I thought these were the ones I normally order</li>
            <li>Normally I use conditioner as my shaving cream, but with the Olay blade I didn&#x27;t have to use an additional shaving cream--</li>
            <li>I actually recieved my Gillette Venus complimentary form</li>
            <li>Normally under these circumstances, I would end up with nicks and/or razor burn.</li>
            <li>It will last you longer then the cheaper ones and be the better buy in the long run.  </li>
            <li>These were a great value on here and will last me a long time without compromising a smooth shave or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>i will only use the Gillette Venus and all the different refills from now on goodbye old razors hello to my new favorite</li>
            <li>Took me awhile to figure out that I didn&#x27;t need to take the refills out of the package by hand, but simply just stick my razor wand and it pops right onto it.</li>
            <li>My friend and I saw, \\&quot;WAY CHEAPER THAN JUST BUYING NEW MACH BLADES!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>i will deffinatly keep using and buying new blades for my new venus razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely live the Venus embrace cartridges.</li>
            <li>My daughter asked for new shaving stuff.  </li>
            <li>Every year the Venus Gillette company comes out with some new summer product.  </li>
            <li>Makes shaving easy and less painless.</li>
            <li>I blow on the blades, both sides, after using it and then blot carefully with a clean washcloth.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you let the razor dry completely before you put the plastic cap back on so</li>
            <li>That stuff is goopy when you&#x27;re shaving (for extra smooth glide of the razor I guess...) and dries solid.</li>
            <li>I was searching around for new razor blade styles, as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good quality, sharp blades and they last a long time (as they should, given the price).  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my legs for some reason</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this razor never bothers my skin.  </li>
            <li>My legs always feel so soft &amp; I don&#x27;t even use soap or shaving cream!  </li>
            <li>If you have marble tiles, definitely test it out on a spare piece first.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it, as long as I can get 3 weeks out of one cartridge.</li>
            <li>I love these shavers they are the only once I don&#x27;t have allergies to from other</li>
            <li>First it covers a much larger area</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is the price is a bit higher than I would like.</li>
            <li>First it covers a much larger area</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to nick myself again!  </li>
            <li>I have always used Venus since I was 14 years old!</li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades (these being gillette venus with 5 blades), and I&#x27;ve tried a few!</li>
            <li>I had received this complimentary from Influenster in my Cosmo Voxbox 2012, and was a bit skeptical over how good it actually worked.  </li>
            <li>The price is ridiculous but it really is worth it to not end up cut up and itchy from the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I recommend laying down the money and treating yourself to smooth</li>
            <li>they last long enough that the price is worth it because these last so much longer than the cheap 2 blade ones that sister uses.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get a close enough shave for long, plus with dull blades you get razor bumps more easily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this just made my skin feel soft and nourished instead of irritated.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a razor blade I actually like, much less love.</li>
            <li>Also, in certain areas, my hair grows in multiple directions.</li>
            <li>I was a little leary at first because of the price and the number of blades, so I had gotten my normal (same brand different style) and there was one of these free in the box.  </li>
            <li>They last for a very long time before having to replace them and get a clean close shave.</li>
            <li>I received this item for free from Influenster and I have to say I was shocked I really liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they last much longer than the others.</li>
            <li>At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall</li>
            <li>At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>They miss places on my legs even though I try to cover the whole area numerous times.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried it in the sensitive areas also.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>i have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>i have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re far too pricey.</li>
            <li>The whole blade unit itself is different.</li>
            <li>, it is not only very convenient to use but also  </li>
            <li>As far as the shower pod goes, it hangs on my shower wall without a problem unless I bang into it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it to hold extra cartridges though, for two reasons:  </li>
            <li>Venus offers razor blades for every imaginable need, skin type, and preference.</li>
            <li>And, on a silly note, For those of us who love Britcoms, the &#x27;5 blade&#x27; razor is reminiscent of the show Reginald Perrin starring Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) where the very idea of 5 blades was made fun of.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>My skin look soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy person who dislikes shaving, so</li>
            <li>The only flaw is you really do need to use the shower holder that holds it upright.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than buying individual packs at the store</li>
            <li>Although its pricey, you can use the blades for numerous shaves, and it not only gets close, but rarely nicks or cuts your skin.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but dang these are really good blades and my skin feels really soft, even when I don&#x27;t have time to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>They shave close, smooth and they seem to last longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll forget how careful you have to be with other razors because the Venus Embrace is so safe.  </li>
            <li>These give a smooth shave and last a long time, especially if you buy them off of Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Even though this is pretty expensive, it is the only kind of razor I prefer to use.</li>
            <li>I got my venus razor complimentary from Influenster a few weeks back, and I used a 5 blade for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>These certainly are expensive but if you shave quickly, or tend to cut yourself it will be worth the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really leaves your skin super soft, and its hard to miss a spot with the 5 blades.</li>
            <li>Peel back the packaging on the new cartridge, insert the razor handle until you hear a click, and voila!  </li>
            <li>I never cut myself, and with the little gel strips on the top and bottom you barely need shaving cream for the first few uses (but, use it anyway-</li>
            <li>It has just enough moisturizer on the blade head to eliminate shaving gels and creams, leave my skin satiny smooth, and still not get \\&quot;goopy\\&quot; or \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; when I set it down to</li>
            <li>I wish they lasted a while longer, 4-5 uses is the max without the blades becoming too dull.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I have to shave less with this razor since it&#x27;s such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>With the long handle, and pivoting head, it doesn&#x27;t really even FEEL like you are shaving...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cheap &#x27;throw away&#x27; razors in the past and they cut the hell out of your skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband has used it a few times for his face, and I have used it a few more times as well!</li>
            <li>Also, I really like that there are several different replaceable blades that you can choose from to put on the razor.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin (particularly on my legs)</li>
            <li>They are expensive, but she says they are great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>One of the major uses of the shower pod (for me) is to avoid having to store an opened box of cartridges somewhere else.</li>
            <li>They are a little more pricey than the other blade refills</li>
            <li>am a frugal shopper and it takes a lot for me to continue to buy products that are a little pricey, these however are worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can be a little pricey but its worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I have gone back and forth numerous times between lots of different wet razors (schick, bic, venus original, venus breeze, etc.)</li>
            <li>It makes a HUGE difference, especially after doing it for a few weeks!)  </li>
            <li>Since I am a delicate lady, I like to have smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>Not much to say here really.</li>
            <li>But they do seem to last longer, so that partially offsets the higher</li>
            <li>They are the only razor that gets close enough to shave wonderfully but not cut the crap out of my legs.</li>
            <li>Venus Embrace will leave your legs silky smooth with very little effort!</li>
            <li>(I am a big lover of testing new products), but ALWAYS go back to my Venus razors.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to let the &amp;#34;ribbon&amp;#34; lay flat on a surface, as it will dissolve rather quickly and make shaving a lot more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Although I like the idea of the other Venus products with their built in lotions and exfoliants, those seem to keep me from getting a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors.</li>
            <li>so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors.</li>
            <li>Worth paying a little extra for these.</li>
            <li>but the one on the razor has lasted me a long time, about 2 weeks so far! &#x3D;</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that all Venus razor blades should fit interchangeably in the blade storage thingies that attach to walls with suction cups.</li>
            <li>I finally threw out the remaining blades and went back to my old blades.</li>
            <li>i have the entire Venus line in every possible color and design, and this one is the queen of all by far.</li>
            <li>i have the entire Venus line in every possible color and design, and this one is the queen of all by far.</li>
            <li>no nicks, no dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Gillette really needs to go down on the price of these razors.</li>
            <li>So, thanks to Amazon&#x27;s autoship, the price can come down</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).     </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dull out quickly at all.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that the blades tend to dull rather quickly.</li>
            <li>You will definitely want to shave slowly, as shaving quickly with this razor often results in cuts.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So will someone please tell me why these little buggers have to cost so much?</li>

            <li> Keeps my wife&#x27;s underarms and legs silky smooth, just like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> I tried this five blade Embrace version when it was on sale, figuring five blades would be better than just three.</li>
            <li> Love everything about these razors but the price.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors.</li>
            <li> Love having them brought to my door.</li>
            <li> The perfect, close shave, they last 2+ weeks, and you don&#x27;t need shaving cream!</li>
            <li> On Amazon, it&#x27;s a much better price than I can get them for in the store, and I don&#x27;t have to remember to get them every couple months.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite razors.</li>
            <li> I love the venus embrace.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is a bit better.</li>
            <li> Also, the Embrace has 5 blades so it should be better at giving a close shave.</li>
            <li> having moisture ribbons on both the top and the bottom, but whatever the reason I&#x27;m glad I found these</li>
            <li> I have used the venus embrace razor and blades for many years.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see them on Amazon at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> They know these subjects way better than</li>

            <li> I love how I don&#x27;t get any cuts from this blade.</li>
            <li> and I get more razor burns and in grown hair with these.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the one with the showerpod &#x27;cause it costs more plus</li>
            <li> But all in all I love this razor.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like five blades to give you a nice close, comfortable shave without any nicks or cuts!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> These are ok.  </li>
            <li> I can use them for months and still get a better shave than the 1st time using those 4 blade disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of being able to get them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the Venus embrace.</li>

            <li> Love me some Venus Embrace.</li>
            <li> I love receiving the gillette razors because it saves me a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> The downfall for these sometimes the heads can feel slimy because the top and bottom part of the razors (I call them moisture bars)</li>
            <li> I have gotten more shaves from disposable razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ploy to get us to buy more razors.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Venus Embrace does seem to be the best product currently on the market.</li>
            <li> Two razors; aloe strips; moisture strips; rubber grips on the handle; FREE suction cup holder for the shower!</li>
            <li> I like the one with olay much better.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this razor.</li>
            <li> laser hair removal is more affordable.....</li>
            <li> Venus Embrace is magical.</li>
            <li> i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have not managed to cut myself with these - so I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re safe as well.</li>
            <li> Of course, the cost is not 5-star, it&#x27;s more like two.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I tend to forget to buy razors when I&#x27;m at the store, and this service ensures that I always have razors available!</li>
            <li> PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-Incredibly smooth shave!</li>
            <li> safe, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gotten a nick with this razor</li>

            <li> but I love the product.</li>
            <li> (Every now and then, I still swipe my husband&#x27;s - Gillette pro fusion, I think - which has a more sturdy razor and seems to give an even closer shave, but . . . .)  </li>
            <li> I get the closest shave ever, and my legs are literally smooth for days!</li>
            <li> and I feel that if you can find a better deal, why not share it with others.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Plus, I love that any Venus razor head fits any Venus razor handle.</li>
            <li> The shave closeness has been okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure where I&#x27;m at just yet with this, but I&#x27;m hoping I end up liking it more.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> But okay</li>
            <li> it sure seems like I&#x27;m not needing to shave as often.</li>
            <li> :)</li>

            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> I love the Venus Embrace razor.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the best razor out of all of the different Venus razors.  </li>
            <li> Much better value than buying at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I can even \\&quot;go cheap\\&quot; in the winter and use 3-blade razors! :)</li>
            <li> Really smooth nice shave.  </li>
            <li> I also put Epson salt and some bubble bath in my bath water before I shave and it helps even more I have noticed.  </li>
            <li> Good price on amazon, and right to my door.</li>
            <li> The lotion strips are alright, and they&#x27;re quite pleasant for the first week</li>
            <li> First two blades, then THREE!!!</li>
            <li> Great razor blades only get better by using Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> The price is pretty good compared to the stores too.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good razors.</li>
            <li> I love these razors, do not nick and leave my legs feeling sexy and smooth (just like the commercials).  </li>
            <li> My roommate and I both have slightly different Venus razors and these razor cartridges fit both of them perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not only it does fit all gillette blades, it is also the best razor ever.  </li>
            <li> The best part is all the Venus carriage heads fit on the same ravor.  </li>
            <li> Let me first tell you that I am pregnant, and overweight so shaving legs and armpits have just become null and void lol.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about the Gillette Venus razor is that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus handle so you can find your perfect shaving match without having to purchase a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> These razors give the smoothest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I love this razor because it has a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I have to buy more of these and am glad I had bought these before as I had not remembered which ones I had gotten and liked so much.</li>
            <li> Works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample through influenster although they were already my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Perfect, delivered just as expected.</li>
            <li> If you have 5 or more things on auto-ship, you can save 15-20%, which puts these at a substantially lower price than I pay at walmart, plus free shipping to my door every month....</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it is and doesnt nick like alot of others.</li>
            <li> I got it free from influenster.com to try, and it gave me the best dry shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I love my original Venus razor and the three blade version refills.</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the other products by Gilette and this is the best one.</li>
            <li> The razor itself isn&#x27;t perfect, as I&#x27;ve replaced 3 times due to breakage.  </li>
            <li> The other awesome thing is that all the blades that are Venus brand are interchangeable so if I find another Venus product, I can mix and match.</li>
            <li> For some reason these rust easily too.</li>
            <li> Also glides easily.</li>
            <li> It works great, love the multiple blade and soap around it, as I shave at the sink.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to replace, as well.</li>
            <li> It glides easily across the skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as easy as pushing a button!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Great quality and better price than big box store</li>
            <li> Check the internet and see that what I&#x27;m telling you is true..:)</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs silky and I especially love that any Venus razor refill fits any blade handle, this makes it so convenient to try other types of Venus products!</li>
            <li> These are definitely one of the best blades I&#x27;ve used at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Buying these online are no doubt the cheapest price you will fine.</li>
            <li> The best part about these is that you can get them on Auto-Ship, which is one less thing you have to worry about at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a razor that is easy to use and leaves your legs feeling silky smooth than the Venus Embrace is for you...</li>
            <li> They work super well!</li>
            <li> The gel strips will be used up much more quickly and will attach themselves to the surface they are placed onto (don&#x27;t worry, not permanently).</li>
            <li> and luckily you can use them more than once</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girlfriend after reading the many positive reviews here and found that they worked better than my Merkel safety razor at shaving my face.</li>
            <li> I tried the Embrace cartridges with the very first Venus handle that ever came out!</li>
            <li> Well, a little cheaper would be awesome</li>
            <li> I was used to a three blade razor and going to the 5 blade made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but it makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Replacement razors are cheap enough so they make great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my fiancee and she wasn&#x27;t a huge fan.  </li>
            <li> The 5 blades makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> They leave skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Now I get a smooth shave and NO razor burn in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the Embrace cartridges do fit the Breeze handle, they</li>
            <li> * fit in the Breeze shower pod.  </li>
            <li> By 10 pm they are still silky smooth.</li>
            <li> These fit all Venus razors, not just the Embrace.</li>
            <li> You get a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> They know how to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Her legs end up smooth and unirritated.</li>
            <li> and she can have a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> They give a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> but I feel like they&#x27;re cheaply made</li>
            <li> This provides a smooth, nick-free shave.</li>
            <li> They leave my legs silky smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /cut by this razor unlike the cheap disposables.</li>
            <li> Felt smooth and got the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li> Smooth, no pain, no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I only use this brand.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the razor which is a win for me obviously.  </li>
            <li> hair and these blades make my legs silky smooth everytime.</li>
            <li> and i must say this razor has made my legs so unbelievably smooth</li>
            <li> It makes shaving easier and it leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> and I have smooth legs until I have to shave again.  </li>
            <li> It runs so smooth, and I like the feel of lotion afterwords.  </li>
            <li> I received this razor blade for free through Influenster.  </li>
            <li> head of the razor is designed to avoid nicks, keep your skin soothed, and provide a smooth, super-close shave.</li>
            <li> I figured hey it is free why not try.  </li>
            <li> I like how it leaves your skin smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li> It glides over skin so smoothly</li>
            <li> Leaves my skins feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Did you know that all Venus blades fit any Venus</li>
            <li> and I feel comfortable using this razor in that area.</li>
            <li> and I have NEVER cut myself with it, which is important as I have a bleeding disorder.</li>
            <li> I recieved it for free in my Influenster VoxBox along with a sample of their Olay razor.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my legs silky smooth every time.</li>
            <li> Venus® Embrace®  is lightweight and formed to fit in a woman&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> The blades glided effortlessly over my legs, and gave me a great shave, even with several days growth.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts and a close smooth shave every time.  </li>
            <li> Well, I have to say that it does seem that it takes fewer passes with the razor to make my legs feel smooth</li>
            <li> So when I went to shave, it wasn&#x27;t a smooth shave</li>
            <li> They provide a close shave and will fit any Gillette razor, even men&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I received one free from influenster.com, but as I said I will keep using this product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite blades, and they really do work better than the 3 blade ones.</li>
            <li> Id love to find something more reasonable, but i won&#x27;t hold my breath.</li>
            <li> I have the most success with the Venus Original used with Aveeno Theraputic Shave Gel.</li>
            <li> very rarely do I get razor burn.  </li>
            <li> My legs are super smooth and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> They leave me legs feeling smooth and freshly shaved for days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still okay after you use it, but it doesn&#x27;t make your legs as smooth as the first time.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have loved most of the venus refills but these are my absolute favorite, especially for summer time.  </li>
            <li> Subscribe and Save gives the best price for the 4 pack compared to any store in my rural area where I live.  </li>
            <li> I never had the before with three blade original.</li>
            <li> I love that I can shave my legs at night and the following afternoon still have smooth legs!!</li>
            <li> Or did the quality just significantly decrease?</li>
            <li> When I found this razor I was really excited.</li>
            <li> So they are worth it!  </li>
            <li> I received a complimentary Gillette Venus Embrace blade from Influenster!</li>
            <li> I have always used the original blades when it comes to my venus razor...</li>
            <li> I think the reason I love it so much is because you can mix and match your Venus refills, with any Venus razor handle!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again, great value for a high quality</li>
            <li> I honestly mistook \\&quot;5 blades\\&quot; for there being FIVE refill blades in the package with the new razor...</li>
            <li> I still have to go over those spots more than once, but I can do it fast and with light pressure.</li>
            <li> The results were a super close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Ever since I found these razors, my legs have been super smooth.</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t need a ton of lotion to get a clean, nick-free shave, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave is always super smooth even at the end of the month for me.  </li>
            <li> Sure, they are good but for the amount of time they last, it gets pretty spendy.</li>
            <li> My legs are so soft and smooth!!  </li>
            <li> I no longer use these blades or the corresponding razor as I found they dulled very easily, cut me too frequently, and just did not give me the smooth, can&#x27;t-stop-touching-them legs.</li>
            <li> The first or second use is great, but after that the blade is already beginning to dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few times you use the razor with either soap or shaving cream, it will be a bit goopy but after it washes off, it&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to know if using a razor with replaceable cartridges was better than a disposal</li>
            <li> There really aren&#x27;t that many choices out there for ladies razors but Venus Embrace</li>
            <li> I am a busy college student with a hectic schedule and shaving is sometimes a time consuming task but not with the Venus Gillette razor honestly the close shave and the gentle glide of the razor makes shaving easier and better.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how good it would have been if I&#x27;d used the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I am going to through a laser hair removal treatment for my full face.</li>
            <li> The cool thing is that you can mix and match blades.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have to use as much shaving cream with this razor. :)</li>
            <li> cause razor burn really badly, no matter what shaving cream/gel I use.  </li>
            <li> they shave my legs sooo smoothly and make everything so easy and fast,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Venus razors before and was satisfied enough with them, but these are considerably better.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and am extremely prone to razor burn on my thighs and in the \\&quot;bikini area.\\&quot; Venus Embrace blades are the best I&#x27;ve used both in terms of minimizing irritation and getting an amazingly smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth blades that slide right off my skin.</li>
            <li> The hippie era makes so much sense, I would have let my hair grow out if I didn&#x27;t have something as wonderful as these razors to take care of that mess.</li>
            <li> This is comparable with the prices of other razorblades but these aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Love these razors, they do a nice close shave that lasts longer than your average cheap razor shave.</li>
            <li> and I had some mild razor burn with them.</li>
            <li> and I had some mild razor burn with them.</li>
            <li> Overall, definitely the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target&#x27;s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper prices.     </li>
            <li> i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target&#x27;s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper</li>
            <li> (bro tip: if you get bumps or ingrown hairs often, quickly exfoliate your underarms with a face scrub or a loofa before you shave.</li>
            <li> It motivates me to change the razors more regularly and I get a better shave.</li>
            <li> It left my legs nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Some of the others do make my skin feel more smooth, but they lose the soft stuff quickly and become unusable.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a complimentary razor from Influenster, I was able to try the Venus razor handle with the Olay blade refill.</li>
            <li> Quick.  </li>
            <li> wanna shave your legs quickly?</li>
            <li> It shaves super close and it doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> I am loyal to these blades, and that&#x27;s after years of searching.</li>
            <li> I was in a rush and had to do a quick shave.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I got the same wonderful</li>
            <li> They came quickly considering I ordered them over a holiday weekend.</li>
            <li> i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!!</li>
            <li> i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!!</li>
            <li> I love it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it, the price compared to the quantity is ok, although if it was a little cheaper, sh&#x27;d have asked for more from this product, in general, she was ok with it.</li>
            <li> no skin irritation just smooth akin and pretty legs</li>
            <li> The Venus is smooth and really makes it so you don&#x27;t have bumps!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I get a nice close even shave every time and that there is no irritation as there would be with other choices.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try out a new type of razor, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> i love the new venus razor.</li>
            <li> Work good but not sure if much better then the 3 blade one I used before trying this.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most razors</li>
            <li> My favorite Venus razor by far!</li>
            <li> My favorite razor blade by far!</li>
            <li> I get a nice smooth clean shave that I can go every other day shaving if I wish.  </li>
            <li> Plus they are the only ones I have found that do amazing around the knee.</li>
            <li> It looks to me as though the designers prioritized making the shower pod \\&quot;cute\\&quot; over making it useful for storage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I rarely cut my legs with them.</li>
            <li> At first I used the disposable razors from the Target brand, but when I saw this here at Amazon, I thought it would be cool to buy the Venus razor itself at a store and just buy the refill cartridges here at Amazon</li>
            <li> Never been a fan of women&#x27;s razors until now, but gal-darn, these are worth it.</li>
            <li> You do get your money&#x27;s worth out of them.</li>
            <li> Pricy but worth it</li>
            <li> Just make sure when you hold the razor, you don&#x27;t grip it near the head to prevent it from swiveling.</li>
            <li> only kind my kids use.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> The Embrace blade is, so far, my favorite.</li>
            <li> I got Venus Embrace as part of my Voxbox complimentary from Influenster.  </li>
            <li> I rarely if ever get nicks and cuts when using these razors.</li>
            <li> I received my venus embrace and venus and olay razor complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> so I never have to worry about running out of fresh blades.</li>
            <li> When you first open a cartridge and use that razor for the first time, it makes whatever you shave feel extremely smooth and absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Discloser: I received my razor complimentary of Influenster</li>
            <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster</li>
            <li> Influenster was kind enough to include both an Embrace®  blade and a handle.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I rarely cut myself and if I do it</li>
            <li> The only time a razor has truly wowed me was when Gillette first came out with the Sensor Excel for men many years ago, but they are not the same quality anymore and don&#x27;t work as good as they used to.</li>
            <li> As I get older and have to shave more, the quality of the blades start to really matter.</li>
            <li> Thanks Influenster for my complimentary blade!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these and cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> so it took a while to find the right blade.</li>
            <li> but I walked right by it in-store).</li>
            <li> In seconds you clean the whole area out of hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does so much better than any other razor out there!</li>
            <li> These actually are far better than even the ones I used to use of my husband&#x27;s...they leave your legs hair-free and very smooth.</li>
            <li> The head of the razor is very flexible and glides right over the curves of your legs and under arms!</li>
            <li> I had read that there was no difference other than price for more blades on a razor---Not true!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they were able to come up with such a superior product to all other Venus brands.</li>
            <li> Easy to swap out, press the button on the razor to disconnect the old blade.  </li>
            <li> Have used these for several years on the leg daily, and they do a great job cleaning and smoothing -</li>
            <li> Not only did it also leave my legs looking free of blood, it also made it smooth-</li>
            <li> (I can usually go an extra day compared to a cheaper razor blade) and is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have seen the other side and its razor burn free :)</li>
            <li> It means that I have been able to own the same razor for a very long time and just keep replacing the blades!</li>
            <li> Love these, they are the only ones I will use.</li>
            <li> I will first say that I&#x27;ve been using a men&#x27;s Mach 3 for years after having first tried the Venus forever ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I can shave fearlessly on my kneecaps, the backs of my lower legs (around the Achilles tendons), and in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the slimmest Venus blades I can find, so they are better for shaving in a smaller area like the bikini area.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use foaming cream, instead I use Coochy Cream (I know, funny name)</li>
            <li> be shopping for more in the future.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;ribbon of moisture\\&quot; does a pretty thorough job, so you can get away without shave gel if you need to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time shaver</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a first time shaver like me, you should totally try this!! :)</li>
            <li> I started to use years ago since it first came out.</li>
            <li> The shave wasn&#x27;t close, causing me to get razor burn from going over the same spot too many times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these refills for a while now, and they&#x27;ve held up pretty well.</li>
            <li> These work really well!</li>
            <li> I am not ashamed to tell you all that I wept the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally sold on these blades, but they do not cut or nick and even though I may need to go over an area more than once, they will do until technology improves or</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t need to go over the same area more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> Same price as walmart but saved me a shopping trip and probably spending more money I didn&#x27;t intend to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is so practical, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same area more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> These razor refills work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Leave skin soft and smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;-Very</li>
            <li> Started using these about 10 years ago when it first came out.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased Embrace razor over 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> been using this since it first came out.</li>
            <li> That saves me so much money and time!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember when I started using Venus Razors, but I do know ever since that first day I discovered them, I had strayed to try others</li>
            <li> I have pretty course hair</li>
            <li> The 1st time i use it, it was ok, but the problem is the cartridges are to big</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products since I first began shaving.</li>
            <li> Target (I&#x27;m sure they were about the same on Amazon</li>
            <li> this is one item I&#x27;ll pay the higher price for.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds and brands.</li>
            <li> My legs and under arms stay soft and smooth for days.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> So glad I tried it, never going back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ones in the more blue box</li>
            <li> This is my favorite from their line because I feel like the blades last longer.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I use --- I never get a cut or nic and the price is so much better on amazon</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s pricing on blades sure beats purchasing at a local grocery store.</li>
            <li> i think i&#x27;m going to go back to using a men&#x27;s razor, as they tend to stay sharper longer and give a much better shave.</li>
            <li> First I tried the Embrace®  blade, twice.</li>
            <li> The first day I used the Embrace</li>
            <li> so shshsh:-0  Thank you so much for offering for sale! :-0</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I wanted and was looking for (5 blade without those moisture bars), and the quality was not sacrificed for the price.</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Love the 5 blades and the moisture strip is terrific!</li>
            <li> Yeah, five blades sure seemed silly, but I guess sometimes more is better.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally discovered this product.  </li>
            <li> Good deal when I first purchased, now same price (or more) than  local stores such as target etc.</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin like me, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it got delivered on a Sunday which was really convenient actually!</li>
            <li> The 5-blade system also ensures a smooth shave - with other razors, I have to go over the same area more times to get my skin completely smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 5 blades give a clean smooth shave and whether im shaving dry, in the shower, with lotion, cream, or nothing</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and I have tried many different razors.</li>
            <li> Feels way more comfortable than 1 or two blades but not a huge step up from 3 blades altought</li>
            <li> Switched to another brand and instantly switched back because of it&#x27;s superior performance.</li>
            <li> I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn&#x27;t get bumped and rarely gets splashed.</li>
            <li> I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn&#x27;t get bumped and rarely gets splashed.</li>
            <li> I use them with shaving cream and get a close shave pretty much every time for months.</li>
            <li> Getting the cartidges through subscribe and save makes it simple and easy.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really use this as much as I did at first.  </li>
            <li> Nothing makes shaving your knees exactly easy, but these are a big improvement over anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was so amazed at how easily this razor shaves...especially the back of the legs, which are always the hardest for me.</li>
            <li> I have been a very loyal, faithful Venus only user for years---</li>
            <li> Easy to use no cuts u can use it multiple times</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s large size.</li>
            <li> Gillette certainly has learned the art of shaving and that can be seen across their product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually always have a perfect shave with this item when purchased from my local store, but when I use the blades purchased from amazon I have frequent nicks</li>
            <li> design fits in your hand nice, and the swiveling head helps to make a quick, smooth shave even in the difficult areas like kneecaps, and the bikini area.</li>
            <li> You do not have to push very hard, or go over the area twice, to get a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing because the hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back as quickly as when I&#x27;ve used other razors.</li>
            <li> Great smooth results without cutting my skin.</li>
            <li> Venus Embrace makes for a smooth and fast shave, there is no need to apply pressure or repeatedly go over the same spot.</li>
            <li> When they&#x27;re nearing the end they really don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Not so much...</li>
            <li> They are MUCH cheaper on Amazon than they are in the box stores.</li>
            <li> Venus is super pricey, even on Amazon, but I really like this particular model of razor because they don&#x27;t have copious amounts of moisturizer (aka gunk) that ends up falling off or getting everywhere and generally making every shave after the first one a bit of a pain in the ass.</li>
            <li> This razor provides a very close shave, I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> and I am very please with</li>
            <li> I feel like it provides a much &amp;#34;closer to the skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I got them so fast too</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The subscribe and save option makes life much easier and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> However, my local stores have replaced the former with the latter, so I am thrilled to find that they are still made and are available.</li>
            <li> While I really like the smoothness of the shave I get from these blades -</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying in-store.</li>
            <li> But we have no choice really but to keep on buying them.</li>
            <li> The head is very flexible</li>
            <li> so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts.</li>
            <li> This is their only downside - which is why I bought this cartridge of 4 to have replacement razor heads available as soon as needed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The blade really glides over your skin.  </li>
            <li> The head is very flexible</li>
            <li> so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts.</li>
            <li> I do not like to use shaving cream, and this razor, with the built in shaving ribbons, make it much easier to skip that</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a cheap one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY disappointmented considering the price I paid for the items.</li>
            <li> It gives a really close shave as you need it.</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> None of the others seem to shave as close or smooth, plus the amazon price beats my local retailers any day of the week.</li>
            <li> And, bonus, with Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, I can get them so much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> But this razor has really changed my look on razors</li>
            <li> I also like it because it prevents cuts since the head is very flexible and that was one reason why I didnt want to use a razor.</li>
            <li> I use to think the 5 blades were a gimmick but after trying them I really do think they make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Very pricey, but</li>
            <li> A must have and Venus blade refills fit any Venus razor handle, which is a plus if you want to try different heads.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand why they cost so much.</li>
            <li> I really like the venus embrace razors.</li>
            <li> this was the only one available.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is also reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Here, the price does not flux as much.</li>
            <li> My sister turned me on to Venus razors and I&#x27;ll never go back to cheap disposables.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than local stores and appears to be genuine Gillette product.</li>
            <li> I do have to pass the razor in double strokes but it is because I forget to rinse out the razor to free it&#x27;s blades of hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Olay blades that you can get for it.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to purchase refills now.</li>
            <li> I am neurotic about not having any nubs ever--these blades shave so much closer than the &#x27;3&amp;#34; blades....</li>
            <li> Also, shipping was so fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never knicked myself shaving with the Embrace, no matter how fast I go.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t go as fast for fear of knicking myself.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate that Gillette has not changed the attachment method to their razor handle...</li>
            <li> I love this particular Embrace razor blade refill over some of the later kinds, which offer more lotion and less efficiency.  </li>
            <li> I think there is one other style of Venus razors that is a bit better</li>
            <li> I dont even feel that burning sensation that I felt with most other brands.  </li>
            <li> More than other disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sharp, but comfortable and I like the gel strips that seem to last pretty consistently.</li>
            <li> They also seemed to dull more quickly.</li>
            <li> They also seemed to dull more quickly.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the original, but Inswitched to the embrace the other day and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> in all I love these, but they dull fast so cost a whole lot more in the long run.</li>
            <li> blades meant five blades of SUCK on two \\&quot;refill\\&quot; packages that came with the new crumby and too large razor and a \\&quot;razor and refill holder\\&quot; that won&#x27;t stay on the wall of my shower for the life of</li>
            <li> Normally can get really pricey in the stores.</li>
            <li> It provides an amazingly close shave, while moisturizing your skin (which is incredibly helpful, especially in the winter when you HATE shaving cream).</li>
            <li> /&gt;the razors stay sharp a good long while and they take weeks to even get a hint of rust.</li>
            <li> I have never had to purchase a new handle EVER!</li>
            <li> When I had the opportunity to once again use the Venus® Embrace® , it was a whole new world!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot less irritation when more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND these blades make it almost impossible to cut yourself...and the best part....get them on auto ship.. never have to think about picking them up at the store....</li>
            <li> Stop wasting your money when you can get a lot more for less.</li>
            <li> Agree with previous reviewers to either store it in the case or leave it blades-up somewhere safe in the shower otherwise</li>
            <li> This is my main product from now on.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the smoothness wears off fairly quick.</li>
            <li> Shai Trial Pack (for a quick example) is only 20 bucks and includes a handle and 18 cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that more blades would lead to a better shave.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think that razors should be so high priced, but I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy anything else but these, and highly recommend them and the razor.</li>
            <li> I just wish more came in a package and they could be a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe to use unlike many of the other razors I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sensitive but this is just the right amount of blades, and glides like butter!</li>
            <li> the razor reaches too much water in the shower, by falling from it&#x27;s post or being in a wetter spot, it almost ruins the razor by adhering itself to whatever it&#x27;s near or just becoming a goopy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They shave really close to the skin and afterwards you&#x27;ll have baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> Wow- this really is a much closer shave than the Quattro, which I have been using forever.</li>
            <li> It gives me a really close shave, while also keeping my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra couple bucks for 5 blades.</li>
            <li> My friends laugh, but it makes total sense.  </li>
            <li> They are definitely pricey, but really worth it.  </li>
            <li> i have recently received this razor complimentary from a website</li>
            <li> They last a long time and make my legs feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I thought these were the ones I normally order</li>
            <li> Normally I use conditioner as my shaving cream, but with the Olay blade I didn&#x27;t have to use an additional shaving cream--</li>
            <li> I actually recieved my Gillette Venus complimentary form</li>
            <li> Normally under these circumstances, I would end up with nicks and/or razor burn.</li>
            <li> It will last you longer then the cheaper ones and be the better buy in the long run.  </li>
            <li> These were a great value on here and will last me a long time without compromising a smooth shave or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> i will only use the Gillette Venus and all the different refills from now on goodbye old razors hello to my new favorite</li>
            <li> Took me awhile to figure out that I didn&#x27;t need to take the refills out of the package by hand, but simply just stick my razor wand and it pops right onto it.</li>
            <li> My friend and I saw, \\&quot;WAY CHEAPER THAN JUST BUYING NEW MACH BLADES!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> i will deffinatly keep using and buying new blades for my new venus razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely live the Venus embrace cartridges.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for new shaving stuff.  </li>
            <li> Every year the Venus Gillette company comes out with some new summer product.  </li>
            <li> Makes shaving easy and less painless.</li>
            <li> I blow on the blades, both sides, after using it and then blot carefully with a clean washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you let the razor dry completely before you put the plastic cap back on so</li>
            <li> That stuff is goopy when you&#x27;re shaving (for extra smooth glide of the razor I guess...) and dries solid.</li>
            <li> I was searching around for new razor blade styles, as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good quality, sharp blades and they last a long time (as they should, given the price).  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my legs for some reason</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this razor never bothers my skin.  </li>
            <li> My legs always feel so soft &amp; I don&#x27;t even use soap or shaving cream!  </li>
            <li> If you have marble tiles, definitely test it out on a spare piece first.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it, as long as I can get 3 weeks out of one cartridge.</li>
            <li> I love these shavers they are the only once I don&#x27;t have allergies to from other</li>
            <li> First it covers a much larger area</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is the price is a bit higher than I would like.</li>
            <li> First it covers a much larger area</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to nick myself again!  </li>
            <li> I have always used Venus since I was 14 years old!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades (these being gillette venus with 5 blades), and I&#x27;ve tried a few!</li>
            <li> I had received this complimentary from Influenster in my Cosmo Voxbox 2012, and was a bit skeptical over how good it actually worked.  </li>
            <li> The price is ridiculous but it really is worth it to not end up cut up and itchy from the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I recommend laying down the money and treating yourself to smooth</li>
            <li> they last long enough that the price is worth it because these last so much longer than the cheap 2 blade ones that sister uses.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get a close enough shave for long, plus with dull blades you get razor bumps more easily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this just made my skin feel soft and nourished instead of irritated.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a razor blade I actually like, much less love.</li>
            <li> Also, in certain areas, my hair grows in multiple directions.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary at first because of the price and the number of blades, so I had gotten my normal (same brand different style) and there was one of these free in the box.  </li>
            <li> They last for a very long time before having to replace them and get a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> I received this item for free from Influenster and I have to say I was shocked I really liked it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they last much longer than the others.</li>
            <li> At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall</li>
            <li> At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> They miss places on my legs even though I try to cover the whole area numerous times.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried it in the sensitive areas also.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> i have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> i have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re far too pricey.</li>
            <li> The whole blade unit itself is different.</li>
            <li> , it is not only very convenient to use but also  </li>
            <li> As far as the shower pod goes, it hangs on my shower wall without a problem unless I bang into it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it to hold extra cartridges though, for two reasons:  </li>
            <li> Venus offers razor blades for every imaginable need, skin type, and preference.</li>
            <li> And, on a silly note, For those of us who love Britcoms, the &#x27;5 blade&#x27; razor is reminiscent of the show Reginald Perrin starring Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) where the very idea of 5 blades was made fun of.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> My skin look soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy person who dislikes shaving, so</li>
            <li> The only flaw is you really do need to use the shower holder that holds it upright.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than buying individual packs at the store</li>
            <li> Although its pricey, you can use the blades for numerous shaves, and it not only gets close, but rarely nicks or cuts your skin.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but dang these are really good blades and my skin feels really soft, even when I don&#x27;t have time to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> They shave close, smooth and they seem to last longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll forget how careful you have to be with other razors because the Venus Embrace is so safe.  </li>
            <li> These give a smooth shave and last a long time, especially if you buy them off of Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Even though this is pretty expensive, it is the only kind of razor I prefer to use.</li>
            <li> I got my venus razor complimentary from Influenster a few weeks back, and I used a 5 blade for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> These certainly are expensive but if you shave quickly, or tend to cut yourself it will be worth the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really leaves your skin super soft, and its hard to miss a spot with the 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Peel back the packaging on the new cartridge, insert the razor handle until you hear a click, and voila!  </li>
            <li> I never cut myself, and with the little gel strips on the top and bottom you barely need shaving cream for the first few uses (but, use it anyway-</li>
            <li> It has just enough moisturizer on the blade head to eliminate shaving gels and creams, leave my skin satiny smooth, and still not get \\&quot;goopy\\&quot; or \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; when I set it down to</li>
            <li> I wish they lasted a while longer, 4-5 uses is the max without the blades becoming too dull.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I have to shave less with this razor since it&#x27;s such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> With the long handle, and pivoting head, it doesn&#x27;t really even FEEL like you are shaving...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cheap &#x27;throw away&#x27; razors in the past and they cut the hell out of your skin.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used it a few times for his face, and I have used it a few more times as well!</li>
            <li> Also, I really like that there are several different replaceable blades that you can choose from to put on the razor.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin (particularly on my legs)</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but she says they are great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> One of the major uses of the shower pod (for me) is to avoid having to store an opened box of cartridges somewhere else.</li>
            <li> They are a little more pricey than the other blade refills</li>
            <li> am a frugal shopper and it takes a lot for me to continue to buy products that are a little pricey, these however are worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be a little pricey but its worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I have gone back and forth numerous times between lots of different wet razors (schick, bic, venus original, venus breeze, etc.)</li>
            <li> It makes a HUGE difference, especially after doing it for a few weeks!)  </li>
            <li> Since I am a delicate lady, I like to have smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here really.</li>
            <li> But they do seem to last longer, so that partially offsets the higher</li>
            <li> They are the only razor that gets close enough to shave wonderfully but not cut the crap out of my legs.</li>
            <li> Venus Embrace will leave your legs silky smooth with very little effort!</li>
            <li> (I am a big lover of testing new products), but ALWAYS go back to my Venus razors.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to let the &amp;#34;ribbon&amp;#34; lay flat on a surface, as it will dissolve rather quickly and make shaving a lot more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Although I like the idea of the other Venus products with their built in lotions and exfoliants, those seem to keep me from getting a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors.</li>
            <li> so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors.</li>
            <li> Worth paying a little extra for these.</li>
            <li> but the one on the razor has lasted me a long time, about 2 weeks so far! &#x3D;</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that all Venus razor blades should fit interchangeably in the blade storage thingies that attach to walls with suction cups.</li>
            <li> I finally threw out the remaining blades and went back to my old blades.</li>
            <li> i have the entire Venus line in every possible color and design, and this one is the queen of all by far.</li>
            <li> i have the entire Venus line in every possible color and design, and this one is the queen of all by far.</li>
            <li> no nicks, no dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Gillette really needs to go down on the price of these razors.</li>
            <li> So, thanks to Amazon&#x27;s autoship, the price can come down</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).     </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dull out quickly at all.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that the blades tend to dull rather quickly.</li>
            <li> You will definitely want to shave slowly, as shaving quickly with this razor often results in cuts.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So will someone please tell me why these little buggers have to cost so much?</li>
            <li> Do I need to purchase a vacuum sealed container for my razor?</li>
            <li> Gillette has never let me down, improving upon the razors and the close shave with each new addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have extremely razor-rash prone skin or just sensitive skin, this is the razor for you.  </li>
            <li> They seem to work well and last long enough.  </li>
            <li> I actually used one of the 3-blade Venus cartridges that I had left over not too long ago...</li>
            <li> The razor falls off of the neck very easily if it falls, and I&#x27;d you put it on the shelf with the blue side down, it sticks to the shelf and leaves a weird feeling residue.</li>
            <li> Do not love, lotion wears away fast and clogs razors</li>
            <li> The moisture strips also add softness, at least for the first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer strips last a long time.</li>
            <li> and they do not last as long.  </li>
            <li> but they last for so long.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a close shave without cutting me and left my legs very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I do have a little trouble getting a close shave on the first swipe of my underarms and sometimes have to go over the same area a couple times in different directions, but it still doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted a bit longer, but it wears down evenly and does the job even when it&#x27;s near the end of it&#x27;s use..</li>
            <li> With every other razor (even the Breeze, which was my prior favorite) I had to slow way down and go carefully</li>
            <li> The razors will stay pretty sharp for a few uses and shave pretty close, but then seem to suddenly get REALLY dull, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Never have to worry about cutting myself and it gives a very smooth, long lasting shave.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I&#x27;ve ever been able to use without cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic price on an essential, expensive item.</li>
            <li> If you dry the blades and keep them dry this will last you several months..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always surprised by how pricey razor blade refills are, but these were slightly cheaper than the ones in store</li>
            <li> Each blade last very long too, it&#x27;s not just the aloe that lasts a long time..</li>
            <li> large and therefore hard to use in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> If you hardly have any hair, you probably don&#x27;t really need it.   </li>
            <li> If you hardly have any hair, you probably don&#x27;t really need it.&lt;br /&gt;i have tried</li>
            <li> I have tried other blades and other brands of razors, and the Venus Embrace is by far my favorites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these since 9th grade (9 years ago) and I will continue to buy them as long as they sell them).</li>
            <li> Been sitting on the shelf too long?</li>
            <li> I only have to wet the razor</li>
            <li> My legs are smoother than they have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> So my hair was quite long...</li>
            <li> refill lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Also, nothing falls off, so one cartridge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to buy it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I could not find the refill cartridges in my local store - only the disposable razor but I will be traveling for two months and these will take up much less room.  </li>
            <li> I mean REALLY with the price?</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use another razor, but I will say sometimes they are just a tad too sharp although even when I get a tiny nick, it has never hurt.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the other types of Gillette Venus razors and I keep coming back to the Embrace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Venus blades and always go back to the Embrace.  </li>
            <li> the venus embrace razor seems to last longer than other brands of razors I have used.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this razor to other women.  </li>
            <li> but the shave gel bars would get dry and fall off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get the last laugh as my guy friends who are too insecure to shave with Venus Embrace, get nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li> I was buying the Gillette Fusion for my boyfriend, but when I made a comment about the quality of women&#x27;s razor blades getting worse and worse, he said he preferred using my razor blades to his own.</li>
            <li> Well... I&#x27;m single again</li>
            <li> These are not good for shaving the bikini area, or really any area.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; usually shave with electric.  </li>
            <li> With previous razors I had to shave those spots repeatedly in different directions, using a lot of pressure, to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> In my opinion I&#x27;m less likely to knick myself using these and the shave lasts longer</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if I use this razor an this system that I do not have the same rashes and I experience a lot less pain.  </li>
            <li> yes it is more expensive but to me they last longer than other razors I never change the head because it gets dull, every month or so</li>
            <li> The blades are set back in the head, so sometimes you have to push down a little bit to get the smaller hairs.</li>
            <li> stays sharp a long time.  </li>
            <li> But with these razors I haven&#x27;t had a single cut or instance of razor burn!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to go for the five blades on the Embrace (five blades seems not only kind of excessive but also scary!)</li>
            <li> only complaint is that sometimes my razor will get stuck to the tub if I put it down wet, and the blue stuff around the outside of the blade dries to the tub.</li>
            <li> but I do feel as though they could last a little longer.</li>
            <li> and I feel like for the price they should just last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Stop using those cheapo drugstore razors, spend a little extra to get Venus.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay sharp for very long</li>
            <li> That lead to painful razor burn, and so most of the time I just tolerated a rough shave there.</li>
            <li> A birthday present for my late teen daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the Venus embrace</li>
            <li> I can get by on these with minimal skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> but always when in a hurry (certainly not as much as when I was using single/double blade disposables).  </li>
            <li> Not much of a difference</li>
            <li> They seem to get the job done with minimal fuss and razor burn.</li>
            <li> Had to buy online as I our local store was having trouble getting these stocked for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> The lower (cheaper) blades in this product line are somewhat rough, IMO.</li>
            <li> Gillette Venus Embrace Women&#x27;s Razor Blade refills do everything they are expected to do.  </li>
            <li> The expected razor burn around my neckline usually associated with using standard multi blade razors never showed up.</li>
            <li> the first razor out of the pack went dull within a week (less than 5 shaves), which is very disappointing considering that these razors aren&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> When I put it flat on a shelf it melts down onto the shelf and glues the razor to the shelf and is a gloppy mess.</li>
            <li> I use them about every other day, and each razor lasts about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well the shower pad would stay attached to other surfaces, like glossy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well the shower pad would stay attached to other surfaces, like glossy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost never cut myself while using it, compared to some other brands of razors.</li>
            <li> Warning: After using the five blade razors you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to use any other kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just like all other razors, they gradually lose their sharpness - how soon that happens, depends on your shaving frequency.</li>
            <li> I have tried other venus brands and gave up hope of finding one that would work for me.</li>
            <li> It is all she uses for her armpits, legs, and other areas.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t buy them all the time due to the cost.  </li>
            <li> During the laser hair removal process I cannot use any other hair removal method to remove hair from face other than shaving.</li>
            <li> is that the razor blades are compatible with other Gillette shave handles.</li>
            <li> I have used different brands of razors in the  past</li>
            <li> The blades are interchangeable with any other Venus handle...</li>
            <li> (compared all the other times I use other razors...</li>
            <li> They stay sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these razors forever and do not have to replace them as often as other razors.</li>
            <li> So much better than any other Venus razor they&#x27;ve made, and I was even disappointed to begin with--</li>
            <li> My sister has some troubles with her underarm area due her armpit shape.</li>
            <li> The razor works well for legs and other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> I never had razor burn, cuts or any other problems with this blade.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase my razors from any other company.  </li>
            <li> I am not affiliated with the company in any way (other than being a fan)</li>
            <li> I also use this to shave any other body part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every other razor but nothing comes close to this one.</li>
            <li> With other razor I am changing them every week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been around for awhile, since back when we were barbarians who shaved with only ONE measly blade in our razors, and women generally had to use men&#x27;s razors, or choose to shave with something that looked like a birth control dispenser (I&#x27;m looking at you, Flicker).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only the blades themselves, but the head of the razor- the razor head swivels all the way back, so you can shave behind your knees and in other places without worry about nicks.</li>
            <li> It works really well at cutting from multiple directions.</li>
            <li> but that is sometimes my fault because I&#x27;m a little too rough.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s only 4-6 uses before they&#x27;re dull</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hard to go back.</li>
            <li> They go dull after only like 2-3 uses and the way the razor bends doesn&#x27;t help a close shave.</li>
            <li> The only time I got razor burns from this was when I was rushing or the blades were dull.</li>
            <li> The bad cartridges didn&#x27;t shave as smoothly</li>
            <li> The bad cartridges didn&#x27;t shave as smoothly</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why this is so expensive though.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: When you&#x27;re done using it, don&#x27;t place it blade down on anything.</li>
            <li> i.e., if you lay the razor down on the counter, the side of the tub, etc.</li>
            <li> remember to not place the razor face down because it will get all slimy.</li>
            <li> Now that I broke down  and tried the &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; blade that is all I will use from here on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the bumps or razor burn that other razors leave!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean you SHOULD be total jerks about it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My legs usually feel dry and itchy after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Typically if I shave my legs at 10 am, there will be stubble by 10 pm.</li>
            <li> I also experience less in-grown hairs while using this, too.</li>
            <li> I spend less time in the shower shaving.</li>
            <li> they foam much less than men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> they foam much less than men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Keeping it hidden from my two teenaged girls.</li>
            <li> I think they may have a slightly longer lifespan than others as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I noticed about the blades is that I did not need to rinse it as often as with the previous razor that I had been using.</li>
            <li> [i previously just used men&#x27;s razors].</li>
            <li> It blade takes so long to dull.</li>
            <li> this razor is a bulky mess</li>
            <li> the moisturizing gel on it does not become a mess.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my daughter in college who&#x27;s on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> i  guess ill put a new head on.</li>
            <li> And they last forever without getting dull!  </li>
            <li> what I don&#x27;t like is that for some reason there is a little sticky strip on the blades and it causes the blades to stick to whatever it comes in contact with.  </li>
            <li> I wish they were a little cheaper though...</li>
            <li> It has 5 chances to get them with all the little mini blades moving at once.</li>
            <li> .. feel like it should be a little closer with all of those blades.</li>
            <li> always remembered it being too large and sticky, awkward to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very dark too, but</li>
            <li> The 5 wide blades make it hard to miss spots.</li>
            <li> I am not changing my five-star rating yet, but I will be paying attention to whether the bad box was a fluke, or a warning of quality control problems.shower pod \\&quot;cute\\&quot; over making it useful for storage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remained firmly attached for months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remained firmly attached for months.</li>
            <li> I have been using these razor cartridges for for a few years</li>
            <li> Ordering with Prime saves you a few bucks from any chain store just about anywhere.</li>
            <li> A few strokes and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> A few strokes and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Venus Embrace for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It hugs the curves of my legs and gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with any razor, without missing a hair.  </li>
            <li> I have half a mind to stop shaving altogether!</li>
            <li> And I have a lot less ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> For those of you that have a hard time getting a close shave with other razors, give these a try.  </li>
            <li> if you put it on the shelf with the blue side down, it sticks to the shelf and leaves a weird feeling residue.</li>
            <li> the area surrounding the blades is too wide and it makes it hard to get a close shave on those \\&quot;hard to reach</li>
            <li> It delivers on all points and lasts several months per head (shaving every 3-4 days or so; when it is cold and I&#x27;m wearing pants all the time I don&#x27;t shave every other day).</li>
            <li> They provide a close shave with very little pressure; I never get nicks.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive only to go dull in so little time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beyond price gouging and it&#x27;s long impacted my opinion of your company and left a bad taste in my mouth,</li>
            <li> No more nicks and cuts since we started using Gillette&#x27;s Venus Embrace.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched as razor manufacturers&#x27; hubris grew; I truly thought it knew no bounds, and was as pointless an escalation as our arms race with the USSR.</li>
            <li> I usually use the creams that you apply, wait, then rub off.</li>
            <li> I am not sure.</li>
            <li> I always am left with uncomfortable cuts.</li>
            <li> Not sure of price compared to WalMart,</li>
            <li> As usual Gillette delivers a quality product.  </li>
            <li> I think I had been using this blade for a while on the past but upon trying to purchase it at the store could not remember which one it was, so I resorted to using my husband&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> Usually I shred my legs into confetti but these blades do the job without the nicks.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Hambone</li>
            <li> But for the past couple years, this was the one I returned to.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy them at Target</li>
            <li> I usually use disposable razors then throw them out after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> They do not do well on very heavy growth, and the cost of the refills are, in my opinion, exorbitant.  </li>
            <li> but it is hard to cut yourself with this one - unless you overdo it or if you have very little hair.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to cut yourself with this one - unless you overdo it or if you have very little hair.</li>
            <li> The razors seemed dull.</li>
            <li> I typically shave my legs every single day, year round, so I notice stubble immediately - hate that.</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> Be wary of other Venus blades that don&#x27;t have the five blades.  </li>
            <li> I usually go about a month in between changing cartriges!  </li>
            <li> I have to tear it off the tub, which ruins the blue stuff and leaves crap on my tub.</li>
            <li> Going from a 3 blade to a 5 blade is a serious jump.</li>
            <li> Seriously, upgrade and you&#x27;ll thank yourself and each one of these 5 blades.</li>
            <li> I found it was less expensive on amazon.</li>
            <li> Seriously ... they chop hair off my wife&#x27;s legs.</li>
            <li> I also like that the company comes out with coupons to make the product less expensive</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> The ones I ordered here are not good.</li>
            <li> Yay for hardly any noticeable stubble!</li>
            <li> and I used the razor, and it was like shaving hair that was hardly there!</li>
            <li> I used this product and its great,But the razor can rust,After using this for one weak</li>
            <li> If the shave was not excellent, nick-free and &#x27;bloodless&#x27;, I would use a less expensive razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, c&#x27;mon!</li>
            <li> I feel like I like the sleekness of this razor, but the bulkiness of the blade head is a little awkward for me in some spots.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin and get the worst rashes when shaving but with these disposables I have no issues.</li>
            <li> I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> I used to think that my legs must be horrible because different razors never got as close as these do, so I seemed to always have stubble.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re expensive</li>
            <li> Expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry</li>
            <li> They shouldn&#x27;t be this expensive.</li>
            <li> I just found these have me a mediocre shave.</li>
            <li> There are expensive, but long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I hope to never again buy these from any store, it&#x27;s just way to expensive for something you have to use basically for the rest of your life.</li>
            <li> Any other razor gives me nasty razor burn.</li>
            <li> Or put it in an inconvenient place like the kitchen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use these.  </li>
            <li> As for cutting I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it cutting me.</li>
            <li> I should have returned this product but was in desperate need of a razor.</li>
            <li> but I always end up cutting myself.</li>
            <li> : They&#x27;re expensive!</li>
            <li> Geez Louise these are expensive!</li>
            <li> Boy was Reggie wrong!</li>
            <li> They are very expensive though.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of issues in the past with painful razor burn and horrific rashes.  </li>
            <li> It is practically impossible to cut yourself with them.  </li>
            <li> I got a bad batch.</li>

            <li> she sayw its bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> Then I thought it was just one bad razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried others but get bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bad about ordering razors</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I must be doing wrong, but I&#x27;m having a terrible time w/these cartridges.</li>
            <li> However, upon getting these razors, I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I promise that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Despite the reviews here, i am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> I hated these.</li>
            <li> Try them and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> - they&#x27;re probably terrible for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning these because the razor they go with is horrible.  </li>

            <li> Keeps my wife&#x27;s underarms and legs silky smooth, just like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> These are great right out of the box but I do feel as though they could last a little longer. When they&#x27;re nearing the end they really don&#x27;t work at all and I feel like for the price they should just last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Great razor blades only get better by using Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> I love my original Venus razor and the three blade version refills. I tried this five blade Embrace version when it was on sale, figuring five blades would be better than just three. Not so much... I typically shave my legs every single day, year round, so I notice stubble immediately - hate that. The Embrace razor blade just doesn&#x27;t get as close and it does leave stubble if you skip a day or two. I never had the before with three blade original. One good thing about the Embrace, the moisturizer strip is really good.</li>
            <li> These razors are great! I don&#x27;t get the bumps or razor burn that other razors leave! Venus is incredibly made!</li>
            <li> Love these, they are the only ones I will use. Yes..they are more expensive however&lt;br /&gt;they last much longer than the others. I believe it is because of the extra blades...I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;tried others by Venus but these are the best!</li>
            <li> These always make my legs feel smoother. I wouldn&#x27;t use another razor, but I will say sometimes they are just a tad too sharp although even when I get a tiny nick, it has never hurt.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors I&#x27;ve found. They leave skin smooth. They are MUCH cheaper on Amazon than they are in the box stores.</li>
            <li> Love everything about these razors but the price.  I use them about every other day, and each razor lasts about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors. Love having them brought to my door.</li>
            <li> I love these razors, but I only tend to buy them as a treat because of how expensive they are.</li>
            <li> Although I like the idea of the other Venus products with their built in lotions and exfoliants, those seem to keep me from getting a very close shave.  This is the maximum close shave you can get with a Venus product.  I have coarse leg hair and this is the best woman&#x27;s razor blade I have found.</li>
            <li> I love these razors, I have since I was a teenager, and probably will forever! The perfect, close shave, they last 2+ weeks, and you don&#x27;t need shaving cream! On Amazon, it&#x27;s a much better price than I can get them for in the store, and I don&#x27;t have to remember to get them every couple months.</li>
            <li> I will first say that I&#x27;ve been using a men&#x27;s Mach 3 for years after having first tried the Venus forever ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always remembered it being too large and sticky, awkward to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this, the Venus \\&quot;EMBRACE,\\&quot; at Target a couple of weeks ago I honestly mistook \\&quot;5 blades\\&quot; for there being FIVE refill blades in the package with the new razor... My friend and I saw, \\&quot;WAY CHEAPER THAN JUST BUYING NEW MACH BLADES!\\&quot; (DOH!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five blades meant five blades of SUCK on two \\&quot;refill\\&quot; packages that came with the new crumby and too large razor and a \\&quot;razor and refill holder\\&quot; that won&#x27;t stay on the wall of my shower for the life of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the razor reaches too much water in the shower, by falling from it&#x27;s post or being in a wetter spot, it almost ruins the razor by adhering itself to whatever it&#x27;s near or just becoming a goopy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it CUTS me! I&#x27;ve never cut my armpits while shaving before with my Mach 3, but with this, I&#x27;ve cut my armpits, my bikini area bleeds, my legs don&#x27;t get as close a shave as I&#x27;d like... this razor is a bulky mess and I DON&#x27;T recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love these razors! They&#x27;ve replaced my Mach 3</li>
            <li> These razors give the smoothest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I can run the razor over my skin fast, with very light pressure, and it still shaves perfectly. For the first time in my life, I can shave fearlessly on my kneecaps, the backs of my lower legs (around the Achilles tendons), and in the bikini area. With every other razor (even the Breeze, which was my prior favorite) I had to slow way down and go carefully or I&#x27;d nick myself in those spots. So I can shave faster! I shave in the shower, and I don&#x27;t find shave gel or foam to be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problems with razor burn and bumps in the underarm and bikini area are over. Also, in certain areas, my hair grows in multiple directions. With previous razors I had to shave those spots repeatedly in different directions, using a lot of pressure, to get a close shave. That lead to painful razor burn, and so most of the time I just tolerated a rough shave there. No more! I still have to go over those spots more than once, but I can do it fast and with light pressure. Now I get a smooth shave and NO razor burn in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things I don&#x27;t like about the Embrace cartridges:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: They&#x27;re expensive! But they do seem to last longer, so that partially offsets the higher cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size: They&#x27;re big. The only reason this is a problem for me is the shower pod: Although the Embrace cartridges do fit the Breeze handle, they *don&#x27;t* fit in the Breeze shower pod.  I ended up buying an Embrace starter pack with a handle and shower pod so I could store the cartridges in the shower pod.  I didn&#x27;t realize until I opened the starter pack that the Embrace shower pod only holds *two* cartridges. So when you open a 4-pack of cartridges, you&#x27;ll have to keep the extra cartridges somewhere else. One of the major uses of the shower pod (for me) is to avoid having to store an opened box of cartridges somewhere else. It looks to me as though the designers prioritized making the shower pod \\&quot;cute\\&quot; over making it useful for storage. At least the shower pod keeps the razor safely up on the wall so it doesn&#x27;t get knocked onto the shower floor and stepped on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Another reviewer reported that the shower pod keeps detaching from the wall. I have mine mounted fairly high in a spot where it doesn&#x27;t get bumped and rarely gets splashed. It&#x27;s remained firmly attached for months. I also have a fiberglass shower. I don&#x27;t know how well the shower pad would stay attached to other surfaces, like glossy tile.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: The Embrace cartridge gives a truly superior shave. It&#x27;s worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: April 11, 2011: Wouldn&#x27;t you know it, shortly after I wrote this glowing review I got a bad batch. The bad cartridges didn&#x27;t shave as smoothly and I had some mild razor burn with them. They also seemed to dull more quickly. Since the bad batch I had tried another box and they worked well again. I am not changing my five-star rating yet, but I will be paying attention to whether the bad box was a fluke, or a warning of quality control problems.shower pod \\&quot;cute\\&quot; over making it useful for storage.

            <li> BEST BLADES AND LOVE THE SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE OPTION</li>
            <li> Price per blade is very good</li>
            <li> Venus is super pricey, even on Amazon, but I really like this particular model of razor because they don&#x27;t have copious amounts of moisturizer (aka gunk) that ends up falling off or getting everywhere and generally making every shave after the first one a bit of a pain in the ass.</li>
            <li> Best ladies razor I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> No need to write review, they are great</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite razors.</li>
            <li> This razor provides a very close shave, I really like this razor. I use to use the Shick Intuition. I used it for about 5 years and then began noticing that I wasn&#x27;t getting a close shave, as when I started using it. So I decided to try out a new type of razor, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I love that I can shave my legs at night and the following afternoon still have smooth legs!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to know if using a razor with replaceable cartridges was better than a disposal so I conducted a test - one leg for each type. I never nicked myself with the Venus and the shave lasted longer. I&#x27;m sold and will stick with the Venus!</li>
            <li> These last a lot longer than the Venus Olay/Spa. I&#x27;ve tried the 3 blade razors as well by Venus and will never switch back. This razor simply gets closer and the shave lasts a lot longer. I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot less irritation when more blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply a great product. Well worth the extra couple bucks for 5 blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are great, of course!  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I hated these. I used them alone, in the shower, with shavegel, you  name it, and I couldn&#x27;t get a good shave. You need to use a lot of water for them to work, and you need to rely on the moisture strip. I still had razor stubble both times I used these! I finally threw out the remaining blades and went back to my old blades. I have the most success with the Venus Original used with Aveeno Theraputic Shave Gel.</li>
            <li> I found the Embrace to be the best shaving system by Venus so far. The results were a super close, smooth shave. Left my legs feeling silky. I wish that feeling would last longer!</li>
            <li> I have been using these razor cartridges for for a few years and I am very please with the results gives a very good shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I must be doing wrong, but I&#x27;m having a terrible time w/these cartridges. I&#x27;ve used the Venus Divine for years and never had a problem, but these leave my legs STINGING every time I shave.  I&#x27;ve tried shaving at different times (beginning/end of shower for steaming) and w/several creams. No luck. Stinging and lingering razor burn every. time. I want to return them!</li>
            <li> I used this product and its great,But the razor can rust,After using this for one weak my razor started rusting,Other than that its great.</li>
            <li> I love the venus embrace.&lt;br /&gt;I am a frugal shopper and it takes a lot for me to continue to buy products that are a little pricey, these however are worth it!&lt;br /&gt;The 5 blades give a clean smooth shave and whether im shaving dry, in the shower, with lotion, cream, or nothing this gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the razors stay sharp a good long while and they take weeks to even get a hint of rust. I recommend laying down the money and treating yourself to smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fits on any venus handle so you can buy and venus variety catridges!</li>
            <li> Typically if I shave my legs at 10 am, there will be stubble by 10 pm. Not the case with these. By 10 pm they are still silky smooth. No irritation either. I am a happy camper. I&#x27;ve used the original Venus razors before and was satisfied enough with them, but these are considerably better.</li>
            <li> Feels way more comfortable than 1 or two blades but not a huge step up from 3 blades altought it is a bit better.</li>
            <li> I love the Venus Embrace Razor!  I feel like it provides a much &amp;#34;closer to the skin&amp;#34; shave.  My legs always feel so soft &amp; I don&#x27;t even use soap or shaving cream!  Would definitely recommend this product &amp; will be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> Geez Louise these are expensive! I have half a mind to stop shaving altogether! I get these on subscribe and save and I still pay over $3 per cartridge. This is comparable with the prices of other razorblades but these aren&#x27;t that great. They don&#x27;t stay sharp for very long so you don&#x27;t get a close enough shave for long, plus with dull blades you get razor bumps more easily. For some reason these rust easily too. I try to keep my razor out of the shower area when I&#x27;m not using it so it won&#x27;t rust, but just being in the humidity has been rusting my blade. Do I need to purchase a vacuum sealed container for my razor? Or put it in an inconvenient place like the kitchen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the slimmest Venus blades I can find, so they are better for shaving in a smaller area like the bikini area. These fit all Venus razors, not just the Embrace. I used to the Venus Breeze but the shave gel bars would get dry and fall off and I could not have my bikini line with it because of how big it was. Also, the Embrace has 5 blades so it should be better at giving a close shave. The first or second use is great, but after that the blade is already beginning to dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use foaming cream, instead I use Coochy Cream (I know, funny name) shave gel (available on here) and get the best shave ever. I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive only to go dull in so little time.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and am extremely prone to razor burn on my thighs and in the \\&quot;bikini area.\\&quot; Venus Embrace blades are the best I&#x27;ve used both in terms of minimizing irritation and getting an amazingly smooth shave. I&#x27;m guessing it has something to do contour of the razor head as well as having moisture ribbons on both the top and the bottom, but whatever the reason I&#x27;m glad I found these and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors in the Venus line. They give a very smooth shave and I have never cut myself. They are very expensive though. I never purchase these without a coupon. Gillette really needs to go down on the price of these razors.</li>
            <li> These are awesome razors for women they shave very well.</li>
            <li> So will someone please tell me why these little buggers have to cost so much? I mean, c&#x27;mon! Sure, they are good but for the amount of time they last, it gets pretty spendy.</li>
            <li> I have used the venus embrace razor and blades for many years. Gives a close and very smooth shave. I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive in the stores. I was glad to see them on Amazon at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> They work super well!</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that I trust on my hair follicles! I&#x27;m not sensitive but this is just the right amount of blades, and glides like butter! Your hair will thank you!</li>
            <li> Daughter uses this brand. No complaints.</li>
            <li> These are some good blades, glide smoothly and I never cut my self using these</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. You get a close, smooth shave. A bit of warning when I had my master bathroom shower replaced with marble tiles, the cream strip on this razor left a drip mark that permanently stained the marble. If you have marble tiles, definitely test it out on a spare piece first. It&#x27;s the moisture strip that made the stain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man.  I admit it: I shave my face with a woman&#x27;s razor.  My friends laugh, but it makes total sense.  Which razor would provide a smoother shave - a product marketed towards women, or one marketed towards men?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women know comfort.  They know how to get a smooth shave.  They know these subjects way better than men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll get the last laugh as my guy friends who are too insecure to shave with Venus Embrace, get nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for over a year now and think they are the best. They offer me the closest shave compared to a others I have used. They don&#x27;t dull out quickly at all. I also like that I have never nicked myself with these and have never gotten that \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; feeling. I hihgly recommend these.</li>
            <li> These blades are the only ones that get a close enough shave. I can use them multiple times without them dulling or rusting.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that razors should be so high priced, but I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I used to use my husband&#x27;s razors because women&#x27;s razors always left me with cuts (and didn&#x27;t remove all the hair). These actually are far better than even the ones I used to use of my husband&#x27;s...they leave your legs hair-free and very smooth. I have these on auto-delivery, and love the convenience of that.</li>
            <li> I love Venus products and have used them for many years. I have very sensitive skin on my legs for some reason so it took a while to find the right blade. When the Embrace came out I fell in love. It gives me a great shave and smooth skin. The only downfall is that the blades tend to dull rather quickly. Sometimes it&#x27;s only 4-6 uses before they&#x27;re dull but sometimes they last a bit longer. The moisturizer strips last a long time. They tend to outlive the blades, actually.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I love these, but they dull fast so cost a whole lot more in the long run. But if you have sensitive skin like me, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> My favorite Venus razor by far! I just wish more came in a package and they could be a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but so pricey.  It&#x27;s like that everwhere.  Last longer than reg blade.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Venus 3 blade.  I purchased this at the grocery store.  My legs are so soft and smooth!!  And I have a lot less ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> Best blades! Five blades gives you the smoothest shave. Ordering with Prime saves you a few bucks from any chain store just about anywhere. What a racket. Dang, these are really good tho.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors my daughter can shave with. Her legs end up smooth and unirritated. I wanted her to use the Venus 3-blade razor (cheaper!) but it leaves her with razor burn, red bumps, etc. So, thanks to Amazon&#x27;s autoship, the price can come down and she can have a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> These are great. Smooth shave and no nicks!</li>
            <li> Great razors! Normally can get really pricey in the stores. I got them so fast too, it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Will be shopping for more in the future. Thanks</li>
            <li> I used to use these razors for years and was always left with cuts and razor burn. Now I&#x27;d never use a Venus razor again.</li>
            <li> Great deal for these razors.  They are quite a saving from buying in the supermarket.  I will purchase again in future.</li>
            <li> These are the best... always a close shave AND these blades make it almost impossible to cut yourself...and the best part....get them on auto ship.. never have to think about picking them up at the store....the price is better than any discount store...Absolutely love the convenience</li>
            <li> Writing this on behalf of my wife. She says these razors are miracle workers. She believes that they provide the best shave she has gotten thus far in life. Overall, definitely the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Even though this is pretty expensive, it is the only kind of razor I prefer to use. I&#x27;ve almost never cut myself while using it, compared to some other brands of razors. The 5-blade system also ensures a smooth shave - with other razors, I have to go over the same area more times to get my skin completely smooth. This is a time-saver and safe for my skin. I also experience less in-grown hairs while using this, too.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use these.  Going from a 3 blade to a 5 blade is a serious jump. I&#x27;m happy to report no Knicks or razor burn. These feel great, I wondered if it was getting a close shave because of the slimy moisturizer that it imparts, but it does! Seems pricey at $3 each but I think it&#x27;s worth it, as long as I can get 3 weeks out of one cartridge.</li>
            <li> Good price and good quality. I love how I don&#x27;t get any cuts from this blade. It&#x27;s safe to use unlike many of the other razors I have tried in the past. I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Good price for refills</li>
            <li> These razors are great. I rarely cut my legs with them. They shave really close to the skin and afterwards you&#x27;ll have baby soft skin. I&#x27;ve been buying these since 9th grade (9 years ago) and I will continue to buy them as long as they sell them).</li>
            <li> Ever since I found these razors, my legs have been super smooth. I used to think that my legs must be horrible because different razors never got as close as these do, so I seemed to always have stubble. Now, I always have silky legs. Yay!</li>
            <li> I love these razors, do not nick and leave my legs feeling sexy and smooth (just like the commercials).  Will continue to invest in these razors.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I&#x27;ve ever been able to use without cutting myself.  The \\&quot;ribbon of moisture\\&quot; does a pretty thorough job, so you can get away without shave gel if you need to.  The razors will stay pretty sharp for a few uses and shave pretty close, but then seem to suddenly get REALLY dull, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I wish they lasted a while longer, 4-5 uses is the max without the blades becoming too dull.</li>
            <li> My favorite blades, and they really do work better than the 3 blade ones. Just wish they weren&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> Always use these they are great.</li>
            <li> love my legs smooth and these blades work great for me</li>
            <li> I love these shavers they are the only once I don&#x27;t have allergies to from other once I get pimples</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic price on an essential, expensive item. It came in undamaged, factory packaging. This is a good subscribe &amp; save item.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are so great. They give the closet shave ever. I was used to a three blade razor and going to the 5 blade made a huge difference. They give a completely smooth shave. The price is pretty good plus I get them on the subscribe and save program which is another great program offered by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the Venus embrace but I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. I actually like using the men&#x27;s gilette fusion a lot better&lt;br /&gt;I like the five blades and stuff but I feel like they&#x27;re cheaply made and I get more razor burns and in grown hair with these. I think I&#x27;ll be going back to the gilette fusion after I finish this pack.</li>
            <li> There really aren&#x27;t that many choices out there for ladies razors but Venus Embrace gets the job done well and painlessly. The subscribe and save option makes life much easier and cheaper.</li>
            <li> No more nicks and cuts since we started using Gillette&#x27;s Venus Embrace.  Getting the cartidges through subscribe and save makes it simple and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time shaver and I started shaving at my age of 13 yrs. old. My mom wouldn&#x27;t let me shave &#x27;cause she sayw its bad for your skin. But no. At first I used the disposable razors from the Target brand, but when I saw this here at Amazon, I thought it would be cool to buy the Venus razor itself at a store and just buy the refill cartridges here at Amazon and that&#x27;s what I did! I bought the Venus Embrace razor at Target for only 4.99!! Good deal for a razor. I didn&#x27;t buy the one with the showerpod &#x27;cause it costs more plus I don&#x27; want my mom to see it. So I bought the purple one. (There&#x27;s one that just come by itself) I shaved after and I didn&#x27;t get any cuts, nicks or razors burns. It&#x27;s the best razor ever.I use a soap for shaving not the gel. But I think I&#x27;m gonna try the Satin Care. And after shaving, don&#x27;t wrap this razor with tissue &#x27;cause it&#x27;s gonna stick with the moisture strip and it&#x27;s not good. But all in all I love this razor. If you&#x27;re a first time shaver like me, you should totally try this!! :)And this is not a razor it&#x27;s only  refill cartridges[[ASIN:B0013MTHWQ Gillette Venus  Embrace Cartridge, 4-count]], but you should buy the razor too!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but dang these are really good blades and my skin feels really soft, even when I don&#x27;t have time to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I choose this because i had one before and need to by one for my daughter with good quality and better price. Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> There is nothing like five blades to give you a nice close, comfortable shave without any nicks or cuts!&lt;br /&gt;The Venus Embrace will leave your legs silky smooth with very little effort!</li>
            <li> My favorite razor blade by far! This provides a smooth, nick-free shave.</li>
            <li> I love this razor because it has a smooth shave. I started to use years ago since it first came out. I love it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  They miss places on my legs even though I try to cover the whole area numerous times.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave! I am a fan! They will last longer if you store your razor out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I was searching around for new razor blade styles, as I have very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Venus razors since I started shaving, so I wanted to stay with this brand. However, upon getting these razors, I was really disappointed. The shave wasn&#x27;t close, causing me to get razor burn from going over the same spot too many times. Additionally, the moisture bands got gross and gooey after 2 showers.</li>
            <li> These are best razor cartridges that I have found. I can use them for months and still get a better shave than the 1st time using those 4 blade disposable razors. I use them with shaving cream and get a close shave pretty much every time for months. I do have a little trouble getting a close shave on the first swipe of my underarms and sometimes have to go over the same area a couple times in different directions, but it still doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. These were a great value on here and will last me a long time without compromising a smooth shave or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different disposables and figured that this would be a cheaper route. I saw many review and have always liked the Venus line. This Embrace razor has done the trick! It is a close save and does not irritate my skin! Will continue to buy in the future!</li>
            <li> I swear I only get a close shave with my Venus Embrace blades. I love the convenience of being able to get them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Work good but not sure if much better then the 3 blade one I used before trying this.  They are definitely way too expensive since they don&#x27;t  last more than 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love the Venus embrace. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Never have to worry about cutting myself and it gives a very smooth, long lasting shave.</li>
            <li> Warning: After using the five blade razors you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to use any other kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave that these things give is terrific. I never cut myself, and with the little gel strips on the top and bottom you barely need shaving cream for the first few uses (but, use it anyway- it&#x27;ll last longer). These razor blades will last for months if you need them to. When I don&#x27;t have the money to throw at these things I have used one razor for months. It&#x27;s not the most comfortable shave you&#x27;ll ever have but it&#x27;s better than a four blade lol. These certainly are expensive but if you shave quickly, or tend to cut yourself it will be worth the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: When you&#x27;re done using it, don&#x27;t place it blade down on anything. The gel strips will be used up much more quickly and will attach themselves to the surface they are placed onto (don&#x27;t worry, not permanently).</li>
            <li> I love this particular Embrace razor blade refill over some of the later kinds, which offer more lotion and less efficiency.  However, my local stores have replaced the former with the latter, so I am thrilled to find that they are still made and are available.</li>
            <li> It blade takes so long to dull. the strips are intact for a good amount of time. love that you don&#x27;t have to soap-up to use this product, the strips work that good. would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> While I really like the smoothness of the shave I get from these blades - what I don&#x27;t like is that for some reason there is a little sticky strip on the blades and it causes the blades to stick to whatever it comes in contact with.  i.e., if you lay the razor down on the counter, the side of the tub, etc. it sticks there!  Kind of a nuisance.  However, I do get one of the smoothest shaves I have ever gotten -- so I continue to order the blades, and just kind of deal with the stick strip!</li>
            <li> No cuts with this cartridge. Also glides easily. Make sure you let the razor dry completely before you put the plastic cap back on so the moisturizing gel on it does not become a mess.</li>
            <li> Love me some Venus Embrace. My legs feel AWESOME. Never been a fan of women&#x27;s razors until now, but gal-darn, these are worth it.</li>
            <li> The greatest shave ever comes from Venus.  Embrace is a bit cheaper than Olay, so you can pick which one you prefer.  I like how it comes in 4 and you can subscribe on Amazon... makes things a lot easier.  Venus is the best!</li>
            <li> I love receiving the gillette razors because it saves me a trip to the store. It always arrives on time when I almost running low on the razors.</li>
            <li> Great, thanks! Much cheaper than buying in-store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these refills for a while now, and they&#x27;ve held up pretty well. Matter of fact I&#x27;ve used one head for about a couple months. Anyone asking if you need shaving cream or not I&#x27;ve used my body wash as shaving cream sometimes because I ran out. I shaves very nice on the skin, it leaves your legs feeling AMAZING. I&#x27;ve used it for armpits/legs/ and I&#x27;ve tried it in the sensitive areas also. I&#x27;ve gotten a couple razor bumps in that area but that is sometimes my fault because I&#x27;m a little too rough. As for cutting I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it cutting me. The downfall for these sometimes the heads can feel slimy because the top and bottom part of the razors (I call them moisture bars) And they&#x27;re expensive BUT they last WAY longer than regular disposables.</li>
            <li> Not Imoressed with the number of shaves you get from one blade.  Expensive.  I have gotten more shaves from disposable razors. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors and seem to have gone up in price in the stores.  This was a great deal</li>
            <li> These razor blades beat all others I&#x27;ve tried. Gives a smooth, close shave and does a great job eliminating nicks.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Just what I needed!</li>
            <li> As far as razors go, these are very very good and luckily you can use them more than once and they still keep doing it very good job. You do get your money&#x27;s worth out of them.</li>
            <li> The razors seemed dull. Maybe I need to try men&#x27;s razors. I should have returned this product but was in desperate need of a razor. Then I thought it was just one bad razor. Nope, all of them. Been sitting on the shelf too long? Can that even happen? Or did the quality just significantly decrease? It&#x27;s a ploy to get us to buy more razors. But we have no choice really but to keep on buying them.</li>
            <li> Love these razors! I have really sensitive skin and they are the only thing that don&#x27;t irritate me. They leave my legs silky smooth and moisturized. I wish they were a little cheaper though...</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted a bit longer, but it wears down evenly and does the job even when it&#x27;s near the end of it&#x27;s use..</li>
            <li> Love my razors! Keep my legs smooth.....and keeps a man</li>
            <li> These work really well!</li>
            <li> Do not love, lotion wears away fast and clogs razors</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a razor blade I actually like, much less love. The only time a razor has truly wowed me was when Gillette first came out with the Sensor Excel for men many years ago, but they are not the same quality anymore and don&#x27;t work as good as they used to. I&#x27;m only 30, and I&#x27;m already saying &amp;#34;I remember when things were made better.&amp;#34; Sad.&lt;br /&gt;That said. The Gillette Venus Embrace does seem to be the best product currently on the market. I have tried all the other types of Gillette Venus razors and I keep coming back to the Embrace. I was buying the Gillette Fusion for my boyfriend, but when I made a comment about the quality of women&#x27;s razor blades getting worse and worse, he said he preferred using my razor blades to his own. I guess I&#x27;ll be buying Venus Embrace for both of us from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been around for awhile, since back when we were barbarians who shaved with only ONE measly blade in our razors, and women generally had to use men&#x27;s razors, or choose to shave with something that looked like a birth control dispenser (I&#x27;m looking at you, Flicker). I can&#x27;t even think about the Epilady tragedy without nightmares. Moisture strips?!? Then we would have call that the rantings of a schizophrenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched as razor manufacturers&#x27; hubris grew; I truly thought it knew no bounds, and was as pointless an escalation as our arms race with the USSR. Two razors; aloe strips; moisture strips; rubber grips on the handle; FREE suction cup holder for the shower! First two blades, then THREE!!! Would the insanity never end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I mistakenly ordered these refills for my spare Venus razor. I am not ashamed to tell you all that I wept the first time I used them. Finally, we have a razor with not 4 but FIVE blades, AND a ground breaking moisture ribbon. Finally, ladies, we have freedom! Finally, we escape the tyranny of men discovering grown women have body hair!! Thank you, Gillette, thank you.</li>
            <li> I have to buy more of these and am glad I had bought these before as I had not remembered which ones I had gotten and liked so much. These are great!</li>
            <li> These razors make shaving a pleasant experience. I don&#x27;t get any cuts, and my legs always turn out very smooth. The 5 wide blades make it hard to miss spots.</li>
            <li> These give an unbelieveable  shave</li>
            <li> Love these razors, they do a nice close shave that lasts longer than your average cheap razor shave. I also never end up nicked/cut by this razor unlike the cheap disposables. The price is ridiculous but it really is worth it to not end up cut up and itchy from the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> These are just about as good as it gets, Gillette is my fave go to brand when it comes to razors.</li>
            <li> I am a busy college student with a hectic schedule and shaving is sometimes a time consuming task but not with the Venus Gillette razor honestly the close shave and the gentle glide of the razor makes shaving easier and better. I spend less time in the shower shaving. Pricy but worth it no skin irritation just smooth akin and pretty legs afterwords</li>
            <li> Not the best, but ist does it&#x27;s job! I like the one with olay much better. Also, I really like that there are several different replaceable blades that you can choose from to put on the razor.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about the Gillette Venus razor is that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus handle so you can find your perfect shaving match without having to purchase a whole new razor. I tried the Embrace cartridges with the very first Venus handle that ever came out! I have never had to purchase a new handle EVER!</li>
            <li> I seriously love this razor. I got it free from influenster.com to try, and it gave me the best dry shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I can only imagine how good it would have been if I&#x27;d used the shaving cream. I will never go back to generic men&#x27;s razors again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally sold on these blades, but they do not cut or nick and even though I may need to go over an area more than once, they will do until technology improves or laser hair removal is more affordable.....</li>
            <li> Venus Embrace is magical. How did people survive without 5 bladed razors and luxurious moisturizing pads around them? The hippie era makes so much sense, I would have let my hair grow out if I didn&#x27;t have something as wonderful as these razors to take care of that mess.</li>
            <li> This razor is the #1 on the market. If you hardly have any hair, you probably don&#x27;t really need it.   i have tried ***ALL*** the Venus collection and many others, so take it from a pro!!! i have the entire Venus line in every possible color and design, and this one is the queen of all by far. First it covers a much larger area so you are done shaving much faster than when using other razors. A few strokes and you&#x27;re done. i was surprised to see that 2 more blades could make THAT much difference!!! i read a reviewer&#x27;s comment saying that Embrace is the same as a 1 blade razor. NO WAY!! this one doesn&#x27;t even compare to the one with 3 blades!!    it is so practical, you don&#x27;t need to go over the same area more than once or twice. the smoothing \\&quot;bands\\&quot; (meant for exfoliation i suppose) seem to assist the shaving because they smoothe the area perfectly. i was TOTALLY IMPRESSED with this one. The head is very flexible so it really EMBRACES your sinuosities which prevents cuts. i have a sensitive skin but it is hard to cut yourself with this one - unless you overdo it or if you have very little hair. You don&#x27;t need to keep running over the same area like with other razors, otherwise you WILL hurt yourself (it is normal with 5 blades!).     i read a review by a man who uses this razor, well i use men&#x27;s foam! i DON&#x27;T use the foaming gels made for women. they foam much less than men&#x27;s products. i use Edge or Gillette foam or Target&#x27;s brand for men which are all great and last MUCH longer with cheaper prices.     i MUST thank Gillette for such a wonderful product. Venus Embrace, that is. i hate shaving, and this one definitely makes it less unpleasant for me.</li>
            <li> Venus Embrace makes for a smooth and fast shave, there is no need to apply pressure or repeatedly go over the same spot. I have not managed to cut myself with these - so I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re safe as well. Just like all other razors, they gradually lose their sharpness - how soon that happens, depends on your shaving frequency. This is their only downside - which is why I bought this cartridge of 4 to have replacement razor heads available as soon as needed.</li>
            <li> It works great, love the multiple blade and soap around it, as I shave at the sink. I only have to wet the razor and it glides on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wow- this really is a much closer shave than the Quattro, which I have been using forever. I was a little hesitant to go for the five blades on the Embrace (five blades seems not only kind of excessive but also scary!) but it makes a HUGE difference. It&#x27;s not only the blades themselves, but the head of the razor- the razor head swivels all the way back, so you can shave behind your knees and in other places without worry about nicks. Just make sure when you hold the razor, you don&#x27;t grip it near the head to prevent it from swiveling. And you don&#x27;t need a ton of lotion to get a clean, nick-free shave, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a good, smooth, nick-free razor system. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Work great and get a lot of use out of them.</li>
            <li> Well... I&#x27;m single again so I don&#x27;t really use this as much as I did at first.  But I know when the time comes this razor works great.  Until then... meh.</li>
            <li> Same price as walmart but saved me a shopping trip and probably spending more money I didn&#x27;t intend to. This is why I buy online.</li>
            <li> These blades are great for shaving legs as well as underarms.  The blade really glides over your skin.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is the price is a bit higher than I would like.</li>
            <li> I buy what my wife likes.  She likes the Embrace because of the five blade cartridge over the regular Venus, 3-blade cartridge.  They seem to work well and last long enough.  Of course, the cost is not 5-star, it&#x27;s more like two.</li>
            <li> This razor is the #1 on the market.

            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and I have tried many different razors. When I found this razor I was really excited. I do not like to use shaving cream, and this razor, with the built in shaving ribbons, make it much easier to skip that step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design fits in your hand nice, and the swiveling head helps to make a quick, smooth shave even in the difficult areas like kneecaps, and the bikini area. You do not have to push very hard, or go over the area twice, to get a nice smooth shave. I have even shaved, with goosebumps, and it does not cut, or nick the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is the only razor that I buy. I have tried other venus brands and gave up hope of finding one that would work for me. Then I met this amazing 5-blade miracle and I fell in love :) Beach here I come......</li>
            <li> My praise for these match that which I have stated for the razor. Great price, great results, my girl loves them</li>
            <li> I have yet to find razors that give as close of a shave as these. I also like that I can save a bit by subscribing and having them auto shipped. I tend to forget to buy razors when I&#x27;m at the store, and this service ensures that I always have razors available!</li>
            <li> These razor refills work pretty well.  I have sensitive skin &amp; usually shave with electric.  I can get by on these with minimal skin irritation.  I give them a 4 b/c I think they&#x27;re far too pricey.</li>
            <li> only kind my kids use.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely razor-rash prone skin or just sensitive skin, this is the razor for you.  I have gone back and forth numerous times between lots of different wet razors (schick, bic, venus original, venus breeze, etc.) and this is the best razor I have ever found, in every attribute (smoothness, gentleness, hair removal effectiveness).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt or cut anything. Felt smooth and got the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li> Only razors I use. I have tried others but get bad razor burn. Worth paying a little extra for these.</li>
            <li> The Venus Embrace is great!  I transitioned from a four blade Schick product and have been really happy with this razor.  It&#x27;s super sharp, but comfortable and I like the gel strips that seem to last pretty consistently.</li>
            <li> PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-Incredibly smooth shave! Leave skin soft and smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;-Very safe, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gotten a nick with this razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;-This is my favorite razor blade for use on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-Rather large and therefore hard to use in the bikini area. Also tends to miss some hairs in the underarm area do to it&#x27;s large size. Great for the legs however!</li>
            <li> I switched to the Venus embrace from disposable razors about a year ago and haven&#x27;t gone back.  They&#x27;re a bit pricier, but as a daily leg shaver I go through one cartridge a month so the cost is spread out.  The shave is always super smooth even at the end of the month for me.  I&#x27;ve nicked myself once or twice, but always when in a hurry (certainly not as much as when I was using single/double blade disposables).  The lotion strips are alright, and they&#x27;re quite pleasant for the first week but after that they don&#x27;t add or detract from the blade.  Easy to swap out, press the button on the razor to disconnect the old blade.  Peel back the packaging on the new cartridge, insert the razor handle until you hear a click, and voila!  I&#x27;ve only used the Embrace type of blades, but I do remember seeing somewhere that all the &amp;#34;Venus&amp;#34; razors are interchangeable.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with Embrace for a while, personally.</li>
            <li> Started using these about 10 years ago when it first came out.  Although its pricey, you can use the blades for numerous shaves, and it not only gets close, but rarely nicks or cuts your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus Embrace for almost three years now. The first few times you use the razor with either soap or shaving cream, it will be a bit goopy but after it washes off, it&#x27;ll be perfect. You will definitely want to shave slowly, as shaving quickly with this razor often results in cuts. One swipe is all it takes to get hairless skin and it&#x27;s amazing because the hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back as quickly as when I&#x27;ve used other razors. Extremely easy to replace, as well. Took me awhile to figure out that I didn&#x27;t need to take the refills out of the package by hand, but simply just stick my razor wand and it pops right onto it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these shavers!  It is practically impossible to cut yourself with them.  They shave close, smooth and they seem to last longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver, and you can&#x27;t beat the pric on amazon. Buy it and try it.. I will never go back to a cheap one. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great value! These are amazing replacement razors for a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizer around the razor!</li>
            <li> Great product. Repeat customer.</li>
            <li> haved used these for year</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Love! My roommate and I both have slightly different Venus razors and these razor cartridges fit both of them perfectly. We keep trying different types, but if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s to not even bother with refills that don&#x27;t have 5 blades.  With these, my legs feel like dolphins and my arm pits have no bumps or ingrown hairs. (bro tip: if you get bumps or ingrown hairs often, quickly exfoliate your underarms with a face scrub or a loofa before you shave. It makes a HUGE difference, especially after doing it for a few weeks!)  Once you start using 5 blades it&#x27;s so hard to go back. Seriously, upgrade and you&#x27;ll thank yourself and each one of these 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth here.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this brand and type. It is all she uses for her armpits, legs, and other areas. Smooth, no pain, no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors to use.  I subscribe and have them delivered about once every 2 months.</li>
            <li> I like the Venus Embrace product, it seems to work better with my sensative skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product with shipping and handling was $3 cheaper than the in store product. Not much of a difference but when you&#x27;re on a budget every dollar counts.</li>
            <li> These are great cartridges, And they work perfectly fine,I would recommend these refill cartridges, if you can get them cheapper here:D</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades. Works great for my sensitive skin. The price is pretty good compared to the stores too. I would buy them again from amazon</li>
            <li> This razor is not the same quality razor as the razors I&#x27;ve bought in my local stores. The whole blade unit itself is different. I usually always have a perfect shave with this item when purchased from my local store, but when I use the blades purchased from amazon I have frequent nicks and they do not last as long.  I&#x27;m VERY disappointmented considering the price I paid for the items. As far as shipping, the items arrived on time and was packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li> I first purchased Embrace razor over 5 years ago. I replace a blade every 2-3 months depends how often I shave. Great smooth results without cutting my skin.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin. Any other razor gives me nasty razor burn. Venus Embrace is the only razor I can use without a reaction.</li>
            <li> It gave me a close shave without cutting me and left my legs very smooth.  This is my main product from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types and this one is the best out of them all! It gives a really close shave as you need it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use these yet but the one on the razor has lasted me a long time, about 2 weeks so far! &#x3D;] I love this razor it works very well. I plan to buy refills again one day</li>
            <li> Buying these online are no doubt the cheapest price you will fine. These are great razor refills. I plan on purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> I love the Venus products.  Makes shaving easy and less painless.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the original, but Inswitched to the embrace the other day and absolutely love it! Knees are always a problem, but not with these!  I highly recommend the Embrace for a flawless shave and smooth, beautiful legs.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend she says it&#x27;s the best one ever. Switched to another brand and instantly switched back because of it&#x27;s superior performance.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t bad. I think there is one other style of Venus razors that is a bit better but these work well.</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t like the five blades.  I just don&#x27;t buy them all the time due to the cost.  but I treat myself occasionally</li>
            <li> Never had a cut from these blades!</li>
            <li> These are great blades. I use these for shaving my legs, chest, arms, and bikini. They are awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I only use this brand. I found it was less expensive on amazon.</li>
            <li> best razor heads ever. they shave my legs sooo smoothly and make everything so easy and fast, its perfect! thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and get the worst rashes when shaving but with these disposables I have no issues. I will keep using these for sure!</li>
            <li> Wife loves the razor which is a win for me obviously.  Replacement razors are cheap enough so they make great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift for my daughter and she says they have become her favorite of the Venus blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bad about ordering razors so I was glad to get these on subscribe and save. It motivates me to change the razors more regularly and I get a better shave.</li>
            <li> I know this is usually a good product. When I have bought them at Target, I&#x27;ve loved them. The ones I ordered here are not good.</li>
            <li> Started using a safety razor because of the price gouging on razor cartridges. ~$16 for four cartridges when one will last for a week&#x27;s use? No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - they&#x27;re probably terrible for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free yourself from the razor industry stronghold! DE Razors fo lyfe son.</li>
            <li> These blades are such an improvement over earlier versions, they cancel out the negatives.  They do not do well on very heavy growth, and the cost of the refills are, in my opinion, exorbitant.  If the shave was not excellent, nick-free and &#x27;bloodless&#x27;, I would use a less expensive razor.&lt;br /&gt;If the price keeps increasing I will have to look for an alternate.</li>
            <li> I am going to through a laser hair removal treatment for my full face. During the laser hair removal process I cannot use any other hair removal method to remove hair from face other than shaving. I didn&#x27;t want to shave my face but I m glad I have found this razor blade, it is not only very convenient to use but also  I never has any cuts using it. I am really happy with the purchase and the good thing is that the razor blades are compatible with other Gillette shave handles.</li>
            <li> None of the others seem to shave as close or smooth, plus the amazon price beats my local retailers any day of the week. Id love to find something more reasonable, but i won&#x27;t hold my breath.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for this product.</li>
            <li> I am sorry but I feel like they changed these razors. They go dull after only like 2-3 uses and the way the razor bends doesn&#x27;t help a close shave. I feel like I get a closer shave with a disposable razor. For the amount of money these razors cost, they should work a lot better. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I compare prices. these razor blades are great</li>
            <li> i have used this brand for many years. it is my favorite. i love that i can buy it on amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE  the Gillette Venus Embrace razors!  They are the only razors that I can use without getting cuts or razor burn.  And, bonus, with Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, I can get them so much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;v ever used.  Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> Great product, smooth shave!!</li>
            <li> Like this brand. Works well on my legs.</li>
            <li> I bought these on Amazon because at the time they were cheaper than target and walmart. These are my favorite razor blades, I have kind of course hair and these blades make my legs silky smooth everytime.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.  They are definitely pricey, but really worth it.  I get a nice smooth clean shave that I can go every other day shaving if I wish.  I sometimes use them without shaving cream and still get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this razor.  The Venus is my go-to razor.  It provides an amazingly close shave, while moisturizing your skin (which is incredibly helpful, especially in the winter when you HATE shaving cream).</li>
            <li> I received the Venus Embrace Razor in my VoxBox and I can honestly say it is the best razor I have used so far! It glides over skin, gets every hair, and can easily be put on any Venus Razor you already own!</li>
            <li> i have recently received this razor complimentary from a website and i must say this razor has made my legs so unbelievably smooth and you know what else any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle. how awesome is that? i will only use the Gillette Venus and all the different refills from now on goodbye old razors hello to my new favorite</li>
            <li> I love Venus razors. You can mix and match blades which is great. Plus they are the only ones I have found that do amazing around the knee. They are my favorite razor brand! I received a free sample through influenster although they were already my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of razors. I usually use the creams that you apply, wait, then rub off. But this razor has really changed my look on razors and i love it. It glides easily across the skin. It makes shaving easier and it leaves the skin smooth. I also like it because it prevents cuts since the head is very flexible and that was one reason why I didnt want to use a razor. I love this razor. I recommend this product to everyone especially the individuals that are scared of getting cuts and razor burns. LOVE THIS RAZOR!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love that with all of the Venus razors that you can change out the refills. The Venus is smooth and really makes it so you don&#x27;t have bumps!</li>
            <li> a good razor.  stays sharp a long time.  &amp; the edging stays in good shape.  been using this since it first came out.</li>
            <li> I recieved a Venus Embrace Razor in my Influenster.com Cosmo Box and was informed that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle.That saves me so much money and time!</li>
            <li> A birthday present for my late teen daughter. She can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about them including that they last long enough that the price is worth it because these last so much longer than the cheap 2 blade ones that sister uses.</li>
            <li> Perfect, delivered just as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Venus Embrace for a few years now.  They provide a close shave with very little pressure; I never get nicks.  I actually used one of the 3-blade Venus cartridges that I had left over not too long ago...I almost bled to death!!  And they last forever without getting dull!  As far as the shower pod goes, it hangs on my shower wall without a problem unless I bang into it.  I don&#x27;t really use it to hold extra cartridges though, for two reasons:  1.  if you change the blade in the shower, what do you do with the trash? 2.  it only holds two cartridges and you can&#x27;t buy just two cartridges so there&#x27;s always some stored somewhere else anyway.</li>
            <li> I have used different brands of razors in the  past and  I am looking forward to the close shave this claims to give.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember when I started using Venus Razors, but I do know ever since that first day I discovered them, I had strayed to try others (I am a big lover of testing new products), but ALWAYS go back to my Venus razors.  They are by far the best razors on the market.  For those of you that have a hard time getting a close shave with other razors, give these a try.  I promise that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I have pretty course hair and it&#x27;s very dark too, but this does the trick and I have smooth legs until I have to shave again.  Thank you Venus for coming out with the best razors EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this razor.  Not only it does fit all gillette blades, it is also the best razor ever.  It runs so smooth, and I like the feel of lotion afterwords.  I dont even feel that burning sensation that I felt with most other brands.  I dont need to put any lotion after I use the gillette embrace, because the lotion is already on the razor. Anyway, I will definitely purchase it from now on.</li>
            <li> The five blades gets everything and it is very smooth. The only downside is that the smoothness wears off fairly quick.</li>
            <li> I have to say, the Venus Embrace razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. With the long handle, and pivoting head, it doesn&#x27;t really even FEEL like you are shaving... it just glides along, following your leg&#x27;s contours, without even a nick!&lt;br /&gt;  Venus offers razor blades for every imaginable need, skin type, and preference. The blades are interchangeable with any other Venus handle... it&#x27;s as easy as pushing a button!&lt;br /&gt;  The Embrace blade is, so far, my favorite. It has just enough moisturizer on the blade head to eliminate shaving gels and creams, leave my skin satiny smooth, and still not get \\&quot;goopy\\&quot; or \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; when I set it down to dry.&lt;br /&gt;  The only downside? Keeping it hidden from my two teenaged girls. It seems that it is THEIR favorite, now, too!</li>
            <li> The 1st time i use it, it was ok, but the problem is the cartridges are to big and i cant get around your knees as well as id like. if you put it on the shelf with the blue side down, it sticks to the shelf and leaves a weird feeling residue.</li>
            <li> I love this razor has 5 blades. It leaves my legs silky and I especially love that any Venus razor refill fits any blade handle, this makes it so convenient to try other types of Venus products! Thanks Influenster for my complimentary blade!</li>
            <li> I love this product it does so much better than any other razor out there! I would go out and by more!</li>
            <li> I received this razor blade for free through Influenster.  I loved it.  My legs usually feel dry and itchy after shaving.  After using this blade they felt more moisturized. I love that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle.  Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Have used these for several years on the leg daily, and they do a great job cleaning and smoothing - no nicks, no dry skin.  I don&#x27;t need to shave daily - it&#x27;s that I just like the ultra-smooth feel I get when I do.  I use them with a mild-scented/mild-strength liquid bath soap, like Oil of Olay shea butter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I get as close of a shave with these as I do with razors without the moisturizing strips.</li>
            <li> Very good products.  I have seldom got cut since I used it.  I like it.  I recommend it to my husband too.</li>
            <li> I have loved most of the venus refills but these are my absolute favorite, especially for summer time.  I use to think the 5 blades were a gimmick but after trying them I really do think they make a difference.  In my opinion I&#x27;m less likely to knick myself using these and the shave lasts longer (I can usually go an extra day compared to a cheaper razor blade) and is very smooth.  I think they may have a slightly longer lifespan than others as well so the cost may get offset that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products since I first began shaving. I was using the dispoable Bic ones a couple of years ago, just to try them out, and though they did the job, I returned to Gillette when I found the razor, the case, and two cartridges on sale @ Target (I&#x27;m sure they were about the same on Amazon but I walked right by it in-store). Replacement cartridges can be pricey, but they are better priced on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the razor is designed to avoid nicks, keep your skin soothed, and provide a smooth, super-close shave. It delivers on all points and lasts several months per head (shaving every 3-4 days or so; when it is cold and I&#x27;m wearing pants all the time I don&#x27;t shave every other day). It is a solid product.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades make shaving so easy and I honestly find the shave so close that I don&#x27;t have to shave as often.  Haven&#x27;t nicked myself even once. I advise caution if you find it necessary to use another brand again like i did when travelling - you&#x27;ll forget how careful you have to be with other razors because the Venus Embrace is so safe.  I was so surprised to nick myself again!  Anyone I&#x27;ve spoken with who has tried the Venus Embrace LOVES it!  Very pricey, but this is one item I&#x27;ll pay the higher price for.  Highly recommend.  And, on a silly note, For those of us who love Britcoms, the &#x27;5 blade&#x27; razor is reminiscent of the show Reginald Perrin starring Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) where the very idea of 5 blades was made fun of.  Boy was Reggie wrong!</li>
            <li> I love the razors and all the refills. They last a long time and make my legs feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product. I had received this complimentary from Influenster in my Cosmo Voxbox 2012, and was a bit skeptical over how good it actually worked.  However, I loved how I didn&#x27;t once cut myself in the process of using it (compared all the other times I use other razors...yikes). Not only did it also leave my legs looking free of blood, it also made it smooth- Yay for hardly any noticeable stubble! One of the best qualities of this razor is that despite how your body is shaped, the razor can get most edges, dents, bumps, whatever!  The next best part? You can Mix &amp; Match any Venus blade with any Venus handle. You know, to customize to your liking.</li>
            <li> I love that this razor has 5 blades. It left my legs nice and smooth. i used it with the Olay cartidge (which I highly reccommend).The handle is easy to hold and fits perfectly into your hand.</li>
            <li> I received these from influenza tee and OMG. They work amazing. The best part is all the Venus carriage heads fit on the same ravor.  Saving money and time</li>
            <li> The Venus Embrace razor and razor blades are amazing!!  I have had a lot of issues in the past with painful razor burn and horrific rashes.  I have noticed that if I use this razor an this system that I do not have the same rashes and I experience a lot less pain.  I love the fact that I get a nice close even shave every time and that there is no irritation as there would be with other choices.</li>
            <li> i love the new venus razor. i will deffinatly keep using and buying new blades for my new venus razor. i love that you can change the blades and attach any gillette blade.</li>
            <li> Good deal when I first purchased, now same price (or more) than  local stores such as target etc. Will discontinue</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  I swear the hair always seemed to come back within a day.  I got Venus Embrace as part of my Voxbox complimentary from Influenster.  I figured hey it is free why not try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It took days for the hair to be noticeable and my skin was very smooth.  A must have and Venus blade refills fit any Venus razor handle, which is a plus if you want to try different heads.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to not place the razor face down because it will get all slimy.</li>
            <li> These are definitely one of the best blades I&#x27;ve used at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Best Razors ever! I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Gillette has the best razors for women, and I find that one of the Venus razor handles fits all different kinds of Venus razors. Gillette has never let me down, improving upon the razors and the close shave with each new addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tried so many different kinds and brands. It feels so great on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I am shaving. This is the best razor out there. I have very sensitive skin and this just made my skin feel soft and nourished instead of irritated. I can not say enough about this razor except go and buy one! You won&#x27;t be disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 12-28-13</li>
            <li> They shave?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why they cost so much. Seriously ... they chop hair off my wife&#x27;s legs. They shouldn&#x27;t be this expensive.</li>
            <li> I no longer use these blades or the corresponding razor as I found they dulled very easily, cut me too frequently, and just did not give me the smooth, can&#x27;t-stop-touching-them legs. I have since found a different brand that addresses all of the above issues. I just found these have me a mediocre shave.</li>
            <li> Great quality and better price than big box store</li>
            <li> Great deal for refills for a great razor.</li>
            <li> Good value for the amount. These leave your legs nice and smooth and they work Great.</li>
            <li> the best manual razor I have found so far...</li>
            <li> Best shaving blades on the market</li>
            <li> Best razors on the market.  Good price on amazon, and right to my door.</li>
            <li> Best ladies razors by far</li>
            <li> There are expensive, but long-lasting.  They stay sharp.  So they are worth it!  My only complaint is that all Venus razor blades should fit interchangeably in the blade storage thingies that attach to walls with suction cups.</li>
            <li> These are like the lady equivalent of the Gillette Fusion blades for dudes. My girlfriend loves these. They work the best.</li>
            <li> I love that all Gillette Venus blades fit all the razor handles!  I tried the Embrace blade and loved it! I didn&#x27;t have any stray hairs and my legs were silky smooth! I would recommend this anyone! I received a complimentary Gillette Venus Embrace blade from Influenster!</li>
            <li> I absolutely live the Venus embrace cartridges. They leave me legs feeling smooth and freshly shaved for days! I also like that the company comes out with coupons to make the product less expensive</li>
            <li> I really like the venus embrace razors. I like how it leaves your skin smooth after shaving. These razors are so good that my husband uses these instead of a mans razor. I rarely if ever get nicks and cuts when using these razors. I also like how any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle allowing you to buy any of the venus blade refills you choose. The handles can last forever so this allows you to only buy what you need instead of having a ton of handles laying around!  I received my venus embrace and venus and olay razor complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! It glides over skin so smoothly and I have never cut myself. My legs and under arms stay soft and smooth for days. Absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for new shaving stuff.  I tried to pick all of the nicer brands and I am sure she will be happy.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here really. My wife uses them all the time and its her favorite type. They seem to get the job done with minimal fuss and razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin (particularly on my legs) and so I&#x27;ve gotten used to expecting nicks and irritation. But with these razors I haven&#x27;t had a single cut or instance of razor burn! The five blades are effective so you don&#x27;t have to go over and over an area to get a smooth shave. I won&#x27;t go back to cheaper disposable razors any time soon.</li>
            <li> I like this product. My skin look soft. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome razor blades. I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using these razors forever and do not have to replace them as often as other razors. The best part about these is that you can get them on Auto-Ship, which is one less thing you have to worry about at the grocery store. If you have 5 or more things on auto-ship, you can save 15-20%, which puts these at a substantially lower price than I pay at walmart, plus free shipping to my door every month....gotta love amazon!</li>
            <li> Great for men too!  Haven&#x27;t whacked my head once with these.</li>
            <li> So much better than any other Venus razor they&#x27;ve made, and I was even disappointed to begin with--I just needed one that was Prime &amp; this was the only one available. So glad I tried it, never going back.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used. Doesn&#x27;t leave any nicks or cuts. Razor lasts for multiple shaves. Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors I&#x27;ve used since high-school and I&#x27;ve yet to attempt to try a different razor. This does the job without cuts and it&#x27;s so close that the results shock me every time.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my fiancee and she wasn&#x27;t a huge fan.  They work but the Venus Spa was better in her opinion.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have some gross ingrown hairs or something. I am not sure. Regular razors don&#x27;t work so well on me. I always am left with uncomfortable cuts. Since I am a delicate lady, I like to have smooth shaves. I even recommended this blade to my guy friends. They love it, too!  It works really well at cutting from multiple directions. The end result is you get a very smooth shave. You only have to move in one direction once to cut all the hairs.  It has 5 chances to get them with all the little mini blades moving at once. You don&#x27;t have to worry about nicks.  The price on Amazon is also reasonable.  Some stores mark up the price for this type and  brand. Here, the price does not flux as much.</li>
            <li> The refills are just as great as the original. If you have concave armpits, it might be tougher to shave there, so I would recommend a smaller razor for that purpose. My sister has some troubles with her underarm area due her armpit shape. The razor works well for legs and other parts of the body. The only time I got razor burns from this was when I was rushing or the blades were dull. It will give you a close shave ONLY if you don&#x27;t rush it. I&#x27;m a busy person who dislikes shaving, so I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time on shaving, but when I do, it&#x27;s gives a nice, close shave. Other than that, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> good price for product</li>
            <li> These are not good for shaving the bikini area, or really any area. I thought these were the ones I normally order but these were too big. It&#x27;s the ones in the more blue box I like I think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years.  I have very sensitive skin and this razor never bothers my skin.  I never have unsightly cuts on my legs or underarms.</li>
            <li> Gives me a close shave every time!!!</li>
            <li> My wife liked it, the price compared to the quantity is ok, although if it was a little cheaper, sh&#x27;d have asked for more from this product, in general, she was ok with it.</li>
            <li> I love it, it makes my legs feel very smooth. Smooth blades that slide right off my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for about five years. I have tried some of the other products by Gilette and this is the best one. The head is flexible and moves nicely. It has five blades which means a close shave. It also has bands on the razor which prevents you from getting nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an aloe strip that is intended to moisturize. The only flaw is you really do need to use the shower holder that holds it upright. When I put it flat on a shelf it melts down onto the shelf and glues the razor to the shelf and is a gloppy mess. My error there so I still rate this as 5 stars &#x3D; I Love It.</li>
            <li> Best razors. They last for a very long time before having to replace them and get a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> my wife says it is great</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of razor for like 2 years with the same wand and just keep replacing the heads. yes it is more expensive but to me they last longer than other razors I never change the head because it gets dull, every month or so Im like well I been using this one awhile i  guess ill put a new head on.</li>
            <li> I have always used Venus since I was 14 years old! This is my favorite from their line because I feel like the blades last longer. Some of the others do make my skin feel more smooth, but they lose the soft stuff quickly and become unusable. These are a much better price and quality.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girlfriend after reading the many positive reviews here and found that they worked better than my Merkel safety razor at shaving my face. The expected razor burn around my neckline usually associated with using standard multi blade razors never showed up.</li>
            <li> I use venus embrace all the time. Had to buy online as I our local store was having trouble getting these stocked for a couple of months. Not sure of price compared to WalMart, but I love the product. I never had razor burn, cuts or any other problems with this blade. I do swap it out weekly. You have to be careful not to let the &amp;#34;ribbon&amp;#34; lay flat on a surface, as it will dissolve rather quickly and make shaving a lot more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Great razors. Leaves my skins feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> My wife says these are the best. You do have to buy the handle that comes with 2 blades. All venus handles fits all venus blades.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great bargain!!!!</li>
            <li> My sister turned me on to Venus razors and I&#x27;ll never go back to cheap disposables. Nothing makes shaving your knees exactly easy, but these are a big improvement over anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I set this up as a subscription so I never have to worry about running out of fresh blades.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I use --- I never get a cut or nic and the price is so much better on amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Venus blades and always go back to the Embrace.  They give a close shave without any cuts.  The razor itself isn&#x27;t perfect, as I&#x27;ve replaced 3 times due to breakage.  That said, these are the best blades for women I&#x27;ve found.  (Every now and then, I still swipe my husband&#x27;s - Gillette pro fusion, I think - which has a more sturdy razor and seems to give an even closer shave, but . . . .)  Amazon&#x27;s pricing on blades sure beats purchasing at a local grocery store.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Venus Embrace razor is Great! I&#x27;ve been using the Venus razors for YEARS! I get the closest shave ever, and my legs are literally smooth for days! I have tried other blades and other brands of razors, and the Venus Embrace is by far my favorites. One of the great features about the Venus razor itself is that the handle fits any Venus blade refill!! Thanks to a complimentary razor from Influenster, I was able to try the Venus razor handle with the Olay blade refill. Normally I use conditioner as my shaving cream, but with the Olay blade I didn&#x27;t have to use an additional shaving cream--the Olay Moisture Bars surrounding the blades were enough; no cuts!!</li>
            <li> Venus Embrace Razors are AMAZING. Stop using those cheapo drugstore razors, spend a little extra to get Venus. Your legs will thank you. Did you know that all Venus blades fit any Venus Handles?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review that Venus Razors are totally amazing!</li>
            <li> I have always used the original blades when it comes to my venus razor... until now! I received a razor and refill complimentary from Influenster and LOVED this blade! They are a little more pricey than the other blade refills but I feel like I have to shave less with this razor since it&#x27;s such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> As usual Gillette delivers a quality product.  I mean... they&#x27;re disposable razor blades - what do you expect?  Good quality, sharp blades and they last a long time (as they should, given the price).  I&#x27;ve used cheap &#x27;throw away&#x27; razors in the past and they cut the hell out of your skin.  Gillette certainly has learned the art of shaving and that can be seen across their product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy these again.</li>
            <li> good, close shave but the area surrounding the blades is too wide and it makes it hard to get a close shave on those \\&quot;hard to reach areas\\&quot; on us ladies.</li>
            <li> These were great razors for me but I stumbled across Dorco USA&#x27;s razors in the search for a cheaper one.  I bought one of their bundle deals and haven&#x27;t bought razors for well over a year.  Dorco&#x27;s razors have up to 6 blades to get an even closer shave.  I will never purchase my razors from any other company.  I am not affiliated with the company in any way (other than being a fan) and I feel that if you can find a better deal, why not share it with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shai Trial Pack (for a quick example) is only 20 bucks and includes a handle and 18 cartridges.  No, I&#x27;m not kidding. You guys have to check it out. Quick.  Stop wasting your money when you can get a lot more for less.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good razors. When you first open a cartridge and use that razor for the first time, it makes whatever you shave feel extremely smooth and absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s still okay after you use it, but it doesn&#x27;t make your legs as smooth as the first time. The razor falls off of the neck very easily if it falls, and I&#x27;d you put it on the shelf with the blue side down, it sticks to the shelf and leaves a weird feeling residue.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than local stores and appears to be genuine Gillette product.</li>
            <li> wanna shave your legs quickly? Use Venus!! I was so amazed at how easily this razor shaves...especially the back of the legs, which are always the hardest for me.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper to buy here than at department stores and pharmacies. It shaves super close and it doesn&#x27;t cut. I&#x27;ve never cut myself with this razor. I also use this to shave my lady bits ( a fresh clean one everyone!!!) and I feel comfortable using this razor in that area. I also use this to shave any other body part. I have no complains and this is my go to. I&#x27;ve tried every other razor but nothing comes close to this one. I will try to flexi ball thing they have out now. I do have to pass the razor in double strokes but it is because I forget to rinse out the razor to free it&#x27;s blades of hair. Even then the double passing doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> there is no comparison.. these are the Top Dogs.  Each blade last very long too, it&#x27;s not just the aloe that lasts a long time.. I don&#x27;t know how they were able to come up with such a superior product to all other Venus brands.</li>
            <li> More than other disposable razors.  I really don&#x27;t understand why this is so expensive though. If you dry the blades and keep them dry this will last you several months..I blow on the blades, both sides, after using it and then blot carefully with a clean washcloth.  A refill lasts me several months.  Check the internet and see that what I&#x27;m telling you is true..:)</li>
            <li> The best razor blades for women.</li>
            <li> the first razor out of the pack went dull within a week (less than 5 shaves), which is very disappointing considering that these razors aren&#x27;t cheap.  that fifth shave felt like i was ripping my skin off.  i think i&#x27;m going to go back to using a men&#x27;s razor, as they tend to stay sharper longer and give a much better shave.</li>
            <li> I am loyal to these blades, and that&#x27;s after years of searching. I have tried just about every style of Gillette blades in the Venus line, and these give the smoothest shave with low risk of nicks and cuts. The moisture strips also add softness, at least for the first couple of shaves. These are just solid.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, It does a good job the first time and I have NEVER cut myself with it, which is important as I have a bleeding disorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette brand since I was about 15, and it is still my favorite razor! I think the reason I love it so much is because you can mix and match your Venus refills, with any Venus razor handle! It&#x27;s awesome! It gives me a really close shave, while also keeping my skin soft. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discloser: I received my razor complimentary of Influenster</li>
            <li> Adore this product!  I recieved it for free in my Influenster VoxBox along with a sample of their Olay razor.  Its soo much better then the store brand ive been using for years.  Guess who&#x27;s never going back lol?  I have seen the other side and its razor burn free :)</li>
            <li> I have to say, the Venus Embrace gives a wonderful shave. My legs are smoother than they have been in a long time. It seems like the shave lasts longer too. The cool thing is that you can mix and match blades. I really like the Olay blades that you can get for it. I also don&#x27;t have to use as much shaving cream with this razor. :)</li>
            <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster and I give it two thumbs up for sure...if you are looking for a razor that is easy to use and leaves your legs feeling silky smooth than the Venus Embrace is for you...I highly recommend this product and will purchase it again, great value for a high quality product!!![[ASIN:B0039LMT9M Gillette Venus Embrace Disposable Womens Razor, 3-Count (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I got my venus razor complimentary from Influenster a few weeks back, and I used a 5 blade for the first time ever. Let me first tell you that I am pregnant, and overweight so shaving legs and armpits have just become null and void lol. So my hair was quite long... and I used the razor, and it was like shaving hair that was hardly there! It didnt take forever, like the 3 blades do, and I was done in no time. It is so perfect! And the blades didnt wear out after the use either! My husband has used it a few times for his face, and I have used it a few more times as well! Looove it! I also love that any venus blade fits any venus razor!</li>
            <li> A little pricey but totally worth it! Such a close shave. Venus is the best razor out there! Love love love.</li>
            <li> the venus embrace razor seems to last longer than other brands of razors I have used. I love how smooth it is and doesnt nick like alot of others.</li>
            <li> I got this through Influenster to try and I love it!  My legs are so smooth!  Also the blades can fit any handle, which is awesome.  this is a great product.</li>
            <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, and they do it well.  What more can you ask for... Well, a little cheaper would be awesome</li>
            <li> I love it! It is definitely good for shaving an keeps your legs moisturized. My razor blade doesn&#x27;t need to be changed often and like I said, does a great job.</li>
            <li> I really love my Gillette Venus Razor. I also use the Olay refills. How awesome is it that I can use any refill with any handle. It makes it so much easier to purchase refills now. This will be my go to razor from now on. I actually recieved my Gillette Venus complimentary form Influenster.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing! It leaves my legs silky smooth every time. Plus, I love that any Venus razor head fits any Venus razor handle. Genius!</li>
            <li> One of the coolest things about this razor is that all the blades are interchangeable!! Influenster was kind enough to include both an Embrace®  blade and a handle. First I tried the Embrace®  blade, twice. I think I had been using this blade for a while on the past but upon trying to purchase it at the store could not remember which one it was, so I resorted to using my husband&#x27;s razor. When I had the opportunity to once again use the Venus® Embrace® , it was a whole new world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Venus® Embrace®  is lightweight and formed to fit in a woman&#x27;s hand. There is no need to apply extra pressure, the razor and blade are the correct weight needed to apply the proper pressure needed to shave a womans&#x27; legs. The blades glided effortlessly over my legs, and gave me a great shave, even with several days growth. The first day I used the Embrace I was in a rush and had to do a quick shave. Normally under these circumstances, I would end up with nicks and/or razor burn. This did not happen with the Venus® Embrace®. The second time I used it, I got the same wonderful results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed about the blades is that I did not need to rinse it as often as with the previous razor that I had been using.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin silky smooth, absolutely the best razor product out there! The razor heads are all interchangeable with any Gillette handle so you can switch back and forth between the razor heads.</li>
            <li> I received this item for free from Influenster and I have to say I was shocked I really liked it. Most disposable razors for ladies don&#x27;t give you a nice close shave [i previously just used men&#x27;s razors]. This razor head gets a nice close shave and its moisture strip doesn&#x27;t disappear like knockoffs.</li>
            <li> It definitely works well and it&#x27;s good that all Venus blades fit all their razors! It can be a little pricey but its worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I feel like I like the sleekness of this razor, but the bulkiness of the blade head is a little awkward for me in some spots. The shave closeness has been okay.. feel like it should be a little closer with all of those blades. I&#x27;m not too sure where I&#x27;m at just yet with this, but I&#x27;m hoping I end up liking it more.</li>
            <li> I had read that there was no difference other than price for more blades on a razor---Not true!  The Venus Embrace &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; blades is now!  the only razor that I will use.  I have been a very loyal, faithful Venus only user for years---Now that I broke down  and tried the &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; blade that is all I will use from here on.  The &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; blade does an ok job--but this is perfect for shaving my legs.  I am neurotic about not having any nubs ever--these blades shave so much closer than the &#x27;3&amp;#34; blades....I learned to not believe all the advise I read......  The price I paid for these beat the drug store price--I should not include that fact in this--you will raise the price&#x3D;so shshsh:-0  Thank you so much for offering for sale! :-0</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades (these being gillette venus with 5 blades), and I&#x27;ve tried a few! As I get older and have to shave more, the quality of the blades start to really matter. These give a smooth shave and last a long time, especially if you buy them off of Amazon!!! I hope to never again buy these from any store, it&#x27;s just way to expensive for something you have to use basically for the rest of your life. Also, shipping was so fast. I&#x27;m pretty sure it got delivered on a Sunday which was really convenient actually! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always surprised by how pricey razor blade refills are, but these were slightly cheaper than the ones in store and I&#x27;m happy I took the time to look around for a better price. These were exactly what I wanted and was looking for (5 blade without those moisture bars), and the quality was not sacrificed for the price.</li>
            <li> I mean REALLY with the price? I actually despise Gillette for how they take advantage of people with their prices on razor refills. Just because you can (and everyone else is also) doesn&#x27;t mean you SHOULD be total jerks about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even matter how well they work. It&#x27;s beyond price gouging and it&#x27;s long impacted my opinion of your company and left a bad taste in my mouth,</li>
            <li> I will not switch from Venus, because they&#x27;re the only razors that don&#x27;t give me razor burn. They are pricey, but shaving is a necessity.</li>
            <li> Easy to use no cuts u can use it multiple times and it makes your skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Nice design and does the job well</li>
            <li> Love these razors &amp; buy them on Subscribe &amp; Save along with the refill cartridges &amp; you can save some $$$ as well as get a great quality ladies shaver.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  As expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning these because the razor they go with is horrible.  I&#x27;ll buy something else.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s preferred razor blades. Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite. But okay</li>
            <li> Subscribe and Save gives the best price for the 4 pack compared to any store in my rural area where I live.  I have used Venus Embrace blades for over three years. I won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Love the 5 blades and the moisture strip is terrific!</li>
            <li> Love these razors best that i have tried so far</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of razor blades and these are the best!!  No nicks or cuts and a close smooth shave every time.  Be wary of other Venus blades that don&#x27;t have the five blades.  They are not as good!</li>
            <li> I could not find the refill cartridges in my local store - only the disposable razor but I will be traveling for two months and these will take up much less room.  I love the shave the 5 blades gives!</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. Usually I shred my legs into confetti but these blades do the job without the nicks.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Hambone</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that more blades would lead to a better shave. Seriously? We&#x27;re up to FIVE blades now? Well, I have to say that it does seem that it takes fewer passes with the razor to make my legs feel smooth and it could just be my perception, but it sure seems like I&#x27;m not needing to shave as often. Yeah, five blades sure seemed silly, but I guess sometimes more is better. I do think we&#x27;ve reached the maximum return on investment, though. Not gonna go for 6,7,8,9, or 10 blades!!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this razor. I don&#x27;t know who else has a problem when they shave over their knees but I always end up cutting myself. Not anymore with this razor though! The head of the razor is very flexible and glides right over the curves of your legs and under arms! Definitely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I must say that I am LOVING my razor, and it is awesome BUT...it does have some downfalls. The blades are set back in the head, so sometimes you have to push down a little bit to get the smaller hairs. lol But all in all a great razor.</li>
            <li> Ordered as open box, which had been inspected (supposedly). 2 out of 4 razors were broken. Would have cost more to return them.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about Venus Embrace Razors!  My legs are super smooth and easy to use.  Love them</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT &amp; VERY HAPPY  VERY GOOD COLLECTABLEEXCELLENT &amp; VERY HAPPY  VERY GOOD COLLECTABLEEXCELLENT &amp; VERY HAPPY  VERY GOOD COLLECTABLEEXCELLENT &amp; VERY HAPPY  VERY GOOD COLLECTABLEEXCELLENT &amp; VERY HAPPY  VERY GOOD COLLECTABLEEXCELLENT &amp; VERY HAPPY  VERY GOOD COLLECTABLE</li>
            <li> In seconds you clean the whole area out of hair. Amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;The refill lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Best razor I&#x27;ve tried! Trully recommend it!</li>
            <li> Good product. Sufficient arrvivial time.</li>
            <li> Despite the reviews here, i am disappointed. Not as close as a men&#x27;s razor. Waste of money. I&#x27;ll stick with Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally discovered this product.  Well worth the price.  Agree with previous reviewers to either store it in the case or leave it blades-up somewhere safe in the shower otherwise the strip will warp or temporarily stain tile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be coming back to Amazon from now on to get my Venus Embrace refill cartridges.  Amazon beats the store prices.  I love the Venus Embrace razor.  I think it&#x27;s the best razor out of all of the different Venus razors.  I&#x27;ve never knicked myself shaving with the Embrace, no matter how fast I go.  It hugs the curves of my legs and gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with any razor, without missing a hair.  I guess that&#x27;s the beauty of the 5 blades and the ribbons of moisture surrounding it.  Also, nothing falls off, so one cartridge lasts a long time.  I was given the Venus &amp; Olay razor as a gift, and the moisture bars surrounding the razor fell off.  So when I went to shave, it wasn&#x27;t a smooth shave and I couldn&#x27;t go as fast for fear of knicking myself.  I&#x27;ve never had that problem with the Venus Embrace.  Nothing falls off.  i would definitely recommend this razor to other women.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t appear to be knock-offs at all.  Much better value than buying at the drugstore. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most razors cause razor burn really badly, no matter what shaving cream/gel I use.  These razors work so well and very rarely do I get razor burn.  Not only that, but they last for so long.  I usually go about a month in between changing cartriges!  With other razor I am changing them every week.  So even though these are more expensive per cartridge, I am actually saving month with them.  I highly recommend these and cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades. Very smooth and close shave. The lower (cheaper) blades in this product line are somewhat rough, IMO.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than buying individual packs at the store</li>
            <li> Gillette Venus Embrace Women&#x27;s Razor Blade refills do everything they are expected to do.  I don&#x27;t buy anything else but these, and highly recommend them and the razor.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are cheaper elsewhere, but I like the convenience of having them delivered. They provide a close shave and will fit any Gillette razor, even men&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Fall short of expectation. Does not shave as close compare with the 3 blades. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought it cause it&#x27;s cheaper than target with the coupon.  The 5 blades makes a huge difference.  Every year the Venus Gillette company comes out with some new summer product.  But for the past couple years, this was the one I returned to.  Will continue to buy it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades. I usually buy them at Target but they were cheaper on Amazon. They came quickly considering I ordered them over a holiday weekend. They are the only razor that gets close enough to shave wonderfully but not cut the crap out of my legs.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best razor I have ever used. I had the privilege of trying out this product through influenster.com . I will definitely be continuing to use this product. I usually use disposable razors then throw them out after a couple of uses. It really leaves your skin super soft, and its hard to miss a spot with the 5 blades. Gets everything that crosses its path!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, it has 5 blades but also has a softening agent that makes my shave smooth.  I received one free from influenster.com, but as I said I will keep using this product.  The other awesome thing is that all the blades that are Venus brand are interchangeable so if I find another Venus product, I can mix and match.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are phenomenal. I have used them for several years. I really appreciate that Gillette has not changed the attachment method to their razor handle... It means that I have been able to own the same razor for a very long time and just keep replacing the blades! I can even \\&quot;go cheap\\&quot; in the winter and use 3-blade razors! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that sometimes my razor will get stuck to the tub if I put it down wet, and the blue stuff around the outside of the blade dries to the tub. That stuff is goopy when you&#x27;re shaving (for extra smooth glide of the razor I guess...) and dries solid. I have to tear it off the tub, which ruins the blue stuff and leaves crap on my tub.</li>
            <li> I love these razor refills!.  I was a little leary at first because of the price and the number of blades, so I had gotten my normal (same brand different style) and there was one of these free in the box.  So I tried it and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  It will last you longer then the cheaper ones and be the better buy in the long run.  Really smooth nice shave.  I rarely cut myself and if I do it is because I am clutsy not because of the blades.  I also put Epson salt and some bubble bath in my bath water before I shave and it helps even more I have noticed.  Try them and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I buy these for my daughter in college who&#x27;s on a tight budget. They are expensive, but she says they are great and last a long time.</li>
