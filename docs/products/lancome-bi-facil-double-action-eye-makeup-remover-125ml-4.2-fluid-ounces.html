            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to try it for free.</li>
            <li>This has been the gentlest, yet effective eye makeup remover</li>
            <li>strongly recommended!</li>
            <li>Good thing is when I returned it originally, Amazon credited me with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Lancome BI-FACIL has been my favorite eye makeup remover for years.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love Lancome, but this isn&#x27;t a product they&#x27;ve cornered the market on.</li>
            <li>I love this eye makeup remover</li>
            <li>I use this when I put on more makeup for a night out and need it to take off the eyeliner &amp; mascara</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>It removes most if not all eye mascara without damaging the eye area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother with them any more.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my very allergic skin and what a great price.  </li>
            <li>am going to returne this product, and I have decided not to buy any more makeup products online, because I have always had to return them.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I think this is the most important factor when purchasing an eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I used this whole bottle so quickly because it&#x27;s amazing and makes me want to wear makeup more often!</li>
            <li>Easily removes my liquid liner and mascara.  </li>
            <li>I put more effort into getting my eyelids clean (nongreasy) than I would have,</li>
            <li>Also, when my precious 2-year-old has gotten into my makeup, this has removed it quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT !</li>
            <li>It might depend on the skin type you have, but this seems gentle to me, yet effective.</li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample when I bought some mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before, I had an eye make-up remover that was for removing light makeup, and so it often smudged my makeup or didn&#x27;t take it off cleanly</li>
            <li>Clinique&#x27;s Eye Makeup Remover is just as good as this, less oily, is still nicely packaged</li>
            <li>Leave your eyes and skin clean in seconds.</li>
            <li>I will say, it&#x27;s better than Laura Mercier&#x27;s and certainly anything I&#x27;ve used from the grocery store over the years.</li>
            <li>Then, it goes to work to gently whisk away even waterproof eye makeup while conditioning and refreshing</li>
            <li>Have used BI-Facil for years and love it because my eyes are sensitive and it takes off waterproof mascara easily and without the oiliness of a lot of removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have used many things in the past to get my makeup off and by far this works the best.</li>
            <li>I love this one and the older one too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many different brand of eye makeup removers, but none can compare!!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an amazing product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But if you can afford it, I definitely recommend it since Lancome almost always makes quality products :)</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Sure, the makeup comes off, but I prefer Philosophy&#x27;s Purity Made Simple.</li>
            <li>This is gentle and works by just placing it to your eyelashes!  </li>
            <li>Maybe I got a real lemon the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is the best, a little more expensive, but it is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyes are super sensitive but the Bifacil didn&#x27;t make my eyes sting either.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, (I have to use All Free &amp; Clear detergent for my clothes)</li>
            <li>When the Lancome BI-FACIL Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover arrived at my house, there were two huge dents at the bottom of the bottle, and multiple scratches all over it.</li>
            <li>The free sample bottle was only 1.7oz or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really recommend it.</li>
            <li>double-phase, fresh-as-water liquid eye makeup remover activates when you shake it gently.</li>
            <li>Thanks Ruth</li>
            <li>This is my very favourite eye makeup remover been using it for years...</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like many of other similiar products do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, mild on delicate skin and sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try out this makeup remover, but I was extremely displeased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, some even more expensive, but this remains the most efficient yet gentle eye makeup remover out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid to buy a different kind of makeup remover out of fear that it won&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li>Gentle, no dry feeling like some others and not oily just right and removes mascara efficiently .</li>
            <li>It off sets the high price of this Lancome product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dabbled in other eye makeup remover but this has still been my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>The gift frequently contains a decent sized offering of this product.</li>
            <li>For women of any age, but particularly over 40, we do not want to have to rub a product near our eyes to help remove the eye make-up.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>This is on my list of products that I would not want to live without (which is actually a pretty short list).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other eye makeup removers at different price points.</li>
            <li>If you live near a department store, watch for when Lancome bonus comes around.</li>
            <li>It will take off /anything/, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to everyone from sensitive skin to girls who wear a lot of eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>The eye makeup is gone without any rubbing or tugging of the sensitive skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li>I use waterproof mascara and long lasting eyeliner and this stuff takes it off easily, just dab some on a cotton cosmetic pad and gently press to your eye for a few seconds before rubbing it off.</li>
            <li>have tried many other types of eye makeup removers and this beats the others hands down.</li>
            <li>It removes mascara without irritating my eyes and is gentle on fine lashes.</li>
            <li>and I use the Neutrogena pad wipes on days where I only use a little coverup and light mascara.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle as an eye makeup remover, and I use it for other stuff as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bifacil is a little bit pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, and this is the only eye make-up remover that doesn&#x27;t cause problems.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for ten years and no other eye makeup remover compares.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have been using this product for ten years and no other eye makeup remover compares.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty small, but since you only need a tiny bit to remove your makeup, it lasted a REALLY long time.</li>
            <li> I like this product due to having sensitive eyes and skin.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, strong, long dark blonde lashes-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people rave so much over this product.  </li>
            <li> the bottle well,saturate a cotton pad, place it on your closed eye for a few seconds,thenwe gently.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to use a lot of it to get my makeup off unlike others I have bought and because of that it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I probably save money in the long run by not wasting it on inferior products.</li>
            <li> Within 2 other brand attempts, I was back at this one.</li>
            <li> The other brands caused redness and irritation around my eye to the point that I could not wear eye make up and had to apply vaseline constantly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have tried many times to bite the bullet and by a cheaper product only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> (otherwise 5 stars all the way), and there is another brand which makes a similar eye makeup remover for a few bucks cheaper</li>
            <li> Not me, gross.&lt;br /&gt;Had to ship it back, waste of time...</li>
            <li> I only have to purchase it a few times a year because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wear quite a bit of eye makeup, and when I would use other makeup remover products, there was always \\&quot;leftovers\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers have said, your toughest mascara and eye liner will melt off.</li>
            <li> but....i&#x27;m disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> and so I explored other brands.</li>
            <li> It works well, and, especially, does not cause drying around the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> little black specks or streaks, maybe some glitter.</li>
            <li> I sometimes wear quite heavy eye makeup</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few including the drugstore brands like Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this for a few weeks, and to me it&#x27;s just way too greasy.  </li>
            <li> I recently got tired of ordering online or having to go to a mall to find a lancome retailer</li>
            <li> The eye is a delicate area on the face, and I will not use any other product than this one to remove waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> It gets out waterproof mascara, eyeshadow, dark and liquid eye-liners, everything!!</li>
            <li> Alot of the cheaper eye makeup removers usually have oil in it that will stick to your eye lids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye makeup remover for years and usually buy at Nordstrom.  </li>
            <li> When I go on trips with my friends, and I&#x27;m too lazy to unpack, I sometimes use their products.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to pull and scrub at your delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> When I use their eye make up I always have to use this one to get off what theirs left behind!!!!  </li>
            <li> If you get this product you won&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

            <li> Lancome BI-FACIL has been my favorite eye makeup remover for years.  I&#x27;ve tried others, some even more expensive, but this remains the most efficient yet gentle eye makeup remover out there.  This price i paid was also the lowest price I&#x27;ve every paid for it.</li>
            <li> I sometimes wear quite heavy eye makeup (Lancome&#x27;s waterproof eyeliner, a couple coats of mascara and three-four shades of eyeshadow, including shimmery shades). This removes it all quite well with a Swisspers cotton pad. A product of this type is a must if you wear any eye makeup at all, because no cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried gets rid of it all. I have naturally thick, strong, long dark blonde lashes- I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakage or excess lash shedding with nightly use, personally, from this product. Makeup comes off quickly enough- I always hold it to the area I&#x27;m cleaning for several seconds before wiping the makeup off. It might depend on the skin type you have, but this seems gentle to me, yet effective. It has a nice, light fragrance. It&#x27;s packaged beautifully. I just think the price is a bit steep- Clinique&#x27;s Eye Makeup Remover is just as good as this, less oily, is still nicely packaged and it&#x27;s cheaper. I love Lancome, but this isn&#x27;t a product they&#x27;ve cornered the market on. I will say, it&#x27;s better than Laura Mercier&#x27;s and certainly anything I&#x27;ve used from the grocery store over the years.</li>
            <li> Have used BI-Facil for years and love it because my eyes are sensitive and it takes off waterproof mascara easily and without the oiliness of a lot of removers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I like this product due to having sensitive eyes and skin. It&#x27;s the only remover that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes. Also, when my precious 2-year-old has gotten into my makeup, this has removed it quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I used this whole bottle so quickly because it&#x27;s amazing and makes me want to wear makeup more often! Before, I had an eye make-up remover that was for removing light makeup, and so it often smudged my makeup or didn&#x27;t take it off cleanly so I wouldn&#x27;t wear make-up because it was just such a pain to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I got this Lancome makeup remover, and it worked like a charm. It will take off /anything/, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting your eyes, and it just leaves you feeling refreshed. However, it is quite pricey so I am docking one star off for that (otherwise 5 stars all the way), and there is another brand which makes a similar eye makeup remover for a few bucks cheaper and it does the same thing. :x But if you can afford it, I definitely recommend it since Lancome almost always makes quality products :)</li>
            <li> This has been the gentlest, yet effective eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever tried to date.  Easily removes my liquid liner and mascara.  Definitely the one I will reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product. It works well, and, especially, does not cause drying around the delicate eye area. I think this is the most important factor when purchasing an eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this brand for years.Alot of the cheaper eye makeup removers usually have oil in it that will stick to your eye lids.I love this one and the older one too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye makeup remover for years and usually buy at Nordstrom.  This was my first time buying it at Amazon.  It had a layer of puffy white stuff in between the layers of product when it hasn&#x27;t been shaken yet.  And even after shaking the bottle, the white stuff would be there again.  Also, the bottle shape and type (in French) did not look like the regular bottle I buy.  I wouldn&#x27;t take a chance on this product again, especially since it&#x27;s used on the eyes.      May 2010:  I tried this again and this time the product is perfect.  Maybe I got a real lemon the first time.  Good thing is when I returned it originally, Amazon credited me with no problem.  I love this eye makeup remover and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few including the drugstore brands like Neutrogena.  I use this when I put on more makeup for a night out and need it to take off the eyeliner &amp; mascara and I use the Neutrogena pad wipes on days where I only use a little coverup and light mascara.  It off sets the high price of this Lancome product.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample when I bought some mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it, and loved it. I wear quite a bit of eye makeup, and when I would use other makeup remover products, there was always \\&quot;leftovers\\&quot;... little black specks or streaks, maybe some glitter. When I used the Bifacil though, every last bit of makeup was taken off with just a tiny bit of product and a cottonball. My eyes are super sensitive but the Bifacil didn&#x27;t make my eyes sting either. Overall, it&#x27;s an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bifacil is a little bit pricey, but totally worth it. The free sample bottle was only 1.7oz or something. It was pretty small, but since you only need a tiny bit to remove your makeup, it lasted a REALLY long time.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t so cheap, but it is easily the best eye makeup remover you&#x27;ll ever find. Like the other reviewers have said, your toughest mascara and eye liner will melt off. You don&#x27;t have to pull and scrub at your delicate eye area. And it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like many of other similiar products do. And finally, it&#x27;s quick-drying. Again, the price is the only downside.    If you live near a department store, watch for when Lancome bonus comes around. The gift frequently contains a decent sized offering of this product. It&#x27;s a great way to try it for free.</li>
            <li> this is the best eye makeup remover i have ever used. it works well even on waterproof makeup. strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes and this is the only eye makeup remover I can use.  No burning or itching.  It also removes the eye makeup without the need to scrub or tug at the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used many!). It gets out waterproof mascara, eyeshadow, dark and liquid eye-liners, everything!! I&#x27;d really recommend it. You will never buy another make up remover!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a ton! This is on my list of products that I would not want to live without (which is actually a pretty short list). My skin is very sensitive, (I have to use All Free &amp; Clear detergent for my clothes) but I&#x27;ve never had any issue with this aggravating me. I also have very sensitive eyes and this is the ONLY eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t cause them to burn and make me need medicated eye drops. I use waterproof mascara and long lasting eyeliner and this stuff takes it off easily, just dab some on a cotton cosmetic pad and gently press to your eye for a few seconds before rubbing it off.</li>
            <li> I have tried this for a few weeks, and to me it&#x27;s just way too greasy.  Every time, I&#x27;ve used it, I feel like washing my eyes to get the greasy film off, but that defeats the purpose.  I put more effort into getting my eyelids clean (nongreasy) than I would have, had I not used this product to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes even come out.  Thankfully, just one or two here or there.  I&#x27;m not sure why people rave so much over this product.  Sure, the makeup comes off, but I prefer Philosophy&#x27;s Purity Made Simple. It&#x27;s an all-in-one face cleanser.  It&#x27;s very gentle as an eye makeup remover, and I use it for other stuff as well.  I&#x27;ve even used it as a carpet stain remover and makeup brush cleanser.  Hey, it works!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent price, arrived quickly, well packaged. I have sensitive eyes, and this is the only eye make-up remover that doesn&#x27;t cause problems.</li>
            <li> I have used many things in the past to get my makeup off and by far this works the best. Unlike the drugstore makeup removers, this leaves no oily feeling afterwards and it gets ALL of my makeup off. I won&#x27;t have to use a lot of it to get my makeup off unlike others I have bought and because of that it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that I will buy from now on!  The others that I&#x27;ve tried are oily AND they don&#x27;t work with out scrubbing your eyes red!  This is gentle and works by just placing it to your eyelashes!  I love this.  And it comes in a travel size.  The eye is a delicate area on the face, and I will not use any other product than this one to remove waterproof mascara.  I don&#x27;t want wrinkles or baggy eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many different brand of eye makeup removers, but none can compare!! It removes most if not all eye mascara without damaging the eye area.</li>
            <li> buy this in the department stores but figured i&#x27;d give it a try. the contents didnt look the same, as the liquid was cloudy, i hesitated contacting the seller, which i shouldnt have but....i&#x27;m disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I&#x27;ve tried many other eye makeup removers at different price points. This one is the best. It&#x27;s effective, mild on delicate skin and sensitive eyes. Others always disappoint me. I don&#x27;t bother with them any more.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  It does not irritate my very allergic skin and what a great price.  Do not hesitate to buy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this waterproof mascara remover for years, along with my waterproof Lancôme mascara. They&#x27;re both pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for ten years and no other eye makeup remover compares.  When I go on trips with my friends, and I&#x27;m too lazy to unpack, I sometimes use their products.  When I use their eye make up I always have to use this one to get off what theirs left behind!!!!  I recommend this product to everyone from sensitive skin to girls who wear a lot of eye makeup.  If you get this product you won&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Who would buy a used cosmetic? Not me, gross.&lt;br /&gt;Had to ship it back, waste of time...&lt;br /&gt;I do not recomend this company.</li>
            <li> The only mascara remover that I will use.  It removes mascara without irritating my eyes and is gentle on fine lashes.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out this makeup remover, but I was extremely displeased. When the Lancome BI-FACIL Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover arrived at my house, there were two huge dents at the bottom of the bottle, and multiple scratches all over it. The bottle also looks like it has been opened.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to returne this product, and I have decided not to buy any more makeup products online, because I have always had to return them.</li>
            <li> I had bought this through Lancome and I absolutely love it! It works miracles. I&#x27;m afraid to buy a different kind of makeup remover out of fear that it won&#x27;t work as good. And it lasts forever. Love it!</li>
            <li> For women of any age, but particularly over 40, we do not want to have to rub a product near our eyes to help remove the eye make-up. Bi-Facil is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake the bottle well,saturate a cotton pad, place it on your closed eye for a few seconds,thenwe gently.Voila! The eye makeup is gone without any rubbing or tugging of the sensitive skin around your eyes. Removing stubborn eye makeup like waterproof mascara is a breeze. This 4.2 oz. double-phase, fresh-as-water liquid eye makeup remover activates when you shake it gently. Then, it goes to work to gently whisk away even waterproof eye makeup while conditioning and refreshing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other types of eye makeup removers and this beats the others hands down. This is the best, a little more expensive, but it is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HighlyRecommended. prisrob 04-06-13</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite some time. I recently got tired of ordering online or having to go to a mall to find a lancome retailer and so I explored other brands. Within 2 other brand attempts, I was back at this one. The other brands caused redness and irritation around my eye to the point that I could not wear eye make up and had to apply vaseline constantly throughout the day. This eye makeup remover is very effective and doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> My mom used this and I&#x27;ve been using this since I started wearing makeup. I&#x27;ve dabbled in other eye makeup remover but this has still been my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I have tried many times to bite the bullet and by a cheaper product only to be disappointed. This works. I only have to purchase it a few times a year because a little goes a long way. I probably save money in the long run by not wasting it on inferior products.</li>
            <li> Lancome BI-FACIL Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover (125ml) 4.2 Fluid...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order arrived on time and with no problem. Thanks Ruth</li>
            <li> This is my very favourite eye makeup remover been using it for years... Just the best, tried many others but this in my opinion is the best... Gentle, no dry feeling like some others and not oily just right and removes mascara efficiently .</li>
            <li> ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT ! A++++++++</li>
            <li> I would recommed it to everyones.  It is a great product. Leave your eyes and skin clean in seconds. Love it.</li>
