            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even thought it was nice and not at all over powering.</li>
            <li>The fact that it came before the estimated time was a very nice surprise and to recieve a coupon for a future purchase was a very nice gesture.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>and she said she was sure if she dropped it that it wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the .24oz bottle, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the how it has a floral scent with just a hint of apple.</li>
            <li>one day we&#x27;ll be able to smell through internet but this was not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume at the mall, I told my mom that I loved it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!!</li>
            <li>Fruity but not too sweet!</li>
            <li>I recieved the product very quickly</li>
            <li>I love the fresh smell</li>
            <li>First off this is my friend&#x27;s favorite perfum, so she was going to love it regardless, but there are some other great things she said about it.</li>
            <li>Beautifully fresh scent that will have people stopping you in the street!</li>
            <li>Thanks Donna Karen for your genius once again! :)</li>
            <li>The perfume smells great and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store.</li>
            <li>Showed up quick, just as ordered.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and Floral all in one.</li>
            <li>Fresh, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Other than that great product, smells great, long lasting, quick shipment, and will be buying bigger bottle with sprayer button.</li>
            <li>Most floral scented perfumes give me a headache, but this is different.</li>
            <li>I typically only wear one perfume and have for years, however, I have started wearing this more often.  </li>
            <li>Such a lovely smell, and deffiantly not overpowering.</li>
            <li>She even said that if you accidently tipped it over without the lid and caught it quickly that not much would spill out due to great suction in the bottle. . .</li>
            <li>It smell likes just pure alcohol with no smell.  </li>
            <li>No doubt it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>as I said it has a hint of green apple and yet a light floral scent.</li>
            <li>Only cons I have with this item is it was very small, only good for a short vacation or travel.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty but not very strong, must use alot to get actual dose.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store. Well worth it!!</li>
            <li> im giving this 3 stars because i ididnt know it was an oil.i mean its okay but the smell doesnt laast all day</li>
            <li> Tiny little bottle that lasts for a long time. I love this perfume. No doubt it&#x27;s real. Great price. Would definitely reccommend!</li>
            <li> First off this is my friend&#x27;s favorite perfum, so she was going to love it regardless, but there are some other great things she said about it. It&#x27;s very small. . . VERY small so it fits in just about any clutch or bag she has with ease. The glass is made well and she said she was sure if she dropped it that it wouldn&#x27;t break. It doesn&#x27;t leak or have bad seams. She even said that if you accidently tipped it over without the lid and caught it quickly that not much would spill out due to great suction in the bottle. . . but that when she uses it it comes out well. Just remember, a little goes a long way!! GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty but not very strong, must use alot to get actual dose. Beautiful smell of flowers and freshness. Next time I will get the perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my aunt.  She loved it.  Great size for travelling or on the go.</li>
            <li> Best perfume I&#x27;ve ever owned. I loved the sample I smelled in a magazine (I know...I&#x27;m THAT person), so I decided to try the .24oz bottle, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did. Beautifully fresh scent that will have people stopping you in the street! Thanks Donna Karen for your genius once again! :)</li>
            <li> Fresh and Floral all in one. You only need a little bit and it lasts a very long time.  Love It!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling perfume I have ever come across. Very little needed and the smell will make you stand out. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Showed up quick, just as ordered.  Would not hesitate  ordering again.  Made a great v- tines additional gift for wife</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite perfume. I love the way it smells. Most floral scented perfumes give me a headache, but this is different. It has that fruity smell to it. So delicious.</li>
            <li> I typically only wear one perfume and have for years, however, I have started wearing this more often.  I love the fresh smell and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the mail today...WOW!! I LOVE it! Fresh, not overpowering. Fruity but not too sweet!</li>
            <li> This scent is so wonderful. a hint of green apple. I was afraid it was going to be fruity smelling ,but it isn&#x27;t. as I said it has a hint of green apple and yet a light floral scent. My boyfriend even thought it was nice and not at all over powering. The fact that it came before the estimated time was a very nice surprise and to recieve a coupon for a future purchase was a very nice gesture. I would definetly get this scent again. You may also Like Ralph Lauren Romance as well.</li>
            <li> la fragancia es exquisita y el tamaño es perfecto para llevarlo en la cartera o para tenerlo en el tocador</li>
            <li> Be Delicious smells great. I recieved the product very quickly the website said 5-7 days, I got in in three. The perfume smells great and lasts a very long time. I will definalty be purchasing a bigger bottle. Only cons I have with this item is it was very small, only good for a short vacation or travel. There is also no sprayer in this size because it is so small therefore you have to screw it open and dap it on you with your fingers or cotton ball. I wish it would have had a little button to just spray it on. The bottle is much smaller than what looks like in the picture. Other than that great product, smells great, long lasting, quick shipment, and will be buying bigger bottle with sprayer button.</li>
            <li> I have a larger bottle of this fragrance and this small bottle does not smell anything like it  It smell likes just pure alcohol with no smell.  I did not want to waste my postage to return it.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume at the mall, I told my mom that I loved it. As it turns out, moms do listen! Anyways, I love it. I love the how it has a floral scent with just a hint of apple. Such a lovely smell, and deffiantly not overpowering. I recomend this to anyone who gets headaches with the heavier perfumes like I do.</li>
            <li> one day we&#x27;ll be able to smell through internet but this was not what I wanted. I thought it was something else.</li>
