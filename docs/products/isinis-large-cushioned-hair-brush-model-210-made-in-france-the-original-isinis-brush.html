            <li> The brush is the French brush and is the same brush as the very old one I had.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair and is constantly dealing with split ends.</li>
            <li> They last a long, long, time too, if you do not let them soak in water when cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought the large Isinis with the nylon bristles for my daughter who has very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for long hair especially on children with thin or thick hair.  </li>
            <li> OR if you would use it to brush somebody else hair like your little girl with 15\\&quot; long hair.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few months, I noticed a general improvement in my hair with less breakage and less fallout.  </li>
            <li> I did not contact the seller because of demands on time, but I would ask them if they have this brush without this sharp edge around the handle.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first due to the price</li>
            <li> I do not know if this will wear down in time, but it is not comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> This is sharp and hard on the hand.  </li>
            <li> I had one in the past and wanted another</li>
            <li> The small ones are&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> No more fear of brushing thank the lord.</li>
            <li> So thick that she snapped the handle on her small isinis brush--and was using it as a palm brush.  </li>
            <li> However, you may feel it useless if you have a very long hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it gets the tangles out without a lot of effort.  </li>
            <li> The women in my family have used these brushes for the past 45 years and don&#x27;t intend to stop!  </li>
            <li> and we both had them arrive with this thin raised plastic edge around the handle</li>
            <li> This brush will not help you to get rid of her annoying crying.</li>

            <li> This was just what I was looking for.  I would recommend this brush to anyone.  I had one in the past and wanted another</li>
            <li> I checked the box that this brush was a described but do have one concern about it. The brush is the French brush and is the same brush as the very old one I had. One problem is the molded plastic handle has a ridge on each side of the handle where the mold was formed. This is sharp and hard on the hand.  I do not know if this will wear down in time, but it is not comfortable to use.  I ordered two, one for myself and my adult daughter and we both had them arrive with this thin raised plastic edge around the handle and it seems to be where the handle was molded and comes together.  My old one did not have this.  I did not contact the seller because of demands on time, but I would ask them if they have this brush without this sharp edge around the handle.</li>
            <li> I have already written a review of the brushes--I love them and will keep them as long as I can find them</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone!  I used one for many, many years before it wore out and that is why I ordered another one just like it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush in the whole wide world… This size and the purse size  Highly recommend!  Best brush ever!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. My daughter has very long hair and is constantly dealing with split ends. This brush gets through her hair without pulling or breaking her hair. Bought this for her so I could keep mine! Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used these brushes for many years, I like them so much I bought them for my family.&lt;br /&gt;They feel great when they brush your scalp, do not scratch or pull. The small ones are&lt;br /&gt;great for your purse, the large for your dressing table.I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair brush for long, thick hair.  I have been using them&lt;br /&gt;and giving them as gifts for years.&lt;br /&gt;My seller sent the brushes so quickly that it seemed like I had just ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is an excellent source for everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is good and much better than the ones we can buy from local stores. It works good without pain. It is light enough so you wont feel a wrist pain after you finish brushing you hair.... However, you may feel it useless if you have a very long hair OR if you would use it to brush somebody else hair like your little girl with 15\\&quot; long hair. This brush will not help you to get rid of her annoying crying.</li>
            <li> This brush is great I couldn&#x27;t find a good brush anywhere until I found this one it brushes my hair very nicely</li>
            <li> I bought the large Isinis with the nylon bristles for my daughter who has very thick hair.  So thick that she snapped the handle on her small isinis brush--and was using it as a palm brush.  She loves her large one and has no problems brushing thru her hair now.  The women in my family have used these brushes for the past 45 years and don&#x27;t intend to stop!  It is even great on long wet hair.</li>
            <li> I got this so I could use a natural brush and really does get to scalp with my thick curly hair. I use it mostly to brush through coconut oil and then run hot tap water on it to get oil out of brush.</li>
            <li> This brush feels amazing on the scalp. I&#x27;ve had my ISINIS brush for 11 years, and it is still in great condition. My grandma tried mine and loved it, so I bought her the same brush from Amazon for Christmas. My grandma has had nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the last 27 years.  I have thick hair and it gets the tangles out without a lot of effort.  I have given one of these brushes to everyone in the family and to friends.  They always come back for another one.  This has got to be the \\&quot;Best Brush Ever!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This brush is so great. I never realized that a good brush can make such a difference.  Worth every penny, great price.</li>
            <li> Had used the same brand brush for about 21 yrs. and held out well, gave it to granddaughter for her use - still a good brush</li>
            <li> My granddaughters introduced me to this brush.  After using it for a few months, I noticed a general improvement in my hair with less breakage and less fallout.  I purchased the brush for my daughter-in-law, who then bought them for her sisters, who have now bought more for the rest of their family.  It&#x27;s the only brush my husband will use.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this brush because my hair is fine and tangles easily.  It has really helped!  I have friends who have used this brush for years before having to replace it!</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist and I use nothing but these wonderful brushes for styling and brushing tangles out of wet hair. They last a long, long, time too, if you do not let them soak in water when cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate brush for children (girls) its brushes their hair without the snag and pull and everyone in tears.  I was skeptical at first due to the price but it was worth every penny.  Highly recommend it for long hair especially on children with thin or thick hair.  No more fear of brushing thank the lord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact model of hairbrush for almost 40 years and love the way it feels as it brushes my hair.  It&#x27;s a high quality brand; the cheaper off-brands can&#x27;t compare.</li>
