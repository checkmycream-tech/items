            <li>not so good, it&#x27;s too oil</li>
            <li>This is good for anyone who gets Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>Good to use, the natual formula can be used for any type skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth, a good mask that helps pull the impurities and bacteria from under the skin is needed about 2 to 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>It feels good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the product does a good job removing my makeup and maintaining my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cerave make good products</li>
            <li>because of all the good reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable, widely available, affective, and perfect for combination skin.</li>
            <li>Good size.</li>
            <li>It seems good, but the foam is not as robust as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>However, a good moisturizer takes care of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good amount for the price.</li>
            <li>Good price and good product.</li>
            <li>and it feels and looks like I have cleaned my skin really good.</li>
            <li>The product lasts a good while, something like 1-2 months.</li>
            <li>non-comogenic, so good for the pores, recommended for those with acne.</li>

            <li>I cannot even remember a time that my skin looked and felt as good as it does since using Cerave.</li>
            <li>this is good to use from Spring to Autumn.</li>

            <li>Still love their CeraVe Moisturizing Cream though!</li>
            <li>It is more like a moisturizer than a cleanser!</li>
            <li>It just feels more moist!</li>
            <li>And I start to see more break outs after using this product!</li>
            <li>I have to say, This is better than cetaphil!</li>

            <li>Excellent and fast packing</li>
            <li>It came packaged nicely and has held up.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist gave me samples which I&#x27;ve liked.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>This is an honest review....</li>
            <li>: works great, not smelly, and really works great</li>
            <li>great facial cleanser with great price!</li>
            <li>is absolutely the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>So, this wasn&#x27;t any kind of miracle worker for</li>
            <li>feel the oil get removed from your face, so somewhat drying but effective</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this soap and I have been loving it ever since.</li>
            <li>Takes off makeup like nobody&#x27;s business and rinses off nicely.</li>
            <li>CereVe has many good products.</li>
            <li>Save your money for a nice serum.</li>
            <li>NICE.</li>
            <li>It also seems to leave a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Really thought this brand would be best for my face.</li>
            <li>Nice for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Use this at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I use it with my clarisonic mia and it foams up nicely.</li>
            <li>The formula foams up nicely and removes the residue from my makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Such great Quality...!&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed.</li>
            <li>do kind of like the way my skin has kind of cleared up</li>
            <li>If you use it once in a while it will give your face a nice feeling and make you look healthier.</li>
            <li>I prefer the moisturizing kind for &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s watery), smells nice without being girly, and does its job of taking off the day and makeup.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>nice thing is it feels like it cleans well</li>
            <li>Of course everyone has their own skin types and needs.</li>
            <li>The cleanser foams nicely and removes excess oil and makeup without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>I never have this kind of acne</li>
            <li>To be honest I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, I&#x27;ve used the hydrating cleanser</li>
            <li>It works best if you take the time to lather up and then rub gently.</li>
            <li>how many good ones there are.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>It cleans nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>I have honestly tried almost every facewash out there and this blows all of them out of the water.</li>
            <li>but I really think this cleanser is one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Great for makeup removal and makes my face really clean.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I use it to clean my beard while showering.</li>
            <li>It is best for normal to oily skin, but you can use it if your skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon has better pricing, unless you&#x27;re able to find a good sale at a drugstore.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this since there is so many good reviews on this product</li>
            <li>Great for a quick wash though.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product so far!</li>
            <li>Great deal, great product, super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>It does have a light lovely scent and foams very nicely.</li>
            <li>I originally started with the moisturizing cleanser and that worked great for most of my face, but it made my forehead way to oily all the time.</li>
            <li>Good cleanser if you want something mild and with no scent!</li>
            <li>I have not found anything else in this price range that I have ever liked better.</li>
            <li>but this one is the best one by far.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best Mens face wash on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have skin that is particularly sensitive, but I think this cleanser is especially good for those who do.</li>
            <li>and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve come across thus far.</li>
            <li>It creates a foamy lather and is just perfect for frequent use.</li>
            <li>I switched off of my spendy clinique stuff to see if the cheap stuff could do as good of a job.</li>
            <li>and I honestly think it works better.</li>
            <li>The most amazing face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The best part of this cleanser is that it leaves your skin at the correct pH level and doesn&#x27;t strip the skin&#x27;s natural acid mantle.</li>
            <li>I tried to get off it and use goats milk soap since it works lovely on my body gives it a nice glow</li>
            <li>It feels nice but strips everything away and leaves my skin overcompensating and producing even more grossness.</li>
            <li>the pill cleared up my acne completely and this cleanser was the perfect compliment for my face.</li>
            <li>Its amazing I love it</li>
            <li>After trying what seems like every face soap on the market, this is clearly the best in my view.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and looks great!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think this would be ideal for someone with very oily skin but mine</li>
            <li>Best foaming cleanser for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this face wash takes all my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes , I love how it foams for a great clean feeling</li>
            <li>Love love love this face cleanser!  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>Just received my order and am excited to see if it keeps working good for my face.</li>
            <li>While this may not apply to everyone, I would think a bit more research on your own may help you make more informed decision on this product.</li>
            <li>The perfect scent free gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; probably great for any skin type, as it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>Nice clean feeling!</li>
            <li>This face wash also works great as hand soap (if you&#x27;re willing to use it for your hands as it can be pricey).</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin very smooth, and my pimples dissapeard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels very comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li>It also rinses easily and foams up nicely.</li>
            <li>I created foams with fair amount of CeraVe cleanser after I washed my face first with warm water, applied them on my face and circularly massaged my face for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Very mild, scentless and effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>Foams up nicely and cleans off easily.</li>
            <li>Mild Face wash, Lovely Fragrance and is a good cleaner.</li>
            <li>:) works excellent and does not dry my face out at all.</li>
            <li>this is a very good mild foaming cleanser that does the job just right.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth texture and pleasant smell, but the most important thing is that it does wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li>Very good product for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After just a couple of days I noticed a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>and I have already noticed a HUGE difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>This cleanser works well, and takes off most makeup (with the exception of waterproof).  </li>
            <li>I guess its ok...</li>
            <li>ok..</li>
            <li>Wish I found this face wash many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite face was</li>
            <li>It removes makeup better than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The CeRave products I&#x27;ve used are the best, especially the Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many reviews on this brand and decided to go for the foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>so you get the best outsome possible.</li>
            <li>I think I will try the moisturizing version and see if that gives better results.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth..</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>gave me more acne than it cleared</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for my whole family.</li>
            <li>Worked better for me than cetaphil.</li>
            <li>GREAT price - highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really love this face wash.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Love the gentleness of CeraVe products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>but i am glad i did.</li>
            <li>This product is simply the best in price and quality.</li>
            <li>This face wash is amazing, it leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Using this along with the CeraVE AM/PM lotions has simplified my routine, and my skin feels better, and looks better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>If I can get her to use the AM lotion, then I&#x27;d truly be #winning</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t feel like it washes your face, more like dries it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li>LOVE with cleanser.</li>
            <li>After using this for a while - my face has never felt more balanced.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but could&#x27;ve been handled better.</li>
            <li>I love this foaming cleanser</li>
            <li>The thing I like best about this is that it removes my eye makeup entirely without having to re-wash the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Non drying aspect is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews and saw that this product was given mostly 5 out of 5</li>
            <li>am so glad I bought this product and tried it out</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Love cleanser,</li>
            <li>but when I turned the bottle to allow it to pump, the top broke.  </li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;intense menthol&amp;#34; feeling, but I love it.</li>
            <li>This is great and takes makeup off really well.  </li>
            <li>More and more breakouts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this cleanser many times and have not found anything I like better yet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about 7 years now and love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing to write home about, just OK.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent- the shipping costs twice as much as the product itself, but it was still worth it.</li>
            <li>and I think it is helping my moisturizer perform better as well.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive, and works better than any luxury brand cleanser I have used.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I wanted something to help aid in healthy skin.</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid works wonder :)</li>
            <li>i tried it once more just to be sure.  </li>
            <li>now, i am sure that this is not a product that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this face wash.</li>
            <li>But I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Often times you won&#x27;t know if your cleanser is overdrying your face because your body will produce more oil to make up for it, and then you&#x27;ll have more acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite exfoliator is [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]].  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>(Better than Aveeno, which we had been using, and which the kids say &amp;#34;hurts&amp;#34; when they put it on.)</li>
            <li>Was given a sample size at my dermatologist 3 weeks ago and love it.</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve found in reviews, this is much better than the 2x</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts forever even with daily washing, it doesn&#x27;t sting if I get it in my eyes, and it rinses off perfectly without any residue.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>They ask for more.</li>
            <li>I love using this face wash.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser</li>
            <li>omg love this ....</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser</li>
            <li>Love it ,I can feel it the result</li>
            <li>Using it in the shower does better than trying to get it all rinsed off over the sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the lotion too :)</li>
            <li>I would pay more to buy a better one than this.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>It cleans WAY better then Cetaphil as well.</li>
            <li>Favorite wash</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Referred by my dermatologist and this price is a lot cheaper:)</li>
            <li>Before this I have tried AcneFree, Neutrogena face wash (many products) but</li>
            <li>just a perfect simple face wash.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist suggested I start using, skin feels like it can breathe 10x more</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I hope it always works because if so I found the best facial cleanser ever!!!</li>
            <li>For me, CeraVe’s Foaming Facial Cleanser is the perfect medium.</li>
            <li>so this might be better for those with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin or even combination skin.</li>
            <li>but if it wasn&#x27;t safe I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t still be on the market.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser ever!!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Better than most face washes/cleansers I have paid more for.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>update when I&#x27;m sure if it is this or not.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it foams and the smell better than set a fill.</li>
            <li>It works best when you mix it with A LOT of water (equal parts almost) and scrub it in your hands till a lot of foam is made.</li>
            <li>Great gentle face wash.  </li>
            <li>The best I could get before was washing my face with water because cleansers were such an issue</li>
            <li>but it is so much better than it was before I started using the cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite for the shower.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m breaking out in acne more so than I did before</li>
            <li>Love cerave lotion on my body too (doesn&#x27;t do well with my face).</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>I want to love this and keep using it</li>
            <li>One of my favorite cleansers.</li>
            <li>NOTE TO BE SURE</li>
            <li>It is gentle and makes my skin happy.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>but i prefer Benzoyl peroxide face wash more than this.</li>
            <li>The foaming cleanser is refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance added in that could irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.....</li>
            <li>At 27, I still get acne even with a healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li>and I do love the CeraVe Moisturizing Cleanser.</li>
            <li>really works at removing makeup feels great</li>
            <li>Followed with a good skin-care regime, I rarely break out anymore</li>
            <li>and my skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>I like this product way more than Cetaphil because I feel more refreashed</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Love CeraVe products.</li>
            <li>Visits to dermatologists were met with suggestions to moisturize more, then suggestions to switch from lotions to oils, and then from oils to petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I will still use but probably</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>, my skin gets more even feeling</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am insanely pleased with this product and its coinciding lotion.</li>
            <li>say that it is great!&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea has been a problem for many years</li>
            <li>I love this foaming cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Using this has cleared my skin and made me look like the sexy beast I was always meant to look like.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser ive ever used at ANY price!</li>
            <li>Foaming Facial Cleanser is perfect for use at the end of the day when I want to get all my creams, serums, sunscreens and makeup off and prep my skin for my retin a application.</li>
            <li>great product -----gentle and does the job</li>
            <li>I used Cetaphil for years but read this was better.  </li>
            <li>I am so incredibly glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I love the cleaning power of CeraVe along with the ease of use.  </li>
            <li>So, I just bought a couple more pump bottles of it,</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel and after a week I can already feel the difference.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this cleanser is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products.</li>
            <li>Bought more at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>My derm suggested that I use this as a facial wash morning and night and it cleanses and hydrates my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>To say I&#x27;m impressed would be a gross understatement.</li>
            <li>Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I use this daily for years now and this is the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but as in all skin care products, it takes time.  </li>
            <li>Love this cleanser</li>
            <li>Love this face wash.</li>
            <li>if anything cause more on my chin..will continue to search.</li>
            <li>It might work for most, just not for me.</li>
            <li>I used Cetaphil before and enjoyed it, but felt it was time for a switch.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks much better after using it.</li>
            <li>The best facial cleaner I&#x27;ve used is...</li>
            <li>Excellent for a daily face wash.</li>
            <li>I am Very satisfied with the Full Satisfactionresults of this product</li>
            <li>This has definitely been the best cleanser I have tried</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>I saw this at the store and thought I would see if maybe my lips were chapped because I needed more moisture.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always looking for a better face wash.</li>
            <li>It is also cheaper than most acne washes.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The best I could get before was washing my face with water because cleansers were such an issue</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can see not being able to use this in Fall and having to move to the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser.</li>
            <li>but might be better for oilier skin types in cooler months.</li>
            <li>Better than p..active.</li>
            <li>and this stuff definitely works the best.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using CeraVe hydrating cleanser for many years.</li>
            <li>I have a subscription to save even more.  </li>
            <li>Works even better than Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>like better if pump worked</li>
            <li>so, yes I love CeraVe cleanser.  </li>
            <li>If you look up scholarly journal articles discussing the safety of methylparabens, they have been tested as safe.</li>
            <li>Best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>My skin is so much more softer.</li>
            <li>Day by day my skin is clearing up more and more.</li>
            <li>Also look into their Facial Moisturizer, it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using CeraVe for almost 2 months now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good quality product, effective yet gentle.</li>
            <li>It is effective and does a good job at removing makeup and is really gentle and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>this was the most popular form of cerave, which i&#x27;d heard good things about, so i figured i should be safe with a product labeled &#x27;normal to oily.&#x27;</li>
            <li>It offers the perfect amount of lather, but rinses clean without leaving that slimy slippery feel.</li>
            <li>Using to help reduce breakouts, so far so good!</li>
            <li>It has a nice, clean scent.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will be great for someone with normal skin and no acne but just not for me.</li>
            <li>In general, I would say, CeraVe&#x27;s skin products are very good.</li>
            <li>l loved it very much.</li>
            <li>Best product found for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gets my skin very clean without drying it out and keeps me from getting breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This gets my skin very clean without feeling stripped or stressed.</li>
            <li>but my skin still feels very clean after.</li>
            <li>Face feels very clean when I use this.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, his face is very clean without oil now.</li>
            <li>This will hold up as a winter and a summer wash making your face feel very clean.</li>
            <li>I have combination and he has normal, great for both</li>
            <li>My face is looking the best it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>It did good for the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, gentle on skin and nice smell, I will continue to use this often and order more.</li>
            <li>, it is gentle, fragrance-free, and effective!</li>
            <li>1 pump is all it takes to wash your face, so a bottle lasts a pretty good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, effective, and I even think it&#x27;s helped with my breakouts!</li>
            <li>It feels very refreshing and minty, but it doesn&#x27;t keep my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>this is good cleanser, good for sensitive skin and make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It is really affordably priced, and the pump is very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>so so i need something more strong.</li>
            <li>I have rosecea, and this is a nice mild cleanser for the face.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, absorbs quickly, and even after applying it liberally, pajamas do not stick.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is Super Amazing</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and this cleanser is both mild and effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear cleanser which is interesting, and it is working great for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wonderful product that is great for sensitive skin and especially great in the winter when I am more prone to dry skin!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling wonderfully clean!</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t have known that I could wash my face and have my skin feeling clean and MOISTURIZED!</li>
            <li>and you can feel your face skin as clean as breathing!</li>
            <li>CeraVe did not irritate at all and gets my skin clean!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel clean after washing my face!</li>
            <li>So I researched the best cleansers for COMBINATION (oily/dry) SKIN, and this beat out many other pricier options.  </li>
            <li>very good facial wash .does what it says .foams</li>
            <li>Nothing special but better than most store brand washing I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It really does the trick of washing away all impurities, giving my face a bright glow after each use.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin and all skin types.</li>
            <li>Also switched my pre-teen from Neutrogena&#x27;s oil-free acne wash to this and it has GREATLY improved her early years acne.</li>
            <li>but I imagine it is gentle and effective enough to be excellent for a variety of skin types.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin has felt much more comfortable after shaving if I use this before a shave.  </li>
            <li>Great for adult acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for sensitive and acne prone skin - trust me</li>
            <li>works great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Good gentle wash that does the job and cleans your face well.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin and does a really good job of cleansing without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cleanser for 2 years and it does a good job at not irritating my skin like salicylic acids and scrubs</li>
            <li>You get a really good amount for the price, and it keeps both my and my husband&#x27;s skin clearer than anything else we&#x27;ve used (including the department store stuff that&#x27;s twice as much money for a quarter of the amount of product).</li>
            <li>(I will spend good money on lotions and potions, but I just can&#x27;t embrace spending too much on a cleanser that washes away.)  </li>
            <li>Good at removing makeup, acne not so much</li>
            <li>and I heard this product was a really good cleanser, but I can say, after many washes, I could live without it.</li>
            <li>Great product, mild cleanser and really cleanses your face without drying.</li>
            <li>Clean smell and very light.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>While that cleanser worked magic on my skin, this one is comparable, and significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li>First time ever buying this but love it!  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get this facial cleanser because I read that for combination skin the best kind of cleanser to use is a gentle foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>This cleanser achieves wonderful results and lasts a very long time- a great value, given its low, affordable cost.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really easy to dispense</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>It eliminates blemishes very quickly.</li>
            <li>Very mild and does what it says.</li>
            <li>It removes mascara easily.  </li>
            <li>It removes eye makeup easily, and when I use toner afterward, there is never a trace of leftover makeup on the cotton pad.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t hurt to use and its easy to apply</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and rinses off easily.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It easily sits in the medicine cabinet, to the side of the sink, in the shower, etc.</li>
            <li>and easily pumps out.</li>
            <li>I feel so refreshing and clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>Easy on your skin and works well.</li>
            <li>However, this Foaming Cleanser which I&#x27;ve purchased many times even through Amazon gives you a nice lather that makes it feel as though as your face IS really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin is prone to being easily burned from the stronger cleansers.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleaner for reactive or sensitive skin because it is especially gentle.</li>
            <li>[...] has a great list of comedogenic and harsh ingredients to avoid  when choosing a good face wash and this one has none of them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and cleans the face leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely been the most amazing cleaner Ive ever used.</li>
            <li>However, this face wash turned out to be PERFECT and just what I needed: it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, it&#x27;s nice and gentle, doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Too strong for my skin (combination).</li>
            <li>really love how gentle the hydrating wash is, and it also nicely removes make-up.  </li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for all people out there.</li>
            <li>Feels like a very gentle yet effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference after using this product, but I find it to be very refreshing on the face.</li>
            <li>Great ingredients and face felt soft and clean after washing.  </li>
            <li>More comfortable, clean feel, non-irritant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This face wash is the best for my skin hands down.</li>
            <li>It might not be great on dry skin, but use it on normal skin and it is great for oily areas like the nose or forehead.                                            </li>
            <li>Feels very refreshing and minty and keeps my face feeling fresh, very effective at washing dirt/oil off my face after a long work day.</li>
            <li>Really lathers well and gives your face a nice, refreshing, clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Delivery and packaging were fine.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and it does not dry my face out and it makes my face feels great after use</li>
            <li>and I like it just fine.</li>
            <li>but it works fine now.</li>
            <li>even bar soap or bronner&#x27;s is fine.    </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>She told me it was going to take a while for the prescription to come in, which was totally fine with me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many things over the years to control my mild acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the lotion, but never tried the cleanser- very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>This foams really well and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation I love it!</li>
            <li>What I like best is that it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin nor does it feel tight after cleansing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great gentle face wash that I will certainly buy again when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>and I rarely get blemishes or breakouts anymore!  </li>
            <li>The fact that it contains ceramides is something that has my mother excited as well, since she&#x27;s a fan of Dr Oz</li>
            <li>o so fresh!  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for this, was excited to try.</li>

            <li>It leaves your skin feeling cool and smooth, no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not the sort to go out of my way to review products like this online, but I have been so impressed with this cleanser that I just had to put the word out there for anyone else who might find themselves in a similar predicament as what I described.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed that I had a significant increase of pimples on my face because of the moisturizers.</li>
            <li>and my skin is needing a rich, moisturizing cleanse.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed even after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Face feels clean and fresh after each use!</li>
            <li>JUST CLEAN AND FRESH!  </li>
            <li>Great for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Still, I like the clean feel of the product and ease of use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil before and didn&#x27;t like how my face didn&#x27;t have that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li>and it does get my skin clean with out drying it out.  </li>
            <li>Seems to clean my face without bothering my skin in any noticeable way.</li>

            <li>I moisturizer AFTER I clean, so</li>
            <li>After washing, my skin feels EXTREMELY clean and refreshed and it feels tighter even.</li>
            <li>A great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry at all.</li>
            <li>but my face feels so clean afterwards.</li>

            <li>Makes my face feel clean, but hasn&#x27;t helped noticeably with breakouts with about 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t keep my skin clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Best facial cream cleanser I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This is conjunction with chemically exfoliating every day with mild glycolic and salicylic acids, benzyol peroxide on acne-prone areas, and a light day</li>
            <li>I tend to break out AND have be somewhat dry, and this is great.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin clean and moist, with no fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product that will get your skin clean without overdrying and to remove all of your make-up, you have to purcahse this.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser&#x27;s pH is perfect for the skin and has helped to clear up and repair my damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>cleansing with CeraVe, I apply milky cleanser with cotton ball, and cotton ball remains completely clean showing no dirt.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to anyone who normally buys cetaphil normal to oily skin face wash, and</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean afterwards, but not tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no nonsense clean.</li>
            <li>I switched from Cetaphil to this because the Cetaphil just didn&#x27;t make my face feel completely clean.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect especially for sensitive skin people.</li>
            <li>It gets sudsy and my face feels clean after I rinse my face</li>
            <li>i want something that will clean my face, not add oils or a waxy layer to my skin.</li>
            <li>my face feels clean and moisturized without being stripped and it keeps my acne away.</li>
            <li>But you feel clean when its washed off.</li>
            <li>I say its excellent as a daily cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t rob your skin of complete moisture and elasticity.</li>

            <li>Not over drying and face feels clean after washing.</li>
            <li>(I know, shame on me) and this leaves your skin clean and almost squeaky clean but not quite because</li>
            <li>it was surprisingly smooth and nice to my sensitive</li>
            <li>It washes off well and leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean also.</li>
            <li>and I found the reason for me breaking out is oftentimes the facial cleanser being too irratating, so I found this one, and so far it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to remove makeup and leaves my skin so white and smooth - flawless....</li>
            <li>I ordered this cleanser after reading so many positive reviews</li>
            <li>Helped clear away her skin and now her face looks more youthful than before!</li>
            <li>but that is best for normal to dry skin</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser along with the lotion for normal to dry skin which provides the perfect balance for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and has improved my skin tremendously!!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t anything special though.</li>
            <li>Just right for my Rosacea plagued face!  </li>
            <li>It is amazing for my sensitive skin because it&#x27;s unscented and it leaves my skin feeling clean without any tightness or dryness.</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin that is combination, this works really nice to keep your skin feeling clean and removing makeup.</li>
            <li>It cleans and prevents oily skin really well, while leaving your face feeling incredibly clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>up very well leaves skin feeling lovely and clean will buy again.</li>
            <li>It leaves her face clean and smooth, it is a great cleaner but not harsh to sensitive skin and non-drying.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is Ok but not 100% effective as it still leaves make up residue and does not completely get everything off.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing and silky and will clear your skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is pretty good for sensitive skin, though not so accustomed as one with oil skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was pretty good and clear before I started using this product</li>
            <li>However its great on all my make up brushes and pink makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>&amp; my skin feels soft &amp; amazing.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive, acne-prone, normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, lathers up great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling too dry or irritated.</li>
            <li>Just one full pump</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s relatively sensitive, and so far, it&#x27;s loving loving this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>Love this gentle face wash.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call this a foaming cleanser (mostly because I&#x27;ve had foaming cleansers before that REALLY foam)</li>
            <li>This cleanser is mild yet leaves your face feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product especially for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Cool cleanser.</li>
            <li>It removes all my makeup well and is good for anyone looking for a daily face wash.</li>
            <li>There is also a hydrating variation which is even more gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a gel cleaner that doesn&#x27;t really foam.  </li>
            <li>This product is really good, it reminds me of the formula of clarisonic facial cleanser</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about CeraVe.</li>
            <li>I want that super clean feeling BEFORE I apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The foaming version gets rid of makeup and oils better than the gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about CeraVe foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>you do all 4 of these steps, I promise you&#x27;ll have much much much clearer skin :)</li>
            <li>you do all 4 of these steps, I promise you&#x27;ll have much much much clearer skin :)</li>
            <li>Good for me and my teenage kids.</li>
            <li>i wear make-up every day and this does a good job getting all the makeup off without any extra effort.</li>
            <li>My BF is a doctor, and he (and our dermatologist) love the whole CeraVe line.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice soft feel to skin after rinsing face.  </li>
            <li>All around good soap; I only use it on my face</li>
            <li>I am currently a full time student</li>
            <li>I like it better, and the price is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>Im sure it would help woman with removing makeup or the dirt on the very surface of your face</li>
            <li>Men, you need to wash your face, and you need to buy a good facial cleanser (not body wash).</li>
            <li>For the most part my skin is very oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;The true test came when i had to stop using them because i had my eyebrows tattooed and couldn&#x27;t because of the hyaluronic acid, which dermatologist recommend all your cleansers should have.  </li>
            <li>have a nice natural glow an no longer have flaky cheeks with a shiny forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li>On top of all that it is really overpriced.</li>
            <li>Loving this face was so far.</li>
            <li>It has worked well for me in conjunction with a good moisturizer and occasional AHA</li>
            <li>I really cannot express how much better my face feels with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t even need to moisturize after using it, my skin just feels better all day.</li>
            <li>I am a pharmacist, and this is my go-to product for patients asking for a good cleanser, and so I finally decided to give it a shot myself.</li>
            <li>I suggest grape seed oil because it&#x27;s better price and it absorb as fast as 2 others that i use.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Good facial cleanser, will buy again!</li>
            <li>It works really good and recommend this to people who like me was looking for a facial cleanser that works well.</li>
            <li>but I realized there had to be something out there that was even more gentle....</li>
            <li>Makes you&#x27;re face feel so refreshed, it&#x27;s actually better than the hydrate cleanse because the foam really gets under your skin barriers.</li>
            <li>I love how much it lathers</li>
            <li>So cool</li>
            <li>Really good standard cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Purchased it based on the numerous 5 stars and the price, and it was a good decision that I made.</li>
            <li>have found that a dime sized pump is the sweet spot for me.  </li>
            <li>: For those with mildly sensitive skin, this is a nice, cheaper alternative to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>So not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not NEARLY as quickly or badly as soap does,</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so gentle and mild, I love it.</li>
            <li>It is great and really helps with my complexion, it does not dry out my skin either.  </li>
            <li>It is a light and effective cleaner and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s great in one sense because it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, but I will be exploring for other, better cleansers for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I am fortunate to have very clear skin and with CeraVe, it is sure to stay that way for years to come.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling clean and natural.</li>
            <li>Feels great and my face (which has historically felt very oily) stays clean all day with this product + a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It washes off pretty easily and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>CeraVe makes excellent products for those with sensitive and very dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I would have to say that overall, it&#x27;s a very good cleanser for people with combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle, straightforward wash that does the job and was easily incorporated into my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at removing light to heavy makeup.</li>
            <li>face feels fresh and clean, reduces redness IMO, doesn&#x27;t overdry</li>
            <li>Works well on all skin types and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh with no residue.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean, fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel fresh and clean without drying out my dry-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean and there is no over powering smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best product lines around, and the foaming facial cleanser is not without exception.</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and this is super moisturizing for my face</li>
            <li>I switched to cerave products and it had helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I have a combination/oily skin prone to break outs and this cleanser helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>My skin is SUPER oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mild, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>No fancy mumbo jumbo or super perfumey scents.</li>
            <li>Despite what the label says it isn&#x27;t actually a foam, it&#x27;s more of a gel, and I love the texture.</li>
            <li>has been helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and helping with my chronic acne problem.</li>
            <li>love FOAMING FACIAL more.</li>
            <li>find this cleanser to be mild and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>Many people are allergic to Propylparaben so make sure you know that the inclusion of this chemical is not going to work against whatever you wish to achieve with this specific product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most favorite facial cleanser of all time.</li>
            <li>and I love this cleanser more than any big department store brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never noticed any makeup leftover after I wash with this, though I do use a mildly exfoliating wash cloth with it so that probably helps.</li>
            <li>Works great as a gentle shampoo especially for baldies like me.</li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant smell and is a very generous amount of cleanser for the low price.</li>
            <li>Great gentle facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>As someone who had quite a bit of acne through high school and college, I was so glad I came upon Cerave.</li>
            <li>Based off all of the positive reviews, this works for many, but sadly not me.</li>
            <li>but it does glide on pretty light and has the feel and texture of foam.</li>
            <li>I gave it to a friend who has normal skin and they love it  </li>
            <li>I do not know the source of the hyaluronic acid in this product, but you should be aware that this may not be a vegan product (if that is important to you).</li>
            <li>12/22: There exists a chemical that is infinitely more effective at curing acne vulgaris than any other face wash on the market.  </li>
            <li>This is the gentlest face wash I&#x27;ve ever used, and it seems more effective than the other anti-acne face washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>have tried other foaming cleansers but this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this facial cleanser makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Cerave cleansers are the best, no garbage, bad ingredients and is good for most highly sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know technically what makes this so good, but it just feels so superior to other face washes.</li>
            <li>I really have found it to be true!  </li>
            <li>My new favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>I kept looking in the mirror to see how many new zits popped up over night and am so relieved to see almost none.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this oily skin version in stores where I live anymore, so I&#x27;m glad I could find it here.</li>
            <li>Within 1 week i havent seen much of a change, maybe a lil more breakout (but from what i understand thats normal with new products) but my skin itself looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This seems to work great for my skin, much less breakouts</li>
            <li>This product is good for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Foaming action was great and left my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It cleanses my face very well and easily washes away makeup.</li>
            <li>Works good but it does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>It is also very gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed after using.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin but seems to clean well.</li>
            <li>This worked exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I have been using the CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser for around 6 months and my face is looking so much better!</li>
            <li>The BEST facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my normal-combination skin and cleans well too.</li>
            <li>This has a great scent, cleans very well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry, sticky, oily, or anything.</li>
            <li>If my skin is dry I also just recently discovered CeraVe Moisturizing cream, which is awesome as well.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently</li>
            <li>-in-all, I think this is a mild but effective facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sidenote: It also feels super soft on your face :)</li>
            <li>Buy it and have a happy, not overly cleansed, tight mask-face.</li>
            <li>Immediately after using my face feels clean and refreshed and I am ready to start my day!</li>
            <li>My skin feels great and looks like it is finally starting to clear up!</li>
            <li>I started a regimen where I clean first with a mixture of sunflower and castor oil, then wash the oil off with this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Pimples are rarely appearing and my mild scarring has almost all faded into clear healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>unlike cetaphil and other nonfoaming gentle cleansers, this takes one pump and good massage w/ hands on face, and gets your face CLEAN!  </li>
            <li>Soft and good for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Im very pleased to have found something that is gentle on my 62 yr old sensitive skin, effective at cleaning oils &amp; makeup, &amp; is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the fact that there is a large quantity so that I don&#x27;t have to continually buy pint-sized products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to your skin care routine if you&#x27;ve got skin that tends to be a little on the oily side.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser, but dries the skin a little.</li>
            <li>This is important as it breaks down into a fairly watery consistency, pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy getting it from Amazon because the store price is so high!</li>
            <li>Amazing product wading with this twice a day helped eliminate a majority of the facial acne I&#x27;ve been struggling with for years.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important for me to use gentle products.</li>
            <li>Amazing facial wash!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to me by my dermatologist</li>
            <li>This lasted me months and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Did not feel like it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it irritated my skin ,i have sensitive skin ,many cleanser gave me rashes ,so did this one</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what that meant until I tried it and from my conclusion it doesn&#x27;t wash away or strip to skin from the natural moister that your skin needs.</li>
            <li>and I rarely break out.</li>
            <li>I bought CeraVe after reading all the stunning reviews, and so far I&#x27;ve had no complaints at all.</li>
            <li>but I buy it anyway because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I really prefer this over Cetaphil; it doesn&#x27;t leave a film but is just as kind to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>and I rarely break out at all.</li>
            <li>Felt good, cleaned well, but gave me closed comedomes.</li>
            <li>it foams up nicely and your face feels clean after..not dry..</li>
            <li>Lathers great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my teenage daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li>From what i was reading i was expecting that it would be a nice facial cleaner that would be easier on my face than oxyclean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;mm allergic to most face cleaners and so far no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>but you actually can use any kind of oil that you like.</li>
            <li>I finally found product that is great for my sensitive skin and my acne.</li>
            <li>it definitely is worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The only kind of face wash</li>
            <li>This has helped so much so far and my skin is beginning to look much better.</li>
            <li>love how soft it leaves my face</li>
            <li>These have natural ingredients and suds up much better - plus you can use this on your hair, skin, for shaving, and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done better for my acne and blackheads than anything else, completely clearing them up and not causing dryness.  </li>
            <li>These have natural ingredients and suds up much better - plus you can use this on your hair, skin, for shaving, and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done better for my acne and blackheads than anything else, completely clearing them up and not causing dryness.  </li>
            <li>This product is only slightly drying, and I am sure if you have normal to oily skin, this will be PERFECT for you!</li>
            <li>This is the best cleanser I have ever used on my pale, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In other words, our own hormones have a much more adverse affect on breast cancer cells than methylparabens do, and that&#x27;s only if it is able to come into contact with existing breast cancer cells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure and fresh and nondrying and we use it each and every day!</li>
            <li>It works well to easily remove all my foundation and concealer, but is still pretty gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other facial cleansers like this the best.</li>
            <li>Cleans off makeup very well and at the other end of the spectrum turns my face into a great canvas for makeup application.</li>
            <li>It does a superior job at removing eye makeup (even without using the Clarisonic), and definitely leaves my skin feeling both soft and clean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I was afraid that it wasn&#x27;t going to be good with washing off my makeup which is important, but it&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>This cleanser makes my skin feel sooo smooth, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>While the product itself seems very similar to Cetaphil, this leaves my skin more moist and clean than Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, you need a good exfoliator to clean away all of the dead skin and gunk that clogs your pores to begin with.  </li>
            <li>May be okay for most people, but my skin is super sensitive and my face felt like it was on fire and then turned red.  </li>
            <li>It works and the price is just right.</li>
            <li>I wish I had time to return it for the right one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the right skin routine for me.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it does the job, and does it right.</li>
            <li>He was absolutely right.</li>
            <li>I switched to Philosophy Face Wash and my foundation just comes off right away</li>
            <li>so it might not be what&#x27;s right for you.*tile Liquid Soap - (Baby Unscented, 32 oz)]].</li>
            <li>so it might not be what&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>So gentle, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling stripped, but you can feel that your skin is clean.</li>
            <li>,it was totally clean ,i hope also have a night cream ,i want to buy again ,thanks amazon</li>
            <li>I bought this face wash (Foaming Facial Cleanser - for Normal to Oily Skin) because I read that it was good for helping improve acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle on your skin but still leaves your face refreshed and clean</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see much results, but does feel face feeling somewhat clean</li>
            <li>stuff is definitely great and worth all the hype, it is not harsh at all on my skin which has been bullied so much over the years from use of the St. Ives Almond Scrub and various harsher cleansers.</li>
            <li>I like my face to feel SUPER clean and this apparently has some type of moisturizer in it, so it does not leave my face squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and easy to use, it works very well with my skin</li>
            <li>Wash the very comfortable and clea，n not greasy， foam a little more</li>
            <li>While it has more ingredients, more chemical ingredients, apparently said chemicals are better or less agitating to the skin.  </li>
            <li>my physician recommended because most face washing soaps have been to harsh on my skin, CeraVe cleaned my face perfectly without being to harsh but still removing all the yuck from the day</li>
            <li>This cleanser has been great on my face for the past year.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you have issues with cleansers for sensitive skin not doing a good enough job of removing sunblock and makeup.</li>
            <li>By far the best face wash I have ever used and those from Amazon that I have tried include Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash and Aveeno Active Naturals Foaming Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, consider doing a little more research on the item you want so you can make a more informed decision.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser, hands down!</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel amazing and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li>CeraVe is gentle, mild and foamy.</li>
            <li>I bought this after using Burt&#x27;s Bees cream facial cleanser, which honestly didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>The only facial cleanser I use, It is great</li>
            <li>I usually alternate between this and good ole St Ives apricot scrub for some exfoliation, then follow up with Thayers toner and Nivea sensitive moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and tends to break out easily.  </li>
            <li>The liquid is clear and non-scented (it doesn’t have a medicinal smell either) and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>This dried up some pimples then the pimples feel off and was left with beautiful skin even with just one use!</li>
            <li>I am so glad to finally find a reasonably priced, effective, and gentle cleanser to help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>I have used expensive lines for many years until I read the great recommendation.</li>
            <li>For even more sensitive skin I highly recommend their baby wash/shampoo!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, removes makeup nicely</li>
            <li>CeraVe is an underrated skincare brand, but their basics are all great and work without being too harsh or drying, and they&#x27;re very affordable.</li>
            <li>Its really gentle on the face, it almost feels like it isn&#x27;t soap when it contacts your face because its so mild.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a mild cleanser that would be gentle on my eyes, but remove all my makeup at once.</li>
            <li>since the whole line is supposed to be very gentle and well-tolerated by most, i was surprised that my skin reacted so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s leaves your skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first day I used this I pumped 1.5 pumps into my hand and quickly realized that it was WAY too much.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle, non drying.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and It does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>, this thing is very gentle.</li>
            <li>This is a very straight to the point cleanse.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle, yet, removes all my make up, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li>This cleanser works well and is very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, i do like it.</li>
            <li>very gently washed.....</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>The texture of it in my hands feel very much like a gel.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and when I wash this, it&#x27;s very gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t bother my Rosacea.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend likes this very much.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial cleanser - I have been buying it for a good year and a half now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle cleanser, which is great, but it does a poor job of getting my face clean.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive oily/acne prone skin - and some wrinkles to add to the fun! - and have been really happy with this cleanser for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li>I have tried literally all the face washs at the drug store, so I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li>Not at all abrasive but definitely cleanses my face to a sqeaky clean and smooth feel.</li>
            <li>It is gentle as well!</li>
            <li>This cleanser is fantastic for those who have sensitive skin or anyone that is looking for a quality, well-priced, and non-irritating product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it on my face</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and all the CeraVe products!!</li>
            <li>I love this facial cleanser!</li>
            <li>As the user you have to make aure you have a consistent routine in place for noticable differences to be made.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>He said it was OK, but perfers a different brand...</li>
            <li>and i am still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>For the first week</li>
            <li>LOVE this facial soap!!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use cetaphil with my clarisonic face brush since it irritates my skin SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of face washes at this point...</li>
            <li>With nothing to lose I started looking for a more well-rounded solution and found CeraVe foaming facial cleanser on Amazon, and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li>so I was pretty optimistic.</li>
            <li>Never in my entire life of using cleansers have I ever had so many breakouts caused by it.</li>
            <li>After finding that my husband was using my facial cleanser, I decided I better load up on it.</li>
            <li>think I will fall in love with this facial cleanser now.</li>
            <li>so I get a rash from most regular lotions.</li>
            <li>It was ok but occasionally made my face sting.  </li>
            <li>I turned to cheaper brands like Clean&amp;Clear and Neutrogena, and they were okay, but they didn&#x27;t seem to help control the oil level in my skin and soon after stopping the creams from the dermatologist, I could see signs of my acne starting to return.</li>
            <li>Gentle yet cleansing!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever tried this brand and wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it based on mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>face first and get it foaming.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of this cleanser, and I will buy it again</li>
            <li>broke me out with the first use</li>
            <li>I have to moisturize after using, but it gets the dirt and grime off first.</li>
            <li>you really do get your money&#x27;s worth in terms of quantity.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m 24 and have been dealing with horrendous acne since the age of 15.  </li>
            <li>Really, what still has parabens anymore?!</li>
            <li>Has yet to irritate my already stellar complexion.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Accidentally purchased this product, but I like it pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different washes from St. Ives, Aveeno, Clearasil, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when I first use this, noticed a difference after a day.</li>
            <li>Most of the year I don&#x27;t even need to follow with moisturizer, though when I do, I only use CeraVe as well.</li>
            <li>This is the first cleanser I&#x27;ve used that has not irritated my rosacea at all.</li>
            <li>I love CeraVe&#x27;s Foaming Facial Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently now for almost a year</li>
            <li>I will definitely finish the bottle I have and would consider buying more, as well.</li>
            <li>I would advise interested buyers research the ingredient list thoroughly before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>It will last me atleast a couple months or maybe more.</li>
            <li>Much better price than in my regular drugstore.</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash!</li>
            <li>I am 30 and dealing with acne for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>I MISTAKENLY ATE MACARONI AND CHEESE AND SURE ENOUGH ACNE.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>This cleanser does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I also like the pump so that the amount is always consistent.</li>
            <li>I purchased both the Foaming Facial Cleanser and the Hydrating Cleanser and absolutely love both of them.</li>
            <li>If CeraVe ever stops making this cleanser, I&#x27;ll be the first in line to buy a hundred bottles</li>
            <li>The quantity is pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>ingredients is facial cleanser &amp;#34; and found an article listing many of the ingredients found in this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love this CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I been trying out different cleansers for many years.</li>
            <li>i definitely would recommend it to a friend and believe that this product deserves more credit than it gets.</li>
            <li>I first tried it when I bought a bottle of it from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s readily available (at least for most of the people reading this review), and you can find it almost anywhere you go.  </li>
            <li>I use a Clarisonic orbital facial scrubber (which I bought after trying out my girlfriend&#x27;s...and absolutely love it).  </li>
            <li>It washes my makeup off pretty well, too.</li>
            <li>I have used only the moisturizer and love it.</li>
            <li>even and healthy is the only way I can describe it.</li>
            <li>Not heavy and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I first use an oil cleanser and then this after.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li>I am 25 and have combination skin with pretty severe hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>So gentle!</li>
            <li>This is a gentle cleanser that leaves my face feeling fresh all day without increasing oil production.</li>
            <li>I love cerave products and tried this one, when my regular CeraVe</li>
            <li>so hopefully my opinion on it won&#x27;t change to negative, but it&#x27;s a great cleanser.</li>
            <li>Changed the texture of my face skin to be more like that of my inner arm.</li>
            <li>Soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Definitely the most moisturizing cleanser ever.</li>
            <li>My husband and i love this facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li>The eczema is mostly gone now as it was hormonal related, but I am continuing to use this face wash from now on.</li>
            <li>Love it as it contains simple ingredient</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser and use it daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to being able to remove my makeup by just washing with my facial cleanser, and this will not do the job.</li>
            <li>First off, it doesn&#x27;t foam</li>
            <li>I break out from everything except this stuff even cleansers and beauty products that claim to be for sensitive skin and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I tried CeraVe first with the Cetaphil</li>
            <li>I like to think i gave it fair trial of a few weeks with no imrovement.</li>
            <li>After you wash your skin with this it leaves It very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>when I clean my face, it makes my face very soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;love it.</li>
            <li>The cleanser made my face very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This face wash is so much better than any of the other neutrogena or clean and</li>
            <li>and I must say, I have much experience with engaging new pump mechanisms ( sarcasm).</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, especially for eczema fare ups.</li>
            <li>Good for my dry sensitive face.</li>
            <li>And I mean it when I say great.</li>
            <li>This face wash is really great, it works as well and feels as high quality as much more expensive products, like those from Clinique.</li>
            <li>Well this did nothing good for my skin, it gave my skin a tight feeling, which I cant stand!</li>
            <li>It also feels soft and fresh!</li>
            <li>Guess I will stick to my clean and clear and Indian Healing Clay masks</li>
            <li>I like the foaming cleanser, it&#x27;s clean and clear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my skin looks clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Clean &amp; Clear and Clearasil products</li>
            <li>It has the most subtle clean smell--about as close to scent free as you can get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything (proactive, clean and clear, ect.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Clean &amp; Clear and Clearasil products</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and skin, and CeraVe got my face clean without irritation.</li>
            <li>Instead my face feels clean and my adult acne has almost cleared up.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Foamy, odorless, rinses clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Finally something that I love as much as my faithful Origins Checks and Balances.</li>
            <li>This formula is better for combination and oily skin, gentle enough to cleanse twice a day.</li>
            <li>CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser actually feels like you are doing something good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleansers even the pricey ones and this has worked very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I belong to the baby boomers era and was trying to find a good facial cleanser that will work well for me, and I found this Cerave Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li>Takes several rinses to totally get it off, but that seems like a good thing in my view.</li>
            <li>I am 35, with no lines or wrinkles, fair skin and occasional hormone related acne on my chin</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say that all of the products I use will work for everyone, but I think CeraVe is gentle enough that it will work for most people.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, refreshing face wash that removes oil but does not leave my skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really well, cleanses well but leaves my skin moisturized, and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>When the new foaming cleanser became available, which is for normal to oily skin, I ordered it immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came on time and everything but wasn&#x27;t right for my skin, it made me break out with huge red blothces of acne</li>
            <li>and my skin feels clean yet not tight.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d heard much positive information about the brand.</li>
            <li>I like CeraVe products a lot, so I agree with the majority of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t over dry which even if you have oily skin like me, is very important.  </li>
            <li>This is first time I am using this product, and I want to share how much I was amazed by this.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is extremely gentle, has no odor, and removes makeup and oil VERY well!</li>
            <li>I ordered this mostly because I was curious about this line of products being available for so many years, with an apparent ardent following.  </li>
            <li>I use this in combination with the CeraVe PM moisturizer and my acne is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember this causing any issues in the first two weeks, but even if a product does, you should really try to hold out.</li>
            <li>one pro is that it does seem pretty gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve used CeraVe, and my face is becoming clear!!!&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>The price is pretty reasonable too.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Proactiv for the last few years, and found that it had been the most effective of acne cleansers I had tried.</li>
            <li>Usually I have problem with cleansers but this one is really good for my skin.</li>
            <li>By the way, works as good if not better than any makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle, slightly foaming cleanser that is good for my slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser for about 6 months, it works well, my skin looks fresh and clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>I had been using neutrogena fresh foaming cleanser because it actually left my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>very moisturized and clean with out stripping the natural oils my face needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh at all and leaves my skin feeling very clean and not tight feeling at all.</li>
            <li>Love it, will definitely buy more and try out the other products as well.</li>
            <li>but it does the job and during the winter it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin more than it already is.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin:-)</li>
            <li>I have combination skin (usually more oily than dry)</li>
            <li>Most of the face cleansers that I have tried have either caused my skin to either get extremely dry</li>
            <li>I just use it once daily because my face gets irritated really easily.</li>
            <li>Love this face wash, doesn&#x27;t dry and holds moisture in.</li>
            <li>CeraVe foaming facial cleanser has been working well for me so far and my face feels clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive combination skin and</li>
            <li>My dry skin on my face is so much better</li>
            <li>At first I had trouble getting it to foam; that was my own fault.</li>
            <li>Apply a little retinol after washing and your skin will be good as new.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean, but not squeaky, and has been a major help in my battle against acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am also prone to rashes from certain products, but I have no issues with CeraVe.</li>
            <li>This one certainly does, but at a price.</li>
            <li>so it will certainly</li>
            <li>My skin is a little oily, this is the first time I bought this cleanser, it is indeed better than big, I believe, more durable</li>
            <li>After we give our faces a couple of more weeks to adjust to the new product, we are definitely going to try the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week and it has made tremendous improvements!</li>
            <li>I also left the foam on my face longer by putting on first, then brushing my teeth, and after my teeth are clean, I then rinse my face.</li>
            <li>The Hydrating Cleanser is very gentle but perhaps better used a first or second cleanser for removing makeup and sunscreen, especially if you use mineral-based products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, smooth, and has few comedogenic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I also recommend buying sulfate free shampoo, toothpaste, and body wash, because I made that switch the same time I purchased this, and it is a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it to me when I was battling with acne a few years back, and it&#x27;s just a great wash....</li>
            <li>As gentle as cetaphil but really cleans.</li>
            <li>This works with no frou-frou fragrance, and if you shave, you need a gentle cleanser to offset irritation.</li>
            <li>Didnt really feel any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Cleans really well without drying out your face.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped.  </li>
            <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li>Secondly, it&#x27;s fragrance free and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Last but not least it&#x27;s extremely gentle and suitable for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt say this clears up acne, it really does cleanse ur face very well, if you have acne it will not get rid of it, however if you dont have acne at all</li>
            <li>However I do like that it is gentle and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t add too much moisture either.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>And neither takes make up off very well.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>this cleanser is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Its gentle, cleans well, and helps with my rosacea.</li>
            <li>so much I would give it 10 stars if I could.  </li>
            <li>While I was very exited to try this product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t do that very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was really amazed....</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe this result but it really happened so I am here to share the story!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve always had issues with very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but washes off all my make up.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin gently and thoroughly, without drying it out and without leaving any soap residue.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it for my very oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Very drying for my skin</li>
            <li>Gentle and does not irritate his face.</li>
            <li>something gentle but effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t really feel that it does anything</li>
            <li>and I have really noticed an improvement the the evenness in color and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;amazon was very helpful with the return process however.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and its extremely gentle on my skin and leave me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the creamier options, this product feels like it really cleans.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my combination skin</li>
            <li>Gentle on the face and leaves it well moisturized too...</li>
            <li>It is gentle.  </li>
            <li>This product really cleans and hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li>but my experience with it has been very positive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought there was no way since all I&#x27;ve used before were much &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; grade products with much harsher chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend that you give it a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been washing twice per day (morning and night) and have noticed a drastic reduction in spotty patches of light acne especially on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It gently foams and removes all my makeup - even</li>
            <li>I found this very drying.  </li>
            <li>I’ve tried a lot of cleansers, but most either don’t clean my skin enough, or leave it feeling stripped and dry.</li>
            <li>Contrary to the name, I don’t know that it really “foams,” but it does bubble up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I used to use Cetaphil face wash, but it never felt like it was doing much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unusual for me to break out so much like that</li>
            <li>This wash cleans gently and makes your face feel smoother.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I use Acanya for acne treatment which is very drying on the skin.</li>
            <li>fact that is foams makes it much lighter on your skin than Cetaphil which feels slimy on the skin.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>Whole family uses these products and dermatologist recommended it as well</li>
            <li>Then, I gently rub it all over my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for ALL skin types!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>/r/skincareaddiction in Reddit recommended this paired with Stridex ex-foliating pads, and as someone who has had moderate to light acne ever since puberty (now 21)</li>
            <li>this really works.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really drying my face out</li>
            <li>However, I want to point out one important thing to consumers who might scan only the rating summary before making a purchase: The summary appears to be an aggregate of reviews for ALL CeraVe products in ALL sizes, including pump, tube, and jar.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Does not foam very well on skin</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really foam.</li>
            <li>I dont feel like this helps that much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used my clarisonic in months because this products cleanses very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My rough skin has gotten rougher and more itchy-</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up but works really well.</li>
            <li>really* started to don on me....</li>
            <li>Feels very concentrated</li>
            <li>My skin feels really hydrated after using the Hydrating Cleanser,so the name really is not false marketing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very upset that I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean but not dry</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>and I heard that the whole &amp;#34;Kill it with Kindness&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anybody who has dealt with acne, it can really make a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic facial cleanser</li>
            <li>I like it, lives your skin clean feeling but not dry even if you have oily skin</li>
            <li>it is gentle and cleans well.</li>
            <li>It foams up very well, and makes you feel very refreshed and cleaned afterwards.</li>
            <li>You get a much cleaner finish, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because it&#x27;s not quite as gentle as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t foam much, but works for me</li>
            <li>and you don’t have to use much.</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle and works well.  </li>
            <li>The seller shipped this to me lightning fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quiet sure why its different than others but its worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Not too much of a smell, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>This cleaner is farther gentle.</li>
            <li>With Purpose it&#x27;s thicker and more rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the face and makes skin look and feel refreshed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this seems to work for me very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all!</li>
            <li>It cleans oil very well.  </li>
            <li>I filled by prior CeraVe empty bottle with EVOO:)</li>
            <li>anyway, it cuts through the evoo makeup remover very well and rest of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was also a bit turned off by the fact that it doesn&#x27;t suds very well.  </li>
            <li>Also its very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, like honey.  </li>
            <li>This stuff didn&#x27;t really work for me..</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference the moment I put it on my face.</li>
            <li>I use Acanya for spot treatment, which works absolute wonders...</li>
            <li>One thing I have to say is: there are two different kind of Facial Cleaners for CeraVe</li>
            <li>It foams up nicely and does not have any fragrance, which I like since fragrance can be too harsh on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has been sensitive and have been switching through many different brand name products.  </li>
            <li>I waited a while before I wrote a review, so I at least used it for a good time.</li>
            <li>so when I used this for the first time, I saw the skin that was pretty dead from the acne start to come off which revealed nice soft skin</li>
            <li>moisturizer/heavy night moisturizer has made my skin clear, and more even toned than it&#x27;s ever been, which is saying something for someone with chronic red face syndrome and hormonal acne issues.</li>
            <li>On top of that it removes my make-up completely which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash, it helps make my skin very smooth along with the other products that I use.</li>
            <li>, there is no oily kind of residue, the skin is tight, clean and yet moist enough after you wash it off.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but gets is clean!</li>
            <li>I adore the feel of it, like soft syrup!!!  </li>
            <li>y/o skin that has a tendency to be oily has experience no breakouts and my skin doesn&#x27;t have them same dried out feeling that I experienced with so many other products.</li>
            <li>Very useful in the summer when the heat made my skin extra oily.</li>
            <li>listed ingredients are much better than the one for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am 99% sure I ordered for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the sample pretty quick, because it was only .5ML.</li>
            <li>I do not have large breakouts on my face, but will breakout regularly if I do not use some product to clean my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in how clear my skin is!</li>
            <li>loved it at first, but now seems to be drying out my skin a little much, so went back to Olay product!</li>
            <li>A great gentle cleanser, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>CeraVe is a step in the right direction, but ultimately wasn&#x27;t the right cleanser for me and just seemed like a cheaper version of Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t completely credit this product with solving my acne issues, but it does leave your skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the dry and tight feelings, this cleanser would be perfect because it cleans my face well and has helped immensely in diminishing my acne.</li>
            <li>They were on my face for 4 days, I used many medicines and other cleansers to get rid off them</li>
            <li>and he has recommended phytoceramides and the like as an alternative to other products that are supposed to make you look more &#x27;youthful&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I can not stress enough how important it is that if you want to get the full potential of this product you HAVE TO WASH YOUR FACE TWICE A DAY.</li>
            <li>and I can save my money for other products (moisturizer, retinol, etc). :)</li>
            <li>I especially got excited b/c</li>
            <li>lasts a long time (been going on a few months now) and is a perfect cleaner without having extra acne-fighting drying ingredients or anything.</li>
            <li>I certainly wish i had known about this during high school.....</li>
            <li>it takes longer for me to get oily on my face again, to compare with Clean n Clear Burst in the morning, or any of clean n clear products for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used special cleansers before because I never needed to, but with this flare up, I knew I needed to find something that was extra gentle.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning my face without making my skin feel tight and dry -</li>
            <li>and I definitely feel clean post use.</li>
            <li>I use it as part of my daily routine and it leaves my skin feeling clean AND hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially I found that it may not work too well for oil skin, but it turned out pretty fine by using a bit more than usual conditions for oil skin.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to clean your entire face.</li>
            <li>I found this cleanser very gentle going on, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling tight or dry afterwards, but smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes with this product because of all the rave reviews on how gentle and non-irritating it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I have finally found the right cleanser for me!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most face washes dry it out and cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap for how long the product lasts.</li>
            <li>This face wash has helped reduce redness that comes from dryer winter conditions, but it&#x27;s definitely suitable for year round use.  </li>
            <li>I usually use the creamy CeraVe cleanser, but the foam is nice.</li>
            <li>CeraVe foams up and makes my skin feel fresh and clean unlike other mild cleansers that simply sit on your skin.  </li>
            <li>pretty much the exact same)</li>
            <li>I have bought loads of money worth of the \\&quot;best\\&quot; Japanese (very revered) skin care products out there and nothing has done my skin as much wonders as cerave.</li>
            <li>It is not to light, nor to heavy, and the foaming action helps me see that I am getting my whole face clean.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Excited to have this in my new daily regimen!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days of using it already my face began to feel somehow more healthy, balanced and clear, without being overly dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this cleanser - very similar to Clinique&#x27;s facial foaming cleansers but a lot less money for a lot more product.  </li>
            <li>It seemed odd that &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; my skin could fix a problem that doctors had been insisting required moisturizing, but after years of being able to pick up microfiber cleaning rags with the side of my arms, I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that what we all want, less Oily Skin :)</li>
            <li>My favorite previously was neutrogena</li>
            <li>Decent sized bottle.  </li>
            <li>It has made a tremendous difference and actually removes makeup too.</li>
            <li>The product top was left open and spilled into the bag.</li>
            <li>I only got this facial cleanser because I heard so many things about it from skincare addicts.</li>
            <li>(super gross I know!).</li>
            <li>If you want a very basic cleanser that removes most oil from your skin, this may do it for you, but I feel like my skin starts to feel oily again shortly after using it.  </li>
            <li>I tried cotton ball cleanser after many different facewash and they always left some sort of remaining.</li>
            <li>and *only* use a light application of concealer with a clear mineral powder for my makeup routine.</li>
            <li>It definately doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin (which I was worried about because it&#x27;s for normal/oily skin), has a nice thick consistency (easily spreads..</li>
            <li>Would recommend if you experience mild blemishes and simply want a cleanser you can rely on.</li>
            <li>this is a cult classic.</li>
            <li>It has really helped to clear my skin!</li>
            <li>Seems to remove makeup better and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The price may seem steep, but the bottle is actually fairly large, and a single pump is more than enough to use each wash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend this and their lotion as well.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist highly recommended it and uses it herself.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product for combination skin users.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for those in their older years and strong enough for those coming of age.</li>
            <li>and I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>If your skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be agreeing with your cleanser, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also highly recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend,</li>
            <li>I took a chance because of the high rating.</li>
            <li>I noticed a positive change in the appearance of my skin after first starting CeraVe.</li>
            <li>but this so far seems to be better than the other things i tried.</li>
            <li>I am using my 3rd bottle and thrilled to have found it after reading other people&#x27;s reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin ( Mine is very sensitive and this hasn&#x27;t been irritating my skin at all)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s been fighting acne/breakouts/bad complexions for many years and using acne products in an attempt to treat it with no luck-- take a moment and consider if, possibly, you actually have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has been visibly more clear CONSISTENTLY than it ever was before with various other acne face washes... and the only significant variable was the change in face wash to CeraVe</li>
            <li>I wish it would lather up a little better, but I can deal with that.</li>
            <li>The hydrating version is a little bit better but not when combined with benzoyl peroxide- burns.</li>
            <li>For the price of the cleansing solution, it does the job done and leave your facial clear and clean.</li>
            <li>PLUS it barely takes any of this stuff to clean your whole face, so the bottle will probably last a year, so...</li>
            <li>It dried my face out, created more whiteheads than I&#x27;ve had in years since high school, and started to create milia-like bumps under my nose that were never there until I tried this</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most facial washes will make me breakout in rash or will dry my skin out so much that i peel.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel clean without stripping the oils and making your skin feel dry.</li>
            <li>It is a thorough cleanser,but gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin at age 28</li>
            <li>I have very oily and somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This brand is frequently recommended by dermatologists for gentle skin care.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and this leaves my skin clean without feeling so dry.</li>
            <li>His skin is clear and he continues to use the product which is gentle on his skin and restores the PH.</li>
            <li>Works really well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much my skin responded to this product within one use.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt clear acne very well, but it doesnt leave skin oily after wash.</li>
            <li>What i like about this product is its gentle nature towards sensitive skin or skin that is undergoing tropical treatments.</li>
            <li>and it really felt as though that cleanser wasn&#x27;t doing anything--it was far too watery.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle enough but also cleans leaving my skin soft and fresh in combination with a couple times a week exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gentle, and I am surprised that a dermatologist even recommended it.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel too dry afterwards, yet looks and feels perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>This product, however, was more harsh on my skin than the medicated acne wash.</li>
            <li>I did not notice this before but this cleanser is designed for normal to oily skin; whereas the creamy CeraVe is for dryer skin.</li>
            <li>and I have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>I guess it works if you have normal skin, but if you have oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Im a male in my early 20s, over the years i have tried many different face washes.</li>
            <li>I worked in fast food for several years- KFC/A&amp;W to be exact- a place with LOTS of grease in the air.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in error since it is for normal or oily skin</li>
            <li>For normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>I started using the oily skin formula, but it has balanced me out so well that I have moved to the normal skin version.  </li>
            <li>Wish I would have realized though that it is for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>Better than all the hundred if not thousands of dollars I&#x27;ve wasted on fancy brands.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea that is mainly under control, but recently was having problems with breakouts that even the prescriptions from the dermatologist weren&#x27;t completely taking care of.</li>
            <li>The Cleanser is good, but the package was broken when arrived.</li>
            <li>Foaming Facial Cleanser is very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like so many other face washes out there.</li>
            <li>Although I used more mild medicated cleaner, my face still felt slightly irritated and often too dry right after washing, accompanied with patches of red spots that lasted a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>I read lots about how these chemicals can actually dry out the skin leading to more breakouts in the future.</li>
            <li>TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]]  is the same product as step 2 but instead of using it as a wash, you apply it to your damp face and let it dry for 15 minutes before using water to wash it</li>
            <li>TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]]  is the same product as step 2 but instead of using it as a wash, you apply it to your damp face and let it dry for 15 minutes before using water to wash it</li>
            <li>I really like this product, and I am a guy that has really sensitive skin, and I gotta be careful which Items I pick to clean my face with, this item is really gentle on the face, does not have any &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation, and leaves your face feeling soft each time.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft &amp; smooth &amp; my skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries my face out just a little, but not enough that I use a moisturizer, because my face is very oily to begin with, and like I said it gets irritated very easily.</li>
            <li>CeraVe has been compared to other gentle cleaners such as Cetaphil and has proven over time to be a top choice.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which was good, but it didn&#x27;t really stand out from other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Most of them are okay, but due to my sensitive skin I constantly break out using other cleansers.</li>
            <li>My skin had some very large bumps within 6 hours and it has taken a week for them to finally go away.  </li>
            <li>you’re feeling a little hesitant to buy, CeraVe does send out free samples from time to time, and I would absolutely recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll even admit to lightly sanding my arms to try and remove the sharp, bumpy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a little over 2 months now, and my arms are still not as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but they&#x27;re so very improved from before.</li>
            <li>A little bit (a dime-sized squirt) will foam up nicely in your hands with a tiny bit of water.</li>
            <li>but my advice is to use lotion right after using it because it dries your face out but other than that it really works!</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to.</li>
            <li>It may be because my skin has gotten uses to the new meds</li>
            <li>even like the new turquoise packaging.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and psoriasis; so, trying new skin care products is always a risk.</li>
            <li>Remember, when using a new product, it takes two weeks for your face to adjust.</li>
            <li>new packaging on the bottle allows you to lock the pump, which is convenient if you are traveling and don&#x27;t want to spill the cleanser everywhere.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>Like any product, do a quick research will help you go a long way!</li>
            <li>Our allergergist recommended this particular brand and so far they work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, lathers amazingly, and isn&#x27;t irritating whatsoever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps remove blackheads and prevent future breakouts, but you do need to make sure you wet your hands/</li>
            <li>Once i was able to start back using it but was careful to not touch my eyebrows</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money BY FAR.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a dime size on my orbital machine and foams up very nicely...cleanses very well, leaving no lingering residue and does it without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of this stuff to clean your entire face so this big bottle lasts far longer than it looks like it would.</li>
            <li>I promise to be more careful next time.</li>
            <li>love this product, great facial cleaner only need a very small pea size drop at a time this product will last a long time.</li>
            <li>One full pump is too much, I recommend not pushing it all the way down.  </li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive and this causes zero irritation.</li>
            <li>Very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended for anyone with eczema or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and everything I&#x27;ve ever tried gives me break outs.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for people who has oily face, troubling with acnes and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I found this product in an article written and recommended by a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am very old, I need a moisturizer,</li>
            <li>Leave your face very soft and with a moisturizing layer.</li>
            <li>well personally i would tell you to look else where, these didn&#x27;t have very much of an effect on me.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin, and it&#x27;s always a struggle to find a cleanser that cleans well without aggravating my skin.</li>
            <li>Very gentle facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling clean but not tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>Tretinoin has made my skin very sensitive and at first it was really red and peeling.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that the product is clear in color and has no perfumes or dyes!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I use this product twice a day with a warm, wet washcloth and the Cerave moisturizing cream (in the pot) afterward and my skin is doing extremely well with fewer breakouts and blemishes.</li>
            <li>I still have occasional breakouts, but my face is SO much clearer now!</li>
            <li>The standard benzoyl peroxide and salycilic acid treatments tend to stop working before you even finish the first tube</li>
            <li>Like many other generic (cheaper) alternatives sold on the market, this product contains Propylparaben and Methylparaben.</li>
            <li>many facial products only seem to further irritate it.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, has a more even color, and I&#x27;m not seeing any redness in the areas I usually do.</li>
            <li>A week later I noticed that when I pulled my lingerie out of the dryer I didn&#x27;t feel the familiar snag sensation when my arms brushed across the nylon.</li>
            <li>overall problem is I don&#x27;t see it doing any better than a bargain brand or any other brand would do.</li>
            <li>I tried finding a cap that would fit the opening of the bottle but had no success.  </li>
            <li>CeraVe has NO FOAMING ACTION at all!  </li>
            <li>It lathers up pretty well with a bit of foam, especially when I use in conjunction with my Shiseido cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>I first started using this because my lips were constantly chapped and drying out to the point where there were cuts on the corners of them.</li>
            <li>Plus it works better than higher priced facial cleansers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>good first few days broke out with small spots</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t miraculously cure my acne or change my life, but it&#x27;s a pretty solid product.</li>
            <li>Ever since that first use, this has been an Amazon regular item for me.</li>
            <li>many facial products only seem to further irritate it.</li>
            <li>Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate is the fourth ingredient on the list and is also a synthetic surfactant, but considered to be an allergenic at higher concentrations.  </li>
            <li>but this is the only one I consistently repurchase.</li>
            <li>My skin is absolutely clearer, my wife and I now use this product as our main facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It foams up really nice (but not too crazy) and leaves my skin feeling really clean.  </li>
            <li>I have acne, cystic acne, and most of the time oily skin, but some times it gets dry, with dry patches.</li>
            <li>It does the job without being strong enough to dry out my face.</li>
            <li>Works better than the more expensive facial cleansers and leaves your skin soft and toned.</li>
            <li>Clear but rich, you will only need a dab mixed with water for your face,  </li>
            <li>It also smells amazing, leaving a faint clean shaven smell similar to aftershave.</li>
            <li>Like there isn&#x27;t an exciting thing in this bottle, but my Mom is convinced she has patchy dry skin</li>
            <li>Its gentle on your skin and will not dry it.</li>
            <li>is gentle and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is usually pretty sensitive to facial washes, so I was nervous about this one.</li>
            <li>I like foaming cleansers that feel like they are really cleaning but have found that many leave my skin way too dry and tight.  </li>
            <li>This has been keeping my skin soft and clear!</li>
            <li>Although the back of the product says wash morning and night, I use it more than twice a day, especially after getting home from a long day and when my face feels grimy and oily.</li>
            <li>I am extremely dissatisfied and hope to receive a full refund for the problems that it caused.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did because my skin has totally balanced itself out now and is breaking out much less.</li>
            <li>It is really gentle on your skin and doesnt dry it out too much.</li>
            <li>This thing lasts for a long time and very cheap compared to all the other products.&lt;br /&gt;Enough about the value, this thing actually works very well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and certain cleansers turn my face red.</li>
            <li>: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydrosultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG 150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and), PEG 6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the large list of ingredients in the cleanser, only one stuck out as a natural ingredient: water.</li>
            <li>Finally, I&#x27;m writing this review with the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had since I was a little girl (yes, even better than Proactiv when it was working for me!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One is super hydrating and the other is mildy hydrating.</li>
            <li>I have used other products from Cera Ve super products.</li>
            <li>I have combination/oily and other cleansers either dry out my skin or make my skin even more oily.</li>
            <li>CeraVe products have helped clear up my skin, making it softer</li>
            <li>My face is clear.</li>
            <li>Also using this cleanser with a serum will clear darkspots and make your skin glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using clearasil and clean care for years, both dry up my skin and don&#x27;t actually work all that well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s cleaning your face because it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>I bought this CeraVe facial cleanser together with the day and night moisturisers for my 27 year old daughter as a gift, and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>She has now been using it for a few months and cannot believe how clear and smooth her skin is.  </li>
            <li>I will say that for the price I was expecting it to also clear breakouts.</li>
            <li>( For me it doesn&#x27;t help clear them up.)</li>
            <li>Used with the moisturizing lotion from the same brand, my skin feels really supple, soft, and toned.</li>
            <li>After using this for a couple weeks my skin is almost completely clear.</li>
            <li>use CeraVe Foaming, CeraVe Moisturizing, Stridex(red box), and Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion SPF</li>
            <li>Is clear in texture.</li>
            <li>I have roseacea and this product has balanced it and made my skin clear.</li>
            <li>i suffered from acne and nothing worked to really clear it up...</li>
            <li>clear face washes I have used.</li>
            <li>B002MSN3QQ EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 sunscreen]].</li>
            <li>The combination of Differin and CeraVe has kept my face extremely clear.</li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive skin with the occasional rosacea breakout, and CeraVe has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Has a slight &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; smell to it; however, it removes dirt and oil leaving the face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This product however seemed to really clear my skin</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night (before sleep)&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser(2% Salicylic Acid) - Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I think it is meant for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Would recommend for sensitive and/ or aging skin.</li>
            <li>If you have oily or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin, and the CeraVe brand was recommended by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, somewhat acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>my dermatologist recommended this product for my adult acne</li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>This is such a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>This product has been working well for my eleven year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>so far did not cause break out or irritation.</li>
            <li>My face is naturally oily</li>
            <li>When I started treating my skin as &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and using this my face completely cleared up except for chin which I still get hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li>I really think it is supplying my skin with vitamins and essential nutrients.</li>
            <li>im terribly sensitive with combination skin</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Ordered these for my sister who sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Unusual especially for a transparent liquid.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on their skin so as to not irritate teen skin.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t really foam.</li>
            <li>I have insanely sensitive skin and this cleanser does not irritate it.</li>
            <li>Gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all</li>
            <li>it is not harsh and I believe it has balance my skin because I no longer have frequent blemish break outs.  </li>
            <li>My skin is also fairly sensitive Anne</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>I was using the CeraVe Moisturizing Facial Cleanser for a bit, but when I switched over to this, I found that my face was much clearer after a week or so.</li>
            <li>I was suffering from sever acne, and it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>It was not harsh on my skin yet cleansed as it</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and have been using this product from last summer when my dermatologist recommended this after a heat acne outbreak.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well and has cleared my facial and body breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely remove all my eye makeup</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend it for someone with acne or oily skin who needs a thorough but gently cleanser.</li>
            <li>Please note that much of the hyaluronic acid currently used in the cosmetics industry is a byproduct of poultry processing, although it can also be expressed in bacteria.</li>
            <li>and I recommend this for those who have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to break the bank.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so gentle and actually make your skin refreshed after washing without that tight/stiff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on Amazon, I got this CeraVe cleanser and moisturing cream for my mom who was having some type of skin poisoning after using old creams and makeup on her face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if I just have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised no one has talked about the flushing, itching or anything like that.</li>
            <li>My acne has cleared; and my face is soft as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with a gentle facial pore brush before I go to bed</li>
            <li>I noticed a marked improvement in my skin texture and a reduction of breakouts.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As an adult, it is embarrassing to have to deal with acne like a teenager.  </li>
            <li>If you find this too drying, try the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>not everyday like I will the hydrating cleanser.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re a person who has sensitive, oily, or problematic skin, try this.  </li>
            <li>This so far has.</li>
            <li>Having used this product for nearly 2 years I can honesty</li>
            <li>I like this facial soap so much i subscribed to it.  </li>
            <li>I recently started using Retin A and needed a gentle yet thorough cleanser that was not going to over strip my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle around eyes and never stings, even with an exfoliating puff or spinning facial brush.</li>
            <li>I recently found another cleanser that looks promising</li>
            <li>I have been using it for just about 3 weeks and my skin is completely clear, and so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks now &amp; have been having 1 or 2 big pimples the whole time.</li>
            <li>I have oily sensitive acne prone skin and everything irritates it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cleanser 3 times, and they&#x27;re almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I also have combination (dry/oily) skin and</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that will break out at the drop of a hat.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and combination skin and a bit of rosacea....</li>
            <li>I washed my entire face with it including my eyes because that would prove if it is truly gentle...</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My acne has been very stubborn for years but ever since I stopped using soapy washes and cleansed only with water</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser eliminates dirt, grime, sweat, and oil much better than Cetaphil (in my opinion) and although it can be a  bit harsh for those cold, windy, winter months, it&#x27;s still a great staple cleanser and one that I will continue buying.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleaner and plan on purchasing it again in the future.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter, and she said that it makes her face painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive oily skin.</li>
            <li>It is a complete cleaner.</li>
            <li>I use this in the evening after using [[ASIN:B0019LVFSU Almond Oil]] and a soft washcloth to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>my skin is much clearer this summer than last.</li>
            <li>as no matter how much I try to lather any amount of product, I can NOT work up enough to justify calling it &amp;#34;foam.&amp;#34; I had to remove a star because since I&#x27;ve been using this, I have found it dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>The connector can be turned back to the sealed position after use, and this design really surprise me a lot</li>
            <li>(the gentle cleanser...tried the daily</li>
            <li>So far so</li>
            <li>I bought this after some Internet research on sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this isn&#x27;t abrasive.</li>
            <li>Now I use hemp oil as a natural cleanser, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its been 2 weeks and soo far no severe acne.</li>
            <li>Completely transformed the appearance and texture of my 35 year old skin.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin that reacts negatively to probably everything.</li>
            <li>; approach worked better than carpet-bombing your skin with various harsh products.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that this had a green top instead of a white one.</li>
            <li>I tried antibiotics (helped, but I don&#x27;t feel right taking antibiotics for non-dangerous diseases/conditions), various OTC face liquids/creams/pads (never really worked and dried the hell out of my face), and this product works better than all of them.</li>
            <li>One full pump is too much product for one face wash, so I only do a half pump to get the product out.</li>
            <li>After a year of this method, it&#x27;s definitely the right option for me, but everyone&#x27;s face is different</li>
            <li>After a year of this method, it&#x27;s definitely the right option for me, but everyone&#x27;s face is different</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fair to give less stars</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after using this, but clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky clean and never feels tight.</li>
            <li>Feels better than some other more expensive luxury brands that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I am 35 and have pimples and wrinkles this was the first product I&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t dry me out or break me out</li>
            <li>I have an oily T-zone but the rest of my skin would be considered pretty &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (not too dry and not too oily).</li>
            <li>I noticed my face was pretty dry after my showers and even had some peeling spots.</li>
            <li>: I tried using it for a month, but it would consistently cause my face to slowly dry out.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the full line of Cerave Products but lotions instead of creams (less chance of contamination)</li>
            <li>It the ingredients acid and niacin made my face super flush like beer red, dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>I have been searching everywhere (Sephora, Ulta) for a nice high end cleanser and was skeptical about getting this after using my Murad cleanser.</li>
            <li>So many other cleansers that I have tried for normal to oily skin always make my face feel so tight after I wash.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out and keeps my face feelig clean, but not over dried.</li>
            <li>This is the first facial cleanser that i&#x27;ve used thats actually made a difference.</li>
            <li>This is the first facial cleanser that i&#x27;ve used thats actually made a difference.</li>
            <li>No more (mild) acne!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle, so it lasts me a fairly long time.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is large and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Having extremely oily skin, I  need something that is actually going to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Overall highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This one is a little more drying (because it&#x27;s designed for oily skin), so I only use it occasionally.  </li>
            <li>Again there are many products that say they work well with eczema, but CeraVe foaming facial cleancer with ceramides,niacinamide and hyaluronic acid does unbelievable cleansing while conditioning the skin like no other product I know on the market.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this because it was foam, and foam generally tended to dry up my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and haven&#x27;t really noticed much reduction in my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser foams nicely, is unscented and does not leave my skin dry and tight!  </li>
            <li>This cleanser successfully removes dirt, grease, and grime, but it doesn&#x27;t leave skin as dry as other face washes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Wetting the face with warm water, I apply a small amount of the cleanser with my hand and rub gently with small circular motion.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>so I will try to normal skin version next.</li>
            <li>Many people give this product a very favorable review base primarily on its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick, you really only need one pump to wash your entire face.</li>
            <li>So many other gentle cleaners are gentle but still leave makeup behind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a mild acne problem and have been prone to a little razor burn as well.  </li>
            <li>Love this, its plain and simple - foaming facial cleanser without any additions.</li>
            <li>I have really mild acne, with relatively small breakouts on my forehead and chin area most commonly.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more is that the article stated that you cannot absorb methylparabens into your body past the first layer of skin (the stratum corneum), unless your skin is broken or you have some sort of skin irritation that has opened the first layer of skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other cleansers such as Cetaphil which is another mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thinner texture than other clear facial foaming cleansers I have used, and definitely does not foam as much or clean as thoroughly.</li>
            <li>but I do live in a moderate humid zone, Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>so I was back on the hunt to find new products.  </li>
            <li>I bought a NEW CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleaser from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Foams very well, lasts very long, cleans VERY well and does not leave skin dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>I no longer have dry patches and my skin feels very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>and this is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li>this cleans my skin so will that I don&#x27;t have black heads, before I would have to exfoliate once a week, but since my skin is clean i only have to do it once in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, but it cleans very well</li>
            <li>it gets the makeup off and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin too much.</li>
            <li>I have tried hundreds of different brands, including the very pricey ones, but have never had the same results.</li>
            <li>Overall I really this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am a 26 year old female with the acne of a 16 year old.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves your skin soft and not dry or oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CeraVe produces only a few skin care products, but I&#x27;ve found that they&#x27;re all well formulated, fragrance free and affordable.  </li>
            <li>I have quite oily skin with light acne and this has dried up all of the regular acne and keeps me reaching for the moisturizer because it washes off the oil so well!</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, but I need a thorough PM cleanser in order to completely remove my physical sunblock.</li>
            <li>the cream is soft and clear, the price is low.</li>
            <li>this may be dermatologist recommended but because its for those very sensitive facial skin people.</li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle...perfect for daily use</li>
            <li>No other facial wash leaves my skin feeling this soft!</li>
            <li>First of all, since there are currently multiple products listed on the product page, I&#x27;d like to note that this review is for the foaming facial cleanser, which I have now been using for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it&#x27;s drying out my skin, which is weird because I don&#x27;t believe there are any traditional &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
            <li>No other comment.</li>
            <li>Not really sure how clean the product gets my face.  </li>
            <li>I did read the reviews on this after trying so many other products that wasted my money.  </li>
            <li>i was told by other people that i should&#x27;ve gone for the milder version of this stuff, but a product labeled with &#x27;normal&#x27; should work for normal skin.</li>
            <li>And there is nothing I hate more than buying a product arbitrarily off the shelves, using it for two weeks, and breaking out more!</li>
            <li>particular cleanser leaves my face soft, minus any redness and has also cleared my pores.  </li>
            <li>The former is relatively more serious with a maximum health concern score of 10 which indicates a high overall hazard while the latter ingredient scored a 4.</li>
            <li>The current Amazon price is highly competitive with anything I&#x27;ve seen in local stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and such a big bottle of it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>While there are less expensive options, I&#x27;m willing to pay a little more for a non-irritating brand that gets my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, and recently I experienced a bad outbreak.  </li>
            <li>Pumps out a clear liquid, rub on face, becomes white and creamy but not &#x27;foaming&#x27;</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it will last for a long time; with one daily wash it took me 6 months to finish it up.</li>
            <li>gets the job done; removes makeup, deep cleans and doesn&#x27;t strip my natural moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the only things my sensitive skin can handle.</li>
            <li>All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I expected too much maybe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, especially those with sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Apparently to make it foam they have to use them as the non-foaming cleaner they make is without those chemicals.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s cleaning and my face broke out from it, so I was surprised to see Cerave facial cleanser isn&#x27;t as hypoallergenic as the soap they make.</li>
            <li>I had been using an Olay foaming cleanser for sensitive skin, but my dermatologist recommended I switch to the CeraVe Foaming Facial</li>
            <li>Zoom in to the photo of the back of the product bottle to see the complete list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far its working well with a twice daily face wash.</li>
            <li>Deep cleaning and a Soft touch after...</li>
            <li>I must not have read far enough.</li>
            <li>The pimples have stopped, the blackheads are gradually clearing, my skin is soft and supple, and the premature lines around my eyes are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li>Several days ago, I even discovered I could start completely skipping foundation all together</li>
            <li>B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]].</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of weeks, and my skin has not dried out or had problems with sudden breakouts.</li>
            <li>Switching back to my old cleanser.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after using it and there&#x27;s no trace of make up left.</li>
            <li>All my teenage and adult life I have always thought that I could never use a product that was \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; or \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; because I thought I needed to massacre the bacteria that was causing my blemishes with acids, peroxides, antibiotics, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of facial cleansers over the years, but having sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t helped me to find one that both works in clearing up acne and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Even then, the absorption rate is barely 1%.</li>
            <li>B000056I89 Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, Normal to Oily Skin]], and like Cetaphil, does not strip the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t normally go out of my way to try out a lot of different facial cleansers</li>
            <li>I wear primer and makeup every day, so I normally use St. Ives Apricot Scrub (or the Walmart generic) because it&#x27;s the only thing that makes me feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>someone with once-oily and now normal skin, I find both moisturizers to be the tiniest bit heavy in all but the driest months in the Northeast, and the Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser stung at first.</li>
            <li>Haha using a facial CLEANSER instead of scrapig off the top layers of your face and expensive self tanner every day... who knew??  </li>
            <li>I was using Neutrogena and that had been working OK for me, but then it seemed to stop, or even to make my skin worse.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well as a gentle cleanser - sometimes leaves my face a little dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very fortunate not having to worry too much about it as a kid, which makes the recent ones at 26 a little confusing.</li>
            <li>My skin, for example, handles the Foaming Facial Cleanser and Hydrating Cleanser differently, as they are completely different products--one produces a light foam, while the other is a milky lotion--and both remove makeup with different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My little kids have dry skin, and this is the first lotion that they say is not sticky!!</li>
            <li>keep purchasing this product as it is less expensive but does a great job</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough on my lumpy, dry cheeks but takes the oil off of my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li>Really worth the price and half a pump will do the trick which means it last FOREVER.</li>
            <li>Only a few showed studies of being mild or low-level toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I enjoyed the product and so far, I am not aware that propylparaben cause any negative reactions to my skin.</li>
            <li>but I tend to have normal to dry and use both without any issues.</li>
            <li>There is also a cleanser for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>While this foaming cleanser is indicated for normal to oily skin, my combination, heading toward dry skin tolerates it well without that parched feeling and no sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li>, I also ordered it because it has hyaluronic acid it in which lifts, I definitely recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin and want something to compliment a lifting cream!-)</li>
            <li>My face usually clears up quickly like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>When you washing with cold water after rinse it off with warm water, don&#x27;t wash your face like you did with warm water, I did massage with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing off, have a towel and just gently take off the wetness.</li>
            <li>In the daytime use the same instructions but use a high rated moisturizer as a 3rd and final step.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin that is very acne prone, and</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin that is very acne prone, and</li>
            <li>It really does blow all the other cleansers I have ever used away.</li>
            <li>Went back to oatmeal soap, 4 weeks later my skin is getting back to normal.</li>
            <li>This is the first cleanser i have ever used that didn&#x27;t leave my face tight or irritated afterward.</li>
            <li>What I love about this product, the cleanser is not as harsh on your skin as other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried such as brands of Neutrogena and Oxy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just clear soap that turns white once water is mixed with it.</li>
            <li>and I have had a lot of trouble finding a cleanser that helps even when it says it is gentle and for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry the face and you can feel your skin is cleaner.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out face.</li>
            <li>Not oily, not dry, or overly tingling like w/ Noxema products.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well and does not dry out my face.</li>
            <li>, sometimes lol, because I&#x27;m sooooooooo sensitive using it every day near my eyes mad me a little red</li>
            <li>If I run out and use another cleanser for a few days, my acne comes right back.</li>
            <li>The consistency is not thick and lathers well with just wet hands in the shower.</li>
            <li>gentle enough for everyday use on face, keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>The product from my experience only stopped acne other than that it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days so far, but I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tired more expensive products thinking more money equals higher quality, but that&#x27;s not true for the CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Around the first few months, I massaged the foam with my fingers onto my face as it turned into foam once you move it circular motion.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be foamy coming out of the spout... not just foamy after you rub it all over your hands or face like normal soap.</li>
            <li>is if I neglect to use it for even 1 day my skin is noticeably worse, and it takes several days to go back to looking healthy again.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is extremely dry and you don&#x27;t need the foaming action (which I do, it&#x27;s a mental thing), then I would try the hydrating formula which is also highly rated.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin feels clean with out irritation from unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have paid over twice as much for other cleansers that promised to be non-drying and non-irritating but didn&#x27;t stand up to the promises; CeraVe delivers!</li>
            <li>4 or so months later I was clear, and finally felt like I could take a step back and actually take care of my skin and not battle</li>
            <li>It has no crazy chemical additives that will clog pores or leave your skin dry or tight</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t dry out skin and keeps skin clear and moisturized</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin naturally and looking to dry out your acne keep moving this product is not for you.  </li>
            <li>, I still can feel my face skin is so soft, but not too dry, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>makes my face feel so soft and not at all dry will continue using this</li>
            <li>It might work for the oily skin people but for a dry skin it&#x27;s a complete NO.</li>
            <li>runs to dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>My complexion is much clearer and less dingy.</li>
            <li>Yeah, I realized a long time ago that my skin is extremely sensitive and not similar with everyone else.</li>
            <li>The first few uses actually left my skin sore.</li>
            <li>It definitely worth the price because a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>This cleanser fits the bill - it removes my sunblock easily without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>, it is kind of a thick liquid that when you rub you hands together it gets slick but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old, but my dry, dull, flaky skin texture made me like ten years older, complete with an adult case of severe acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I notice that after I wash and dry my face it feels tight and I need to put a moisturizer on right away.</li>
            <li>It is not a harsh facial cleanser, but not sure how much of a difference it makes.  </li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this product, it arrived a week late and was completely busted open in the package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if face washes are like toothpaste (i.e., foaming doesn&#x27;t actually DO anything), but I do like the feeling of a nice thick foam on my face.</li>
            <li>It is clear loose gel like with no scent.  </li>
            <li>and it works great at cleaning any dirt or oils (the bad oils), without leaving your face dry.</li>
            <li>are products I&#x27;ve been using to get rid of acne and repair my face from previous acne.&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser(2% Salicylic Acid) - Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control(10% Benzoyl Peroxide) - Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Skin Relief 24hr</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oily, dry, occasionally acne-ridden and sensitive to everything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It is mild, but cleanses teen skin well, at least In our&lt;br /&gt;household.</li>
            <li>Background:I have oily acne prone skin, but my eyes get easily dried out as I suffer from dermatitis around the eyes during certain times of the year.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight after or like there&#x27;s a thick layer on top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, after reading into skin care for what seemed like the millionth time, I decided- for once- to look into how to treat very pale skin, rather than acne-prone skin, because I&#x27;d recently also gotten a job where I had to work 2nd shift and rarely got to see the sun.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with a very oily nose and the rest just being crazy sensitive and my previous cleanser was drying me out even more which was just horrendous.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back to using my old Noxzema cleanser in the hopes in will clear up the mess that this one caused.</li>
            <li>my physician prescribed me a pill for my acne and when i started the pill i decided to start using a new cleanser because my other one did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Stay away if you have dry skin - there is another formula by Cerave that is for normal to oily skin and won&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after I wash at night - not dry like some other brands.</li>
            <li>So far the wife loves it as it does not dry her face out like other cleansers while removing her makeup.</li>
            <li>products are chock full of high quality ingredients, void of useless fillers and preservatives and toxins and are not cheaply made yet very affordably priced.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommendable, as are all of the other products in the CeraVe line!</li>
            <li>I usually get dry, tight skin with most face washes but this face wash leaves my skin feeling</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product dispenses as a clear gel and when combined with a wet face lathers up into a foam.</li>

            <li> CeraVe is the best cleansing product I&#x27;ve found to keep skin moist and healthy.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t spending ba&#x27;zillions of dollars on tv commercials as the money has been wisely spend building a great product.</li>
            <li> Loving it!  </li>
            <li> Also, what&#x27;s best is that this exfoliator also doubles as the product you need for step 4 :)</li>
            <li> Let me feel happy is good quality and price is the reason why I always choose amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of cleansers and this is close to the top of my list for the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> Like many women, I have tried a lot of cleansers in search of the perfect one.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup perfectly and leaves the skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> It really is the perfect face wash and at a perfect price!!!</li>
            <li> .it has residue which doesn&#x27;t make it a pleasant process while rinse off .wont</li>

            <li> Good to use, the natual formula can be used for any type skin.</li>

            <li> It feels good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of the product does a good job removing my makeup and maintaining my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> because of all the good reviews</li>

            <li> Good size.</li>
            <li> It seems good, but the foam is not as robust as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> However, a good moisturizer takes care of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I prefer the moisturizing kind for &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s watery), smells nice without being girly, and does its job of taking off the day and makeup.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> nice thing is it feels like it cleans well</li>
            <li> Of course everyone has their own skin types and needs.</li>
            <li> The cleanser foams nicely and removes excess oil and makeup without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I never have this kind of acne</li>
            <li> To be honest I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, I&#x27;ve used the hydrating cleanser</li>
            <li> It works best if you take the time to lather up and then rub gently.</li>
            <li> how many good ones there are.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> It cleans nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> I have honestly tried almost every facewash out there and this blows all of them out of the water.</li>
            <li> but I really think this cleanser is one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Great for makeup removal and makes my face really clean.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I use it to clean my beard while showering.</li>
            <li> It is best for normal to oily skin, but you can use it if your skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon has better pricing, unless you&#x27;re able to find a good sale at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this since there is so many good reviews on this product</li>
            <li> Great for a quick wash though.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product so far!</li>
            <li> Great deal, great product, super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> It does have a light lovely scent and foams very nicely.</li>
            <li> I originally started with the moisturizing cleanser and that worked great for most of my face, but it made my forehead way to oily all the time.</li>
            <li> Good cleanser if you want something mild and with no scent!</li>
            <li> I have not found anything else in this price range that I have ever liked better.</li>
            <li> but this one is the best one by far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best Mens face wash on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have skin that is particularly sensitive, but I think this cleanser is especially good for those who do.</li>
            <li> and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve come across thus far.</li>
            <li> It creates a foamy lather and is just perfect for frequent use.</li>
            <li> I switched off of my spendy clinique stuff to see if the cheap stuff could do as good of a job.</li>
            <li> and I honestly think it works better.</li>
            <li> The most amazing face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The best part of this cleanser is that it leaves your skin at the correct pH level and doesn&#x27;t strip the skin&#x27;s natural acid mantle.</li>
            <li> I tried to get off it and use goats milk soap since it works lovely on my body gives it a nice glow</li>
            <li> It feels nice but strips everything away and leaves my skin overcompensating and producing even more grossness.</li>
            <li> the pill cleared up my acne completely and this cleanser was the perfect compliment for my face.</li>
            <li> Its amazing I love it</li>
            <li> After trying what seems like every face soap on the market, this is clearly the best in my view.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and looks great!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Best for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I think this would be ideal for someone with very oily skin but mine</li>
            <li> Best foaming cleanser for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this face wash takes all my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes , I love how it foams for a great clean feeling</li>
            <li> Love love love this face cleanser!  </li>
            <li> Love Love Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> Just received my order and am excited to see if it keeps working good for my face.</li>
            <li> While this may not apply to everyone, I would think a bit more research on your own may help you make more informed decision on this product.</li>
            <li> The perfect scent free gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; probably great for any skin type, as it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> Nice clean feeling!</li>
            <li> This face wash also works great as hand soap (if you&#x27;re willing to use it for your hands as it can be pricey).</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin very smooth, and my pimples dissapeard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels very comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li> It also rinses easily and foams up nicely.</li>
            <li> I created foams with fair amount of CeraVe cleanser after I washed my face first with warm water, applied them on my face and circularly massaged my face for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Very mild, scentless and effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> Foams up nicely and cleans off easily.</li>
            <li> Mild Face wash, Lovely Fragrance and is a good cleaner.</li>
            <li> :) works excellent and does not dry my face out at all.</li>
            <li> this is a very good mild foaming cleanser that does the job just right.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth texture and pleasant smell, but the most important thing is that it does wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> Very good product for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After just a couple of days I noticed a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> and I have already noticed a HUGE difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> This cleanser works well, and takes off most makeup (with the exception of waterproof).  </li>
            <li> I guess its ok...</li>
            <li> ok..</li>
            <li> Wish I found this face wash many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite face was</li>
            <li> It removes makeup better than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The CeRave products I&#x27;ve used are the best, especially the Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many reviews on this brand and decided to go for the foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> so you get the best outsome possible.</li>
            <li> I think I will try the moisturizing version and see if that gives better results.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth..</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> gave me more acne than it cleared</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for my whole family.</li>
            <li> Worked better for me than cetaphil.</li>
            <li> GREAT price - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love the gentleness of CeraVe products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> but i am glad i did.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best in price and quality.</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing, it leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Using this along with the CeraVE AM/PM lotions has simplified my routine, and my skin feels better, and looks better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> If I can get her to use the AM lotion, then I&#x27;d truly be #winning</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel like it washes your face, more like dries it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li> LOVE with cleanser.</li>
            <li> After using this for a while - my face has never felt more balanced.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but could&#x27;ve been handled better.</li>
            <li> I love this foaming cleanser</li>
            <li> The thing I like best about this is that it removes my eye makeup entirely without having to re-wash the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Non drying aspect is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews and saw that this product was given mostly 5 out of 5</li>
            <li> am so glad I bought this product and tried it out</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Love cleanser,</li>
            <li> but when I turned the bottle to allow it to pump, the top broke.  </li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;intense menthol&amp;#34; feeling, but I love it.</li>
            <li> This is great and takes makeup off really well.  </li>
            <li> More and more breakouts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this cleanser many times and have not found anything I like better yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 7 years now and love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about, just OK.  </li>
            <li> This product is excellent- the shipping costs twice as much as the product itself, but it was still worth it.</li>
            <li> and I think it is helping my moisturizer perform better as well.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive, and works better than any luxury brand cleanser I have used.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I wanted something to help aid in healthy skin.</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid works wonder :)</li>
            <li> i tried it once more just to be sure.  </li>
            <li> now, i am sure that this is not a product that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash.</li>
            <li> But I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Often times you won&#x27;t know if your cleanser is overdrying your face because your body will produce more oil to make up for it, and then you&#x27;ll have more acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite exfoliator is [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]].  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> (Better than Aveeno, which we had been using, and which the kids say &amp;#34;hurts&amp;#34; when they put it on.)</li>
            <li> Was given a sample size at my dermatologist 3 weeks ago and love it.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve found in reviews, this is much better than the 2x</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts forever even with daily washing, it doesn&#x27;t sting if I get it in my eyes, and it rinses off perfectly without any residue.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> They ask for more.</li>
            <li> I love using this face wash.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser</li>
            <li> omg love this ....</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser</li>
            <li> Love it ,I can feel it the result</li>
            <li> Using it in the shower does better than trying to get it all rinsed off over the sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the lotion too :)</li>
            <li> I would pay more to buy a better one than this.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> It cleans WAY better then Cetaphil as well.</li>
            <li> Favorite wash</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Referred by my dermatologist and this price is a lot cheaper:)</li>
            <li> Before this I have tried AcneFree, Neutrogena face wash (many products) but</li>
            <li> just a perfect simple face wash.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested I start using, skin feels like it can breathe 10x more</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I hope it always works because if so I found the best facial cleanser ever!!!</li>
            <li> For me, CeraVe’s Foaming Facial Cleanser is the perfect medium.</li>
            <li> so this might be better for those with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin or even combination skin.</li>
            <li> but if it wasn&#x27;t safe I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t still be on the market.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser ever!!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Better than most face washes/cleansers I have paid more for.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> update when I&#x27;m sure if it is this or not.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it foams and the smell better than set a fill.</li>
            <li> It works best when you mix it with A LOT of water (equal parts almost) and scrub it in your hands till a lot of foam is made.</li>
            <li> Great gentle face wash.  </li>
            <li> The best I could get before was washing my face with water because cleansers were such an issue</li>
            <li> but it is so much better than it was before I started using the cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite for the shower.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m breaking out in acne more so than I did before</li>
            <li> Love cerave lotion on my body too (doesn&#x27;t do well with my face).</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li> I want to love this and keep using it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cleansers.</li>
            <li> NOTE TO BE SURE</li>
            <li> It is gentle and makes my skin happy.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> but i prefer Benzoyl peroxide face wash more than this.</li>
            <li> The foaming cleanser is refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance added in that could irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.....</li>
            <li> At 27, I still get acne even with a healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li> and I do love the CeraVe Moisturizing Cleanser.</li>
            <li> really works at removing makeup feels great</li>
            <li> Followed with a good skin-care regime, I rarely break out anymore</li>
            <li> and my skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> I like this product way more than Cetaphil because I feel more refreashed</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love CeraVe products.</li>
            <li> Visits to dermatologists were met with suggestions to moisturize more, then suggestions to switch from lotions to oils, and then from oils to petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure I will still use but probably</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> , my skin gets more even feeling</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am insanely pleased with this product and its coinciding lotion.</li>
            <li> say that it is great!&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea has been a problem for many years</li>
            <li> I love this foaming cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Using this has cleared my skin and made me look like the sexy beast I was always meant to look like.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser ive ever used at ANY price!</li>
            <li> Foaming Facial Cleanser is perfect for use at the end of the day when I want to get all my creams, serums, sunscreens and makeup off and prep my skin for my retin a application.</li>
            <li> great product -----gentle and does the job</li>
            <li> I used Cetaphil for years but read this was better.  </li>
            <li> I am so incredibly glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning power of CeraVe along with the ease of use.  </li>
            <li> So, I just bought a couple more pump bottles of it,</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and after a week I can already feel the difference.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this cleanser is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products.</li>
            <li> Bought more at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> My derm suggested that I use this as a facial wash morning and night and it cleanses and hydrates my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> To say I&#x27;m impressed would be a gross understatement.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for years now and this is the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but as in all skin care products, it takes time.  </li>
            <li> Love this cleanser</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.</li>
            <li> if anything cause more on my chin..will continue to search.</li>
            <li> It might work for most, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I used Cetaphil before and enjoyed it, but felt it was time for a switch.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks much better after using it.</li>
            <li> The best facial cleaner I&#x27;ve used is...</li>
            <li> Excellent for a daily face wash.</li>
            <li> I am Very satisfied with the Full Satisfactionresults of this product</li>

            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li> I saw this at the store and thought I would see if maybe my lips were chapped because I needed more moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always looking for a better face wash.</li>
            <li> It is also cheaper than most acne washes.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The best I could get before was washing my face with water because cleansers were such an issue</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can see not being able to use this in Fall and having to move to the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser.</li>
            <li> but might be better for oilier skin types in cooler months.</li>
            <li> Better than p..active.</li>
            <li> and this stuff definitely works the best.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CeraVe hydrating cleanser for many years.</li>
            <li> I have a subscription to save even more.  </li>
            <li> Works even better than Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> like better if pump worked</li>
            <li> so, yes I love CeraVe cleanser.  </li>
            <li> If you look up scholarly journal articles discussing the safety of methylparabens, they have been tested as safe.</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> My skin is so much more softer.</li>
            <li> Day by day my skin is clearing up more and more.</li>
            <li> Also look into their Facial Moisturizer, it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CeraVe for almost 2 months now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good quality product, effective yet gentle.</li>
            <li> It is effective and does a good job at removing makeup and is really gentle and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> this was the most popular form of cerave, which i&#x27;d heard good things about, so i figured i should be safe with a product labeled &#x27;normal to oily.&#x27;</li>
            <li> It offers the perfect amount of lather, but rinses clean without leaving that slimy slippery feel.</li>
            <li> Using to help reduce breakouts, so far so good!</li>
            <li> It has a nice, clean scent.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will be great for someone with normal skin and no acne but just not for me.</li>
            <li> In general, I would say, CeraVe&#x27;s skin products are very good.</li>
            <li> l loved it very much.</li>
            <li> Best product found for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gets my skin very clean without drying it out and keeps me from getting breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This gets my skin very clean without feeling stripped or stressed.</li>
            <li> but my skin still feels very clean after.</li>
            <li> Face feels very clean when I use this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, his face is very clean without oil now.</li>
            <li> This will hold up as a winter and a summer wash making your face feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I have combination and he has normal, great for both</li>
            <li> My face is looking the best it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> It did good for the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, gentle on skin and nice smell, I will continue to use this often and order more.</li>
            <li> , it is gentle, fragrance-free, and effective!</li>
            <li> 1 pump is all it takes to wash your face, so a bottle lasts a pretty good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle, effective, and I even think it&#x27;s helped with my breakouts!</li>
            <li> It feels very refreshing and minty, but it doesn&#x27;t keep my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> this is good cleanser, good for sensitive skin and make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It is really affordably priced, and the pump is very nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> so so i need something more strong.</li>
            <li> I have rosecea, and this is a nice mild cleanser for the face.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, absorbs quickly, and even after applying it liberally, pajamas do not stick.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is Super Amazing</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this cleanser is both mild and effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear cleanser which is interesting, and it is working great for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wonderful product that is great for sensitive skin and especially great in the winter when I am more prone to dry skin!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling wonderfully clean!</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t have known that I could wash my face and have my skin feeling clean and MOISTURIZED!</li>
            <li> and you can feel your face skin as clean as breathing!</li>
            <li> CeraVe did not irritate at all and gets my skin clean!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel clean after washing my face!</li>
            <li> So I researched the best cleansers for COMBINATION (oily/dry) SKIN, and this beat out many other pricier options.  </li>
            <li> very good facial wash .does what it says .foams</li>
            <li> Nothing special but better than most store brand washing I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It really does the trick of washing away all impurities, giving my face a bright glow after each use.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin and all skin types.</li>
            <li> Also switched my pre-teen from Neutrogena&#x27;s oil-free acne wash to this and it has GREATLY improved her early years acne.</li>
            <li> but I imagine it is gentle and effective enough to be excellent for a variety of skin types.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin has felt much more comfortable after shaving if I use this before a shave.  </li>
            <li> Great for adult acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great for sensitive and acne prone skin - trust me</li>
            <li> works great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Good gentle wash that does the job and cleans your face well.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin and does a really good job of cleansing without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for 2 years and it does a good job at not irritating my skin like salicylic acids and scrubs</li>
            <li> You get a really good amount for the price, and it keeps both my and my husband&#x27;s skin clearer than anything else we&#x27;ve used (including the department store stuff that&#x27;s twice as much money for a quarter of the amount of product).</li>
            <li> (I will spend good money on lotions and potions, but I just can&#x27;t embrace spending too much on a cleanser that washes away.)  </li>
            <li> Good at removing makeup, acne not so much</li>
            <li> and I heard this product was a really good cleanser, but I can say, after many washes, I could live without it.</li>
            <li> Great product, mild cleanser and really cleanses your face without drying.</li>
            <li> Clean smell and very light.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> While that cleanser worked magic on my skin, this one is comparable, and significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li> First time ever buying this but love it!  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get this facial cleanser because I read that for combination skin the best kind of cleanser to use is a gentle foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> This cleanser achieves wonderful results and lasts a very long time- a great value, given its low, affordable cost.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really easy to dispense</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> It eliminates blemishes very quickly.</li>
            <li> Very mild and does what it says.</li>
            <li> It removes mascara easily.  </li>
            <li> It removes eye makeup easily, and when I use toner afterward, there is never a trace of leftover makeup on the cotton pad.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t hurt to use and its easy to apply</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It easily sits in the medicine cabinet, to the side of the sink, in the shower, etc.</li>
            <li> and easily pumps out.</li>
            <li> I feel so refreshing and clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> Easy on your skin and works well.</li>
            <li> However, this Foaming Cleanser which I&#x27;ve purchased many times even through Amazon gives you a nice lather that makes it feel as though as your face IS really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin is prone to being easily burned from the stronger cleansers.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleaner for reactive or sensitive skin because it is especially gentle.</li>
            <li> [...] has a great list of comedogenic and harsh ingredients to avoid  when choosing a good face wash and this one has none of them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and cleans the face leaving no residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely been the most amazing cleaner Ive ever used.</li>
            <li> However, this face wash turned out to be PERFECT and just what I needed: it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, it&#x27;s nice and gentle, doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my skin (combination).</li>
            <li> really love how gentle the hydrating wash is, and it also nicely removes make-up.  </li>
            <li> and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it for all people out there.</li>
            <li> Feels like a very gentle yet effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference after using this product, but I find it to be very refreshing on the face.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients and face felt soft and clean after washing.  </li>
            <li> More comfortable, clean feel, non-irritant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best for my skin hands down.</li>
            <li> It might not be great on dry skin, but use it on normal skin and it is great for oily areas like the nose or forehead.                                            </li>
            <li> Feels very refreshing and minty and keeps my face feeling fresh, very effective at washing dirt/oil off my face after a long work day.</li>
            <li> Really lathers well and gives your face a nice, refreshing, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Delivery and packaging were fine.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it does not dry my face out and it makes my face feels great after use</li>
            <li> and I like it just fine.</li>
            <li> but it works fine now.</li>
            <li> even bar soap or bronner&#x27;s is fine.    </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> She told me it was going to take a while for the prescription to come in, which was totally fine with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things over the years to control my mild acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the lotion, but never tried the cleanser- very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> This foams really well and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation I love it!</li>
            <li> What I like best is that it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin nor does it feel tight after cleansing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great gentle face wash that I will certainly buy again when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had pretty high expectations considering all of the great reviews, but it ended up just not being for me.</li>
            <li> The difference is huge.</li>
            <li> However, after about almost two weeks of using the product, I noticed a huge change in my skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gentle face wash that makes my skin feel oil free.  </li>
            <li> There is huge difference between causing cancer (which mehtylparabens do not) and affecting existing cancer cells.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find their facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser product overall</li>
            <li> The price on amazon is fantastic and I can keep one on the sink and one in the shower.</li>
            <li> This works great for me and is the same size as the moisturizer</li>
            <li> my face felt smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> CeraVe cleansers and lotions keep me comfortable.</li>
            <li> recommend this product for maybe morning routines, when all you need is a light rinse - not for end-of-day grime though.</li>
            <li> Great face wash, it definitely takes all the oil and dirt away.</li>
            <li> My skin stay oily free all day</li>

            <li> I was looking for a light cleanser that would be good for sensitive skin and for everyday use, and this cleanser works great!</li>
            <li> I use it every day at night and just lather it gently all over my face and wash it with warm water before patting with a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Because I liked the exfoliator so much, I tried [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say 6 months later that I have no regrets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I promise this wash is amazing, and you should really give it a try.</li>

            <li> It does work great as an everyday/night facial cleanser though!</li>

            <li> good facial cleanser , love it</li>

            <li> /&gt;So far so good</li>
            <li> It made my skin nice and soft and I love the lather.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I&#x27;ve ever used that is so good that I&#x27;ve stopped looking for something better.</li>

            <li> The product was highly rated, and even if it didn&#x27;t help my arms, I&#x27;d still have a nice face wash for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is good for my sensitive skin as a pregnant.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; eczema, this facial cleaner is great!!!</li>
            <li> Love my first experience with CeraVe.</li>
            <li> and I rarely get blemishes or breakouts anymore!  </li>
            <li> The fact that it contains ceramides is something that has my mother excited as well, since she&#x27;s a fan of Dr Oz</li>
            <li> o so fresh!  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this, was excited to try.</li>

            <li> It leaves your skin feeling cool and smooth, no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not the sort to go out of my way to review products like this online, but I have been so impressed with this cleanser that I just had to put the word out there for anyone else who might find themselves in a similar predicament as what I described.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed that I had a significant increase of pimples on my face because of the moisturizers.</li>
            <li> and my skin is needing a rich, moisturizing cleanse.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed even after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Face feels clean and fresh after each use!</li>
            <li> JUST CLEAN AND FRESH!  </li>
            <li> Great for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Still, I like the clean feel of the product and ease of use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil before and didn&#x27;t like how my face didn&#x27;t have that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li> and it does get my skin clean with out drying it out.  </li>
            <li> Seems to clean my face without bothering my skin in any noticeable way.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do: clean my face.</li>
            <li> I just need it to clean.</li>

            <li> It just feels... clean.</li>
            <li> I moisturizer AFTER I clean, so</li>
            <li> After washing, my skin feels EXTREMELY clean and refreshed and it feels tighter even.</li>
            <li> A great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry at all.</li>
            <li> but my face feels so clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> CeraVe&#x27;s Foaming Facial Cleanser is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Face and body feels clean after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this is by far the best daily cleanser to use.  </li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t keep my skin clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Best facial cream cleanser I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This is conjunction with chemically exfoliating every day with mild glycolic and salicylic acids, benzyol peroxide on acne-prone areas, and a light day</li>
            <li> I tend to break out AND have be somewhat dry, and this is great.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin clean and moist, with no fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that will get your skin clean without overdrying and to remove all of your make-up, you have to purcahse this.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser&#x27;s pH is perfect for the skin and has helped to clear up and repair my damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> cleansing with CeraVe, I apply milky cleanser with cotton ball, and cotton ball remains completely clean showing no dirt.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to anyone who normally buys cetaphil normal to oily skin face wash, and</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean afterwards, but not tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no nonsense clean.</li>
            <li> I switched from Cetaphil to this because the Cetaphil just didn&#x27;t make my face feel completely clean.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect especially for sensitive skin people.</li>
            <li> It gets sudsy and my face feels clean after I rinse my face</li>
            <li> i want something that will clean my face, not add oils or a waxy layer to my skin.</li>
            <li> my face feels clean and moisturized without being stripped and it keeps my acne away.</li>
            <li> But you feel clean when its washed off.</li>
            <li> I say its excellent as a daily cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t rob your skin of complete moisture and elasticity.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so clean</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and this is by far the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean - but not oily at all.</li>
            <li> Not over drying and face feels clean after washing.</li>
            <li> (I know, shame on me) and this leaves your skin clean and almost squeaky clean but not quite because</li>
            <li> it was surprisingly smooth and nice to my sensitive</li>
            <li> It washes off well and leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean also.</li>
            <li> and I found the reason for me breaking out is oftentimes the facial cleanser being too irratating, so I found this one, and so far it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to remove makeup and leaves my skin so white and smooth - flawless....</li>
            <li> I ordered this cleanser after reading so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> Helped clear away her skin and now her face looks more youthful than before!</li>
            <li> but that is best for normal to dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser along with the lotion for normal to dry skin which provides the perfect balance for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and has improved my skin tremendously!!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t anything special though.</li>
            <li> Just right for my Rosacea plagued face!  </li>
            <li> It is amazing for my sensitive skin because it&#x27;s unscented and it leaves my skin feeling clean without any tightness or dryness.</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin that is combination, this works really nice to keep your skin feeling clean and removing makeup.</li>
            <li> It cleans and prevents oily skin really well, while leaving your face feeling incredibly clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> up very well leaves skin feeling lovely and clean will buy again.</li>
            <li> It leaves her face clean and smooth, it is a great cleaner but not harsh to sensitive skin and non-drying.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is Ok but not 100% effective as it still leaves make up residue and does not completely get everything off.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing and silky and will clear your skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is pretty good for sensitive skin, though not so accustomed as one with oil skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was pretty good and clear before I started using this product</li>
            <li> However its great on all my make up brushes and pink makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> &amp; my skin feels soft &amp; amazing.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive, acne-prone, normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, lathers up great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling too dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> Just one full pump</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s relatively sensitive, and so far, it&#x27;s loving loving this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love this gentle face wash.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a foaming cleanser (mostly because I&#x27;ve had foaming cleansers before that REALLY foam)</li>
            <li> This cleanser is mild yet leaves your face feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product especially for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Cool cleanser.</li>
            <li> It removes all my makeup well and is good for anyone looking for a daily face wash.</li>
            <li> There is also a hydrating variation which is even more gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a gel cleaner that doesn&#x27;t really foam.  </li>
            <li> This product is really good, it reminds me of the formula of clarisonic facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about CeraVe.</li>
            <li> I want that super clean feeling BEFORE I apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The foaming version gets rid of makeup and oils better than the gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about CeraVe foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> you do all 4 of these steps, I promise you&#x27;ll have much much much clearer skin :)</li>
            <li> you do all 4 of these steps, I promise you&#x27;ll have much much much clearer skin :)</li>
            <li> Good for me and my teenage kids.</li>
            <li> i wear make-up every day and this does a good job getting all the makeup off without any extra effort.</li>
            <li> My BF is a doctor, and he (and our dermatologist) love the whole CeraVe line.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice soft feel to skin after rinsing face.  </li>
            <li> All around good soap; I only use it on my face</li>
            <li> I am currently a full time student</li>
            <li> I like it better, and the price is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> Im sure it would help woman with removing makeup or the dirt on the very surface of your face</li>
            <li> Men, you need to wash your face, and you need to buy a good facial cleanser (not body wash).</li>
            <li> For the most part my skin is very oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;The true test came when i had to stop using them because i had my eyebrows tattooed and couldn&#x27;t because of the hyaluronic acid, which dermatologist recommend all your cleansers should have.  </li>
            <li> have a nice natural glow an no longer have flaky cheeks with a shiny forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li> On top of all that it is really overpriced.</li>
            <li> Loving this face was so far.</li>
            <li> It has worked well for me in conjunction with a good moisturizer and occasional AHA</li>
            <li> I really cannot express how much better my face feels with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t even need to moisturize after using it, my skin just feels better all day.</li>
            <li> I am a pharmacist, and this is my go-to product for patients asking for a good cleanser, and so I finally decided to give it a shot myself.</li>
            <li> I suggest grape seed oil because it&#x27;s better price and it absorb as fast as 2 others that i use.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Good facial cleanser, will buy again!</li>
            <li> It works really good and recommend this to people who like me was looking for a facial cleanser that works well.</li>
            <li> but I realized there had to be something out there that was even more gentle....</li>
            <li> Makes you&#x27;re face feel so refreshed, it&#x27;s actually better than the hydrate cleanse because the foam really gets under your skin barriers.</li>
            <li> I love how much it lathers</li>
            <li> So cool</li>
            <li> Really good standard cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Purchased it based on the numerous 5 stars and the price, and it was a good decision that I made.</li>
            <li> have found that a dime sized pump is the sweet spot for me.  </li>
            <li> : For those with mildly sensitive skin, this is a nice, cheaper alternative to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> So not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not NEARLY as quickly or badly as soap does,</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so gentle and mild, I love it.</li>
            <li> It is great and really helps with my complexion, it does not dry out my skin either.  </li>
            <li> It is a light and effective cleaner and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s great in one sense because it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, but I will be exploring for other, better cleansers for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I am fortunate to have very clear skin and with CeraVe, it is sure to stay that way for years to come.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling clean and natural.</li>
            <li> Feels great and my face (which has historically felt very oily) stays clean all day with this product + a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It washes off pretty easily and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> CeraVe makes excellent products for those with sensitive and very dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that overall, it&#x27;s a very good cleanser for people with combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle, straightforward wash that does the job and was easily incorporated into my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at removing light to heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> face feels fresh and clean, reduces redness IMO, doesn&#x27;t overdry</li>
            <li> Works well on all skin types and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh with no residue.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean, fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel fresh and clean without drying out my dry-prone skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean and there is no over powering smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best product lines around, and the foaming facial cleanser is not without exception.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and this is super moisturizing for my face</li>
            <li> I switched to cerave products and it had helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have a combination/oily skin prone to break outs and this cleanser helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> My skin is SUPER oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mild, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> No fancy mumbo jumbo or super perfumey scents.</li>
            <li> Despite what the label says it isn&#x27;t actually a foam, it&#x27;s more of a gel, and I love the texture.</li>
            <li> has been helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and helping with my chronic acne problem.</li>
            <li> love FOAMING FACIAL more.</li>
            <li> find this cleanser to be mild and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Many people are allergic to Propylparaben so make sure you know that the inclusion of this chemical is not going to work against whatever you wish to achieve with this specific product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most favorite facial cleanser of all time.</li>
            <li> and I love this cleanser more than any big department store brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never noticed any makeup leftover after I wash with this, though I do use a mildly exfoliating wash cloth with it so that probably helps.</li>
            <li> Works great as a gentle shampoo especially for baldies like me.</li>
            <li> It has a light pleasant smell and is a very generous amount of cleanser for the low price.</li>
            <li> Great gentle facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> As someone who had quite a bit of acne through high school and college, I was so glad I came upon Cerave.</li>
            <li> Based off all of the positive reviews, this works for many, but sadly not me.</li>
            <li> but it does glide on pretty light and has the feel and texture of foam.</li>
            <li> I gave it to a friend who has normal skin and they love it  </li>
            <li> I do not know the source of the hyaluronic acid in this product, but you should be aware that this may not be a vegan product (if that is important to you).</li>
            <li> 12/22: There exists a chemical that is infinitely more effective at curing acne vulgaris than any other face wash on the market.  </li>
            <li> This is the gentlest face wash I&#x27;ve ever used, and it seems more effective than the other anti-acne face washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> have tried other foaming cleansers but this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this facial cleanser makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Cerave cleansers are the best, no garbage, bad ingredients and is good for most highly sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know technically what makes this so good, but it just feels so superior to other face washes.</li>
            <li> I really have found it to be true!  </li>
            <li> My new favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> I kept looking in the mirror to see how many new zits popped up over night and am so relieved to see almost none.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this oily skin version in stores where I live anymore, so I&#x27;m glad I could find it here.</li>
            <li> Within 1 week i havent seen much of a change, maybe a lil more breakout (but from what i understand thats normal with new products) but my skin itself looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This seems to work great for my skin, much less breakouts</li>
            <li> This product is good for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Foaming action was great and left my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my face very well and easily washes away makeup.</li>
            <li> Works good but it does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It is also very gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed after using.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin but seems to clean well.</li>
            <li> This worked exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I have been using the CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser for around 6 months and my face is looking so much better!</li>
            <li> The BEST facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my normal-combination skin and cleans well too.</li>
            <li> This has a great scent, cleans very well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry, sticky, oily, or anything.</li>
            <li> If my skin is dry I also just recently discovered CeraVe Moisturizing cream, which is awesome as well.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently</li>
            <li> -in-all, I think this is a mild but effective facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sidenote: It also feels super soft on your face :)</li>
            <li> Buy it and have a happy, not overly cleansed, tight mask-face.</li>
            <li> Immediately after using my face feels clean and refreshed and I am ready to start my day!</li>
            <li> My skin feels great and looks like it is finally starting to clear up!</li>
            <li> I started a regimen where I clean first with a mixture of sunflower and castor oil, then wash the oil off with this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Pimples are rarely appearing and my mild scarring has almost all faded into clear healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> unlike cetaphil and other nonfoaming gentle cleansers, this takes one pump and good massage w/ hands on face, and gets your face CLEAN!  </li>
            <li> Soft and good for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Im very pleased to have found something that is gentle on my 62 yr old sensitive skin, effective at cleaning oils &amp; makeup, &amp; is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the fact that there is a large quantity so that I don&#x27;t have to continually buy pint-sized products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great addition to your skin care routine if you&#x27;ve got skin that tends to be a little on the oily side.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, but dries the skin a little.</li>
            <li> This is important as it breaks down into a fairly watery consistency, pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy getting it from Amazon because the store price is so high!</li>
            <li> Amazing product wading with this twice a day helped eliminate a majority of the facial acne I&#x27;ve been struggling with for years.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important for me to use gentle products.</li>
            <li> Amazing facial wash!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to me by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> This lasted me months and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Did not feel like it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> it irritated my skin ,i have sensitive skin ,many cleanser gave me rashes ,so did this one</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what that meant until I tried it and from my conclusion it doesn&#x27;t wash away or strip to skin from the natural moister that your skin needs.</li>
            <li> and I rarely break out.</li>
            <li> I bought CeraVe after reading all the stunning reviews, and so far I&#x27;ve had no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> but I buy it anyway because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I really prefer this over Cetaphil; it doesn&#x27;t leave a film but is just as kind to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> and I rarely break out at all.</li>
            <li> Felt good, cleaned well, but gave me closed comedomes.</li>
            <li> it foams up nicely and your face feels clean after..not dry..</li>
            <li> Lathers great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my teenage daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li> From what i was reading i was expecting that it would be a nice facial cleaner that would be easier on my face than oxyclean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;mm allergic to most face cleaners and so far no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> but you actually can use any kind of oil that you like.</li>
            <li> I finally found product that is great for my sensitive skin and my acne.</li>
            <li> it definitely is worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only kind of face wash</li>
            <li> This has helped so much so far and my skin is beginning to look much better.</li>
            <li> love how soft it leaves my face</li>
            <li> These have natural ingredients and suds up much better - plus you can use this on your hair, skin, for shaving, and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done better for my acne and blackheads than anything else, completely clearing them up and not causing dryness.  </li>
            <li> These have natural ingredients and suds up much better - plus you can use this on your hair, skin, for shaving, and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done better for my acne and blackheads than anything else, completely clearing them up and not causing dryness.  </li>
            <li> This product is only slightly drying, and I am sure if you have normal to oily skin, this will be PERFECT for you!</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used on my pale, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In other words, our own hormones have a much more adverse affect on breast cancer cells than methylparabens do, and that&#x27;s only if it is able to come into contact with existing breast cancer cells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure and fresh and nondrying and we use it each and every day!</li>
            <li> It works well to easily remove all my foundation and concealer, but is still pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other facial cleansers like this the best.</li>
            <li> Cleans off makeup very well and at the other end of the spectrum turns my face into a great canvas for makeup application.</li>
            <li> It does a superior job at removing eye makeup (even without using the Clarisonic), and definitely leaves my skin feeling both soft and clean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it wasn&#x27;t going to be good with washing off my makeup which is important, but it&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my skin feel sooo smooth, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li> While the product itself seems very similar to Cetaphil, this leaves my skin more moist and clean than Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, you need a good exfoliator to clean away all of the dead skin and gunk that clogs your pores to begin with.  </li>
            <li> May be okay for most people, but my skin is super sensitive and my face felt like it was on fire and then turned red.  </li>
            <li> It works and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> I wish I had time to return it for the right one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the right skin routine for me.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it does the job, and does it right.</li>
            <li> He was absolutely right.</li>
            <li> I switched to Philosophy Face Wash and my foundation just comes off right away</li>
            <li> so it might not be what&#x27;s right for you.*tile Liquid Soap - (Baby Unscented, 32 oz)]].</li>
            <li> so it might not be what&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> So gentle, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling stripped, but you can feel that your skin is clean.</li>
            <li> ,it was totally clean ,i hope also have a night cream ,i want to buy again ,thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this face wash (Foaming Facial Cleanser - for Normal to Oily Skin) because I read that it was good for helping improve acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle on your skin but still leaves your face refreshed and clean</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see much results, but does feel face feeling somewhat clean</li>
            <li> stuff is definitely great and worth all the hype, it is not harsh at all on my skin which has been bullied so much over the years from use of the St. Ives Almond Scrub and various harsher cleansers.</li>
            <li> I like my face to feel SUPER clean and this apparently has some type of moisturizer in it, so it does not leave my face squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and easy to use, it works very well with my skin</li>
            <li> Wash the very comfortable and clea，n not greasy， foam a little more</li>
            <li> While it has more ingredients, more chemical ingredients, apparently said chemicals are better or less agitating to the skin.  </li>
            <li> my physician recommended because most face washing soaps have been to harsh on my skin, CeraVe cleaned my face perfectly without being to harsh but still removing all the yuck from the day</li>
            <li> This cleanser has been great on my face for the past year.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you have issues with cleansers for sensitive skin not doing a good enough job of removing sunblock and makeup.</li>
            <li> By far the best face wash I have ever used and those from Amazon that I have tried include Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash and Aveeno Active Naturals Foaming Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, consider doing a little more research on the item you want so you can make a more informed decision.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser, hands down!</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel amazing and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li> CeraVe is gentle, mild and foamy.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using Burt&#x27;s Bees cream facial cleanser, which honestly didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> The only facial cleanser I use, It is great</li>
            <li> I usually alternate between this and good ole St Ives apricot scrub for some exfoliation, then follow up with Thayers toner and Nivea sensitive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and tends to break out easily.  </li>
            <li> The liquid is clear and non-scented (it doesn’t have a medicinal smell either) and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This dried up some pimples then the pimples feel off and was left with beautiful skin even with just one use!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to finally find a reasonably priced, effective, and gentle cleanser to help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive lines for many years until I read the great recommendation.</li>
            <li> For even more sensitive skin I highly recommend their baby wash/shampoo!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, removes makeup nicely</li>
            <li> CeraVe is an underrated skincare brand, but their basics are all great and work without being too harsh or drying, and they&#x27;re very affordable.</li>
            <li> Its really gentle on the face, it almost feels like it isn&#x27;t soap when it contacts your face because its so mild.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mild cleanser that would be gentle on my eyes, but remove all my makeup at once.</li>
            <li> since the whole line is supposed to be very gentle and well-tolerated by most, i was surprised that my skin reacted so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s leaves your skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first day I used this I pumped 1.5 pumps into my hand and quickly realized that it was WAY too much.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle, non drying.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and It does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> , this thing is very gentle.</li>
            <li> This is a very straight to the point cleanse.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle, yet, removes all my make up, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li> This cleanser works well and is very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, i do like it.</li>
            <li> very gently washed.....</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> The texture of it in my hands feel very much like a gel.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and when I wash this, it&#x27;s very gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t bother my Rosacea.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes this very much.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial cleanser - I have been buying it for a good year and a half now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle cleanser, which is great, but it does a poor job of getting my face clean.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily/acne prone skin - and some wrinkles to add to the fun! - and have been really happy with this cleanser for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally all the face washs at the drug store, so I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li> Not at all abrasive but definitely cleanses my face to a sqeaky clean and smooth feel.</li>
            <li> It is gentle as well!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fantastic for those who have sensitive skin or anyone that is looking for a quality, well-priced, and non-irritating product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it on my face</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and all the CeraVe products!!</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> As the user you have to make aure you have a consistent routine in place for noticable differences to be made.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> He said it was OK, but perfers a different brand...</li>
            <li> and i am still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> For the first week</li>
            <li> LOVE this facial soap!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use cetaphil with my clarisonic face brush since it irritates my skin SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of face washes at this point...</li>
            <li> With nothing to lose I started looking for a more well-rounded solution and found CeraVe foaming facial cleanser on Amazon, and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty optimistic.</li>
            <li> Never in my entire life of using cleansers have I ever had so many breakouts caused by it.</li>
            <li> After finding that my husband was using my facial cleanser, I decided I better load up on it.</li>
            <li> think I will fall in love with this facial cleanser now.</li>
            <li> so I get a rash from most regular lotions.</li>
            <li> It was ok but occasionally made my face sting.  </li>
            <li> I turned to cheaper brands like Clean&amp;Clear and Neutrogena, and they were okay, but they didn&#x27;t seem to help control the oil level in my skin and soon after stopping the creams from the dermatologist, I could see signs of my acne starting to return.</li>
            <li> Gentle yet cleansing!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever tried this brand and wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it based on mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> face first and get it foaming.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this cleanser, and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> broke me out with the first use</li>
            <li> I have to moisturize after using, but it gets the dirt and grime off first.</li>
            <li> you really do get your money&#x27;s worth in terms of quantity.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m 24 and have been dealing with horrendous acne since the age of 15.  </li>
            <li> Really, what still has parabens anymore?!</li>
            <li> Has yet to irritate my already stellar complexion.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Accidentally purchased this product, but I like it pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different washes from St. Ives, Aveeno, Clearasil, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I first use this, noticed a difference after a day.</li>
            <li> Most of the year I don&#x27;t even need to follow with moisturizer, though when I do, I only use CeraVe as well.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleanser I&#x27;ve used that has not irritated my rosacea at all.</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe&#x27;s Foaming Facial Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently now for almost a year</li>
            <li> I will definitely finish the bottle I have and would consider buying more, as well.</li>
            <li> I would advise interested buyers research the ingredient list thoroughly before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It will last me atleast a couple months or maybe more.</li>
            <li> Much better price than in my regular drugstore.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash!</li>
            <li> I am 30 and dealing with acne for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I MISTAKENLY ATE MACARONI AND CHEESE AND SURE ENOUGH ACNE.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> This cleanser does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I also like the pump so that the amount is always consistent.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the Foaming Facial Cleanser and the Hydrating Cleanser and absolutely love both of them.</li>
            <li> If CeraVe ever stops making this cleanser, I&#x27;ll be the first in line to buy a hundred bottles</li>
            <li> The quantity is pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ingredients is facial cleanser &amp;#34; and found an article listing many of the ingredients found in this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I been trying out different cleansers for many years.</li>
            <li> i definitely would recommend it to a friend and believe that this product deserves more credit than it gets.</li>
            <li> I first tried it when I bought a bottle of it from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s readily available (at least for most of the people reading this review), and you can find it almost anywhere you go.  </li>
            <li> I use a Clarisonic orbital facial scrubber (which I bought after trying out my girlfriend&#x27;s...and absolutely love it).  </li>
            <li> It washes my makeup off pretty well, too.</li>
            <li> I have used only the moisturizer and love it.</li>
            <li> even and healthy is the only way I can describe it.</li>
            <li> Not heavy and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I first use an oil cleanser and then this after.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li> I am 25 and have combination skin with pretty severe hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> So gentle!</li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleanser that leaves my face feeling fresh all day without increasing oil production.</li>
            <li> I love cerave products and tried this one, when my regular CeraVe</li>
            <li> so hopefully my opinion on it won&#x27;t change to negative, but it&#x27;s a great cleanser.</li>
            <li> Changed the texture of my face skin to be more like that of my inner arm.</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Definitely the most moisturizing cleanser ever.</li>
            <li> My husband and i love this facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li> The eczema is mostly gone now as it was hormonal related, but I am continuing to use this face wash from now on.</li>
            <li> Love it as it contains simple ingredient</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to being able to remove my makeup by just washing with my facial cleanser, and this will not do the job.</li>
            <li> First off, it doesn&#x27;t foam</li>
            <li> I break out from everything except this stuff even cleansers and beauty products that claim to be for sensitive skin and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I tried CeraVe first with the Cetaphil</li>
            <li> I like to think i gave it fair trial of a few weeks with no imrovement.</li>
            <li> After you wash your skin with this it leaves It very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> when I clean my face, it makes my face very soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;love it.</li>
            <li> The cleanser made my face very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This face wash is so much better than any of the other neutrogena or clean and</li>
            <li> and I must say, I have much experience with engaging new pump mechanisms ( sarcasm).</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, especially for eczema fare ups.</li>
            <li> Good for my dry sensitive face.</li>
            <li> And I mean it when I say great.</li>
            <li> This face wash is really great, it works as well and feels as high quality as much more expensive products, like those from Clinique.</li>
            <li> Well this did nothing good for my skin, it gave my skin a tight feeling, which I cant stand!</li>
            <li> It also feels soft and fresh!</li>
            <li> Guess I will stick to my clean and clear and Indian Healing Clay masks</li>
            <li> I like the foaming cleanser, it&#x27;s clean and clear.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my skin looks clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Clean &amp; Clear and Clearasil products</li>
            <li> It has the most subtle clean smell--about as close to scent free as you can get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything (proactive, clean and clear, ect.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Clean &amp; Clear and Clearasil products</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and skin, and CeraVe got my face clean without irritation.</li>
            <li> Instead my face feels clean and my adult acne has almost cleared up.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Foamy, odorless, rinses clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Finally something that I love as much as my faithful Origins Checks and Balances.</li>
            <li> This formula is better for combination and oily skin, gentle enough to cleanse twice a day.</li>
            <li> CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser actually feels like you are doing something good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleansers even the pricey ones and this has worked very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I belong to the baby boomers era and was trying to find a good facial cleanser that will work well for me, and I found this Cerave Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Takes several rinses to totally get it off, but that seems like a good thing in my view.</li>
            <li> I am 35, with no lines or wrinkles, fair skin and occasional hormone related acne on my chin</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say that all of the products I use will work for everyone, but I think CeraVe is gentle enough that it will work for most people.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, refreshing face wash that removes oil but does not leave my skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> It lathers really well, cleanses well but leaves my skin moisturized, and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> When the new foaming cleanser became available, which is for normal to oily skin, I ordered it immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came on time and everything but wasn&#x27;t right for my skin, it made me break out with huge red blothces of acne</li>
            <li> and my skin feels clean yet not tight.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d heard much positive information about the brand.</li>
            <li> I like CeraVe products a lot, so I agree with the majority of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry which even if you have oily skin like me, is very important.  </li>
            <li> This is first time I am using this product, and I want to share how much I was amazed by this.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is extremely gentle, has no odor, and removes makeup and oil VERY well!</li>
            <li> I ordered this mostly because I was curious about this line of products being available for so many years, with an apparent ardent following.  </li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the CeraVe PM moisturizer and my acne is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember this causing any issues in the first two weeks, but even if a product does, you should really try to hold out.</li>
            <li> one pro is that it does seem pretty gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &#x27;s only been about 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve used CeraVe, and my face is becoming clear!!!&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The price is pretty reasonable too.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Proactiv for the last few years, and found that it had been the most effective of acne cleansers I had tried.</li>
            <li> Usually I have problem with cleansers but this one is really good for my skin.</li>
            <li> By the way, works as good if not better than any makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle, slightly foaming cleanser that is good for my slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser for about 6 months, it works well, my skin looks fresh and clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I had been using neutrogena fresh foaming cleanser because it actually left my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> very moisturized and clean with out stripping the natural oils my face needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh at all and leaves my skin feeling very clean and not tight feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Love it, will definitely buy more and try out the other products as well.</li>
            <li> but it does the job and during the winter it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin more than it already is.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin:-)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (usually more oily than dry)</li>
            <li> Most of the face cleansers that I have tried have either caused my skin to either get extremely dry</li>
            <li> I just use it once daily because my face gets irritated really easily.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash, doesn&#x27;t dry and holds moisture in.</li>
            <li> CeraVe foaming facial cleanser has been working well for me so far and my face feels clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive combination skin and</li>
            <li> My dry skin on my face is so much better</li>
            <li> At first I had trouble getting it to foam; that was my own fault.</li>
            <li> Apply a little retinol after washing and your skin will be good as new.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean, but not squeaky, and has been a major help in my battle against acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am also prone to rashes from certain products, but I have no issues with CeraVe.</li>
            <li> This one certainly does, but at a price.</li>
            <li> so it will certainly</li>
            <li> My skin is a little oily, this is the first time I bought this cleanser, it is indeed better than big, I believe, more durable</li>
            <li> After we give our faces a couple of more weeks to adjust to the new product, we are definitely going to try the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week and it has made tremendous improvements!</li>
            <li> I also left the foam on my face longer by putting on first, then brushing my teeth, and after my teeth are clean, I then rinse my face.</li>
            <li> The Hydrating Cleanser is very gentle but perhaps better used a first or second cleanser for removing makeup and sunscreen, especially if you use mineral-based products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, smooth, and has few comedogenic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I also recommend buying sulfate free shampoo, toothpaste, and body wash, because I made that switch the same time I purchased this, and it is a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me when I was battling with acne a few years back, and it&#x27;s just a great wash....</li>
            <li> As gentle as cetaphil but really cleans.</li>
            <li> This works with no frou-frou fragrance, and if you shave, you need a gentle cleanser to offset irritation.</li>
            <li> Didnt really feel any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Cleans really well without drying out your face.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped.  </li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> Secondly, it&#x27;s fragrance free and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Last but not least it&#x27;s extremely gentle and suitable for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say this clears up acne, it really does cleanse ur face very well, if you have acne it will not get rid of it, however if you dont have acne at all</li>
            <li> However I do like that it is gentle and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t add too much moisture either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> And neither takes make up off very well.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> this cleanser is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Its gentle, cleans well, and helps with my rosacea.</li>
            <li> so much I would give it 10 stars if I could.  </li>
            <li> While I was very exited to try this product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t do that very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was really amazed....</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this result but it really happened so I am here to share the story!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always had issues with very oily skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but washes off all my make up.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin gently and thoroughly, without drying it out and without leaving any soap residue.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it for my very oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Very drying for my skin</li>
            <li> Gentle and does not irritate his face.</li>
            <li> something gentle but effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t really feel that it does anything</li>
            <li> and I have really noticed an improvement the the evenness in color and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;amazon was very helpful with the return process however.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and its extremely gentle on my skin and leave me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the creamier options, this product feels like it really cleans.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my combination skin</li>
            <li> Gentle on the face and leaves it well moisturized too...</li>
            <li> It is gentle.  </li>
            <li> This product really cleans and hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li> but my experience with it has been very positive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought there was no way since all I&#x27;ve used before were much &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; grade products with much harsher chemicals.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend that you give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing twice per day (morning and night) and have noticed a drastic reduction in spotty patches of light acne especially on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It gently foams and removes all my makeup - even</li>
            <li> I found this very drying.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried a lot of cleansers, but most either don’t clean my skin enough, or leave it feeling stripped and dry.</li>
            <li> Contrary to the name, I don’t know that it really “foams,” but it does bubble up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I used to use Cetaphil face wash, but it never felt like it was doing much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unusual for me to break out so much like that</li>
            <li> This wash cleans gently and makes your face feel smoother.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I use Acanya for acne treatment which is very drying on the skin.</li>
            <li> fact that is foams makes it much lighter on your skin than Cetaphil which feels slimy on the skin.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> Whole family uses these products and dermatologist recommended it as well</li>
            <li> Then, I gently rub it all over my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for ALL skin types!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> /r/skincareaddiction in Reddit recommended this paired with Stridex ex-foliating pads, and as someone who has had moderate to light acne ever since puberty (now 21)</li>
            <li> this really works.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really drying my face out</li>
            <li> However, I want to point out one important thing to consumers who might scan only the rating summary before making a purchase: The summary appears to be an aggregate of reviews for ALL CeraVe products in ALL sizes, including pump, tube, and jar.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Does not foam very well on skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really foam.</li>
            <li> I dont feel like this helps that much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my clarisonic in months because this products cleanses very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My rough skin has gotten rougher and more itchy-</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up but works really well.</li>
            <li> really* started to don on me....</li>
            <li> Feels very concentrated</li>
            <li> My skin feels really hydrated after using the Hydrating Cleanser,so the name really is not false marketing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very upset that I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean but not dry</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> and I heard that the whole &amp;#34;Kill it with Kindness&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anybody who has dealt with acne, it can really make a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I like it, lives your skin clean feeling but not dry even if you have oily skin</li>
            <li> it is gentle and cleans well.</li>
            <li> It foams up very well, and makes you feel very refreshed and cleaned afterwards.</li>
            <li> You get a much cleaner finish, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because it&#x27;s not quite as gentle as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam much, but works for me</li>
            <li> and you don’t have to use much.</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle and works well.  </li>
            <li> The seller shipped this to me lightning fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quiet sure why its different than others but its worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Not too much of a smell, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> This cleaner is farther gentle.</li>
            <li> With Purpose it&#x27;s thicker and more rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the face and makes skin look and feel refreshed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this seems to work for me very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all!</li>
            <li> It cleans oil very well.  </li>
            <li> I filled by prior CeraVe empty bottle with EVOO:)</li>
            <li> anyway, it cuts through the evoo makeup remover very well and rest of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I was also a bit turned off by the fact that it doesn&#x27;t suds very well.  </li>
            <li> Also its very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, like honey.  </li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t really work for me..</li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference the moment I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I use Acanya for spot treatment, which works absolute wonders...</li>
            <li> One thing I have to say is: there are two different kind of Facial Cleaners for CeraVe</li>
            <li> It foams up nicely and does not have any fragrance, which I like since fragrance can be too harsh on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has been sensitive and have been switching through many different brand name products.  </li>
            <li> I waited a while before I wrote a review, so I at least used it for a good time.</li>
            <li> so when I used this for the first time, I saw the skin that was pretty dead from the acne start to come off which revealed nice soft skin</li>
            <li> moisturizer/heavy night moisturizer has made my skin clear, and more even toned than it&#x27;s ever been, which is saying something for someone with chronic red face syndrome and hormonal acne issues.</li>
            <li> On top of that it removes my make-up completely which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash, it helps make my skin very smooth along with the other products that I use.</li>
            <li> , there is no oily kind of residue, the skin is tight, clean and yet moist enough after you wash it off.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but gets is clean!</li>
            <li> I adore the feel of it, like soft syrup!!!  </li>
            <li> y/o skin that has a tendency to be oily has experience no breakouts and my skin doesn&#x27;t have them same dried out feeling that I experienced with so many other products.</li>
            <li> Very useful in the summer when the heat made my skin extra oily.</li>
            <li> listed ingredients are much better than the one for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am 99% sure I ordered for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the sample pretty quick, because it was only .5ML.</li>
            <li> I do not have large breakouts on my face, but will breakout regularly if I do not use some product to clean my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in how clear my skin is!</li>
            <li> loved it at first, but now seems to be drying out my skin a little much, so went back to Olay product!</li>
            <li> A great gentle cleanser, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> CeraVe is a step in the right direction, but ultimately wasn&#x27;t the right cleanser for me and just seemed like a cheaper version of Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t completely credit this product with solving my acne issues, but it does leave your skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the dry and tight feelings, this cleanser would be perfect because it cleans my face well and has helped immensely in diminishing my acne.</li>
            <li> They were on my face for 4 days, I used many medicines and other cleansers to get rid off them</li>
            <li> and he has recommended phytoceramides and the like as an alternative to other products that are supposed to make you look more &#x27;youthful&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I can not stress enough how important it is that if you want to get the full potential of this product you HAVE TO WASH YOUR FACE TWICE A DAY.</li>
            <li> and I can save my money for other products (moisturizer, retinol, etc). :)</li>
            <li> I especially got excited b/c</li>
            <li> lasts a long time (been going on a few months now) and is a perfect cleaner without having extra acne-fighting drying ingredients or anything.</li>
            <li> I certainly wish i had known about this during high school.....</li>
            <li> it takes longer for me to get oily on my face again, to compare with Clean n Clear Burst in the morning, or any of clean n clear products for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used special cleansers before because I never needed to, but with this flare up, I knew I needed to find something that was extra gentle.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning my face without making my skin feel tight and dry -</li>
            <li> and I definitely feel clean post use.</li>
            <li> I use it as part of my daily routine and it leaves my skin feeling clean AND hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially I found that it may not work too well for oil skin, but it turned out pretty fine by using a bit more than usual conditions for oil skin.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to clean your entire face.</li>
            <li> I found this cleanser very gentle going on, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling tight or dry afterwards, but smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes with this product because of all the rave reviews on how gentle and non-irritating it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the right cleanser for me!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most face washes dry it out and cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheap for how long the product lasts.</li>
            <li> This face wash has helped reduce redness that comes from dryer winter conditions, but it&#x27;s definitely suitable for year round use.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the creamy CeraVe cleanser, but the foam is nice.</li>
            <li> CeraVe foams up and makes my skin feel fresh and clean unlike other mild cleansers that simply sit on your skin.  </li>
            <li> pretty much the exact same)</li>
            <li> I have bought loads of money worth of the \\&quot;best\\&quot; Japanese (very revered) skin care products out there and nothing has done my skin as much wonders as cerave.</li>
            <li> It is not to light, nor to heavy, and the foaming action helps me see that I am getting my whole face clean.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Excited to have this in my new daily regimen!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days of using it already my face began to feel somehow more healthy, balanced and clear, without being overly dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this cleanser - very similar to Clinique&#x27;s facial foaming cleansers but a lot less money for a lot more product.  </li>
            <li> It seemed odd that &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; my skin could fix a problem that doctors had been insisting required moisturizing, but after years of being able to pick up microfiber cleaning rags with the side of my arms, I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that what we all want, less Oily Skin :)</li>
            <li> My favorite previously was neutrogena</li>
            <li> Decent sized bottle.  </li>
            <li> It has made a tremendous difference and actually removes makeup too.</li>
            <li> The product top was left open and spilled into the bag.</li>
            <li> I only got this facial cleanser because I heard so many things about it from skincare addicts.</li>
            <li> (super gross I know!).</li>
            <li> If you want a very basic cleanser that removes most oil from your skin, this may do it for you, but I feel like my skin starts to feel oily again shortly after using it.  </li>
            <li> I tried cotton ball cleanser after many different facewash and they always left some sort of remaining.</li>
            <li> and *only* use a light application of concealer with a clear mineral powder for my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> It definately doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin (which I was worried about because it&#x27;s for normal/oily skin), has a nice thick consistency (easily spreads..</li>
            <li> Would recommend if you experience mild blemishes and simply want a cleanser you can rely on.</li>
            <li> this is a cult classic.</li>
            <li> It has really helped to clear my skin!</li>
            <li> Seems to remove makeup better and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The price may seem steep, but the bottle is actually fairly large, and a single pump is more than enough to use each wash.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend this and their lotion as well.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist highly recommended it and uses it herself.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product for combination skin users.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for those in their older years and strong enough for those coming of age.</li>
            <li> and I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> If your skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be agreeing with your cleanser, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also highly recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> I took a chance because of the high rating.</li>
            <li> I noticed a positive change in the appearance of my skin after first starting CeraVe.</li>
            <li> but this so far seems to be better than the other things i tried.</li>
            <li> I am using my 3rd bottle and thrilled to have found it after reading other people&#x27;s reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin ( Mine is very sensitive and this hasn&#x27;t been irritating my skin at all)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s been fighting acne/breakouts/bad complexions for many years and using acne products in an attempt to treat it with no luck-- take a moment and consider if, possibly, you actually have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has been visibly more clear CONSISTENTLY than it ever was before with various other acne face washes... and the only significant variable was the change in face wash to CeraVe</li>
            <li> I wish it would lather up a little better, but I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> The hydrating version is a little bit better but not when combined with benzoyl peroxide- burns.</li>
            <li> For the price of the cleansing solution, it does the job done and leave your facial clear and clean.</li>
            <li> PLUS it barely takes any of this stuff to clean your whole face, so the bottle will probably last a year, so...</li>
            <li> It dried my face out, created more whiteheads than I&#x27;ve had in years since high school, and started to create milia-like bumps under my nose that were never there until I tried this</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most facial washes will make me breakout in rash or will dry my skin out so much that i peel.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel clean without stripping the oils and making your skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> It is a thorough cleanser,but gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin at age 28</li>
            <li> I have very oily and somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This brand is frequently recommended by dermatologists for gentle skin care.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and this leaves my skin clean without feeling so dry.</li>
            <li> His skin is clear and he continues to use the product which is gentle on his skin and restores the PH.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much my skin responded to this product within one use.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt clear acne very well, but it doesnt leave skin oily after wash.</li>
            <li> What i like about this product is its gentle nature towards sensitive skin or skin that is undergoing tropical treatments.</li>
            <li> and it really felt as though that cleanser wasn&#x27;t doing anything--it was far too watery.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle enough but also cleans leaving my skin soft and fresh in combination with a couple times a week exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gentle, and I am surprised that a dermatologist even recommended it.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel too dry afterwards, yet looks and feels perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> This product, however, was more harsh on my skin than the medicated acne wash.</li>
            <li> I did not notice this before but this cleanser is designed for normal to oily skin; whereas the creamy CeraVe is for dryer skin.</li>
            <li> and I have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I guess it works if you have normal skin, but if you have oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Im a male in my early 20s, over the years i have tried many different face washes.</li>
            <li> I worked in fast food for several years- KFC/A&amp;W to be exact- a place with LOTS of grease in the air.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in error since it is for normal or oily skin</li>
            <li> For normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I started using the oily skin formula, but it has balanced me out so well that I have moved to the normal skin version.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have realized though that it is for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Better than all the hundred if not thousands of dollars I&#x27;ve wasted on fancy brands.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea that is mainly under control, but recently was having problems with breakouts that even the prescriptions from the dermatologist weren&#x27;t completely taking care of.</li>
            <li> The Cleanser is good, but the package was broken when arrived.</li>
            <li> Foaming Facial Cleanser is very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like so many other face washes out there.</li>
            <li> Although I used more mild medicated cleaner, my face still felt slightly irritated and often too dry right after washing, accompanied with patches of red spots that lasted a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> I read lots about how these chemicals can actually dry out the skin leading to more breakouts in the future.</li>
            <li> TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]]  is the same product as step 2 but instead of using it as a wash, you apply it to your damp face and let it dry for 15 minutes before using water to wash it</li>
            <li> TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]]  is the same product as step 2 but instead of using it as a wash, you apply it to your damp face and let it dry for 15 minutes before using water to wash it</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and I am a guy that has really sensitive skin, and I gotta be careful which Items I pick to clean my face with, this item is really gentle on the face, does not have any &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation, and leaves your face feeling soft each time.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft &amp; smooth &amp; my skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries my face out just a little, but not enough that I use a moisturizer, because my face is very oily to begin with, and like I said it gets irritated very easily.</li>
            <li> CeraVe has been compared to other gentle cleaners such as Cetaphil and has proven over time to be a top choice.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which was good, but it didn&#x27;t really stand out from other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Most of them are okay, but due to my sensitive skin I constantly break out using other cleansers.</li>
            <li> My skin had some very large bumps within 6 hours and it has taken a week for them to finally go away.  </li>
            <li> you’re feeling a little hesitant to buy, CeraVe does send out free samples from time to time, and I would absolutely recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll even admit to lightly sanding my arms to try and remove the sharp, bumpy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over 2 months now, and my arms are still not as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but they&#x27;re so very improved from before.</li>
            <li> A little bit (a dime-sized squirt) will foam up nicely in your hands with a tiny bit of water.</li>
            <li> but my advice is to use lotion right after using it because it dries your face out but other than that it really works!</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to.</li>
            <li> It may be because my skin has gotten uses to the new meds</li>
            <li> even like the new turquoise packaging.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and psoriasis; so, trying new skin care products is always a risk.</li>
            <li> Remember, when using a new product, it takes two weeks for your face to adjust.</li>
            <li> new packaging on the bottle allows you to lock the pump, which is convenient if you are traveling and don&#x27;t want to spill the cleanser everywhere.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Like any product, do a quick research will help you go a long way!</li>
            <li> Our allergergist recommended this particular brand and so far they work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, lathers amazingly, and isn&#x27;t irritating whatsoever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps remove blackheads and prevent future breakouts, but you do need to make sure you wet your hands/</li>
            <li> Once i was able to start back using it but was careful to not touch my eyebrows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra money BY FAR.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a dime size on my orbital machine and foams up very nicely...cleanses very well, leaving no lingering residue and does it without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of this stuff to clean your entire face so this big bottle lasts far longer than it looks like it would.</li>
            <li> I promise to be more careful next time.</li>
            <li> love this product, great facial cleaner only need a very small pea size drop at a time this product will last a long time.</li>
            <li> One full pump is too much, I recommend not pushing it all the way down.  </li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive and this causes zero irritation.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended for anyone with eczema or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and everything I&#x27;ve ever tried gives me break outs.</li>
            <li> highly recommend for people who has oily face, troubling with acnes and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I found this product in an article written and recommended by a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am very old, I need a moisturizer,</li>
            <li> Leave your face very soft and with a moisturizing layer.</li>
            <li> well personally i would tell you to look else where, these didn&#x27;t have very much of an effect on me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin, and it&#x27;s always a struggle to find a cleanser that cleans well without aggravating my skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling clean but not tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Tretinoin has made my skin very sensitive and at first it was really red and peeling.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that the product is clear in color and has no perfumes or dyes!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a day with a warm, wet washcloth and the Cerave moisturizing cream (in the pot) afterward and my skin is doing extremely well with fewer breakouts and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I still have occasional breakouts, but my face is SO much clearer now!</li>
            <li> The standard benzoyl peroxide and salycilic acid treatments tend to stop working before you even finish the first tube</li>
            <li> Like many other generic (cheaper) alternatives sold on the market, this product contains Propylparaben and Methylparaben.</li>
            <li> many facial products only seem to further irritate it.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, has a more even color, and I&#x27;m not seeing any redness in the areas I usually do.</li>
            <li> A week later I noticed that when I pulled my lingerie out of the dryer I didn&#x27;t feel the familiar snag sensation when my arms brushed across the nylon.</li>
            <li> overall problem is I don&#x27;t see it doing any better than a bargain brand or any other brand would do.</li>
            <li> I tried finding a cap that would fit the opening of the bottle but had no success.  </li>
            <li> CeraVe has NO FOAMING ACTION at all!  </li>
            <li> It lathers up pretty well with a bit of foam, especially when I use in conjunction with my Shiseido cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> I first started using this because my lips were constantly chapped and drying out to the point where there were cuts on the corners of them.</li>
            <li> Plus it works better than higher priced facial cleansers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> good first few days broke out with small spots</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t miraculously cure my acne or change my life, but it&#x27;s a pretty solid product.</li>
            <li> Ever since that first use, this has been an Amazon regular item for me.</li>
            <li> many facial products only seem to further irritate it.</li>
            <li> Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate is the fourth ingredient on the list and is also a synthetic surfactant, but considered to be an allergenic at higher concentrations.  </li>
            <li> but this is the only one I consistently repurchase.</li>
            <li> My skin is absolutely clearer, my wife and I now use this product as our main facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It foams up really nice (but not too crazy) and leaves my skin feeling really clean.  </li>
            <li> I have acne, cystic acne, and most of the time oily skin, but some times it gets dry, with dry patches.</li>
            <li> It does the job without being strong enough to dry out my face.</li>
            <li> Works better than the more expensive facial cleansers and leaves your skin soft and toned.</li>
            <li> Clear but rich, you will only need a dab mixed with water for your face,  </li>
            <li> It also smells amazing, leaving a faint clean shaven smell similar to aftershave.</li>
            <li> Like there isn&#x27;t an exciting thing in this bottle, but my Mom is convinced she has patchy dry skin</li>
            <li> Its gentle on your skin and will not dry it.</li>
            <li> is gentle and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually pretty sensitive to facial washes, so I was nervous about this one.</li>
            <li> I like foaming cleansers that feel like they are really cleaning but have found that many leave my skin way too dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> This has been keeping my skin soft and clear!</li>
            <li> Although the back of the product says wash morning and night, I use it more than twice a day, especially after getting home from a long day and when my face feels grimy and oily.</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissatisfied and hope to receive a full refund for the problems that it caused.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did because my skin has totally balanced itself out now and is breaking out much less.</li>
            <li> It is really gentle on your skin and doesnt dry it out too much.</li>
            <li> This thing lasts for a long time and very cheap compared to all the other products.&lt;br /&gt;Enough about the value, this thing actually works very well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and certain cleansers turn my face red.</li>
            <li> : Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydrosultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG 150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and), PEG 6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the large list of ingredients in the cleanser, only one stuck out as a natural ingredient: water.</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;m writing this review with the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had since I was a little girl (yes, even better than Proactiv when it was working for me!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One is super hydrating and the other is mildy hydrating.</li>
            <li> I have used other products from Cera Ve super products.</li>
            <li> I have combination/oily and other cleansers either dry out my skin or make my skin even more oily.</li>
            <li> CeraVe products have helped clear up my skin, making it softer</li>
            <li> My face is clear.</li>
            <li> Also using this cleanser with a serum will clear darkspots and make your skin glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using clearasil and clean care for years, both dry up my skin and don&#x27;t actually work all that well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s cleaning your face because it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> I bought this CeraVe facial cleanser together with the day and night moisturisers for my 27 year old daughter as a gift, and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> She has now been using it for a few months and cannot believe how clear and smooth her skin is.  </li>
            <li> I will say that for the price I was expecting it to also clear breakouts.</li>
            <li> ( For me it doesn&#x27;t help clear them up.)</li>
            <li> Used with the moisturizing lotion from the same brand, my skin feels really supple, soft, and toned.</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple weeks my skin is almost completely clear.</li>
            <li> use CeraVe Foaming, CeraVe Moisturizing, Stridex(red box), and Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion SPF</li>
            <li> Is clear in texture.</li>
            <li> I have roseacea and this product has balanced it and made my skin clear.</li>
            <li> i suffered from acne and nothing worked to really clear it up...</li>
            <li> clear face washes I have used.</li>
            <li> B002MSN3QQ EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 sunscreen]].</li>
            <li> The combination of Differin and CeraVe has kept my face extremely clear.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive skin with the occasional rosacea breakout, and CeraVe has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Has a slight &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; smell to it; however, it removes dirt and oil leaving the face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This product however seemed to really clear my skin</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night (before sleep)&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser(2% Salicylic Acid) - Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I think it is meant for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Would recommend for sensitive and/ or aging skin.</li>
            <li> If you have oily or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin, and the CeraVe brand was recommended by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, somewhat acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended this product for my adult acne</li>
            <li> but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> This is such a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product has been working well for my eleven year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> so far did not cause break out or irritation.</li>
            <li> My face is naturally oily</li>
            <li> When I started treating my skin as &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and using this my face completely cleared up except for chin which I still get hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really think it is supplying my skin with vitamins and essential nutrients.</li>
            <li> im terribly sensitive with combination skin</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my sister who sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Unusual especially for a transparent liquid.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on their skin so as to not irritate teen skin.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t really foam.</li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive skin and this cleanser does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> Gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all</li>
            <li> it is not harsh and I believe it has balance my skin because I no longer have frequent blemish break outs.  </li>
            <li> My skin is also fairly sensitive Anne</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I was using the CeraVe Moisturizing Facial Cleanser for a bit, but when I switched over to this, I found that my face was much clearer after a week or so.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from sever acne, and it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li> It was not harsh on my skin yet cleansed as it</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have been using this product from last summer when my dermatologist recommended this after a heat acne outbreak.</li>
            <li> It lathers really well and has cleared my facial and body breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely remove all my eye makeup</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend it for someone with acne or oily skin who needs a thorough but gently cleanser.</li>
            <li> Please note that much of the hyaluronic acid currently used in the cosmetics industry is a byproduct of poultry processing, although it can also be expressed in bacteria.</li>
            <li> and I recommend this for those who have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to break the bank.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so gentle and actually make your skin refreshed after washing without that tight/stiff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on Amazon, I got this CeraVe cleanser and moisturing cream for my mom who was having some type of skin poisoning after using old creams and makeup on her face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if I just have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised no one has talked about the flushing, itching or anything like that.</li>
            <li> My acne has cleared; and my face is soft as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a gentle facial pore brush before I go to bed</li>
            <li> I noticed a marked improvement in my skin texture and a reduction of breakouts.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As an adult, it is embarrassing to have to deal with acne like a teenager.  </li>
            <li> If you find this too drying, try the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> not everyday like I will the hydrating cleanser.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re a person who has sensitive, oily, or problematic skin, try this.  </li>
            <li> This so far has.</li>
            <li> Having used this product for nearly 2 years I can honesty</li>
            <li> I like this facial soap so much i subscribed to it.  </li>
            <li> I recently started using Retin A and needed a gentle yet thorough cleanser that was not going to over strip my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle around eyes and never stings, even with an exfoliating puff or spinning facial brush.</li>
            <li> I recently found another cleanser that looks promising</li>
            <li> I have been using it for just about 3 weeks and my skin is completely clear, and so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks now &amp; have been having 1 or 2 big pimples the whole time.</li>
            <li> I have oily sensitive acne prone skin and everything irritates it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser 3 times, and they&#x27;re almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I also have combination (dry/oily) skin and</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that will break out at the drop of a hat.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and combination skin and a bit of rosacea....</li>
            <li> I washed my entire face with it including my eyes because that would prove if it is truly gentle...</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My acne has been very stubborn for years but ever since I stopped using soapy washes and cleansed only with water</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser eliminates dirt, grime, sweat, and oil much better than Cetaphil (in my opinion) and although it can be a  bit harsh for those cold, windy, winter months, it&#x27;s still a great staple cleanser and one that I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleaner and plan on purchasing it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she said that it makes her face painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily skin.</li>
            <li> It is a complete cleaner.</li>
            <li> I use this in the evening after using [[ASIN:B0019LVFSU Almond Oil]] and a soft washcloth to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> my skin is much clearer this summer than last.</li>
            <li> as no matter how much I try to lather any amount of product, I can NOT work up enough to justify calling it &amp;#34;foam.&amp;#34; I had to remove a star because since I&#x27;ve been using this, I have found it dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> The connector can be turned back to the sealed position after use, and this design really surprise me a lot</li>
            <li> (the gentle cleanser...tried the daily</li>
            <li> So far so</li>
            <li> I bought this after some Internet research on sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this isn&#x27;t abrasive.</li>
            <li> Now I use hemp oil as a natural cleanser, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its been 2 weeks and soo far no severe acne.</li>
            <li> Completely transformed the appearance and texture of my 35 year old skin.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin that reacts negatively to probably everything.</li>
            <li> ; approach worked better than carpet-bombing your skin with various harsh products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that this had a green top instead of a white one.</li>
            <li> I tried antibiotics (helped, but I don&#x27;t feel right taking antibiotics for non-dangerous diseases/conditions), various OTC face liquids/creams/pads (never really worked and dried the hell out of my face), and this product works better than all of them.</li>
            <li> One full pump is too much product for one face wash, so I only do a half pump to get the product out.</li>
            <li> After a year of this method, it&#x27;s definitely the right option for me, but everyone&#x27;s face is different</li>
            <li> After a year of this method, it&#x27;s definitely the right option for me, but everyone&#x27;s face is different</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fair to give less stars</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after using this, but clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin silky clean and never feels tight.</li>
            <li> Feels better than some other more expensive luxury brands that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I am 35 and have pimples and wrinkles this was the first product I&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t dry me out or break me out</li>
            <li> I have an oily T-zone but the rest of my skin would be considered pretty &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (not too dry and not too oily).</li>
            <li> I noticed my face was pretty dry after my showers and even had some peeling spots.</li>
            <li> : I tried using it for a month, but it would consistently cause my face to slowly dry out.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the full line of Cerave Products but lotions instead of creams (less chance of contamination)</li>
            <li> It the ingredients acid and niacin made my face super flush like beer red, dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere (Sephora, Ulta) for a nice high end cleanser and was skeptical about getting this after using my Murad cleanser.</li>
            <li> So many other cleansers that I have tried for normal to oily skin always make my face feel so tight after I wash.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out and keeps my face feelig clean, but not over dried.</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleanser that i&#x27;ve used thats actually made a difference.</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleanser that i&#x27;ve used thats actually made a difference.</li>
            <li> No more (mild) acne!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bottle, so it lasts me a fairly long time.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is large and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Having extremely oily skin, I  need something that is actually going to clean my face.</li>
            <li> Overall highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This one is a little more drying (because it&#x27;s designed for oily skin), so I only use it occasionally.  </li>
            <li> Again there are many products that say they work well with eczema, but CeraVe foaming facial cleancer with ceramides,niacinamide and hyaluronic acid does unbelievable cleansing while conditioning the skin like no other product I know on the market.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this because it was foam, and foam generally tended to dry up my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and haven&#x27;t really noticed much reduction in my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser foams nicely, is unscented and does not leave my skin dry and tight!  </li>
            <li> This cleanser successfully removes dirt, grease, and grime, but it doesn&#x27;t leave skin as dry as other face washes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Wetting the face with warm water, I apply a small amount of the cleanser with my hand and rub gently with small circular motion.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> so I will try to normal skin version next.</li>
            <li> Many people give this product a very favorable review base primarily on its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick, you really only need one pump to wash your entire face.</li>
            <li> So many other gentle cleaners are gentle but still leave makeup behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a mild acne problem and have been prone to a little razor burn as well.  </li>
            <li> Love this, its plain and simple - foaming facial cleanser without any additions.</li>
            <li> I have really mild acne, with relatively small breakouts on my forehead and chin area most commonly.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more is that the article stated that you cannot absorb methylparabens into your body past the first layer of skin (the stratum corneum), unless your skin is broken or you have some sort of skin irritation that has opened the first layer of skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other cleansers such as Cetaphil which is another mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thinner texture than other clear facial foaming cleansers I have used, and definitely does not foam as much or clean as thoroughly.</li>
            <li> but I do live in a moderate humid zone, Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> so I was back on the hunt to find new products.  </li>
            <li> I bought a NEW CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleaser from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Foams very well, lasts very long, cleans VERY well and does not leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> I no longer have dry patches and my skin feels very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> and this is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> this cleans my skin so will that I don&#x27;t have black heads, before I would have to exfoliate once a week, but since my skin is clean i only have to do it once in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, but it cleans very well</li>
            <li> it gets the makeup off and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin too much.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of different brands, including the very pricey ones, but have never had the same results.</li>
            <li> Overall I really this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old female with the acne of a 16 year old.</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves your skin soft and not dry or oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CeraVe produces only a few skin care products, but I&#x27;ve found that they&#x27;re all well formulated, fragrance free and affordable.  </li>
            <li> I have quite oily skin with light acne and this has dried up all of the regular acne and keeps me reaching for the moisturizer because it washes off the oil so well!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, but I need a thorough PM cleanser in order to completely remove my physical sunblock.</li>
            <li> the cream is soft and clear, the price is low.</li>
            <li> this may be dermatologist recommended but because its for those very sensitive facial skin people.</li>
            <li> Very soft and gentle...perfect for daily use</li>
            <li> No other facial wash leaves my skin feeling this soft!</li>
            <li> First of all, since there are currently multiple products listed on the product page, I&#x27;d like to note that this review is for the foaming facial cleanser, which I have now been using for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it&#x27;s drying out my skin, which is weird because I don&#x27;t believe there are any traditional &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
            <li> No other comment.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how clean the product gets my face.  </li>
            <li> I did read the reviews on this after trying so many other products that wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> i was told by other people that i should&#x27;ve gone for the milder version of this stuff, but a product labeled with &#x27;normal&#x27; should work for normal skin.</li>
            <li> And there is nothing I hate more than buying a product arbitrarily off the shelves, using it for two weeks, and breaking out more!</li>
            <li> particular cleanser leaves my face soft, minus any redness and has also cleared my pores.  </li>
            <li> The former is relatively more serious with a maximum health concern score of 10 which indicates a high overall hazard while the latter ingredient scored a 4.</li>
            <li> The current Amazon price is highly competitive with anything I&#x27;ve seen in local stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and such a big bottle of it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> While there are less expensive options, I&#x27;m willing to pay a little more for a non-irritating brand that gets my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and recently I experienced a bad outbreak.  </li>
            <li> Pumps out a clear liquid, rub on face, becomes white and creamy but not &#x27;foaming&#x27;</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it will last for a long time; with one daily wash it took me 6 months to finish it up.</li>
            <li> gets the job done; removes makeup, deep cleans and doesn&#x27;t strip my natural moisture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the only things my sensitive skin can handle.</li>
            <li> All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I expected too much maybe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, especially those with sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Apparently to make it foam they have to use them as the non-foaming cleaner they make is without those chemicals.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s cleaning and my face broke out from it, so I was surprised to see Cerave facial cleanser isn&#x27;t as hypoallergenic as the soap they make.</li>
            <li> I had been using an Olay foaming cleanser for sensitive skin, but my dermatologist recommended I switch to the CeraVe Foaming Facial</li>
            <li> Zoom in to the photo of the back of the product bottle to see the complete list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far its working well with a twice daily face wash.</li>
            <li> Deep cleaning and a Soft touch after...</li>
            <li> I must not have read far enough.</li>
            <li> The pimples have stopped, the blackheads are gradually clearing, my skin is soft and supple, and the premature lines around my eyes are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> Several days ago, I even discovered I could start completely skipping foundation all together</li>
            <li> B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]].</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks, and my skin has not dried out or had problems with sudden breakouts.</li>
            <li> Switching back to my old cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after using it and there&#x27;s no trace of make up left.</li>
            <li> All my teenage and adult life I have always thought that I could never use a product that was \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; or \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; because I thought I needed to massacre the bacteria that was causing my blemishes with acids, peroxides, antibiotics, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of facial cleansers over the years, but having sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t helped me to find one that both works in clearing up acne and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Even then, the absorption rate is barely 1%.</li>
            <li> B000056I89 Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, Normal to Oily Skin]], and like Cetaphil, does not strip the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t normally go out of my way to try out a lot of different facial cleansers</li>
            <li> I wear primer and makeup every day, so I normally use St. Ives Apricot Scrub (or the Walmart generic) because it&#x27;s the only thing that makes me feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> someone with once-oily and now normal skin, I find both moisturizers to be the tiniest bit heavy in all but the driest months in the Northeast, and the Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser stung at first.</li>
            <li> Haha using a facial CLEANSER instead of scrapig off the top layers of your face and expensive self tanner every day... who knew??  </li>
            <li> I was using Neutrogena and that had been working OK for me, but then it seemed to stop, or even to make my skin worse.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well as a gentle cleanser - sometimes leaves my face a little dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very fortunate not having to worry too much about it as a kid, which makes the recent ones at 26 a little confusing.</li>
            <li> My skin, for example, handles the Foaming Facial Cleanser and Hydrating Cleanser differently, as they are completely different products--one produces a light foam, while the other is a milky lotion--and both remove makeup with different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My little kids have dry skin, and this is the first lotion that they say is not sticky!!</li>
            <li> keep purchasing this product as it is less expensive but does a great job</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough on my lumpy, dry cheeks but takes the oil off of my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li> Really worth the price and half a pump will do the trick which means it last FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Only a few showed studies of being mild or low-level toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I enjoyed the product and so far, I am not aware that propylparaben cause any negative reactions to my skin.</li>
            <li> but I tend to have normal to dry and use both without any issues.</li>
            <li> There is also a cleanser for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> While this foaming cleanser is indicated for normal to oily skin, my combination, heading toward dry skin tolerates it well without that parched feeling and no sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> , I also ordered it because it has hyaluronic acid it in which lifts, I definitely recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin and want something to compliment a lifting cream!-)</li>
            <li> My face usually clears up quickly like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> When you washing with cold water after rinse it off with warm water, don&#x27;t wash your face like you did with warm water, I did massage with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing off, have a towel and just gently take off the wetness.</li>
            <li> In the daytime use the same instructions but use a high rated moisturizer as a 3rd and final step.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin that is very acne prone, and</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin that is very acne prone, and</li>
            <li> It really does blow all the other cleansers I have ever used away.</li>
            <li> Went back to oatmeal soap, 4 weeks later my skin is getting back to normal.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleanser i have ever used that didn&#x27;t leave my face tight or irritated afterward.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product, the cleanser is not as harsh on your skin as other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried such as brands of Neutrogena and Oxy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just clear soap that turns white once water is mixed with it.</li>
            <li> and I have had a lot of trouble finding a cleanser that helps even when it says it is gentle and for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry the face and you can feel your skin is cleaner.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out face.</li>
            <li> Not oily, not dry, or overly tingling like w/ Noxema products.  </li>
            <li> It cleans well and does not dry out my face.</li>
            <li> , sometimes lol, because I&#x27;m sooooooooo sensitive using it every day near my eyes mad me a little red</li>
            <li> If I run out and use another cleanser for a few days, my acne comes right back.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not thick and lathers well with just wet hands in the shower.</li>
            <li> gentle enough for everyday use on face, keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> The product from my experience only stopped acne other than that it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days so far, but I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired more expensive products thinking more money equals higher quality, but that&#x27;s not true for the CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Around the first few months, I massaged the foam with my fingers onto my face as it turned into foam once you move it circular motion.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be foamy coming out of the spout... not just foamy after you rub it all over your hands or face like normal soap.</li>
            <li> is if I neglect to use it for even 1 day my skin is noticeably worse, and it takes several days to go back to looking healthy again.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is extremely dry and you don&#x27;t need the foaming action (which I do, it&#x27;s a mental thing), then I would try the hydrating formula which is also highly rated.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin feels clean with out irritation from unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have paid over twice as much for other cleansers that promised to be non-drying and non-irritating but didn&#x27;t stand up to the promises; CeraVe delivers!</li>
            <li> 4 or so months later I was clear, and finally felt like I could take a step back and actually take care of my skin and not battle</li>
            <li> It has no crazy chemical additives that will clog pores or leave your skin dry or tight</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t dry out skin and keeps skin clear and moisturized</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin naturally and looking to dry out your acne keep moving this product is not for you.  </li>
            <li> , I still can feel my face skin is so soft, but not too dry, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> makes my face feel so soft and not at all dry will continue using this</li>
            <li> It might work for the oily skin people but for a dry skin it&#x27;s a complete NO.</li>
            <li> runs to dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> My complexion is much clearer and less dingy.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I realized a long time ago that my skin is extremely sensitive and not similar with everyone else.</li>
            <li> The first few uses actually left my skin sore.</li>
            <li> It definitely worth the price because a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This cleanser fits the bill - it removes my sunblock easily without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> , it is kind of a thick liquid that when you rub you hands together it gets slick but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old, but my dry, dull, flaky skin texture made me like ten years older, complete with an adult case of severe acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I notice that after I wash and dry my face it feels tight and I need to put a moisturizer on right away.</li>
            <li> It is not a harsh facial cleanser, but not sure how much of a difference it makes.  </li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this product, it arrived a week late and was completely busted open in the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if face washes are like toothpaste (i.e., foaming doesn&#x27;t actually DO anything), but I do like the feeling of a nice thick foam on my face.</li>
            <li> It is clear loose gel like with no scent.  </li>
            <li> and it works great at cleaning any dirt or oils (the bad oils), without leaving your face dry.</li>
            <li> are products I&#x27;ve been using to get rid of acne and repair my face from previous acne.&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser(2% Salicylic Acid) - Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control(10% Benzoyl Peroxide) - Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Skin Relief 24hr</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily, dry, occasionally acne-ridden and sensitive to everything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It is mild, but cleanses teen skin well, at least In our&lt;br /&gt;household.</li>
            <li> Background:I have oily acne prone skin, but my eyes get easily dried out as I suffer from dermatitis around the eyes during certain times of the year.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight after or like there&#x27;s a thick layer on top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, after reading into skin care for what seemed like the millionth time, I decided- for once- to look into how to treat very pale skin, rather than acne-prone skin, because I&#x27;d recently also gotten a job where I had to work 2nd shift and rarely got to see the sun.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with a very oily nose and the rest just being crazy sensitive and my previous cleanser was drying me out even more which was just horrendous.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back to using my old Noxzema cleanser in the hopes in will clear up the mess that this one caused.</li>
            <li> my physician prescribed me a pill for my acne and when i started the pill i decided to start using a new cleanser because my other one did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Stay away if you have dry skin - there is another formula by Cerave that is for normal to oily skin and won&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after I wash at night - not dry like some other brands.</li>
            <li> So far the wife loves it as it does not dry her face out like other cleansers while removing her makeup.</li>
            <li> products are chock full of high quality ingredients, void of useless fillers and preservatives and toxins and are not cheaply made yet very affordably priced.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommendable, as are all of the other products in the CeraVe line!</li>
            <li> I usually get dry, tight skin with most face washes but this face wash leaves my skin feeling</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product dispenses as a clear gel and when combined with a wet face lathers up into a foam.</li>
            <li> Although I have oily skin, this actually results in less of an oily feel, despite being highly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> As other say, leaves your face noticably clean without excessive tightness.</li>
            <li> Gentle, no strong smell, and my skin has improved since I started using it last June.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with all the other sensitive skin washes including like cetaphil and such.</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out due to adult acne recently.</li>
            <li> So since then my acne as cleared up significantly, but now I&#x27;m struggling from the scars left behind.</li>
            <li> With little water, it foams a decent amount.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few days and face looked blotchy and older and stopped using it and back to Ivory.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and makes your skin feel really clean.</li>
            <li> This is unlike any of the other clear, foaming face washes I have used.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin which can react to scents and other soap additives.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that would break out when using any other cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it cleans, because it doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;detergenty&amp;#34; as the other face washes.</li>
            <li> I was getting adult acne due to hormonal changes, I believe.  </li>
            <li> of what I&#x27;m saying above is not only keep your facial skin dry from the winter, but actually will keep moisturizing your skin as well.</li>
            <li> I use this about 3 times a week, alternating with their Hydrating cleanser, it&#x27;s gentle and does not leave your face feeling tight or dry.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference over the past few months.</li>
            <li> At first I though my acne was related to my diet - it was too late when I singled out that my continued used of this product was the culprit.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin or make it feel dry.  </li>
            <li> Funny too because I never break out due to a course of Accutane a few years back.  </li>
            <li> although i like it, but i have to be honest that this one does make my cheek areas and around my eye brows dry in the WINTER or COLD Weather.</li>
            <li> I apply it with a small buffing pad and gently cleanse my face each night.</li>
            <li> I used to have much oilier skin, but it still has the capacity to slick up.  </li>
            <li> I guess my oil slick face is just too much for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Occasionally dries my faces for some strange reason</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Proactiv fan, but recently it seems like my acne has grown immune to it</li>
            <li> It lasts a long tim too, you only need a pea to dime size amount.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it just made my face breakout more especially my forehead which was never really a problem area before.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars because the pump on mine did not last as long as the wash inside.</li>
            <li> My fiance has even been convinced several times now that I have been wearing foundation when I have not worn it for a long while</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if other things haven&#x27;t worked in the past.</li>
            <li> it did not clear, I still would get blemishes and same oily skin.</li>
            <li> But alas, it was true.</li>
            <li> I spent the better part of my teenage years and young adulthood constantly fighting breakouts, acne, blotchiness and an overall bad complexion.</li>
            <li> i have bad acne and my skin is super oily in some parts but super dry in others and reacts to even the slightest perfumes or anything!</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and limited break outs, but black heads on my nose have always been an issue.</li>
            <li> Before I was getting huge blind pimples on the regular and I was using neutrogena and organic face wash.</li>
            <li> This left my face extremely dry and parched feeling.</li>
            <li> Left my face dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Made my skin so dry and flaky causing an eczema break out and a lot of red itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Especially when I wake in the morning, I do not have that flaky dry patches all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Left my skin way too dry even though I use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Less breakouts and hydrated soft skin.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, but at the same doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> This is my makeup along with generic Aveeno lotion for the dry areas around my face and neck and to blend in the Clearisil.</li>
            <li> But when I got it, I seriously doubt it was a second hand because the bottle was already open and the liquid was spilled in the plastic bag making the bottle very sticky.</li>
            <li> If you do not have oily skin (especially if you have dry skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with dry patches along my jawline and forehead.</li>
            <li> Dry forehead gone, dewy appearance back!</li>
            <li> Gave me instant whiteheads near my nose and dried out my lips for some reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use this and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dried out.  </li>
            <li> but it hurts to rub my eyes, my skin is just super thin now....</li>
            <li> I got hard red rashes on my face and had to calm it down by putting oatmeal on it for weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin did feel a little tight after use, just like with the SA line, but not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li> Then, I washed it off with warm water (not hot water) 12 times until I could not feel the oily feeling and washed it off with cold water.</li>
            <li> then got a rotating facial brush and used CeraVe with that, thinking if I applied by a different method other than my fingers, I could probably see some results.</li>
            <li> If I had run into my current dermatologist earlier, I would have such less scarring...</li>
            <li> Compare to that, I felt like this cerave does not clean my face completely...</li>
            <li> Just half a pump should lather up enough to wash your entire face, meaning the bottle will last for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> so it was hard for me to find one that worked really well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first wash, I was a little disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t a magical cure, but the itch wasn&#x27;t as pronounced.</li>
            <li> The foaming cleanser does what it says, completely cleans my face without making it feel tight or overly dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure of this because when I use a cotton pad and clarifying solution, I would get a dirty pad after I&#x27;m done - but not if I used another stronger cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin broke out more and still felt dirty every time I used it.</li>
            <li> My wife must use this product to wash her face, and other CeraVe products to wash her body due to a severe nickel and perfume allergy that she developed just three years ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently developed a lot of trouble with allergic dermetittis around my eyes.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cleanser keeps my face from looking oily all day long.  </li>
            <li> I think im going to stick with this 1 for the long run.</li>
            <li> Not much is needed, so it should last awhile.  </li>
            <li> Note to always be careful about not getting regular shampoo on your face in the shower, It will screw up your face.</li>
            <li> I used cetaphil for a long time then was turned on to this stuff</li>
            <li> I have used in a long time will buy this all the time from now on</li>
            <li> I am only going to finish the product because I don&#x27;t like wasting a product, and I have spent money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how i went without it for so long.</li>
            <li> Give it a whirl, it lasts quite a long time too...</li>
            <li> ITs not over drying or harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The hubby got this to replace the Neutrogena he was using for a long time and loves it.  </li>
            <li> but I used to work for a few different prestige cosmetic brands including Chanel, Benefit, and Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> May make your face a little dry but that is fixed with some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Got this a little while ago because my old acne products would dry out my skin</li>
            <li> My skin normally has small breakouts here and there, and I have definitely had less of that since starting to use this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I use CeraVe&#x27;s morning and night moisturizers and that completely fixes the slight drying this wash causes for me!</li>
            <li> very frustrated but heard great things about CeraVe</li>
            <li> I was left with rough, itchy, dry skin that was also sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li> It does not foam and is really thick and does not go on easily in the least.</li>
            <li> I mean the whole family.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews on products, but I was very disappointed with the outcome and honestly hope no one else has to deal with the same thing I did.</li>
            <li> Specifically, in the article entitled \\&quot;Final amended report on the safety assessment of Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Isopropylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, and Benzylparaben as used in cosmetic products.\\&quot; (located in the PubMed database), Methylparabens were known to slightly increase the estrogenic activity of breast cancer cells in vitro (aka: in a test tube), but the activity was significantly less than estradiol has on breast cancer cells, which is a naturally occuring hormone in our bodies.</li>
            <li> I love using it morning and night because it NEVER makes my skin feel tight, dry, or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Feels very clean and doesn&#x27;t have artificial colors/</li>
            <li> I like this brand and use several of their other products.</li>
            <li> so now I just Aveno or other facial wash for face.  </li>
            <li> other pimples, they got smaller too.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser and follow up with the moisturizing cream, its like heaven on your face after a long day!</li>
            <li> Even if Kiel&#x27;s brought that other soap back, I&#x27;d continue to use cerave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly more expensive, but we&#x27;re talking about your face here!  </li>
            <li> My teenage son swears by the soap and won&#x27;t use any other for his face</li>
            <li> While other cleansers caused severe irritation such as extreme redness or red bumps, this one did not.</li>
            <li> , I thought maybe it was because of travel and different water types and other factors</li>
            <li> I had acne as a teen, and I was left with the red pigmentation, some pits, and also unbelievable oiliness on my forehead and nose, and sometime even on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> We switched to this facial cleanser and/or Netragena due to&lt;br /&gt;developing allergic reactions to had been used for a couple&lt;br /&gt;of years.</li>
            <li> I like the fact I can see the soapy foam on my face and it works extremely well with my facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> My other cleansers have left it somewhat duty.</li>
            <li> I now use this in the morning and moisturize with a little Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizing Face Lotion, and use Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Cleanser facial wash at night.</li>
            <li> My eye makeup in particular is hardly touched - and I&#x27;m not using anything waterproof.</li>
            <li> Other facial cleansers have the tendency of making my face incredibly dry and makes my face oily by mid-day.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for a long long time!!</li>
            <li> I think my face is too dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin as I notice</li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;m not experiencing a reaction my skin is so dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> When I use it my face does not feel dry and that is an accomplishment.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
            <li> Some would dry up my face, some would not control achne at all and some were just too pricy.</li>
            <li> You can use it dry too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over dry the skin.</li>
            <li> Medications make my skin dry and rashy.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that can go from dry as the sahara dessert to greasier than the BP oil spill.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with dry skin though as it did dry out mine</li>
            <li> So my skin became so dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t to dry and not itchy.</li>
            <li> hydrating and no any feels of dry after washing face.</li>
            <li> and I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It evens my skin without leaving it too moist or dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is a mixture, oily some places, dry in others, and acne prone all over.</li>
            <li> I have had acne prone and dry skin all of my life.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face either</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t aggravate my acne when I had a lot of acne, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face</li>
            <li> Yes, this thing will dry out your face if you use it too often like all cleansers because that&#x27;s the nature of cleansers.</li>
            <li> but my cheeks at times are dry.  </li>
            <li> For someone with dry skin this did not work well.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you will want to use the one that is the hydrating cleanser.</li>
            <li> On the flip side this hasn&#x27;t made my skin dry</li>
            <li> My face gets dry and flaky in the winter and allot of products will give me a breakout, since I have been using this</li>
            <li> so I continued to use it for maybe two or even three weeks, but my face was so dry, so flaky and so itchy that I knew it had to be the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Does not over dry even while clearing acne.</li>
            <li> I have oily yet dry skin, and I also break out.</li>
            <li> this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry my face out to yet cleans it well… even with my make-up on.</li>
            <li> After rinsing well, I pat dry.  </li>
            <li> after I wash my face with this, I let it dry by itself, use some ALCOHOL-FREE Toner, wait for 5 mins.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my skin get dry.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t leave my face too dry.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry out your face, helps with acne, and keeps the face hydrated.</li>
            <li> It takes off makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry at all afterwards.</li>
            <li> If my face does start to feel dry, I use their moisturizer and that product is also a must buy.</li>
            <li> I have struggle for years with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my face, which is usually dry, feels greasy after I wash with this.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not prone to breaking out, nor am i prone to dry or flaky skin.</li>
            <li> It is making me somewhat dry however,</li>
            <li> I had gone to the dermatologist about some dry skin</li>
            <li> After using the lotion my dry skin cleared up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin extremely dry</li>
            <li> Always i feel dry when i put it in face.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for you if you have a dry skin i don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This has singlehandely fixed the dots on my upper arms or at least reduced them.</li>
            <li> The same active ingredient as Phisoderm, but this soap is nicer.</li>
            <li> My acne is all gone and no new acne is popping up.</li>
            <li> In just one week my face is clearer and no new blemishes have appeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a single issue.</li>
            <li> I use it after my makeup remover, and I don&#x27;t have to use it every single day.</li>
            <li> The cleanser itself is quite good, but it was packed so badly, that half the bottle had leaked by time I got it, and it had leaked out of its plastic bag to damage other items in the package as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is dark brown, and I am a male.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne my entire life, and at 28, I was finally tired of using the same old acne treatments that did not seem to fully control my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed..</li>
            <li> It is the only face wash I have ever used on my dry, acne-prone skin that did not irritate my skin, nor leave it stinging, tight, and dry.</li>
            <li> Plus, it lasts a long time, because it takes just a little bit to wash the entire face.  </li>
            <li> I look 80 years younger, past embryo stage, into a single cell contained in a carbon based life form of similar deoxyribonucleic</li>
            <li> I have been using it for one year and honestly, for the other 29 years of my life I must have been a total idiot.</li>
            <li> It felt dry and tight and my forehead became extra shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it as a second cleanser after oil cleansing to remove makeup, and it manages to remove the oil without making my skin dry or tight.</li>
            <li> I have not had dry face skin!  </li>
            <li> Prior to this cleanser, I used Boscia&#x27;s Detoxifying Black Cleanser.</li>
            <li> other benefit is, if I use it at night before going to sleep, I don&#x27;t wake up the next day with oily skin - which was an issue with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering for years with rough, itchy, dry skin on my forearms.</li>
            <li> I only got half a bottle of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too rough on the skin and doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li> Once your skin got enough moist, it will secrete less oil.</li>
            <li> I have very pale and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> --I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and I see no need to spend a ridiculous amount of money on high end cleansers.</li>
            <li> Pure Tea Tree Oil + FREE Acne Fighting Blemish Roll-on Stick with Tea Tree Oil]] dries out bad oils!</li>
            <li> Most face cleansers dry my face out quite badly.</li>
            <li> It feels great when I wash my skin with it, but immediately after washing my face become so dry and flaky and looks absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Used a ton of face washes and these sensitive ones tend to produce the least dry skin.</li>
            <li> After I pat dry my face, I follow with a few sprays of facial toner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not very foamy, only slightly.</li>
            <li> There is no film left on my skin, and does not leave my skin feeling tight.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my skin is so unbelievable soft!  </li>
            <li> Afterward, it left my face so dry that it felt like my face wanted to stretch from being so stiff.</li>
            <li> I thought that it seemed like soap because it makes little soap-like bubbles (the \\&quot;Foaming\\&quot; in the Facial Cleanser), but it is not!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is a little tougher I do only use the tea tree oil for extremes.</li>
            <li> When I use it I don’t break out, I don’t even get a little red in the cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face twice daily for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on your skin, but tough on dirt.</li>
            <li> Cleans face but is extremely drying - buyer beware if you already have dry skin.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like a lot of other cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Anything with a fragrace or other effects really isn&#x27;t worth it for everyday use, they just dry your skin out or worse irritate it.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with this, my skin got red, dry and very tight.</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin but am not a fan of creamy cleansers that are typically recommended for dry skin - they feel like they are leaving a greasy film.  </li>
            <li> None of the ingredients in CeraVe are great for you, but again none of them are terrible.</li>
            <li> We tried the traditional teenage washes- Neutrogina, Noxema, Oxy, but her skin is sensative and she complained of burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different medicated face wash for acne and it really dried my skin, so</li>
            <li> Not much dryness out here.  </li>
            <li> I put it on a damp (not soaking wet) face, with damp (not soaking wet) hands.</li>
            <li> Been only using this wash for a few weeks</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no reason for me to even waste my time any further this foam.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> wash never really felt like it was spreading or even on my face</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any specific benefits to my skin but am continuing to use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> A FEW DAYS LATER</li>
            <li> This is my everyday facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> While this cleanser may not have much in the way of novelty, it is dependable and gets the job done without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> For years my skin has been blotchy, red, and uneven.</li>
            <li> It has not made me break out, but has not really helped my acne either.</li>
            <li> last a few months even when used daily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work, thus, quite messy</li>
            <li> I use this and then exfoliate with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> Not really &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I also have acne and my acne started clearing after a week of use (using twice a day, everyday) with no further breakouts.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never really had skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a few days</li>
            <li> I spent tons of money on Tom Ford, Chanel, La Mer, etc etc for face washes until one lost suitcase landed me in a Walgreens picking up this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one few recent health/personal/beauty products that I purchased from amazon based on user reviews and ratings!</li>
            <li> For all the synthetic ingredients in the cleanser, you&#x27;d think they would add a few that allowed it to actually suds</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds/thousands of dollars trying to repair and get clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;Tried</li>
            <li> Have lotions only after cleaning my face using this product, within 2 hours the most annoying pimple at my front side of eye was</li>
            <li> A little expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> Within a hour of use, my skin looked greasy plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I found that it was not strong enough to keep my acne away.</li>
            <li> Last winter I wound up with ezcema on my forehead due to the harsh weather.  </li>
            <li> If i used one and not the other the results may not be as expected.</li>
            <li> This cleanser started out okay, but after a few days of using it, my skin started to dry out really bad</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t feel clean, and it caused my skin to break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> My skin feels less dry</li>
            <li> and my skin is less dry.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way too</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m going to try the hydrating cleanser because this makes my skin feel a little tight afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely has dried my skin out, so I use it less.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out; it also doesn&#x27;t dry out you skin leaving that tight feeling after you wash your face.</li>
            <li> I seem to be in the minority when it comes to this face wash because after I wash it off, it leaves my face feeling really dry and tight.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my face and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and dry after use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry you out and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight after washing.</li>
            <li> created red, painful blotches on my face the very first time.  </li>
            <li> other words it kills the skin cells on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Other product made my skin get over-sensitive.</li>
            <li> When you wash your face it will not irritate or burn your eyes like other cleansers do.</li>
            <li> so I go around that every other day</li>
            <li> Causes small white heads, which I never got before.</li>
            <li> Not exactly &#x27;foaming&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I think I will buy other products from this brand now.</li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;m looking at their other products as well.</li>
            <li> Just like ProActiv and other products, once you stop using it you begin to break out again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to the ratings and neglected to view the ingredients....</li>
            <li> But sometimes the extreme dryness was just too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> used 1 other product from crave and have not been bothered by it at all.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I kept breaking out (two or three pimples) even after using this product consistently for a month.</li>
            <li> After using this product twice a day (usually during my morning shower and before bed), I noticed that my skin was smoother and pimped faded after only a day or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten my aesthetician to start recommending it to other clients</li>
            <li> She now cannot wait to try the other CeraVe products.</li>
            <li> I am going to try some other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things in the past to no avail, but this combination has finally provided results.</li>
            <li> I still get the occasional breakout (usually around my time of the month)</li>
            <li> so now I switched to the other formula because I have no oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other comments.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> I have moderately to extremely oily face</li>
            <li> I get the same amount of pimples, albeit not many.</li>
            <li> I recommend the other cleanser</li>
            <li> She had no such complaint with CeraVe, and after a week, her skin only has a few blemishes.</li>
            <li> Just two days of using this instead of the OTC facewashes, and no more white heads!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why it says foaming, because it&#x27;s just like a regular gel type cleanser.</li>
            <li> You only need to use small amount.</li>
            <li> Agree with other that is dries my skin.  </li>
            <li> It also caused small pimples to develop on my nose, especially on the creases of my nose.</li>
            <li> I use it maybe one every two weeks if my skin is feeling a little dry</li>
            <li> There is a bit of dryness here and there but very minimal.  </li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t use it everyday and alternate with this because it isn&#x27;t as harsh.  </li>
            <li> Almost all of them contain either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient to combat a breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several, including some prescription ones from my dermatologist but nothing seemed to tame the acne beast within!  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful because a lot of exfoliators are so harsh on the skin that they can actually open up small microscopic sores that bacteria nestles inside of and creates acne.  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and a very hard time finding products that work for me.</li>
            <li> There is no strong odor to the cleanser and does not leave a dry or film on the skin.</li>
            <li> Yet despite it, I continued to get a lot of breakouts, my skin was constantly peeling, and I got black heads like crazy no matter how much I tried to prevent them.</li>
            <li> especially not proactiv, other common drug store cleansers, or what a dermatologist prescribed me.</li>
            <li> Did the bumps all over my arms feel less sharp or was that just in my head?</li>
            <li> In fact, it foams up LESS than other face washes that DON&#x27;T advertise the foaming effect.</li>
            <li> I actually had very *sensitive* skin (as pale skin is usually considered) and all the acne treatments were just aggravating it and making it worse.</li>
            <li> I usually have very oily tough skin and tons of acne.</li>
            <li> But I find it hard to go back to this because it truly is average in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I went to my dermatologist to get another prescription for Doryx because I was starting to break out pretty bad and the Acanya couldn&#x27;t keep up.</li>
            <li> Product should last at least 4 months, one squirt each morning and night.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth the price.</li>
            <li> has made a noticeable improvement on the dark shading around my eyes.</li>
            <li> CeraVe has suddenly become the holy grail skin care product lately</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an average product which although did not work for me, could work for you.</li>
            <li> There is no smell, so I can see it as a perk and negative at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have used Purpose Gentle Facial Cleansing Wash for a few years but notice around the cold fall/winter days</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with blackheads and never kind find the proper product.</li>
            <li> Wet my face then apply wait a few then rinse.</li>
            <li> The CeraVe Foaming, just one use, the one pimple, most annoying one located at my eye side is gone now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive, acne-prone skin and was hoping I might have found that secret weapon to solve my problem...</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m down to at least 25% left, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m even going to bother with the rest.</li>
            <li> So oily that the oil runs down in his eyes.  </li>
            <li> Been using for about 2.5 year, hasn&#x27;t let me down yet..</li>
            <li> I even tried to use it again after my skin calmed down and would react again to it.</li>
            <li> Some of the liquid even got out of the plastic bag and got on the other items I have in the UPS box making them sticky too!</li>
            <li> I am over 30 and still get spots, tried lots of other scrubs and cleansers and they cleared my skin a little</li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin and some of the face soaps I&#x27;ve used tend to dry it out because I usually use products that treat acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scentless, which works fine as I hate the artificial smelling goop I normally get with other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very gentle and suds up well with a small amount, and while a bit expensive, lasts me for around 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin</li>
            <li> In addition, I feel that my skin is less oily throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this less than a month ago.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use this product from my Dermatologist about a year and half ago.</li>
            <li> so when i saw it on amazon for less than $10</li>
            <li> For example, if you one of your previous cleanser did not performance up to your expectation, you should try to find out the source, perhaps compare ingredient of the two products.</li>
            <li> My skin gets quite oily but I&#x27;ve noticed that after using it for a while my skin has been less oily.</li>
            <li> It has my skin feeling smoother and softer and with less bumps than before.</li>
            <li> Well within a week and a half i had a slight acne breakout.  </li>
            <li> The scars from my slight breakout also lightened up.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I started using it, I&#x27;ve seen the frequency/severity of my breakouts slightly reduced.  </li>
            <li> : I saw results in less than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> - my skin is much less oily and my acne is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less concerned than I would be over a cream or lotion that sits and soaks in to my body all</li>
            <li> /&gt;-makes slight foam when rubbed with water and hands</li>
            <li> and if you get an&lt;br /&gt;auto-subscription it&#x27;s even less.</li>
            <li> I have had black heads on my nose for years.</li>
            <li> I use Jack Black in the morning shower</li>
            <li> This formula produces a slight lather and rinses without any residue.  </li>
            <li> Half the price for the amount you get as well.</li>
            <li> So I just bought this item and when I put it on it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling stiff like how other lotions leave my face feeling</li>
            <li> Before using this product when I wake up in the morning my skin is an oily mess it would look like somebody took bacon grease and  slathered it all over my face.</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s facial cleansers often contain fragrance and other potentially irritating ingredients.  </li>
            <li> My acne and skin was so messed up from years of abusing it with harsh chemicals like benzyl peroxide and other harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li> I had acne on the low end of moderately bad on my forehead mainly, but also somewhat on my face.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me and made my skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> For further information involving SMART skin care (no &#x27;bro-science&#x27;) go to reddit&#x27;s skin care addiction subreddit: [...]</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the skin too tight.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t feel tight after using this product.</li>
            <li> My face does not feel tight after I finishing cleansing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too tight either.</li>
            <li> This cleans without stripping my skin, so my skin does not feel tight after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hardly ever had a zit, breakout or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling a little tight but I prefer that over feeling oily.</li>
            <li> My only complaint it that I assumed this came out of the nozzle AS foam (as some products I have used in the past), but it does not.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel not clean my face.</li>
            <li> Contains ingredients to help with dark spots as well!</li>
            <li> My face felt a little cleaner afterwards, but the Cetaphil face</li>
            <li> and I do have a little acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been off birth control for a little over a year (wacked out hormones)</li>
            <li> Using that little sample bottle for a week got me hooked.</li>
            <li> Used alone it may be a little too drying, but as part of a routine it manages to get rid of impurities without damaging my skin barrier.</li>
            <li> a little bit greasy...hard to rinse it off...</li>
            <li> So I stopped washing my face and it helped a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> It also stings the eye if a little gets in your eye.</li>
            <li> I have seen little if any foaming.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I ran out of cetaphil and found it on Amazon for cheaper than what i paid for a little bottle of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> have crazy sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotta say it&#x27;s tough to imagine going back to something with abrasive chemicals or microbeads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of cleansers and have settled on expensive cleansers, such as Dermalogica with minimal success.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It can takes the makeup away if you didn&#x27;t applied too heavy or waterproof mascara and eyeline.</li>
            <li> This product cleans your face just as well as those harsh bead-filled face washes but without the sting or tightness afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use it with an Olay cleansing spin brush a few nights a week.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or messy.  </li>
            <li> Totally dried out my face which led to the overproduction of sebum to compensate for the dryness which in turn led to the emergence of severe acne.</li>
            <li> use everyday without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> After a few seconds, the form disappears, but the stuff is still on your face.</li>
            <li> I have an oily T-zone with a tendency to break out on my forehead and this stuff has definitely helped in controlling my oil and cleansing my face without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> After I started using this everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear heavy eye makeup</li>
            <li> Wish I had started using this years ago instead of harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li> I also experience harsh tingling and redness.  </li>
            <li> Almost worse than my teen acne.  </li>
            <li> , it contains collagen, green tea &amp; glycolic acid</li>
            <li> I have been using the foaming facial cleanser for approximately 1.5 years now.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is not too harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the feel of my skin after just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I like the product as I&#x27;ve been using it for over quite a few years, but, the pumping mechanism on this bottle was non-operational.  </li>
            <li> I keep this facewash in the shower and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Works well, and not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost every product I have tried has either dried my skin out or caused breakouts, even Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> and I start to shed dead skin like a snake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper than any B&amp;M (Brick and Mortar) store.</li>
            <li> It turns out I was using products that were too harsh.</li>
            <li> This face wash dried out my skin and gave it a shiny appearance.</li>
            <li> I wear heavy makeup while I&#x27;m a work</li>
            <li> I would see dirty skin cells, and little white heads that would usually be washed away when I used a regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pale by nature anyway.</li>
            <li> Bonus: so much cheaper than expensive Boscia!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helped minimize my breakouts and eliminate the need for creams and other thick, greasy chemicals</li>
            <li> No strong smell.</li>
            <li> Not easy to wash off the remains but acceptable.</li>
            <li> After a long day, I would use it to wash up, only to find my face still oily and dirty.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past few months.</li>
            <li> If your skin tends to develop those awful white, under the skin, bumps / pustules with most washes and lotions, you know how frustrating the search for a non-irritating wash and lotion can be.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that awful tight feeling after washing your face, removes makeup pretty well, and leaves my face feeling hydrated!!!</li>
            <li> I slathered some raw honey all over my face to sooth the soreness.</li>
            <li> I also wear a ridiculous amount of makeup (toner, foundation, concealer, powder, blush, thick black cat eyes, etc) and it takes it all off in one wash which is also something I don&#x27;t see from other products (except for Shu Uemura&#x27;s oil washes).</li>
            <li> I have never had a product make my face break out that badly that fast.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed and stopped use after only a couple days.</li>
            <li> dermatologist suggested that I use the CeraVe moisturizer years ago, which I have been, but the hydrating face wash next to it was all wrong for me</li>
            <li> Just after a few days of use I am hooked!</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Diagnosed rosacea with acne, as of late Aveeno Naturals with fever few hasn&#x27;t been working as well.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a bit small so beware.</li>
            <li> or so I started seeing a dermatologist for it, after years of trying out different expensive products not suited to my age or skin type.</li>
            <li> but no more then that.</li>
            <li> No more spending tons of $$ on cleansers for this gal.</li>
            <li> I usually also have a pinkish/red complexion but this has also cleared that up.</li>
            <li> try to use it twice a day, but usually just once in the shower</li>
            <li> btw not sure if I like the idea of parabans in my face wash</li>
            <li> I usually use this beforehand</li>
            <li> I just need to use a small amount</li>
            <li> but once I hit young adulthood, my face decided to go crazy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on department store brands!</li>
            <li> I have tried it all in the past - prescription and</li>
            <li> I usually apply it in the shower, leaving on for 2-3 minutes before washing it off.  </li>
            <li> I often get small groups of pimples by my eyebrows and also around my mouth and in the creases on each side of my nose.</li>
            <li> and I have no more flakes after I wash my face and apply face cream</li>
            <li> Hmm, not sure at the moment.</li>
            <li> I was just getting tired of my acne prone skin despite thousands spent on prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful how companies put so many harmful toxic &amp; carcinogenic substances in their products &amp; then say it &amp;#34;helps restore and maintain&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The pump drips all over the counter when it is taken out of the bottle when I pour a small amount into my palm, not to mention the wastefulness.  </li>
            <li> And I thought that by my 30s I would have no more skin issues-</li>
            <li> I will update this review in a few weeks with an update!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I switch from my expensive Boscia facial cleanser to this</li>
            <li> Unbelievable value considering the quality and quantity of the product.</li>
            <li> My acne came back worse than it had been in years after I used this!</li>
            <li> usual, Amazon has the product cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Two washes while just scrubbing with my fingers, gets my mascara and my serious smoky eyeshadow off, leaving behind minimal residue on my toner soaked cotton swab afterwards.</li>
            <li> That was the only other product I could tolerate and bummed when I couldn&#x27;t get it anymore (or only at an outrageous price)  </li>
            <li> I was afraid this cleanser would make my face feel dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> However I did notice I broken out slightly for a week after switching but that has gone away.  </li>
            <li> Never drying, irritating, or tight feeling.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it made my skin dry!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a cleanser to do either of those things, so I have not switched.</li>
            <li> Switching products every few days is really hard on your face and can make things much worse.</li>
            <li> so I wash my face at least twice a day with this wash, sometimes 3 times depending on what I did that day.</li>
            <li> and I must say my skin has improved by at least 90%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something without the microbeads since the research found them in our lakes and ponds negatively impacting our fish</li>
            <li> When I got it I expected it to be a foam pump that pumps out foam, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I use it with Complex 15 Moisturizing Face Cream.</li>
            <li> Well at least to a newbie skincare person like me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People with oily skin must try this product at least once.</li>
            <li> But, this stuff sucks every bit of moisture out of my face.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face at least once a day in the shower</li>
            <li> , Water at least didn&#x27;t make it worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from seborrheic dermatitis on my face/nose, this facial cleanser has done wonders.  </li>
            <li> day at the salon, as I was desperately trying to relieve the itching without appearing diseased, a woman in the chair next to me suggested I try CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser on my arms.</li>
            <li> and she hasn&#x27;t complained since.</li>
            <li> Try it for three days at least.</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients are dermatologist recommended, at least recommended by mine.</li>
            <li> , Water at least didn&#x27;t make it worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel obligated to leave a comment to counteract the negative review discussing that this product contains methylparabens and claims that it is a carcinogen.</li>
            <li> and my skin is slowly healing.</li>
            <li> Dried me out and made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> I pump this really thick cleanser and have to add water before I can use it.</li>
            <li> I assume it is a slow moving</li>
            <li> I mean... the cost savings alone...</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> Everything, and I mean, everything irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; cleansers, like Cetaphil, that didn&#x27;t work with my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with an oily t-zone which becomes pretty terrible in the Arizona summers; but within a few months of using this product I have noticed (as well as friends and family)</li>
            <li> If you have serious skin problems, no cleanser will fix them.  </li>
            <li> I would seriously consider repurchasing.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> My face went through a random burst of acne a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I have to say it was a not good experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I have struggled in the past with dry skin and breakouts, a horrible combo, but since switching from St. Ives and Aveeno to CeraVe&#x27;s foaming cleanser twice a dry, my skin is hydrated and radiant with no breakouts!</li>
            <li> I have never had terrible skin but always  problems with slight breakouts, dark spots, closed comedones.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has literally restored my skin back to what it was...before it was leathery, flaky, dry, disgusting piece of poop.</li>
            <li> About two or three weeks go, I finally got sick of it all.</li>
            <li> , my skin was crazy oily and just a mess.</li>
            <li> what a waste of time and money!!!</li>
            <li> Cleanses without stripping and irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> This has been a game changer for me.  </li>
            <li> I used it for about 3 weeks and my skin just got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> It did not seem to make my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> my forehead has broken out more.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out from using this product but it is rather drying.  </li>
            <li> At night wash with this cleanser (does not foam for me which is unimportant).</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, my acne has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and had leaked all over the box.</li>
            <li> Non irritating.</li>
            <li> Although I always purchase eyemakeup removers, I hate the hassle of that extra step.</li>
            <li> The nozzle to my face wash was broken off, causing the pump to not work.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Not over drying and irritating combination skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, Mother Nature can have a very strange sense of humor giving us wrinkles AND zits!  :(  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a decrease in mini random pimples popping up since using this, but I must state that I don&#x27;t have serious acne issues.</li>
            <li> I was having random acne issues and grew tired of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the market for acne and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> It was a clear fragrance-free gel (doesn&#x27;t smell horrible at all, just unscented) that foams well.</li>
            <li> I have the WORST sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it makes me face feel tight :(</li>
            <li> I read reviews for this cleanser before purchasing it, and I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> If I have bad acne at the time I usually get a bit of baking soda, add water to it, and apply to my face.</li>
            <li> in the pic all irritats my face ,what a waste :(</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have the usual harsh nasty crap in it which typically contain two dozen syllables per word.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t drying at all, and doesn&#x27;t foam so much to be annoying and messy over my pedestal sink.</li>
            <li> its been a month shy since i bought this product</li>
            <li> This is really annoying and gives me a bad impression of the company, that they use such cheapy bottles.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately from time to time I do still get a blemish.</li>
            <li> I suppose I could have turned it the wrong way, but I did not force it</li>
            <li> weird texture, smell, doesnt do anything for my acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> I probably ordered the wrong product</li>
            <li> cleansers/moisturizers don&#x27;t have to be expensive to work.</li>
            <li> Why aren&#x27;t these cancer causing chemicals illegal?</li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive face wash when this stuff does the trick at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Expensive though</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is also unsettling.</li>
            <li> Even the expensive organic stuff from Kiehls.</li>
            <li> Mediocre makeup removing capabiity.  </li>
            <li> I had tried a cetaphil cleanser and was NOT impressed.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately some ingredient in this product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing helped, and I would frequently be miserable enough to slather myself with Cortaid to stop the itching, and then Vaseline to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> After suffering from the worst year of acne, I finally saw my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> You will be addicted!</li>
            <li> May be i choose the wrong one</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t look dirty; but I would find out when I looked closely in the mirror or a magnifier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this one in this cold weather.</li>
            <li> I used to use Cetaphil, but it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me anymore.  </li>
            <li> Not too expensive!</li>
            <li> AND WAS MAD AT MYSELF.</li>
            <li> negative is that the packaging job is terrible.</li>
            <li> Caused whiteheads, somehow it interfered with every shaving product I tried to use, made shaving impossible,.</li>
            <li> but I think this&#x27;s impossible, unless it has oil moisturizers like &amp;#34;Dove.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> After a bad breakout that would never go away</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne at all</li>
            <li> I get some really bad acne at times and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad. :</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to exfoliate every day, it&#x27;s bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> As if it takes off all the bad stuff</li>
            <li> I used for about 2 weeks and broke out fairly bad and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let the bad reviews about it not removing makeup deter you because it does not claim to be a makeup reviewer anywhere on it&#x27;s label.</li>
            <li> This product broke my face out so bad.</li>
            <li> I even felt bad donating it to the women&#x27;s shelter in my community</li>
            <li> But after having a baby, I broke out in bad eczema everywhere including my face and neck</li>
            <li> Some of these are incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m still ugly. :(</li>
            <li> it made me break out :(</li>
            <li> Did not work for me well :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started using it based on others&#x27; reviews and have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I doubt you’re be disappointed.</li>
            <li> my skin has gone all crazy!  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me! :(</li>
            <li> I strayed from Alpha Hydrox (wash) and Oil of Olay (lotion) to try Cerave products and (unfortunately) have had terrible luck with them.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work with my skin :(</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m quite disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> And if you think something might be wrong, don&#x27;t give this product the benefit of the doubt just because your derm recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so annoying when it comes to face wash since I have oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I hate it with a passion.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t have as bad of an acne problem as I do, but the acne he did have was remedied by just this step alone!  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t have as bad of an acne problem as I do, but the acne he did have was remedied by just this step alone!  </li>

            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t too terrible</li>
            <li> terrible!</li>
            <li> every paraben and sulfate ever invented is in this stuff - horrible.</li>
            <li> Had terrible breakouts when i started using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible when using an orbital machine...</li>
            <li> my t-zone dries quite terribly</li>
            <li> I had to scrub at my cheeks with a rag which is terrible for your skin because it can cause wrinkles.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent. I noticed that my skin looked smoother after using it for a short while (maybe a couple weeks or so). I have not found anything else in this price range that I have ever liked better. Highly recommended. In general, I would say, CeraVe&#x27;s skin products are very good.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works well, and takes off most makeup (with the exception of waterproof).  My skin normally has small breakouts here and there, and I have definitely had less of that since starting to use this cleanser.  I just think it leaves my face cleaner than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> Brilliant cleanser that I purchased at the recommendation of my dermatologist. I use this with the CeraVe AM and in the evening CeraVe PM and my acne prone skin is soothed and healed.</li>
            <li> I like this brand and use several of their other products. I was happy to find their facial cleanser. This is a good quality product, effective yet gentle.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best product lines around, and the foaming facial cleanser is not without exception. I used only CeraVe products, and I use this cleanser with my Clarisonic to remove my makeup at night. I use the hydrating cleanser in the morning. My skin is happy! The product isn&#x27;t drying at all, and doesn&#x27;t foam so much to be annoying and messy over my pedestal sink. It does a superior job at removing eye makeup (even without using the Clarisonic), and definitely leaves my skin feeling both soft and clean at the end of the day. It is gentle as well!</li>
            <li> I guess its ok... I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but it works ok.. I guess for people with sensitive skin it would be good for them.&lt;br /&gt;newest update September 2013 and I bought this October 2012... its been a month shy since i bought this product and I cannot recommend it. I think it is meant for sensitive skin. I dont have sensitive skin so so i need something more strong. I managed to get acne because of this product. so now I just Aveno or other facial wash for face.  this may be dermatologist recommended but because its for those very sensitive facial skin people.</li>
            <li> Wonderful face wash for oily, acne prone skin.  Cleanses without stripping and irritating the skin.  As gentle as cetaphil but really cleans. No fragrance, and your skin feels nice and refreshed afterwards.  Wish I found this face wash many years ago.  Thank you Cerave for making a quality, affordable product.  Just one full pump and that&#x27;s all you need.  Product should last at least 4 months, one squirt each morning and night.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite face was but it does the job and during the winter it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin more than it already is.</li>
            <li> I use this about 3 times a week, alternating with their Hydrating cleanser, it&#x27;s gentle and does not leave your face feeling tight or dry.  Would recommend for sensitive and/ or aging skin.</li>
            <li> Feels very refreshing and minty and keeps my face feeling fresh, very effective at washing dirt/oil off my face after a long work day.</li>
            <li> This is a foaming cleanser with no fragrance or color added.  It is best for normal to oily skin, but you can use it if your skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels luxurious and will remove makeup.  It rinses well and is non-irritating.  Toner is not necessary, but I use toner myself.  It removes makeup better than [[ASIN:B000056I89 Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, Normal to Oily Skin]], and like Cetaphil, does not strip the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent cleanser for any skin type, at any age.  I especially recommend it for men.  Men&#x27;s facial cleansers often contain fragrance and other potentially irritating ingredients.  This works with no frou-frou fragrance, and if you shave, you need a gentle cleanser to offset irritation.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fantastic for those who have sensitive skin or anyone that is looking for a quality, well-priced, and non-irritating product. I also enjoy the fact that there is a large quantity so that I don&#x27;t have to continually buy pint-sized products. I found this cleanser very gentle going on, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling tight or dry afterwards, but smooth and healthy. The first time I used it on my face I thought that it seemed like soap because it makes little soap-like bubbles (the \\&quot;Foaming\\&quot; in the Facial Cleanser), but it is not! This product is highly recommendable, as are all of the other products in the CeraVe line!</li>
            <li> It meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me and made my skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> The CeRave products I&#x27;ve used are the best, especially the Moisturizing Cream. Great for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  It works well on combination skin.</li>
            <li> Soft and good for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I needed something non-irritating to wash my face at night. This worked exactly as advertised! I have sensitive eyes and skin, and CeraVe got my face clean without irritation. My skin feels soft after I wash at night - not dry like some other brands. While there are less expensive options, I&#x27;m willing to pay a little more for a non-irritating brand that gets my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser..Applying CeraVe Moisturizer AM &amp; PM ..Good combination. seen difference in 4 weeks</li>
            <li> Great for makeup removal and makes my face really clean. My face is very sensitive and this causes zero irritation. Recommended by my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> My face is brighter and clearer than ever!!! It comes in a pump so it&#x27;s really easy to dispense and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin:-)</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It is effective and does a good job at removing makeup and is really gentle and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes with this product because of all the rave reviews on how gentle and non-irritating it is supposed to be. After washing my face with this, my skin got red, dry and very tight. I think it&#x27;s the niacinamide in it which irritated my face. Niacin is known to cause the &amp;#34;flushed&amp;#34; effect. Totally not worth the price.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE PRODUCT! I have Rosacea and this is super moisturizing for my face and I love it! I highly recommend this product and all the CeraVe products!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a film on the face.</li>
            <li> Love my first experience with CeraVe. I&#x27;ve read so many reviews on this brand and decided to go for the foaming cleanser. It is really affordably priced, and the pump is very nice and easy to use. I use this in the morning and at nigh (after removing makeup), and it foams really nicely and feels great on my skin. After I pat dry my face, I follow with a few sprays of facial toner. I have normal skin but it&#x27;s relatively sensitive, and so far, it&#x27;s loving loving this cleanser. It&#x27;s a clear cleanser which is interesting, and it is working great for me.</li>
            <li> This one bottle lasted a year for me. I love it</li>
            <li> works great for my teenagers</li>
            <li> This product works great! Follow the direction on the back of the bottle so you get the best outsome possible. Use it twice per day.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it claimed to be a cleanser for oily skin that also locked in moisture and would cleanse without drying or tightening skin, and it did not deliver at all. It feels great when I wash my skin with it, but immediately after washing my face become so dry and flaky and looks absolutely terrible. I&#x27;ve been using a different medicated face wash for acne and it really dried my skin, so I was looking for a more gentle cleanser. This product, however, was more harsh on my skin than the medicated acne wash. Beware before buying this product that this could also happen to you. I think I will try the moisturizing version and see if that gives better results.</li>
            <li> I think my face is too dry so it started cracking with this product. I went back to my tried and tested Clearisil.</li>
            <li> Great face wash! doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but gets is clean!</li>
            <li> I switch off using this one and the CeraVe hydrating cleanser.  This one is a little more drying (because it&#x27;s designed for oily skin), so I only use it occasionally.  CeraVe products have helped clear up my skin, making it softer and I rarely get blemishes or breakouts anymore!  Amazon has better pricing, unless you&#x27;re able to find a good sale at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth.. Excellent and fast packing</li>
            <li> I used cetaphil before and want change,so I choose cerave. After washing the face is clean and smooth. but I still like the fell of cetaphil, so I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> Works great. I will buy this product again! Use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The Cleanser is good, but the package was broken when arrived.</li>
            <li> This does the trick and I definitely feel clean post use.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve used for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. This lasted me months and is well worth the price. It came packaged nicely and has held up. It smooths out my combination skin without over drying or clogging pores. This is a new favorite face wash of mine!</li>
            <li> excellent product and buy</li>
            <li> Very good product. It does not dry the face and you can feel your skin is cleaner. I have been using it for a week and I can already see some blemishes gone from my chin area.</li>
            <li> This left my face extremely dry and parched feeling. I was not impressed and stopped use after only a couple days.</li>
            <li> Didnt really feel any difference in my skin. The first few uses actually left my skin sore. I wouldnt purchase again. Did not feel like it was worth the price. Their lotion however is great.</li>
            <li> Really love this! Cleans really well without drying out your face. Great bargain. Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. Very gentle, non drying. My face is looking the best it has in a long time. Plus its a great price cheaper than I&#x27;ve seen in stores.</li>
            <li> OILY SKIN -- If you have oily or sensitive skin this is a goto cleanser. It&#x27;s light, smooth, and has few comedogenic ingredients. For further information involving SMART skin care (no &#x27;bro-science&#x27;) go to reddit&#x27;s skin care addiction subreddit: [...]</li>
            <li> Use it every morning and any time I need to wash off make up.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin as I notice but I do live in a moderate humid zone, Hawaii.  Not much dryness out here.  Still, I like the clean feel of the product and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I like that this foams. I usually use the creamy CeraVe cleanser, but the foam is nice. I did not notice this before but this cleanser is designed for normal to oily skin; whereas the creamy CeraVe is for dryer skin. You may want to consider before buying- but I tend to have normal to dry and use both without any issues.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser! It makes your face feel clean without stripping the oils and making your skin feel dry. I have slightly oily skin and I&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil before and didn&#x27;t like how my face didn&#x27;t have that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Not easy to wash off the remains but acceptable.</li>
            <li> gave me more acne than it cleared</li>
            <li> This soap is EXCELLENT. 2 dermatologist recommend and it&#x27;s great for my whole family. Great for sensitive skin and all skin types.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m going to try the hydrating cleanser because this makes my skin feel a little tight afterwards. However, I still like it and use it. Definitely prefer it over Cetaphil. It works well to easily remove all my foundation and concealer, but is still pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser product overall I was expecting a white foam but it&#x27;s just clear soap that turns white once water is mixed with it. I would recommend this product though</li>
            <li> Very sensitive skin and I have had a lot of trouble finding a cleanser that helps even when it says it is gentle and for sensitive skin.  This stuff has really helped.  Worked better for me than cetaphil. (BTW it&#x27;s $10 at medco.com)</li>
            <li> Excellent really does a solid job.</li>
            <li> Cleans face but is extremely drying - buyer beware if you already have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently developed a lot of trouble with allergic dermetittis around my eyes. Even when I&#x27;m not experiencing a reaction my skin is so dry and flakey. I switched to cerave products and it had helped tremendously. The price on amazon is fantastic and I can keep one on the sink and one in the shower.</li>
            <li> It can takes the makeup away if you didn&#x27;t applied too heavy or waterproof mascara and eyeline.</li>
            <li> Love this gentle face wash. When I use it my face does not feel dry and that is an accomplishment. No other facial wash leaves my skin feeling this soft!</li>
            <li> WOW! Finally something that I love as much as my faithful Origins Checks and Balances. So gentle, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling stripped, but you can feel that your skin is clean. GREAT price - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Excellent product... does what it says. As the user you have to make aure you have a consistent routine in place for noticable differences to be made.</li>
            <li> One of my kid&#x27;s dermatologists recommended this and they recommended it to ME.  Works really well! Gets my skin very clean without drying it out and keeps me from getting breakouts.  Yes, Mother Nature can have a very strange sense of humor giving us wrinkles AND zits!  :(  The moisturizers are great, as well.</li>
            <li> I used to use the CeraVe hydrating cleanser but that is best for normal to dry skin and I have normal to oily skin. When the new foaming cleanser became available, which is for normal to oily skin, I ordered it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just about perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of using it already my face began to feel somehow more healthy, balanced and clear, without being overly dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great gentle face wash that I will certainly buy again when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while, but before the product is used up, the CereVe bottle starts to implode. This is really annoying and gives me a bad impression of the company, that they use such cheapy bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things over the years to control my mild acne. I&#x27;ve finally found something that works! I used to break out about once a week but since I started using this 2 months ago, I have yet to break out at all. I recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s worth a try if other things haven&#x27;t worked in the past. And it&#x27;s cheap for how long the product lasts.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser and would buy product again.  The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> I have an oily/combination skin and this cleanser works wonders for me.It is very gentle and It does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son.  He said it was OK, but perfers a different brand...</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin naturally and looking to dry out your acne keep moving this product is not for you.  I bought this upon a friends recommendation.  Big mistakes I guess it works if you have normal skin, but if you have oily acne prone skin it does nothing.  Guess I will stick to my clean and clear and Indian Healing Clay masks</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail cleanser and I wouldn&#x27;t change it for anything else. Firstly, it will last for a long time; with one daily wash it took me 6 months to finish it up. Secondly, it&#x27;s fragrance free and does not irritate my skin. Last but not least it&#x27;s extremely gentle and suitable for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> gentle enough for everyday use. won&#x27;t dry out skin and keeps skin clear and moisturized</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended for anyone with eczema or sensitive skin. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this, my skin has cleared up dramatically. This is the only facial cleaner I will ever buy--unless they decide to stop making it.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say this clears up acne, it really does cleanse ur face very well, if you have acne it will not get rid of it, however if you dont have acne at all this is perfect for you in terms of cleansing your skin. Im gonna try something different for my acne.</li>
            <li> Part of my nightly routine. Wet my face then apply wait a few then rinse. This cleanser is Ok but not 100% effective as it still leaves make up residue and does not completely get everything off. Once I wipe a cottonball with a toner product make up still comes off every time. However I do like that it is gentle and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash. I have combination skin (usually more oily than dry) so I wash my face at least twice a day with this wash, sometimes 3 times depending on what I did that day. This cleanser makes my skin feel sooo smooth, soft, and clean. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. I wouldn&#x27;t call this a foaming cleanser (mostly because I&#x27;ve had foaming cleansers before that REALLY foam) but it does glide on pretty light and has the feel and texture of foam. Prior to this cleanser, I used Boscia&#x27;s Detoxifying Black Cleanser. While that cleanser worked magic on my skin, this one is comparable, and significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li> This cleaner was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I could not be happier.  Great for sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling clean and natural.</li>
            <li> Gentle. Cleans your face.  Decent sized bottle.  Worth every penny. Foams up well.  One full pump is too much, I recommend not pushing it all the way down.  This will last you.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. Not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this cleanser as a body wash. She has sensitive skin, and the CeraVe brand was recommended by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My new favorite cleanser. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist and is doing the job!  It is a thorough cleanser,but gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love the gentleness of CeraVe products and this one is no exception. Also use the lotions &amp; creams as they are all very hydrating without harsh chemicals that make us all break out.  Our allergergist recommended this particular brand and so far they work.</li>
            <li> Just right for my Rosacea plagued face!  I use it with my Clarisonic facial brush.  It cleanses without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash!!  I was having a problem with breakouts just before and at the beginning of my menstrual cycle and this has gotten rid of all problems!!  Not just breakouts but also my skin over drying.  But it doesn&#x27;t add too much moisture either.  It really is the perfect face wash and at a perfect price!!!</li>
            <li> I was using basis, then cetaphil.  Now that my cetaphil is almost out, I purchased this.  My dermatologist gave me samples which I&#x27;ve liked.  I thought it was a prescription wash, but was happy to found out it was not.  It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser.  If you have serious skin problems, no cleanser will fix them.  It&#x27;s likely a bacteria and you need antibiotics.  But if you have sensitive skin that is combination, this works really nice to keep your skin feeling clean and removing makeup.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is mild yet leaves your face feeling clean.  I&#x27;ve tried other cleansers such as Cetaphil which is another mild cleanser.  CeraVe foams up and makes my skin feel fresh and clean unlike other mild cleansers that simply sit on your skin.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in local stores.  THANK YOU AMAZON for carrying it!!</li>
            <li> Good gentle wash that does the job and cleans your face well.  I use a benzol wash also but i don&#x27;t use it everyday and alternate with this because it isn&#x27;t as harsh.  To me it is a good combo of treatments.</li>
            <li> My lady loves this face wash. I saved 50% 0ff.</li>
            <li> Im a male in my early 20s, over the years i have tried many different face washes. Some would dry up my face, some would not control achne at all and some were just too pricy. I forgot how i found this brand but i am glad i did. This product is simply the best in price and quality. I have used this for about an year now and i am still on my first bottle. This thing lasts for a long time and very cheap compared to all the other products.&lt;br /&gt;Enough about the value, this thing actually works very well. Since i have started to use it, it kept my achne under control and my face never dries up. Highly reccomend this and their lotion as well.</li>
            <li> I used to use Cetaphil, but my dermatologist recommended this as I have oily skin.  It has made a tremendous difference and actually removes makeup too.</li>
            <li> Too drying for my face.  I like the hydrating cleanser instead.  And neither takes make up off very well.  For that I have an oil cleanser with baby wipes.</li>
            <li> derm recommendation .</li>
            <li> It did good for the first 3 weeks then it did nothing. Left my face dry and itchy. Been taking for 2 months now</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing, it leaves my skin feeling smooth. I will be purchasing this regularly.</li>
            <li> Awesome product especially for such a cheap price. I have tried hundreds of different brands, including the very pricey ones, but have never had the same results. It has a smooth texture and pleasant smell, but the most important thing is that it does wonders for your skin. I have a combination/oily skin prone to break outs and this cleanser helped my skin tremendously. It is like night and day. It was recommended to my by a very experienced beautician and she was 100% that it does work. If you have oily or combination/oily skin do try this product, you won&#x27;t regret it. It really does work.</li>
            <li> Great deal, great product, super fast shipping!! A+ all the way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve got very oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin at age 28 and I switched from another foaming cleanser to this. For the first week or so I broke out, my skin was crazy oily and just a mess. I stuck with it and I&#x27;m so glad I did because my skin has totally balanced itself out now and is breaking out much less. This cleanser is so gentle and mild, I love it.</li>
            <li> it made me break out :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so annoying when it comes to face wash since I have oily acne prone skin. Well this exceeded my expectations a million times. My face is clear. Before I was getting huge blind pimples on the regular and I was using neutrogena and organic face wash. So yeah. Buy this. It feels amazing and silky and will clear your skin. 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> LOVE this facial soap!!! I will never use anything else again. It is moisturizing but without making my face oily. I wouldn&#x27;t call this face wash &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34;. It does suds up as you&#x27;re washing your face, but isn&#x27;t foaming, just liquid. I have sensitive, somewhat acne-prone skin and it has not caused me any problems. It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> I fell good after using it！</li>
            <li> My skin is SUPER oily and acne prone. That being said, I also want to take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a solid, dependable face wash that I can use any time of day for any purpose. I&#x27;d been using 2-3 different face washes (one everyday one for the morning, one acne fighter, one gentle night one) and couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist suggested that I use the CeraVe moisturizer years ago, which I have been, but the hydrating face wash next to it was all wrong for me (it didn&#x27;t lather, felt like I was rubbing lotion into my face with water, egh). Having extremely oily skin, I  need something that is actually going to clean my face. This works great for me and is the same size as the moisturizer so it lasts a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with this and the CeraVe moisturizer and not using anything else.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great! Just after a few days of use I am hooked! I have been using cetaphil for normal&amp;oily skin and AHA foaming cleanser. Cetaphil is good for morning uses for washing away the oil that build up on my face overnight. I can&#x27;t use cetaphil with my clarisonic face brush since it irritates my skin SO MUCH!  CeraVe is gentle, mild and foamy. Also melts my makeup away!  It leaves my skin non-irritated and balanced!  It&#x27;ll be my replacement of AHA cleanser at night in future!!</li>
            <li> Great face wash best one i could find, could also be used to shave with.</li>
            <li> face feels fresh and clean, reduces redness IMO, doesn&#x27;t overdry</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended this product for my adult acne</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. High quality.</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve started using this my skin has responded well....I am now on my 3rd or 4th bottle. Using this along with the CeraVE AM/PM lotions has simplified my routine, and my skin feels better, and looks better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mild, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. my face felt smooth after using it. excellent product.</li>
            <li> Again there are many products that say they work well with eczema, but CeraVe foaming facial cleancer with ceramides,niacinamide and hyaluronic acid does unbelievable cleansing while conditioning the skin like no other product I know on the market. It&#x27;s a must purchase for my kid with eczema.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Use it in place of shaving cream. It keeps my face clean and free of pimples.</li>
            <li> gets the job done; removes makeup, deep cleans and doesn&#x27;t strip my natural moisture.</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Made my skin so dry and flaky causing an eczema break out and a lot of red itchy skin. Did not work for me well :(</li>
            <li> Works really well.  My sensitive skin feels clean with out irritation from unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin which can react to scents and other soap additives.  I have been using this for month with a buffing brush and have experienced no problems.  This allows me to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; a bit without getting a rash.  I had to give up on all face cleaners with any abrasive additives.  Also I cannot use regular soaps.  This gets my skin very clean without feeling stripped or stressed.</li>
            <li> Before this, I was using shuemura oil cleanding. Compare to that, I felt like this cerave does not clean my face completely... this is a non-expensive cosmetics you can use when you did not do make up....</li>
            <li> Came wrapped and sealed and I use it everyday! Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> it irritated my skin ,i have sensitive skin ,many cleanser gave me rashes ,so did this one .it has residue which doesn&#x27;t make it a pleasant process while rinse off .wont buy again .stuff in the pic all irritats my face ,what a waste :(</li>
            <li> My proactiv replacement. I&#x27;ve used proactiv once a day for years.  It worked well but I really only cared to use the cleanser and I ended up with a lot of expired product. I read the reviews on amazon and decided to give this a try. I actually prefer it to proactiv! My skin feels less dry and I like that it doesn&#x27;t bleach my towels. It also rinses easily and foams up nicely. I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent--I have very dry skin so this is the only product that I found, that could help my skin.  Especially when I wake in the morning, I do not have that flaky dry patches all over my face.  Thank you Cerave.  My husband have the opposite skin--very oily.  So oily that the oil runs down in his eyes.  So he too uses Cerava for the oily skin and it has done wonders w/keeping his skin balanced as well.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this is one of the cleansers that my doctor recommended I use.  It is great and really helps with my complexion, it does not dry out my skin either.  I can find it cheaper on Amazon then buying it in the store and it comes within 2 days.  I would recommend CeraVe to anyone with skin problems.</li>
            <li> AWESOME FACE CLEANSER! It&#x27;s great. I use it every day and it&#x27;s helped minimize my breakouts and eliminate the need for creams and other thick, greasy chemicals I was so used to using. I feel the difference from when I wash my face versus when it&#x27;s been untouched for awhile. The difference is huge. Unfortunately from time to time I do still get a blemish. For those I use an oil; but it&#x27;s not greasy like you think! Tea tree oil [[ASIN:B00I42CK4A 100% Pure Tea Tree Oil + FREE Acne Fighting Blemish Roll-on Stick with Tea Tree Oil]] dries out bad oils! You can use it dry too. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and goes well with any cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a little tougher I do only use the tea tree oil for extremes. My daily washer is still the cleanser. The tea tree oil works on any body part though; back, arms, legs. Anywhere you have acne I suggest using it! It eliminates blemishes very quickly. I use the cerave with my shower and the tea tree oil if I feel a blemish coming on or have one. Great combination!</li>
            <li> excellent item...very good for my skin. Leaves no greases shin or redness. Great under makeup. Nice. Thanks</li>
            <li> Cool cleanser. Great effect in oil control and oil &amp; water balance. I&#x27;ll recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for my acne-prone skin.  It&#x27; probably great for any skin type, as it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> I love Cerave because for one it is great for my anti aging skin. Don&#x27;t over dry the skin. And ladies with oily skin and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best cleanser I have tried till now. It leaves your skin very smooth, and my pimples dissapeard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> CeraVe is the best cleansing product I&#x27;ve found to keep skin moist and healthy. Medications make my skin dry and rashy. CeraVe cleansers and lotions keep me comfortable. Great products.</li>
            <li> This product cleans your face just as well as those harsh bead-filled face washes but without the sting or tightness afterwards. I use it as part of my daily routine and it leaves my skin feeling clean AND hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product dispenses as a clear gel and when combined with a wet face lathers up into a foam. It removes all my makeup well and is good for anyone looking for a daily face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of this and it&#x27;s earned a permanent spot in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I saw no change in my skin</li>
            <li> Switched to CeraVe from Cetaphil about 2 years ago after recommendations from my esthetician and close friend, from her dermatologist.  Best choice I made and I&#x27;m still a Cetaphil fan. But only when I can&#x27;t get to my CeraVe. This foaming cleanser is great in removing oil and MAKEUP, it contains the ingredients needed for youthful, healthy skin (hyaluronic acid, ceramides and niacinamide), and it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate acne. Also switched my pre-teen from Neutrogena&#x27;s oil-free acne wash to this and it has GREATLY improved her early years acne. If I can get her to use the AM lotion, then I&#x27;d truly be #winning</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my skin is so unbelievable soft!  I am fortunate to have very clear skin and with CeraVe, it is sure to stay that way for years to come.  There is no strong odor to the cleanser and does not leave a dry or film on the skin. This is one of the best cleansers I have purchased.  I will definitely continue to purchase and use the AM/PM cream as well.</li>
            <li> this cleanser is the real deal. they aren&#x27;t spending ba&#x27;zillions of dollars on tv commercials as the money has been wisely spend building a great product. multiple friends have had their respective dermatologists recommend this cleanser to them and I have jumped on the bandwagon.</li>
            <li> I used to use obagi cleanser, but the cerave is awesome...and cheaper too</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel like it washes your face, more like dries it. would go for an exfoliator instead.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Its works great. I love it. Its gentle, cleans well, and helps with my rosacea. My dermatologist highly recommended it and uses it herself. I recommend it also. There is also a hydrating variation which is even more gentle. Both are great.</li>
            <li> Came in plastic Baggie to prevent leakage. Good product. It&#x27;s one of the only things my sensitive skin can handle.</li>
            <li> It was too drying for my skin. It felt dry and tight and my forehead became extra shiny.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Cleans thoroughly without drying out my skin.  Will continue to use it. Wish I could find it locally.</li>
            <li> I think I like this.  It&#x27;s more like a gel cleaner that doesn&#x27;t really foam.  I use it with my clairsonic and it does get my skin clean with out drying it out.  I am still trying it out so I can&#x27;t say for sure but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> LOVE with cleanser. After using this for a while - my face has never felt more balanced.</li>
            <li> The product top was left open and spilled into the bag. Love the product, but could&#x27;ve been handled better.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face. I use it almost every morning. It isn&#x27;t anything special though. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which was good, but it didn&#x27;t really stand out from other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this foaming cleanser so much I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I have oily skin and this product removes the oil without drying my skin.  In addition, I feel that my skin is less oily throughout the day.  This is the perfect cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for years. Feels very comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li> While I was very exited to try this product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Left my skin way too dry even though I use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The thing I like best about this is that it removes my eye makeup entirely without having to re-wash the eye area.  It is also very gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed after using.  Love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I use this as instructed and my face does not look any cleaner than before... Can someone please explain to me why everyone else loves this product??? It just isn&#x27;t working out for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of face washes at this point... Almost all of them contain either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient to combat a breakout. This does seem to work within 4/7 days but never seemed like a sustainable solution. I read lots about how these chemicals can actually dry out the skin leading to more breakouts in the future. I have really mild acne, with relatively small breakouts on my forehead and chin area most commonly. I&#x27;ve been very fortunate not having to worry too much about it as a kid, which makes the recent ones at 26 a little confusing. With nothing to lose I started looking for a more well-rounded solution and found CeraVe foaming facial cleanser on Amazon, and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I must admit I&#x27;ve been really happy with it. My skin has been visibly more clear CONSISTENTLY than it ever was before with various other acne face washes... and the only significant variable was the change in face wash to CeraVe (diet, lifestyle etc. pretty much the exact same)... Just bought my second bottle!  ***TIP*** I put it on a damp (not soaking wet) face, with damp (not soaking wet) hands. This is important as it breaks down into a fairly watery consistency, pretty quickly. If you want a thicker lather, I&#x27;d recommend trying this for best results!</li>
            <li> All blemishes ate gone with a month of using it. Nothing else worked.</li>
            <li> This product is really good, it reminds me of the formula of clarisonic facial cleanser and I tried different brands but this one is the best one by far. Will repurchased it when I run out.</li>
            <li> its avg cleaner.. wouldnt buy again</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used. Cleared all my blemishes, and I haven&#x27;t gotten any since using! This is my new go-to.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean my face without bothering my skin in any noticeable way. Expect slight improvements, but I&#x27;ve continued to use these steadily over the last six months and I&#x27;ve gotta say it&#x27;s tough to imagine going back to something with abrasive chemicals or microbeads.</li>
            <li> Diagnosed rosacea with acne, as of late Aveeno Naturals with fever few hasn&#x27;t been working as well. So I surfed around and found reviews for this one.  It is terrific!! Non drying aspect is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do: clean my face. After a long day, I would use it to wash up, only to find my face still oily and dirty. It wouldn&#x27;t look dirty; but I would find out when I looked closely in the mirror or a magnifier. I would see dirty skin cells, and little white heads that would usually be washed away when I used a regular cleanser. I&#x27;m sure of this because when I use a cotton pad and clarifying solution, I would get a dirty pad after I&#x27;m done - but not if I used another stronger cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, this thing is very gentle. It even moisturizes your face. But I have moisturizer for that. I just need it to clean. And it didn&#x27;t do that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for maybe morning routines, when all you need is a light rinse - not for end-of-day grime though.</li>
            <li> Cobtains methylparaben a known carcinogen linked to breast cancer. Be an informed consumer. I won&#x27;t by anything without researching the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews on products, but I was very disappointed with the outcome and honestly hope no one else has to deal with the same thing I did. I read many of the reviews and saw that this product was given mostly 5 out of 5 so I was pretty optimistic. However, after about almost two weeks of using the product, I noticed a huge change in my skin. Never in my entire life of using cleansers have I ever had so many breakouts caused by it. Now I&#x27;m back to using my old Noxzema cleanser in the hopes in will clear up the mess that this one caused. I am extremely dissatisfied and hope to receive a full refund for the problems that it caused.</li>
            <li> Girls go for it...trust me it ll not disappoint u at all</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and everything I&#x27;ve ever tried gives me break outs. This is such a gentle cleanser. It&#x27;s very effective at keeping my breakouts to a minimum! I use it with an Olay cleansing spin brush a few nights a week.</li>
            <li> PLEASE buy this. Look at beautypedia.com. Paula loves it. It&#x27;s incredible. Feels amazing, doesn&#x27;t strip your skin and takes all the make up off.</li>
            <li> The BEST facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out my normal-combination skin and cleans well too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks not and it is absolutely awesome. Immediately after using my face feels clean and refreshed and I am ready to start my day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the lotion, but never tried the cleanser- very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> This product has been working well for my eleven year old daughter.  When it is time to re-order, it will be with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Cerave makes great products and I think I have used just about all of them.  After finding that my husband was using my facial cleanser, I decided I better load up on it.</li>
            <li> Great face wash, it definitely takes all the oil and dirt away. May make your face a little dry but that is fixed with some moisturizer. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have found that foams and removes makeup.  The price is the best on Amazon.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS PARABENS WHICH CAUSE CELL DEATH WHEN EXPOSED TO UV LIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;In other words it kills the skin cells on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love it so much My skin stay oily free all day</li>
            <li> I got my CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser today. This is first time I am using this product, and I want to share how much I was amazed by this. So, tonight I used it to wash my face. I had pimples on my forehead and one at the frontal side of my left eye. They were on my face for 4 days, I used many medicines and other cleansers to get rid off them but it never removed them at all. Other product made my skin get over-sensitive. However, so I decided to change my cleansers and I found this one. The CeraVe Foaming, just one use, the one pimple, most annoying one located at my eye side is gone now. It&#x27;s been 2 hours after I washed my face with this product. I created foams with fair amount of CeraVe cleanser after I washed my face first with warm water, applied them on my face and circularly massaged my face for 5 minutes. Then, I washed it off with warm water (not hot water) 12 times until I could not feel the oily feeling and washed it off with cold water. When you washing with cold water after rinse it off with warm water, don&#x27;t wash your face like you did with warm water, I did massage with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing off, have a towel and just gently take off the wetness. Have lotions only after cleaning my face using this product, within 2 hours the most annoying pimple at my front side of eye was gone!&lt;br /&gt;I was really amazed....I couldn&#x27;t believe this result but it really happened so I am here to share the story!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other pimples, they got smaller too. It seems like they would get gone by tomorrow morning.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought this product and tried it out tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for people who has oily face, troubling with acnes and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thus it is been 3 hours now I washed my face using this product, I still can feel my face skin is so soft, but not too dry, not oily.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will fall in love with this facial cleanser now.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I use it to clean my beard while showering.</li>
            <li> This is an honest review.... So I&#x27;ve always had issues with very oily skin. Before using this product when I wake up in the morning my skin is an oily mess it would look like somebody took bacon grease and  slathered it all over my face. I&#x27;ve used many products claiming to help with oily skin but nothing ever worked as great as this product.This product is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought as far as facial cleansers go. After you wash your skin with this it leaves It very soft and clean. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I must say my skin has improved by at least 90% I no longer wake up with oily skin in the morning and by the time night time rolls around my skin still looks like it was just washed.The cleanser helps restore the protective skin barrier on your face I wasn&#x27;t sure what that meant until I tried it and from my conclusion it doesn&#x27;t wash away or strip to skin from the natural moister that your skin needs. When you wash your face it will not irritate or burn your eyes like other cleansers do. So if you suffer from oily skin like I do you will never regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is extremely gentle, has no odor, and removes makeup and oil VERY well! While the product itself seems very similar to Cetaphil, this leaves my skin more moist and clean than Cetaphil. I have very oily and somewhat sensitive skin but I imagine it is gentle and effective enough to be excellent for a variety of skin types. I use this product twice a day with a warm, wet washcloth and the Cerave moisturizing cream (in the pot) afterward and my skin is doing extremely well with fewer breakouts and blemishes.</li>
            <li> Great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using Burt&#x27;s Bees cream facial cleanser, which honestly didn&#x27;t do much. This has a great scent, cleans very well, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry, sticky, oily, or anything. Very mild and does what it says. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> CeraVe works great, and when I use it consistently keeps my face clear of breakouts. There are times where I have used it inconsistently, but even then I could see the difference a day or two afterward. This works perfectly for me when I use it every morning and I rarely break out. I do not have large breakouts on my face, but will breakout regularly if I do not use some product to clean my face. I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: works great, not smelly, and really works great&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It&#x27;s gentle but washes off all my make up. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used! Does not strip my skin, but also works for my sometimes oily skin issues. It has eliminated a lot of my acne breakouts too!</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser that is made with all skin-loving ingredients. No tightness, no alcohol, no drying. This formula is better for combination and oily skin, gentle enough to cleanse twice a day. Contains ingredients to help with dark spots as well! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about CeraVe.</li>
            <li> great facial cleanser with great price! so far did not cause break out or irritation. listed ingredients are much better than the one for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Use it to clean my face. My face is naturally oily so I brought the normal-oily cleanser. It works and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is great to use. It works wonderful on my skin. This is way better than the expensive stuff at the department stores.</li>
            <li> This has been a game changer for me.  I had been using all &amp;#34;acne prone&amp;#34; skin products FOR YEARS and was still having breakouts.  When I started treating my skin as &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and using this my face completely cleared up except for chin which I still get hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li> Love cleanser, but when I turned the bottle to allow it to pump, the top broke.  I suppose I could have turned it the wrong way, but I did not force it and I must say, I have much experience with engaging new pump mechanisms ( sarcasm).</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best Mens face wash on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It cleans and prevents oily skin really well, while leaving your face feeling incredibly clean and healthy. It also smells amazing, leaving a faint clean shaven smell similar to aftershave. Some people don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;intense menthol&amp;#34; feeling, but I love it. It opens your sinuses and over all makes you feel great. I wish it would lather up a little better, but I can deal with that. Definitely pick some up!</li>
            <li> This is great and takes makeup off really well.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels nourished. I really think it is supplying my skin with vitamins and essential nutrients. It has no alcohol and the face appreciates it.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin gently and thoroughly, without drying it out and without leaving any soap residue.  My touchy, acne-prone skin loves CeraVe.</li>
            <li> Love love love this face cleanser!  Most of the face cleansers that I have tried have either caused my skin to either get extremely dry or I break out. This is perfect! It is perfect for my skin!</li>
            <li> Reduced some redness works great. My dermatologist recommended it for my very oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t too terrible but I thought I would try this to get rid of some of my blackheads. I used it for about 3 weeks and my skin just got worse and worse. More and more breakouts so I stopped using it. This is just my experience but it didn&#x27;t work well at all for me.</li>
            <li> This is a very straight to the point cleanse. No fancy mumbo jumbo or super perfumey scents. Just a great simple cleanser. And I mean it when I say great. I have combination skin that can go from dry as the sahara dessert to greasier than the BP oil spill. I only got this facial cleanser because I heard so many things about it from skincare addicts. I will never use another cleanser again. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight after or like there&#x27;s a thick layer on top. It just feels... clean. It&#x27;s not a miracle acne cure. I still have occasional breakouts, but my face is SO much clearer now! Only get the occasional pimple or hormonal breakouts which will just always happen but this cleanser has truly cleared my face otherwise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cleanser 100%</li>
            <li> weird texture, smell, doesnt do anything for my acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> gentle enough for everyday use on face, keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Hooray! Best cleaner out there ☺️</li>
            <li> Using to help reduce breakouts, so far so good! I apply it with a small buffing pad and gently cleanse my face each night. My skin feels great and looks like it is finally starting to clear up! I have very sensitive skin so I get a rash from most regular lotions. I use this cleanser and follow up with the moisturizing cream, its like heaven on your face after a long day!</li>
            <li> Great deal on dermatologist recommended cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin but am not a fan of creamy cleansers that are typically recommended for dry skin - they feel like they are leaving a greasy film.  I like foaming cleansers that feel like they are really cleaning but have found that many leave my skin way too dry and tight.  CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser foams nicely, is unscented and does not leave my skin dry and tight!  It removes mascara easily.  I&#x27;ve purchased this cleanser many times and have not found anything I like better yet.  I tried the CeraVe hydrating (i.e., non-foaming) cleanser. It was ok but occasionally made my face sting.  The foaming cleanser has never made my skin sting.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is pretty good for sensitive skin, though not so accustomed as one with oil skin. Initially I found that it may not work too well for oil skin, but it turned out pretty fine by using a bit more than usual conditions for oil skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Haven&#x27;t had 1 breakout since I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days and face looked blotchy and older and stopped using it and back to Ivory. From my experience I do not recommend but I don&#x27;t know if others would have the same reaction.</li>
            <li> I am 35 and have pimples and wrinkles this was the first product I&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t dry me out or break me out im terribly sensitive with combination skin, sometimes lol, because I&#x27;m sooooooooo sensitive using it every day near my eyes mad me a little red so I go around that every other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 7 years now and love it. I also enjoy getting it from Amazon because the store price is so high!</li>
            <li> Very drying for my skin</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son&#x27;s acne. It was part of the daily face regiment that was prescribed by doctor. He seems to like it... Gentle and does not irritate his face.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about, just OK.  I like my face to feel SUPER clean and this apparently has some type of moisturizer in it, so it does not leave my face squeaky clean. I moisturizer AFTER I clean, so I want that super clean feeling BEFORE I apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Only face wash I found without the microbeads that doesn&#x27;t cause my acne to flare up. I&#x27;ve had clearer skin since using this product. I&#x27;ve been looking for something without the microbeads since the research found them in our lakes and ponds negatively impacting our fish</li>
            <li> This has singlehandely fixed the dots on my upper arms or at least reduced them. Very good product and great value. The bottle is a bit small so beware.</li>
            <li> This brand is frequently recommended by dermatologists for gentle skin care. The foaming version gets rid of makeup and oils better than the gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this cleanser would make my face feel dry and tight.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Instead my face feels clean and my adult acne has almost cleared up.  I bought this less than a month ago.</li>
            <li> My acne is all gone and no new acne is popping up. The product from my experience only stopped acne other than that it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin. Also using this cleanser with a serum will clear darkspots and make your skin glow.</li>
            <li> I found this product in an article written and recommended by a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am very old, I need a moisturizer, something gentle but effective.&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely the best I have ever used.  The nightly moisturizer feels so&lt;br /&gt;good.  It is not greasy or messy.  Try it - you will like it.  I will never use anything&lt;br /&gt;else now that I have found the perfect face care product.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent- the shipping costs twice as much as the product itself, but it was still worth it. I have had acne for years, and only in the last year or so I started seeing a dermatologist for it, after years of trying out different expensive products not suited to my age or skin type. I even underwent facial treatments that cost upwards of ten thousand! My skin improved by leaps and bounds after seeing a dermatologist, but as the derm didn&#x27;t provide a skin cleanser I struggled to find one. I turned to cheaper brands like Clean&amp;Clear and Neutrogena, and they were okay, but they didn&#x27;t seem to help control the oil level in my skin and soon after stopping the creams from the dermatologist, I could see signs of my acne starting to return. I bought CeraVe after reading all the stunning reviews, and so far I&#x27;ve had no complaints at all. After washing, my skin feels EXTREMELY clean and refreshed and it feels tighter even. Despite what the label says it isn&#x27;t actually a foam, it&#x27;s more of a gel, and I love the texture. It&#x27;s scentless, which works fine as I hate the artificial smelling goop I normally get with other facial cleansers. Within a week or two of washing there was visible improvement in my skin- my face has actually become lighter and brighter. Although the back of the product says wash morning and night, I use it more than twice a day, especially after getting home from a long day and when my face feels grimy and oily. Love it, will definitely buy more and try out the other products as well. The fact that it contains ceramides is something that has my mother excited as well, since she&#x27;s a fan of Dr Oz and he has recommended phytoceramides and the like as an alternative to other products that are supposed to make you look more &#x27;youthful&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about CeraVe foaming cleanser. This product is amazing for anyone. I don&#x27;t have skin that is particularly sensitive, but I think this cleanser is especially good for those who do. It&#x27;s gentle, lathers amazingly, and isn&#x27;t irritating whatsoever. It has a nice, clean scent. I don&#x27;t see myself ever switching cleansers again.</li>
            <li> Causes small white heads, which I never got before.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use this product from my Dermatologist about a year and half ago. This product is very gentle, yet, removes all my make up, too. When people ask me about a facial cleanser, I always recommend this product. One thing I have to say is: there are two different kind of Facial Cleaners for CeraVe but their bottles are just about identical so becareful with which one you buy. The one I buy is the foaming facial cleanser. My husband and I use the same product. I use it with my Clarisonic brush, too. I did not break out from this product either. A little expensive but I buy it anyway because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> - Cleans my face&lt;br /&gt;- Occasionally dries my faces for some strange reason&lt;br /&gt;- Haven&#x27;t seen reduction in my blackheads/whiteheads&lt;br /&gt;- Must use in conjunction with Benzoyl Peroxide &amp; Oil-Free Moisturizer to reduce acne.&lt;br /&gt;- Not exactly &#x27;foaming&#x27;. Pumps out a clear liquid, rub on face, becomes white and creamy but not &#x27;foaming&#x27;</li>
            <li> A great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry at all. Without it my acne would definitely be much worse and it&#x27;s an important part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product. I have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt; i use this product every day and when I clean my face, it makes my face very soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;love it.</li>
            <li> not so good, it&#x27;s too oil</li>
            <li> Loving it!  Perfect for combination skin. Great ingredients and face felt soft and clean after washing.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This dye-free skin cleanser is a die-for product. It&#x27;s cheap and works wonders on your skin. It has no crazy chemical additives that will clog pores or leave your skin dry or tight feeling.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this product I&#x27;d say just go for it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this since there is so many good reviews on this product but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I am 27 with Oily Skin and Light Acne and it did nothing to help my acne whatsoever. I am sure it will be great for someone with normal skin and no acne but just not for me.</li>
            <li> Ruined my face. Totally dried out my face which led to the overproduction of sebum to compensate for the dryness which in turn led to the emergence of severe acne. At first I though my acne was related to my diet - it was too late when I singled out that my continued used of this product was the culprit. I hate it with a passion.</li>
            <li> Love all products! Gentle yet cleansing!</li>
            <li> This is a great product i use it to remove my make-up  as a facial cleanser and it reduces acne&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this in March, and it&#x27;s now August and I still haven&#x27;t run out of this product! I love this! It still leaves a bit of make-up residue, but that&#x27;s what astringent is for.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, gentle on skin and nice smell, I will continue to use this often and order more.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash takes all my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes , I love how it foams for a great clean feeling</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use makeup remover and instead use this soap to wash my face twice at night. Cleans very good, and not drying. I&#x27;ve gotten my sister to use it. This soap is a lot like Kiel&#x27;s non detergent foaming face soap that was discontinued. Even if Kiel&#x27;s brought that other soap back, I&#x27;d continue to use cerave.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, great price. It stops my skin from drying and has greatly reduced my acne. I cannot recommend it enough. It&#x27;s a great deal cheaper on Amazon than in stores as well!</li>
            <li> I have rosecea, and this is a nice mild cleanser for the face.  It doesn&#x27;t make the skin too tight.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever tried this brand and wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it based on mixed reviews. have used it about a week and my skin is less dry. I think I will buy other products from this brand now.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser. I have oily, acne prone skin and this is definitely helping. My husband even told me, without me mentioning it, &amp;#34;Your skin looks great.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps remove blackheads and prevent future breakouts, but you do need to make sure you wet your hands/face first and get it foaming. It&#x27;s a great cleanser, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this cleanser, and I will buy it again AND I&#x27;m looking at their other products as well. This seems to work great for my skin, much less breakouts and I think it is helping my moisturizer perform better as well.</li>
            <li> CeraVe has been compared to other gentle cleaners such as Cetaphil and has proven over time to be a top choice. Works well on all skin types and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh with no residue. The gel comes out with the consistency of hand soap and foams up with the same degree of lather.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It is inexpensive, and works better than any luxury brand cleanser I have used.  It removes eye makeup easily, and when I use toner afterward, there is never a trace of leftover makeup on the cotton pad.  I am also prone to rashes from certain products, but I have no issues with CeraVe.</li>
            <li> Wash the very comfortable and clea，n not greasy， foam a little more</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it made my skin dry!  I probably ordered the wrong product but I&#x27;d heard much positive information about the brand.</li>
            <li> Love this - doesn&#x27;t quite take off make up that great but my face feels so clean afterwards. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with dry skin though as it did dry out mine but I use a moisturizer after I shower now</li>
            <li> Been only using this wash for a few weeks and I like it so far. It foams up nicely and does not have any fragrance, which I like since fragrance can be too harsh on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone and oily skin. It&#x27;s still that way after using this product but I am going to keep using it to see if it improves it! Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> The only facial cleanser I use, It is great</li>
            <li> My face went through a random burst of acne a few months ago. I decided to try out this cleanser to see if it helps. I used it with my clarisonic brush and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference over the past few months. I&#x27;ve also been using Retin-A and topical antibiotics so I wouldn&#x27;t completely credit this product with solving my acne issues, but it does leave your skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Dude! I&#x27;ve tried all types of cleansers and have settled on expensive cleansers, such as Dermalogica with minimal success.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have the usual harsh nasty crap in it which typically contain two dozen syllables per word.&lt;br /&gt;I have crazy sensitive, dry skin and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve come across thus far.This is good for anyone who gets Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;Can use everyday without drying out my skin. If my skin is dry I also just recently discovered CeraVe Moisturizing cream, which is awesome as well.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently cleansers/moisturizers don&#x27;t have to be expensive to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every OTC option there is. And there is nothing I hate more than buying a product arbitrarily off the shelves, using it for two weeks, and breaking out more! CeraVe started clearing up my skin within a couple days of using it twice a day. It is gentle enough on my lumpy, dry cheeks but takes the oil off of my forehead and nose. I can not stress enough how important it is that if you want to get the full potential of this product you HAVE TO WASH YOUR FACE TWICE A DAY. The effects are not lasting. Just like ProActiv and other products, once you stop using it you begin to break out again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light cleanser that would be good for sensitive skin and for everyday use, and this cleanser works great! It creates a foamy lather and is just perfect for frequent use.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this brand. I have the moisturizing facial lotion, but I though i should try the foaming cleanser.  What I love about this product, the cleanser is not as harsh on your skin as other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried such as brands of Neutrogena and Oxy. I highly suggest this product for combination skin users.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous facial cleansers over the years.  CeraVe&#x27;s Foaming Facial Cleanser is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The difference in the quality of my skin was noticable after just several days of use.  The nusiance acne that I have been battling for several years has already cleared up.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy feeling like Cetaphil and removes dirt and makeup well.  I am so pleased!!!!</li>
            <li> I also use it on my body. Helps with moisturizing and reducing itching and dryness. CeraVe makes excellent products for those with sensitive and very dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> terrible! broke me out with the first use</li>
            <li> Aggressive acne treatment and heredity has left my skin super-sensitive, red and itchy. A friend of mine recommended that I use this cleanser with the Cerave cream. Although I have oily skin, this actually results in less of an oily feel, despite being highly moisturizing. Love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to the ratings and neglected to view the ingredients.... every paraben and sulfate ever invented is in this stuff - horrible. Why aren&#x27;t these cancer causing chemicals illegal? I wish I didn&#x27;t have to worry about this - I wish none of us have to!</li>
            <li> Cleans well. Face and body feels clean after. I have to moisturize after using, but it gets the dirt and grime off first.</li>
            <li> If it helps, I have African American skin. I wanted something to help aid in healthy skin. I used this for months, twice a day in the morning and before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around the first few months, I massaged the foam with my fingers onto my face as it turned into foam once you move it circular motion. After a few seconds, the form disappears, but the stuff is still on your face. Then it says to rinse your face. Afterward, it left my face so dry that it felt like my face wanted to stretch from being so stiff. Sometimes I had to resort to putting on lotion afterward to get rid of that irritable feeling. I do have oily skin. But sometimes the extreme dryness was just too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then got a rotating facial brush and used CeraVe with that, thinking if I applied by a different method other than my fingers, I could probably see some results. I also left the foam on my face longer by putting on first, then brushing my teeth, and after my teeth are clean, I then rinse my face. But I got the same outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a smell, nor have I experienced it bothering my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still experienced acne. So, this wasn&#x27;t any kind of miracle worker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars for two reasons, 1) It did not seem to make my skin worse. So, that&#x27;s a plus. And 2) becuase for $8 to $10 you really do get your money&#x27;s worth in terms of quantity. It&#x27;s a big bottle and it will take forever to use every bit of it. But I&#x27;m down to at least 25% left, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m even going to bother with the rest. I&#x27;m now moving on to another product. There&#x27;s no reason for me to even waste my time any further this foam. But at least it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have an oily T-zone with a tendency to break out on my forehead and this stuff has definitely helped in controlling my oil and cleansing my face without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is definitely great and worth all the hype, it is not harsh at all on my skin which has been bullied so much over the years from use of the St. Ives Almond Scrub and various harsher cleansers. You won&#x27;t really feel that it does anything but you will see the results by using this cleanser. I use it every day at night and just lather it gently all over my face and wash it with warm water before patting with a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a staple to anyone&#x27;s skincare routine!</li>
            <li> Does as it says. But i&#x27;m still ugly. :(</li>
            <li> Best when used with an electric brush</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference after using this product, but I find it to be very refreshing on the face. It can&#x27;t hurt to use and its easy to apply so I use it anyway. After this bottle is finished I will go back to Dove soap and water.</li>
            <li> This facial wash works well. Really lathers well and gives your face a nice, refreshing, clean feeling. Also does well at lightening skin complexion. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this cleanser - very similar to Clinique&#x27;s facial foaming cleansers but a lot less money for a lot more product.  I would seriously consider repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I really prefer this over Cetaphil; it doesn&#x27;t leave a film but is just as kind to my sensitive skin. Seems to remove makeup better and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight. I only need about a half-pump per use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and certain cleansers turn my face red. This foams really well and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 days and I have really noticed an improvement the the evenness in color and texture of my skin.  This cleanser keeps my face from looking oily all day long.  No smell to the product at all. Easy to apply and rinses off easily. Excellent value and works great!</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling. I have oily skin, and this leaves my skin clean without feeling so dry. I have recommended this same product to friends. There is also a cleanser for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good to use, the natual formula can be used for any type skin. Low price and I am very satisfied for this product. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Never buying overpriced facial cleanser again!! The hyaluronic acid works wonder :) After just a couple of days I noticed a huge difference in my skin! I have combination/oily and other cleansers either dry out my skin or make my skin even more oily.</li>
            <li> i used it twice and had to return it.  created red, painful blotches on my face the very first time.  i tried it once more just to be sure.  now, i am sure that this is not a product that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have used 1 other product from crave and have not been bothered by it at all.  since the whole line is supposed to be very gentle and well-tolerated by most, i was surprised that my skin reacted so poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon was very helpful with the return process however.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT! No need to buy expensive face wash when this stuff does the trick at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well as a gentle cleanser - sometimes leaves my face a little dry but I think that is possibly dependent upon the weather</li>
            <li> I was skecptical about this stuff in the store being almost $20 so when i saw it on amazon for less than $10 i gave it a chance. Within 1 week i havent seen much of a change, maybe a lil more breakout (but from what i understand thats normal with new products) but my skin itself looks and feels amazing. I think im going to stick with this 1 for the long run. For my face i use just the CerVe morning and night and i mix it with body wash and scrub my back, arms and chest also morning and night. Will be posting updates but this so far seems to be better than the other things i tried. (noxzema, proactiv, knock off proactiv, etc)</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash. I use it with my Carlisonic brush. It&#x27;s gentle on your skin, but tough on dirt. It&#x27;s not scented. My skin is usually pretty sensitive to facial washes, so I was nervous about this one. But I really love it. However, I would not recommend using the CeraVe lotion with this - it&#x27;s too greasy and takes forever to soak into to your skin. You end up sticking to your pillow sheets at nigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this face wash - perfect. I love it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m 24 and have been dealing with horrendous acne since the age of 15.  I&#x27;ve been a long time Proactiv fan, but recently it seems like my acne has grown immune to it so I was back on the hunt to find new products.  I&#x27;ve tried several, including some prescription ones from my dermatologist but nothing seemed to tame the acne beast within!  Finally, I&#x27;m writing this review with the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had since I was a little girl (yes, even better than Proactiv when it was working for me!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this is by far the best daily cleanser to use.  It doesn&#x27;t over dry which even if you have oily skin like me, is very important.  Often times you won&#x27;t know if your cleanser is overdrying your face because your body will produce more oil to make up for it, and then you&#x27;ll have more acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you need a good exfoliator to clean away all of the dead skin and gunk that clogs your pores to begin with.  You have to be careful because a lot of exfoliators are so harsh on the skin that they can actually open up small microscopic sores that bacteria nestles inside of and creates acne.  My favorite exfoliator is [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]].  This one leaves your face feeling o so fresh!  Also, what&#x27;s best is that this exfoliator also doubles as the product you need for step 4 :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, a good spot treatment is needed!  The standard benzoyl peroxide and salycilic acid treatments tend to stop working before you even finish the first tube so it was hard for me to find one that worked really well.  Because I liked the exfoliator so much, I tried [[ASIN:B00LFT0CGM TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]  by the same brand and it has worked flawlessly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, a good mask that helps pull the impurities and bacteria from under the skin is needed about 2 to 3 times a week.  Yes MEN, even you guys should use this!  My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t have as bad of an acne problem as I do, but the acne he did have was remedied by just this step alone!  [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]]  is the same product as step 2 but instead of using it as a wash, you apply it to your damp face and let it dry for 15 minutes before using water to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do all 4 of these steps, I promise you&#x27;ll have much much much clearer skin :)mpurities and bacteria from under the skin is needed about 2 to 3 times a week.  Yes MEN, even you guys should use this!  My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t have as bad of an acne problem as I do, but the acne he did have was remedied by just this step alone!

            <li> Just what I ordered! Love this product.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 2.5 year, hasn&#x27;t let me down yet..</li>
            <li> My little kids have dry skin, and this is the first lotion that they say is not sticky!! It goes on nicely, absorbs quickly, and even after applying it liberally, pajamas do not stick.  A dermatologist recommended it to me, and we love it! (Better than Aveeno, which we had been using, and which the kids say &amp;#34;hurts&amp;#34; when they put it on.)</li>
            <li> Was given a sample size at my dermatologist 3 weeks ago and love it. Just received my order and am excited to see if it keeps working good for my face. I usually have very oily tough skin and tons of acne. My dermatologist put me on Tazorac and benzoyl peroxide. So my skin became so dry and irritated. I tried multiple face washes with no luck. Once I started using this face wash my redness and irritation went away almost instantly. My skin isn&#x27;t to dry and not itchy. It may be because my skin has gotten uses to the new meds but I truly believe it is because of this face wash! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I had acne on the low end of moderately bad on my forehead mainly, but also somewhat on my face. I tried antibiotics (helped, but I don&#x27;t feel right taking antibiotics for non-dangerous diseases/conditions), various OTC face liquids/creams/pads (never really worked and dried the hell out of my face), and this product works better than all of them. I just use it once daily because my face gets irritated really easily. From what I&#x27;ve found in reviews, this is much better than the 2x more expensive cetaphil products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries my face out just a little, but not enough that I use a moisturizer, because my face is very oily to begin with, and like I said it gets irritated very easily.</li>
            <li> It is not a harsh facial cleanser, but not sure how much of a difference it makes.  I still have plenty wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is it!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my combination skin. The Colorado winter takes all the moisture or if my skin. This is a great balance so that my face stays moisturized but not oily. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  Several years ago, my dermatologist told me to use it, and I have been devoted ever since.  The bottle lasts forever even with daily washing, it doesn&#x27;t sting if I get it in my eyes, and it rinses off perfectly without any residue.</li>
            <li> This product is not recommend for some with oily skin. Within a hour of use, my skin looked greasy plain and simple. I use it maybe one every two weeks if my skin is feeling a little dry but no more then that. It does have a light lovely scent and foams very nicely. This product is good for someone with dry skin. I would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect goods Let me feel happy is good quality and price is the reason why I always choose amazon</li>
            <li> Recommended by dermatologist for my teenage son&#x27;s acne.  His skin is clear and he continues to use the product which is gentle on his skin and restores the PH.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash, Its all I use. Cleans good!!</li>
            <li> It has parabens. Really, what still has parabens anymore?!</li>
            <li> This is the facial cleanser that I always use. It&#x27;s very gentle but my skin still feels very clean after.</li>
            <li> feel the oil get removed from your face, so somewhat drying but effective</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my sister who sensitive skin. She was happy with them.</li>
            <li> got this on time. I am 99% sure I ordered for normal to dry skin. That&#x27;s not what I got. I got for oil skin which drys my face out. I wish I had time to return it for the right one.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin and I can&#x27;t stand facial soap that doesn&#x27;t lather up. My dermatologist recommended this soap and I have been loving it ever since. It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out; it also doesn&#x27;t dry out you skin leaving that tight feeling after you wash your face. It definitely worth the price because a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It feels good. Very refreshing and toning. Leave your face very soft and with a moisturizing layer. Definitely I recommend it.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this because it was foam, and foam generally tended to dry up my face. However, this face wash turned out to be PERFECT and just what I needed: it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, it&#x27;s nice and gentle, doesn&#x27;t seem to cause breakouts. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and easy to use, it works very well with my skin and i use daily. Highly recommend this facial cleanser makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mostly because I was curious about this line of products being available for so many years, with an apparent ardent following.  I am so glad I did.  It is the only soap I have ever used that leaves my face feeling softer and hydrated afterwards.  No oily feeling.  Unusual especially for a transparent liquid.  I now give this as gifts and is well received!  They ask for more.</li>
            <li> Our go-to face cleanser for our teenage kids.  Gentle on their skin so as to not irritate teen skin.  They follow up with Cetaphil&#x27;s Moisturizing Lotion for All Skin Types and the acne has been helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> First time ever buying this but love it!  Going to be purchasing it for our RV as well.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love using this face wash. I have eczema and its extremely gentle on my skin and leave me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I switched off of my spendy clinique stuff to see if the cheap stuff could do as good of a job. I&#x27;m happy to say 6 months later that I have no regrets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that &amp;#34;foaming facial cleanser&amp;#34; is misleading though. I expected it to be foamy coming out of the spout... not just foamy after you rub it all over your hands or face like normal soap.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the CeraVe PM moisturizer and my acne is pretty much gone. I love this cleanser, it is gentle, fragrance-free, and effective! It cleans all my make up off wonderfully. I also use this when my kiddos have excema outbreaks. It is a wonderful product, excellent for sensitive skin in our household.</li>
            <li> CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser actually feels like you are doing something good for your skin.  Works better than the more expensive facial cleansers and leaves your skin soft and toned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and helping with my chronic acne problem. Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t really foam. When I got it I expected it to be a foam pump that pumps out foam, I was wrong. But I don&#x27;t have an issue with that, I think you are supposed to make it foam by using it. I would recommend this to everyone, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it is good for my sensitive skin as a pregnant. I used it on my face and neck every night. hydrating and no any feels of dry after washing face.</li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive skin and this cleanser does not irritate it. Unlike some of the creamier options, this product feels like it really cleans.</li>
            <li> Excellent for oily faced people.&lt;br /&gt;I even like the new turquoise packaging. Give it a try. Has yet to irritate my already stellar complexion. ;-)</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t feel tight after using this product. I&#x27;ve already bought an extra, would buy again. I&#x27;ve tried other facial cleansers like this the best.</li>
            <li> I worked in fast food for several years- KFC/A&amp;W to be exact- a place with LOTS of grease in the air.  Grease, grease, grease.  After I started using this everyday. I hardly ever had a zit, breakout or dry skin.  It&#x27;s slightly more expensive, but we&#x27;re talking about your face here!  Get it for yourself, even if only as a preventative measure!!!  This makes a wonderful gift for any teenagers or soon to be teenagers- I certainly wish i had known about this during high school.....</li>
            <li> Just FYI, when you pump out product, it doesn&#x27;t come out as foam. You have to lather it for it to become foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product does a good job removing my makeup and maintaining my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s great in one sense because it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, but I will be exploring for other, better cleansers for my skin type.</li>
            <li> well personally i would tell you to look else where, these didn&#x27;t have very much of an effect on me.</li>
            <li> The only cleanser I will ever use. Doesn&#x27;t overdry or leave my combo skin oily, but leaves it feeling clean. Takes off makeup like nobody&#x27;s business and rinses off nicely. Never had a breakout using this stuff. No more spending tons of $$ on cleansers for this gal.</li>
            <li> Accidentally purchased this product, but I like it pretty well.</li>
            <li> I take this into the shower with me to wash the grease off my shoulders and face/neck before application retinol cream. As other say, leaves your face noticably clean without excessive tightness. Apply a little retinol after washing and your skin will be good as new.</li>
            <li> Gentle facial cleanser. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser. Not heavy at all and it doesn&#x27;t conflict with my moisturizer or sun screen. Good for my dry sensitive face. Plenty of cleanser in this container.</li>
            <li> omg love this ....makes my face feel so soft and not at all dry will continue using this</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser it is not harsh and I believe it has balance my skin because I no longer have frequent blemish break outs.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Delivery and packaging were fine.  I bought this in error since it is for normal or oily skin and I have dry skin.  I gave it to a friend who has normal skin and they love it  CereVe has many good products.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and psoriasis; so, trying new skin care products is always a risk. This cleanser works well and is very gentle on skin. I have not experienced any irritation.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried. Does not create zits like some others do. Leaves my face feeling nothing but clean.</li>
            <li> This cleanser thoroughly removes dirt and makeup.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  Save your money for a nice serum.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and great product. It just refreshes my face without drying me out!&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my combination skin</li>
            <li> has made a noticeable improvement on the dark shading around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily/acne prone skin - and some wrinkles to add to the fun! - and have been really happy with this cleanser for the past 6 months. What I like best is that it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin nor does it feel tight after cleansing. It&#x27;s a gentle, straightforward wash that does the job and was easily incorporated into my skincare routine. I&#x27;ve tried many different washes from St. Ives, Aveeno, Clearasil, Neutrogena, etc. and they do not work as well for me as this CeraVe wash does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using clearasil and clean care for years, both dry up my skin and don&#x27;t actually work all that well. I was amazed when I first use this, noticed a difference after a day. After a 2 month of using this my skin is noticeable cleaner and haven&#x27;t had a pimple since I&#x27;ve started using it. Can&#x27;t say nothing but good things about this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleanser for years, i like it. Cerave make good products</li>
            <li> Gentle on the face and leaves it well moisturized too...</li>
            <li> Love it ,I can feel it the result,it was totally clean ,i hope also have a night cream ,i want to buy again ,thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Jury still out on this one.  I&#x27;m currently adding baking soda to the product when I am lathering it up with water in my hands before applying to my face.  I add the baking soda for exfoliating properties.  The product directions do not instruct the consumer to do this.  Not really sure how clean the product gets my face.  Using it in the shower does better than trying to get it all rinsed off over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;  I do like the fact that the product is clear in color and has no perfumes or dyes!  It is gentle.  Not much is needed, so it should last awhile.  I may give a status update in the future.  I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying this product.</li>
            <li> Works well. I use the lotion too :)</li>
            <li> Literally recommended by my dermatologist, this stuff is perfect. I have the most sensitive skin. It&#x27;s oily, dry, occasionally acne-ridden and sensitive to everything I&#x27;ve ever tried. Literally. My eyelids swell shut, my earlobes balloon and then crack...CeraVe is a lifesaver. I&#x27;ve never had a single issue. It evens my skin without leaving it too moist or dry. Most of the year I don&#x27;t even need to follow with moisturizer, though when I do, I only use CeraVe as well.</li>
            <li> I expected too much maybe. because of all the good reviews but this is not my style. I would pay more to buy a better one than this.</li>
            <li> After a bad breakout that would never go away I went to the dermatologist and he prescribed me tretinoin, but also recommended this CeraVe cleanser. I got it and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past few months. Tretinoin has made my skin very sensitive and at first it was really red and peeling. Despite that whenever I cleansed my face with this it didn&#x27;t irritate it at all. So since then my acne as cleared up significantly, but now I&#x27;m struggling from the scars left behind. I have CeraVe to thank in part for clearing my skin. I&#x27;ve continued to use CeraVe and it is a very good cleanser. It&#x27;s not harsh at all and leaves my skin feeling very clean and not tight feeling at all. The best way I can describe it is the feeling that my skin can breathe. I&#x27;ve used a lot of cleansers and this is close to the top of my list for the best. My skin is also fairly sensitive Anne this hasn&#x27;t irritated it at all. It lasts a long tim too, you only need a pea to dime size amount. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, especially those with sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, i do like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this and hydrating both.&lt;br /&gt;I love FOAMING FACIAL more. More comfortable, clean feel, non-irritant.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. NICE.</li>
            <li> Came on time and everything but wasn&#x27;t right for my skin, it made me break out with huge red blothces of acne</li>
            <li> Where was this all my life? I&#x27;m done with all the other sensitive skin washes including like cetaphil and such. It leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere (Sephora, Ulta) for a nice high end cleanser and was skeptical about getting this after using my Murad cleanser. But I bought this after I read all the great reviews. This product really cleans and hydrates your skin. It also seems to leave a nice glow. It cleans WAY better then Cetaphil as well. I will def. keep purchasing this product as it is less expensive but does a great job and I can save my money for other products (moisturizer, retinol, etc). :)</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this, was excited to try. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive, acne-prone skin and was hoping I might have found that secret weapon to solve my problem... But this only made my skin greasy and break out. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I was using the CeraVe Moisturizing Facial Cleanser for a bit, but when I switched over to this, I found that my face was much clearer after a week or so. It&#x27;s affordable, widely available, affective, and perfect for combination skin.</li>
            <li> The cleanser itself is quite good, but it was packed so badly, that half the bottle had leaked by time I got it, and it had leaked out of its plastic bag to damage other items in the package as well.</li>
            <li> This gives my face an incredibly clean feeling. I&#x27;m not enough of an expert to know how well it&#x27;s actually working but my experience with it has been very positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squirt handle seemed to become detached in shipped but I won&#x27;t knock the product for that.</li>
            <li> This, this is awesome face wash. Buy it and have a happy, not overly cleansed, tight mask-face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it with Complex 15 Moisturizing Face Cream. I was suffering from sever acne, and it&#x27;s completely gone. I won&#x27;t be switching products. Remember, when using a new product, it takes two weeks for your face to adjust. I don&#x27;t remember this causing any issues in the first two weeks, but even if a product does, you should really try to hold out. Switching products every few days is really hard on your face and can make things much worse. I promise this wash is amazing, and you should really give it a try. This bottle is very big and should last around two to three months, if you wash twice a day like me. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed! I have sensitive skin that would break out when using any other cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have zits or acne or whatever, but when I&#x27;d use a cleanser, my face would break out!&lt;br /&gt;Was very frustrated but heard great things about CeraVe so decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels clean when using it. It also feels soft and fresh! It was not harsh on my skin yet cleansed as it should.&lt;br /&gt;The other benefit is, if I use it at night before going to sleep, I don&#x27;t wake up the next day with oily skin - which was an issue with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> Good for me and my teenage kids. Keeps our faces undercontrol. Favorite wash and I have tried everything</li>
            <li> I started using CeraVe at the suggestion of a friend who is also an aesthetician. This is the first cleanser I&#x27;ve used that has not irritated my rosacea at all. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. Foaming action was great and left my face feeling clean. Expensive though</li>
            <li> CeraVe has suddenly become the holy grail skin care product lately it seems. Well at least to a newbie skincare person like me. What totally blew my mind was the fact that this is the 1st product I have EVER used that made me break out. I thought there was no way since all I&#x27;ve used before were much &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; grade products with much harsher chemicals. But alas, it was true. I got hard red rashes on my face and had to calm it down by putting oatmeal on it for weeks. I even tried to use it again after my skin calmed down and would react again to it. I had to give it to a friend whom reported she had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s fair to give less stars b/c i&#x27;m personally allergic to it but this was my personal experience. I especially got excited b/c they started carrying this brand in a lot of the local stores!</li>
            <li> Awesome for keeping my face clean and oil-free. Referred by my dermatologist and this price is a lot cheaper:)</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have been using this product from last summer when my dermatologist recommended this after a heat acne outbreak. Love this, its plain and simple - foaming facial cleanser without any additions. Foams well, if skin is too oily I try and wash face with this twice. It did definitely help me in controlling oil and keeping my face clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with oily skin must try this product at least once. Before this I have tried AcneFree, Neutrogena face wash (many products) but I like CeraVe the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I stopped using my prescription face cleanser and have used this for about 2 years now. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s cleaning your face because it&#x27;s clear but if I am not breaking out it must be working!</li>
            <li> Does not dry out face. Delivered on time. Good size.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time (been going on a few months now) and is a perfect cleaner without having extra acne-fighting drying ingredients or anything. just a perfect simple face wash. i wear make-up every day and this does a good job getting all the makeup off without any extra effort. i plan to order again and again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> Love this product! It cleans without drying out. Works really well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash.  I started using it based on others&#x27; reviews and have not been disappointed.  1 pump is all it takes to wash your face, so a bottle lasts a pretty good amount of time.  This face wash has helped reduce redness that comes from dryer winter conditions, but it&#x27;s definitely suitable for year round use.  I usually alternate between this and good ole St Ives apricot scrub for some exfoliation, then follow up with Thayers toner and Nivea sensitive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe&#x27;s Foaming Facial Cleanser.  My skin is sensitive and tends to break out easily.  I think I have used this cleanser longer and more consistently than anything I have ever used because it works with my skin so well.  I use this all over my body with a puffy sponge.  It lathers really well and has cleared my facial and body breakouts.  I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed by blemishes and &amp;#34;bacne&amp;#34;.  If you have sensitive skin, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> Caused whiteheads, somehow it interfered with every shaving product I tried to use, made shaving impossible,. My skin would breakout all the time. The ingredient list is also unsettling. Went back to oatmeal soap, 4 weeks later my skin is getting back to normal.</li>
            <li> Really thought this brand would be best for my face. It works well but has chemicals that I did not expect. Apparently to make it foam they have to use them as the non-foaming cleaner they make is without those chemicals.</li>
            <li> I did not order this -I ordered cerave foaming facial cleanser as recommended by my husbands dermatologist.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s cleaning and my face broke out from it, so I was surprised to see Cerave facial cleanser isn&#x27;t as hypoallergenic as the soap they make.</li>
            <li> I used this product every time I showered. My skin was pretty good and clear before I started using this product but I got it to help with blackheads. This product caused me to start breaking out and developing pimples. I thought it was just &amp;#34;the product working and bringing the dirt and grime to the surface&amp;#34; like I always hear. Unfortunately, I kept breaking out (two or three pimples) even after using this product consistently for a month. I decided not to use this anymore and my skin is slowly healing. I won&#x27;t use this again and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The foaming cleanser does what it says, completely cleans my face without making it feel tight or overly dry. It doesn&#x27;t completely remove all my eye makeup but it&#x27;s not an eye makeup remover so that&#x27;s fine. Overall I would recommend it for someone with acne or oily skin who needs a thorough but gently cleanser.</li>
            <li> Gentle, no strong smell, and my skin has improved since I started using it last June. A little expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> As someone who had quite a bit of acne through high school and college, I was so glad I came upon Cerave. After using this product twice a day (usually during my morning shower and before bed), I noticed that my skin was smoother and pimped faded after only a day or two. I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently now for almost a year and I rarely break out at all. I&#x27;m so happy I found this product and I highly recommend that you give it a try!</li>
            <li> I tried this facewash because my doctor said I might have the beginnings of rosacea. I was very disappointed. My face didn&#x27;t feel clean, and it caused my skin to break out like crazy. I&#x27;ll stick with Philosophy&#x27;s Purity facewash.</li>
            <li> Super light face wash, no residue and great for mixed skin types.  My dermatologist suggested I start using, skin feels like it can breathe 10x more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing twice per day (morning and night) and have noticed a drastic reduction in spotty patches of light acne especially on my forehead. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Anything with hyaluronic acid in it makes me break out.  Funny too because I never break out due to a course of Accutane a few years back.  My BF is a doctor, and he (and our dermatologist) love the whole CeraVe line.  I cannot fault the product for my sensitivity to the ingredients, hence the five stars.  He uses this in the summer months and the hydrating in the winter.  He looks ten years younger than he is.  FYI he also uses retin-a.</li>
            <li> I had been using an Olay foaming cleanser for sensitive skin, but my dermatologist recommended I switch to the CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loooove this cleanser! It gently foams and removes all my makeup - even mascara - without drying my skin out. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after using this, but clean and refreshed. I&#x27;ve also tried the CeraVe Hydrating cleanser. It&#x27;s great, too, but it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup like the foaming cleanser does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the convenient design, too. It easily sits in the medicine cabinet, to the side of the sink, in the shower, etc. and easily pumps out. The bottle is huge. My boyfriend and I both use this daily for over a month, and it&#x27;s still half-full. I imagine this would last one person 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> good facial cleanser , love it</li>
            <li> This product showed up open and spilled inside of the box. Unusable.</li>
            <li> Nice for oily skin. I will definitely buy it again. Not too expensive!</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin that reacts negatively to probably everything. But this is PERFECT. I don&#x27;t have bad acne at all I had a lot of flesh colored bumps and would break up before my awesome time of the month. But this has cleared me up greatly. I usually also have a pinkish/red complexion but this has also cleared that up. I love it. I hope it always works because if so I found the best facial cleanser ever!!! And trust me I&#x27;ve tried everything. Even the expensive organic stuff from Kiehls.</li>
            <li> I found this very drying.  I used to have much oilier skin, but it still has the capacity to slick up.  But, this stuff sucks every bit of moisture out of my face.  I&#x27;m flaky.  Skin-wise!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash, doesn&#x27;t dry and holds moisture in. Great deal too! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> My teenage son swears by the soap and won&#x27;t use any other for his face</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser in conjunction with CeraVe’s moisturizer in a tub and max strength Stridex as part of a twice daily facial routine. My skin is a mixture, oily some places, dry in others, and acne prone all over. I’ve tried a lot of cleansers, but most either don’t clean my skin enough, or leave it feeling stripped and dry. For me, CeraVe’s Foaming Facial Cleanser is the perfect medium. It makes my skin feel clean, but not squeaky, and has been a major help in my battle against acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price may seem steep, but the bottle is actually fairly large, and a single pump is more than enough to use each wash. The liquid is clear and non-scented (it doesn’t have a medicinal smell either) and washes off easily. Especially great is that it’s non-irritating. When I use it I don’t break out, I don’t even get a little red in the cheeks. Contrary to the name, I don’t know that it really “foams,” but it does bubble up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re feeling a little hesitant to buy, CeraVe does send out free samples from time to time, and I would absolutely recommend trying it out. I doubt you’re be disappointed. CeraVe makes great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used several cleansers and this is the only one that takes off all of your makeup. You don&#x27;t need to use any makeup remover. I don&#x27;t wear heavy eye makeup but it takes off eye shadow, eye liner and mascara. Face feels clean and fresh after each use!</li>
            <li> I wash my face at least once a day in the shower and I used to use Cetaphil face wash, but it never felt like it was doing much. My face felt a little cleaner afterwards, but the Cetaphil face wash never really felt like it was spreading or even on my face, it was too &amp;#34;liquidy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This CeraVe foaming facial cleanser has been working well for me so far and my face feels clean and smooth after using it. I can tell that it&#x27;s spreading and actually sticking because of the way it foams up. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarassed to say that until maybe a month ago, I didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d been cleaning my face with exfoliating scrubs.  I used the St. Ives Apricot Scrub, followed by Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub on a near-daily basis.  No wonder my skin has gone all crazy!  So I researched the best cleansers for COMBINATION (oily/dry) SKIN, and this beat out many other pricier options.  Plus, they sell this at Walmart for the same price, so if I need some quicker, I can grab some while running errands too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWHOO!  The second after I rinse my face with this, my skin feels SO HYDRATED.  Not oily, not dry, or overly tingling like w/ Noxema products.  JUST CLEAN AND FRESH!  Haha using a facial CLEANSER instead of scrapig off the top layers of your face and expensive self tanner every day... who knew??  Excited to have this in my new daily regimen!</li>
            <li> It seems good, but the foam is not as robust as I had hoped.  Mediocre makeup removing capabiity.  Feels like Cetaphil to me.</li>
            <li> First of all, since there are currently multiple products listed on the product page, I&#x27;d like to note that this review is for the foaming facial cleanser, which I have now been using for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this cleanser to be mild and non-irritating. I don&#x27;t know that it foams all that much for me, but that&#x27;s not particularly important to me so I&#x27;m not letting it impact my rating. I think this product does an excellent job at removing sweat and oils (I use it in the shower after exercising), which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t list the ingredients because they&#x27;re available in one of the product images. Zoom in to the photo of the back of the product bottle to see the complete list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this contains niacinamide, which reduces unwanted skin coloration (from red marks, etc.). I do think this is helping with that problem, although I should note that I am also using a CeraVe facial sunscreen that contains additional niacinamide, so I am perhaps getting a double dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid will be especially moisturizing (without increasing grease or oil). Please note that much of the hyaluronic acid currently used in the cosmetics industry is a byproduct of poultry processing, although it can also be expressed in bacteria. I do not know the source of the hyaluronic acid in this product, but you should be aware that this may not be a vegan product (if that is important to you). This product also contains several parabens if you are watching out for those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I think this is a mild but effective facial cleanser. I will definitely finish the bottle I have and would consider buying more, as well. The current Amazon price is highly competitive with anything I&#x27;ve seen in local stores.</li>
            <li> Great face wash - does the job. Wish it was scentless though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and I don&#x27;t normally go out of my way to try out a lot of different facial cleansers but considering I have oily skin I decided to make an effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the way this stuff makes my skin feel after using it.  It feels smoother and somehow even a bit firmer, but maybe that&#x27;s my imagination.  But above that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to use it twice a day, but usually just once in the shower and it&#x27;s helped prevent oil-induced acne.</li>
            <li> Many people give this product a very favorable review base primarily on its effectiveness. I would advise interested buyers research the ingredient list thoroughly before purchasing this product. Like many other generic (cheaper) alternatives sold on the market, this product contains Propylparaben and Methylparaben. The former is relatively more serious with a maximum health concern score of 10 which indicates a high overall hazard while the latter ingredient scored a 4. While this may not apply to everyone, I would think a bit more research on your own may help you make more informed decision on this product. For example, if you one of your previous cleanser did not performance up to your expectation, you should try to find out the source, perhaps compare ingredient of the two products. Many people are allergic to Propylparaben so make sure you know that the inclusion of this chemical is not going to work against whatever you wish to achieve with this specific product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I enjoyed the product and so far, I am not aware that propylparaben cause any negative reactions to my skin. Like any product, do a quick research will help you go a long way!</li>
            <li> I have had acne prone and dry skin all of my life.  My skin has been sensitive and have been switching through many different brand name products.  I was surprised how much my skin responded to this product within one use.  I gave this product 5-stars because of the price and quality.  It does what it is described to do and I recommend this for those who have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to break the bank.</li>
            <li> I bought this face wash because I started breaking out in specific areas. It&#x27;s unusual for me to break out so much like that so I panicked. I bought this because I heard some reviews about it diminishing acne scars, clears skin and removes make up. I waited a while before I wrote a review, so I at least used it for a good time. It didn&#x27;t clear my skin, but it&#x27;s good face wash in the sense that my face feels clean,refreshed and removes my makeup. I&#x27;ve been using another product and I&#x27;ve had amazing results.</li>
            <li> Into a beautiful face!  This wash cleans gently and makes your face feel smoother.  I look 80 years younger, past embryo stage, into a single cell contained in a carbon based life form of similar deoxyribonucleic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> my best friend&#x27;s mom recommended this for me so I bought it on sale at my local walgreens.  she said it worked great for her but unfortunately it just made my face breakout more especially my forehead which was never really a problem area before.  I like to think i gave it fair trial of a few weeks with no imrovement. I have very oily skin so this might be better for those with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin or even combination skin. btw not sure if I like the idea of parabans in my face wash but if it wasn&#x27;t safe I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t still be on the market.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product. It is the only face wash I have ever used on my dry, acne-prone skin that did not irritate my skin, nor leave it stinging, tight, and dry. I have been using one pump on my face at night with lukewarm water for about a month now, in combination with a benzoyl peroxide gel on my problem areas and CeraVe Moisturizer (in the tub) as per suggestions from acne.org and reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction. I am happy to report that my skin has begun to get better. I no longer have dry patches and my skin feels very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only cleanser I have ever used that I felt cleansed my skin without removing all of the moisture! I will definitely be buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser ever!! Leaves your face feeling very clean and smooth. I&#x27;ve gotten my aesthetician to start recommending it to other clients bc she has seen such an improvement to my skin!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. My skin gets quite oily but I&#x27;ve noticed that after using it for a while my skin has been less oily. Also, I have acne prone skin. I don&#x27;t break out with this product and my face has actually cleared up a lot! I usually get dry, tight skin with most face washes but this face wash leaves my skin feeling very moisturized and clean with out stripping the natural oils my face needs. Another plus is that it cleans away all my make up. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this CeraVe facial cleanser together with the day and night moisturisers for my 27 year old daughter as a gift, and she absolutely loves it.  She has now been using it for a few months and cannot believe how clear and smooth her skin is.  Although she does not have very bad skin problems she still always seemed to have some sort of breakout no matter what she tried.  She now cannot wait to try the other CeraVe products.</li>
            <li> I use Acanya for acne treatment which is very drying on the skin. This cleanser is so gentle and actually make your skin refreshed after washing without that tight/stiff feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good; recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that is foams makes it much lighter on your skin than Cetaphil which feels slimy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Gave me instant whiteheads near my nose and dried out my lips for some reason.</li>
            <li> Doesnt clear acne very well, but it doesnt leave skin oily after wash. Kinda helps keep skin moist</li>
            <li> Seriously great cleanser. It boasts a PH OF 5.5, so it is perfect for maintaining your skin&#x27;s ideal PH.</li>
            <li> Great foaming face wash. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> cleans without drying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the right skin routine for me. I&#x27;m glad I bought this cleanser. It works great for my skin (even though I have combination skin). It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face either</li>
            <li> I get some really bad acne at times and so I result to using some 10% benzoyl peroxide products. I usually use this beforehand and it works great at cleaning any dirt or oils (the bad oils), without leaving your face dry. If I have bad acne at the time I usually get a bit of baking soda, add water to it, and apply to my face. It dries my face a bit and sometimes makes it burn, but I then wash my face with this cleanser and it soothes it all away. My face usually clears up quickly like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I just rambled on about some BS, but this product works well. Better than most face washes/cleansers I have paid more for.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know technically what makes this so good, but it just feels so superior to other face washes. This will be a regular purchase.</li>
            <li> Clean smell and very light.  Has a nice soft feel to skin after rinsing face.  Definitely will keep buying this brand.</li>
            <li> Overall I really this facial cleanser. It cleanses my face very well and easily washes away makeup. I will say that for the price I was expecting it to also clear breakouts. ( For me it doesn&#x27;t help clear them up.) It does work great as an everyday/night facial cleanser though! It is great for sensitive skin ( Mine is very sensitive and this hasn&#x27;t been irritating my skin at all), It&#x27;s very gentle!&lt;br /&gt;The size of the bottle is awesome! It will last me atleast a couple months or maybe more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s not great. I am pretty sure it&#x27;s drying out my skin, which is weird because I don&#x27;t believe there are any traditional &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; ingredients. I am going to try some other products. My skin is dark brown, and I am a male.</li>
            <li> Love the cleanser! It is gentle, effective, and I even think it&#x27;s helped with my breakouts!</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 days of daily use It has my skin feeling smoother and softer and with less bumps than before.</li>
            <li> Had terrible breakouts when i started using this. I had alot of whitehead appearing out of nowhere. Use this at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean, but hasn&#x27;t helped noticeably with breakouts with about 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;In fact my forehead has broken out more.&lt;br /&gt;Will update when I&#x27;m sure if it is this or not.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin, and it&#x27;s always a struggle to find a cleanser that cleans well without aggravating my skin. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry. My only complaint it that I assumed this came out of the nozzle AS foam (as some products I have used in the past), but it does not. I guess it was my misunderstanding, but if I knew that I probably would have bought the hydrating one instead of the foaming one.</li>
            <li> Whole family uses these products and dermatologist recommended it as well so we have been spot on. Gentle enough for those in their older years and strong enough for those coming of age. Rinses away with no residue but always moisterize after. Feel great skin after use over and over.  It&#x27;s a staple in my home.</li>
            <li> Nice clean feeling! All around good soap; I only use it on my face</li>
            <li> It feels very refreshing and minty, but it doesn&#x27;t keep my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am a really big fan of this face wash! I was a set a fill use her for probably 10 years until I try this and I like the fact that it foams and the smell better than set a fill. I find that it is comparable in the effect on cleaning. The price is really great with subscribe and save over buying it in the store!</li>
            <li> I switched from Cetaphil to this wash and like it and it feels like it lasts longer</li>
            <li> Have to use a lot of the product. Doesn&#x27;t lather well. Great for a quick wash though. Doesn&#x27;t hurt eyes.</li>
            <li> Felt good, cleaned well, but gave me closed comedomes. I use their Hydrating version now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t keep my skin clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this facial cleanser, having never heard of this brand before. This cleanser successfully removes dirt, grease, and grime, but it doesn&#x27;t leave skin as dry as other face washes I have used in the past. I was surprised at how well it cleans, because it doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;detergenty&amp;#34; as the other face washes. Used with the moisturizing lotion from the same brand, my skin feels really supple, soft, and toned.</li>
            <li> thickish  - need a lot of water to make foam, works well - best I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> Great cleanser! Bought this for myself, my mom, and now my sister has it too, lol! It works best when you mix it with A LOT of water (equal parts almost) and scrub it in your hands till a lot of foam is made. Then, I gently rub it all over my skin. Very refreshing, and not drying at all! I have oily skin and I prefer this to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Great gentle face wash.  It removes my makeup and my dermatologist uses it herself as well!</li>
            <li> Always the best face cleaner</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me. Been using this face wash for 6 years now and will continue to use it and recommend it to everyone. It really does the trick of washing away all impurities, giving my face a bright glow after each use. I noticed a positive change in the appearance of my skin after first starting CeraVe. Less breakouts and hydrated soft skin. This face wash also works great as hand soap (if you&#x27;re willing to use it for your hands as it can be pricey). As for a moisturizer after washing my face, I use CeraVe&#x27;s SA Renewing moisturizer which is a lifesaver. It never leaves my face feeling oily!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out from using this product but it is rather drying.  I haven&#x27;t seen any specific benefits to my skin but am continuing to use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most facial washes will make me breakout in rash or will dry my skin out so much that i peel. YUCK! This product is only slightly drying, and I am sure if you have normal to oily skin, this will be PERFECT for you! I use CeraVe&#x27;s morning and night moisturizers and that completely fixes the slight drying this wash causes for me! This has been keeping my skin soft and clear! Great product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> So I just bought this item and when I put it on it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling stiff like how other lotions leave my face feeling and I do have a little acne so when I used this for the first time, I saw the skin that was pretty dead from the acne start to come off which revealed nice soft skin and the pimples are already going away in one use. This dried up some pimples then the pimples feel off and was left with beautiful skin even with just one use! Definitely recommend this product even for people with acne .</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser just based off the reviews here on Amazon. I wear primer and makeup every day, so I normally use St. Ives Apricot Scrub (or the Walmart generic) because it&#x27;s the only thing that makes me feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;. Well, I keep reading about how using scrubs every day is not the best for oily/acne prone skin. I had tried a cetaphil cleanser and was NOT impressed. Felt like it didn&#x27;t take all my makeup off. CeraVe is amazing though! I just need to use a small amount and it REALLY cleans without being harsh on my face. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, but at the same doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I highly recommend this for ALL skin types!</li>
            <li> This face wash is really great, it works as well and feels as high quality as much more expensive products, like those from Clinique. It&#x27;s a great alternative.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on Amazon, I got this CeraVe cleanser and moisturing cream for my mom who was having some type of skin poisoning after using old creams and makeup on her face. Helped clear away her skin and now her face looks more youthful than before!</li>
            <li> Best facial cream cleanser I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> So far its working well with a twice daily face wash. I moved from harsher face washes to this and I don&#x27;t think I will be going back. 4 stars because the pump on mine did not last as long as the wash inside.</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleanser that i&#x27;ve used thats actually made a difference. I know this brand is very popular in the skincare community, but I had no idea what to expect. I have extremely oily skin that is very acne prone, and many facial products only seem to further irritate it. The best I could get before was washing my face with water because cleansers were such an issue, Water at least didn&#x27;t make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is my go to now. It was a last resort and it made a world of difference for me, and those changes were noticeable in about a week. Even on my period, I had minimal-no breakouts. This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> /r/skincareaddiction in Reddit recommended this paired with Stridex ex-foliating pads, and as someone who has had moderate to light acne ever since puberty (now 21) this really works. I&#x27;ve tried other things in the past to no avail, but this combination has finally provided results. I also recommend buying sulfate free shampoo, toothpaste, and body wash, because I made that switch the same time I purchased this, and it is a very noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> This a wonderful face cleanser. It is fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. I use it with my clarisonic mia and it foams up nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this face wash (Foaming Facial Cleanser - for Normal to Oily Skin) because I read that it was good for helping improve acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and haven&#x27;t really noticed much reduction in my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one pro is that it does seem pretty gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old female with the acne of a 16 year old. I never struggled with breakouts as a teenager but once I hit young adulthood, my face decided to go crazy. I&#x27;ve also been off birth control for a little over a year (wacked out hormones) and so my face continued to explode with bumps!! I am currently a full time student but I used to work for a few different prestige cosmetic brands including Chanel, Benefit, and Bare Escentuals. I was a Clinique 3-step user for years! I have tried the best of the best skincare and none of it has worked as well as CeraVe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have an oily T-zone but the rest of my skin would be considered pretty &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (not too dry and not too oily). I get cystic bumps and whiteheads on my chin and forehead. Some of these are incredibly painful. I have tried benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid spot treatments but they always seem to irritate the bumps and I end up picking them off anyway (super gross I know!). Finding CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser has been a godsend. I use it morning and night to take off all of my makeup (including my eye makeup). It is so gentle but I feel like I am cleaning everything off of my face! My face does not feel tight after I finishing cleansing. So many other cleansers that I have tried for normal to oily skin always make my face feel so tight after I wash. I finish up with the CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion and my face feels so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have been using the CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser for around 6 months and my face is looking so much better! I still get the occasional breakout (usually around my time of the month) but it is so much better than it was before I started using the cleanser. I am so glad to finally find a reasonably priced, effective, and gentle cleanser to help clear up my acne. Don&#x27;t waste your money on department store brands! CeraVe is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite for the shower. The whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li> I like the foaming cleanser, it&#x27;s clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is a perfect everyday wash for my face.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very gentle, slightly foaming cleanser that is good for my slightly sensitive skin. Much better price than in my regular drugstore.</li>
            <li> I originally started with the moisturizing cleanser and that worked great for most of my face, but it made my forehead way to oily all the time. So I figured I&#x27;d try out the foaming cleanser.....It&#x27;s really drying my face out and I&#x27;m breaking out in acne more so than I did before and that is with me using CereVe moisturizer after I cleanse as well.  I only assume it&#x27;s because of this product. Very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I like CeraVe products a lot, so I agree with the majority of the positive reviews. However, I want to point out one important thing to consumers who might scan only the rating summary before making a purchase: The summary appears to be an aggregate of reviews for ALL CeraVe products in ALL sizes, including pump, tube, and jar. Therefore, consider doing a little more research on the item you want so you can make a more informed decision. My skin, for example, handles the Foaming Facial Cleanser and Hydrating Cleanser differently, as they are completely different products--one produces a light foam, while the other is a milky lotion--and both remove makeup with different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with once-oily and now normal skin, I find both moisturizers to be the tiniest bit heavy in all but the driest months in the Northeast, and the Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser stung at first. It took my skin time to adapt to the niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. The Hydrating Cleanser is very gentle but perhaps better used a first or second cleanser for removing makeup and sunscreen, especially if you use mineral-based products.</li>
            <li> After researching for a facial cleanser I came across CeraVe products and I&#x27;m delighted!&lt;br /&gt;This particular cleanser leaves my face soft, minus any redness and has also cleared my pores.  There is a bit of dryness here and there but very minimal.  However, a good moisturizer takes care of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I would def. recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is conjunction with chemically exfoliating every day with mild glycolic and salicylic acids, benzyol peroxide on acne-prone areas, and a light day moisturizer/heavy night moisturizer has made my skin clear, and more even toned than it&#x27;s ever been, which is saying something for someone with chronic red face syndrome and hormonal acne issues. Love cerave lotion on my body too (doesn&#x27;t do well with my face).</li>
            <li> If you want a very basic cleanser that removes most oil from your skin, this may do it for you, but I feel like my skin starts to feel oily again shortly after using it.  I had pretty high expectations considering all of the great reviews, but it ended up just not being for me.</li>
            <li> very gently washed.....</li>
            <li> This wash is of good value for preventing acne and is best for oily skin.  Stay away if you have dry skin - there is another formula by Cerave that is for normal to oily skin and won&#x27;t dry it out.  My skin was somewhat oily before I started using this but it makes my face appear dryer so now I switched to the other formula because I have no oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash! It is not to light, nor to heavy, and the foaming action helps me see that I am getting my whole face clean.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser on the market. The formula foams up nicely and removes the residue from my makeup remover. It is also gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. I use it at night in the shower and in the morning before my makeup.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin and does a really good job of cleansing without drying out your skin. Doesn&#x27;t do too well against make-up though (this is according to my wife, seeing as I&#x27;m not a make up wearing type of guy) but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. Would definitely purchase again. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Such great Quality...!&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed on this review! I am 30 and dealing with acne for the first time in my life. I heard the reviews and gave this a go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I just have really sensitive skin. It the ingredients acid and niacin made my face super flush like beer red, dry and itchy. I want to love this and keep using it but I don&#x27;t know if I can work around the side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wax my eyebrows every two weeks and this is my two week mark with CeraVe and it ripped skin off!!! It&#x27;s so bad. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do kind of like the way my skin has kind of cleared up but it hurts to rub my eyes, my skin is just super thin now....you decide! I&#x27;m surprised no one has talked about the flushing, itching or anything like that. Maybe it&#x27;s just me! :(</li>
            <li> I like it. It is just a bit drying for me personally.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and I am a guy that has really sensitive skin, and I gotta be careful which Items I pick to clean my face with, this item is really gentle on the face, does not have any &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation, and leaves your face feeling soft each time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Keeps my skin looking great.</li>
            <li> best cleanser I have used ever</li>
            <li> I used this product in combination of Retin A and clindamycin phosphate to treat acne. While other cleansers caused severe irritation such as extreme redness or red bumps, this one did not. What i like about this product is its gentle nature towards sensitive skin or skin that is undergoing tropical treatments. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cleansers. I&#x27;ve probably repurchased twice already. It didn&#x27;t aggravate my acne when I had a lot of acne, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it too often. I use it once a week. Yes, this thing will dry out your face if you use it too often like all cleansers because that&#x27;s the nature of cleansers. If you use it once in a while it will give your face a nice feeling and make you look healthier.</li>
            <li> Buy on Amazon. Cheaper than &#x27;big box&#x27; stores! Amazing product, suggested by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I was having random acne issues and grew tired of it. I have very pale and sensitive skin and this did the trick for me. No more (mild) acne!  Works for me.</li>
            <li> If your skin tends to develop those awful white, under the skin, bumps / pustules with most washes and lotions, you know how frustrating the search for a non-irritating wash and lotion can be.  I strayed from Alpha Hydrox (wash) and Oil of Olay (lotion) to try Cerave products and (unfortunately) have had terrible luck with them. My skin had some very large bumps within 6 hours and it has taken a week for them to finally go away.  I know the reviews for both CeraVe products were so great...I was hoping both would work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face twice daily for a little over a year now. My acne has cleared; and my face is soft as a babies bottom. I also use the Moisturizing Cream. Fantastic product..</li>
            <li> At night wash with this cleanser (does not foam for me which is unimportant). Next put some Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar on a cotton ball and dilute with water. Finally pat the entire skin area with the cotton ball. In the daytime use the same instructions but use a high rated moisturizer as a 3rd and final step. Note to always be careful about not getting regular shampoo on your face in the shower, It will screw up your face. NOTE TO BE SURE YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC TO DAIRY PRODUCTS. I MISTAKENLY ATE MACARONI AND CHEESE AND SURE ENOUGH ACNE. I PUT 2 + 2 TOGETHER A FEW DAYS LATER AND WAS MAD AT MYSELF. I KNEW BEFORE HAND I WAS ALLERGIC BUT I GUESS I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN!</li>
            <li> For normal to oily skin. Gentle and effective. I will definitely buy it again. I don&#x27;t have any other comments.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a gentle facial pore brush before I go to bed and my face loves it.</li>
            <li> Works great...only need to use a tiny amount.....Great value and price</li>
            <li> Does not foam very well on skin</li>
            <li> For the price of the cleansing solution, it does the job done and leave your facial clear and clean. Will be getting my next refills again. Great price and quality product</li>
            <li> Used a ton of face washes and these sensitive ones tend to produce the least dry skin. I used cetaphil for a long time then was turned on to this stuff and I honestly think it works better. Anything with a fragrace or other effects really isn&#x27;t worth it for everyday use, they just dry your skin out or worse irritate it.</li>
            <li> Deep cleaning and a Soft touch after... what else can anyone ask for!&lt;br /&gt;Great cleanser!</li>
            <li> great product and price.</li>
            <li> How deceptive.  I&#x27;m over 50 an I can&#x27;t use this skin cleanser for oily skin.  Really!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that worked on my break outs. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my skin shine after washing with it. I feel so refreshing and clean after using it.  I wish it does not contain parabens (preservatives that MIGHT cause beast cancer)</li>
            <li> This is my everyday facial cleaner. It is gentle and makes my skin happy.</li>
            <li> Recommended in the book Toss the Gloss available on Amazon.  I have used expensive lines for many years until I read the great recommendation. I am impressed!  52 y/o skin that has a tendency to be oily has experience no breakouts and my skin doesn&#x27;t have them same dried out feeling that I experienced with so many other products.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts and this has been working great for me.</li>
            <li> This is my HG. Derm recommended this years ago and it&#x27;s all I will use. Not drying but is great for oily skin!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s good. I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> best makeup remover and face wash I have used in a long time will buy this all the time from now on</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really foam. I prefer the moisturizing kind for &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> Mild Face wash, Lovely Fragrance and is a good cleaner.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, refreshing face wash that removes oil but does not leave my skin feeling dry.  Similar concept to Cetaphil, but I like it better, and the price is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> I dont feel like this helps that much. I use it every morning and dont notice a lot. Im sure it would help woman with removing makeup or the dirt on the very surface of your face but i prefer Benzoyl peroxide face wash more than this. It&#x27;s also not very foamy, only slightly.</li>
            <li> Men, you need to wash your face, and you need to buy a good facial cleanser (not body wash). This is the way to go. Good amount for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser along with the lotion for normal to dry skin which provides the perfect balance for my oily skin.  For the most part my skin is very oil but my cheeks at times are dry.  I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleansers even the pricey ones and this has worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test came when i had to stop using them because i had my eyebrows tattooed and couldn&#x27;t because of the hyaluronic acid, which dermatologist recommend all your cleansers should have.  Well within a week and a half i had a slight acne breakout.  Once i was able to start back using it but was careful to not touch my eyebrows my face has cleared back up.  The scars from my slight breakout also lightened up.  I haven&#x27;t used my clarisonic in months because this products cleanses very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a nice natural glow an no longer have flaky cheeks with a shiny forehead and chin.  I do believe using both the cerave cleanser and lotion works together. If i used one and not the other the results may not be as expected.</li>
            <li> I received a sample bottle of the cerave facial cleanser from a dermatologist, along with a lotion and cream sample. Using that little sample bottle for a week got me hooked. The foaming cleanser is refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance added in that could irritate the skin. I noticed a marked improvement in my skin texture and a reduction of breakouts. I have finally found the right cleanser for me!</li>
            <li> Get it with my monthly shipments of household products. Great price</li>
            <li> Best product found for super sensitive skin. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.....</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used on my pale, sensitive skin. At 27, I still get acne even with a healthy lifestyle. After using this for a couple weeks my skin is almost completely clear. Wish I had started using this years ago instead of harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my sensitive skin. I tend to break out AND have be somewhat dry, and this is great. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too tight either.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this. I cannot figure out why.  My rough skin has gotten rougher and more itchy- the opposite of what I was going for.  I also experience harsh tingling and redness.  I feel like sending HIM a bill for the cost of this cleanser and the AM moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this is good cleanser, good for sensitive skin and make my skin smooth. I like it.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my skin (combination). It ended up drying out my skin, even around the oily parts (t-zone).</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years now and I really enjoy it. I use it twice a day during each shower. I find it cleans my skin so I can properly apply my face creams. Helps my face shine!</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser! Easy on your skin and works well.</li>
            <li> I have always had troublesome skin.  As an adult, it is embarrassing to have to deal with acne like a teenager.  I am very impressed with CeraVe.  I started using the oily skin formula, but it has balanced me out so well that I have moved to the normal skin version.  I have tried it all in the past - prescription and non - this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the hydrating cleanser from CeraVe and it really felt as though that cleanser wasn&#x27;t doing anything--it was far too watery. However, this Foaming Cleanser which I&#x27;ve purchased many times even through Amazon gives you a nice lather that makes it feel as though as your face IS really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative is that the packaging job is terrible. Its put into a plastic bag. I believe out of the 6 or 7 times I&#x27;ve ordered CeraVe products (the cream moisturizer as well) from amazon, 2 of the Foaming Cleansers have come covered in the cleanser from leaking, 1 of the Hydrating Cleanser came leaking, and 1 of the CeraVe Moisturizing Creams came exploded.&lt;br /&gt;Leaking means that the bottle and such are intact but some of the product has leaked into the plastic bag. Essentially the bottle is covered in sticky cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a review of the product and I do love the CeraVe Moisturizing Cleanser. I believe it helps immensely keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> Buy four bottles, a bottle to leak.</li>
            <li> really works at removing makeup feels great</li>
            <li> Good price and good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Dried me out and made my acne worse. Sorry but it didn&#x27;t work for me. The hydrating version is a little bit better but not when combined with benzoyl peroxide- burns.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Great price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gentle face wash that makes my skin feel oil free.  It doesn&#x27;t have any scent to it which is because I don&#x27;t want fruity (or girly) smells.  I usually alternate between this and an exfoliating wash. You don&#x27;t want to exfoliate every day, it&#x27;s bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling great (oily skin here) and not &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; like some cleansers do.</li>
            <li> This is great for my oily skin! I use it after my makeup remover, and I don&#x27;t have to use it every single day.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!! Leaves your face feeling super clean!</li>
            <li> While this cleanser may not have much in the way of novelty, it is dependable and gets the job done without irritating my skin. I use it as a second cleanser after oil cleansing to remove makeup, and it manages to remove the oil without making my skin dry or tight. Used alone it may be a little too drying, but as part of a routine it manages to get rid of impurities without damaging my skin barrier.</li>
            <li> My holy grail daily cleanser. It works well on my oily, acne-prone skin. The cleanser is very gentle and suds up well with a small amount, and while a bit expensive, lasts me for around 4-6 months. It leaves the skin clean and moist, with no fragrance. Followed with a good skin-care regime, I rarely break out anymore and my skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this. It felt great everytime I used it. It&#x27;s very thick and makes your skin feel really clean. Unfortunately some ingredient in this product does not work for me. It undid all the progress I made and gave me fields of whiteheads. When I stopped using it, I stopped breaking out.</li>
            <li> The most amazing face wash I have ever used. It offers the perfect amount of lather, but rinses clean without leaving that slimy slippery feel. My skin is absolutely clearer, my wife and I now use this product as our main facial cleanser. If you find this too drying, try the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser for acne prone combo skin</li>
            <li> i would give this 10 stars.. i just stumbled upon this at my local CVS store..It doesnt smell.. it foams up nicely and your face feels clean after..not dry..</li>
            <li> This cleanser does exactly what it says it will do. On top of that it removes my make-up completely which is a definite plus. I like this product way more than Cetaphil because I feel more refreashed and it feels and looks like I have cleaned my skin really good.The product lasts a good while, something like 1-2 months. So not bad for the price. If you are looking for a product that will get your skin clean without overdrying and to remove all of your make-up, you have to purcahse this. If you purchase this don&#x27;t for get to moisturize with Cerave facial AM and PM moisturizers. Their awesome too.</li>
            <li> I have eczema.  The doctor told me to get this and it is working well.  It also removes my makeup well.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  It leaves my face feeling soft &amp; smooth &amp; my skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry anymore.</li>
            <li> Foams very well, lasts very long, cleans VERY well and does not leave skin dry. Still hydrating and have had pimples while using it.</li>
            <li> We use it with a Pretika Sonic cleanser and I have no complaints. Would def recommend this to others and will buy again.</li>
            <li> my physician recommended because most face washing soaps have been to harsh on my skin, CeraVe cleaned my face perfectly without being to harsh but still removing all the yuck from the day</li>
            <li> This face wash thoroughly cleanses without drying the skin. non-comogenic, so good for the pores, recommended for those with acne. A+</li>
            <li> Lathers great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my teenage daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. She uses it to remove eye make up and it doesn&#x27;t irritate her eyes. This face wash is unscented, which is a plus. Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Most favorite facial cleanser of all time. Very gentle on my skin. Won&#x27;t use anything else. Love CeraVe products.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from seborrheic dermatitis on my face/nose, this facial cleanser has done wonders.  Ever since I started using it, I&#x27;ve seen the frequency/severity of my breakouts slightly reduced.  I usually apply it in the shower, leaving on for 2-3 minutes before washing it off.  My face feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> For someone with dry skin this did not work well. However its great on all my make up brushes and pink makeup sponge. I will try it again in the summer on my face.</li>
            <li> Very mild, scentless and effective cleanser. Great value and works like Aveeno Calming cleanser.</li>
            <li> a little bit greasy...hard to rinse it off...</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week and I have already noticed a HUGE difference in my skin! For years my skin has been blotchy, red, and uneven. I often get small groups of pimples by my eyebrows and also around my mouth and in the creases on each side of my nose. Like I said, I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week and it has made tremendous improvements! My skin is softer, has a more even color, and I&#x27;m not seeing any redness in the areas I usually do. This cleanser is a MIRACLE WORKER. It is amazing for my sensitive skin because it&#x27;s unscented and it leaves my skin feeling clean without any tightness or dryness. I will continue to use this for a long long time!!</li>
            <li> Very effective in cleaning up the face.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome cleaner for someone who doesn&#x27;t have acne. It makes your skin soo smooth. I found that it was not strong enough to keep my acne away. I wash my face with Ivory Soap and then use Tinted Clearisil for Adults. This is my makeup along with generic Aveeno lotion for the dry areas around my face and neck and to blend in the Clearisil. You can even sleep in this Clearisil. It does not contain the Benzoyl Peroxide that bleaches your shirt necks. TY &amp;#60;*&amp;#62;&amp;#60;~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> Delivery and packaging time was excellent. I use this every morning in the shower. I would recommend this as a morning scrub, prior to using the moisturizer. It leaves your skin feeling cool and smooth, no greasy residue. I will purchase this again and I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering for years with rough, itchy, dry skin on my forearms. Visits to dermatologists were met with suggestions to moisturize more, then suggestions to switch from lotions to oils, and then from oils to petroleum jelly. Nothing helped, and I would frequently be miserable enough to slather myself with Cortaid to stop the itching, and then Vaseline to seal in moisture. I was left with rough, itchy, dry skin that was also sticky and greasy. I&#x27;ll even admit to lightly sanding my arms to try and remove the sharp, bumpy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day at the salon, as I was desperately trying to relieve the itching without appearing diseased, a woman in the chair next to me suggested I try CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser on my arms. It seemed odd that &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; my skin could fix a problem that doctors had been insisting required moisturizing, but after years of being able to pick up microfiber cleaning rags with the side of my arms, I decided to take a chance. The product was highly rated, and even if it didn&#x27;t help my arms, I&#x27;d still have a nice face wash for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash, I was a little disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t a magical cure, but the itch wasn&#x27;t as pronounced. Two washes later I convinced myself I was just imagining things. Did the bumps all over my arms feel less sharp or was that just in my head? A week later I noticed that when I pulled my lingerie out of the dryer I didn&#x27;t feel the familiar snag sensation when my arms brushed across the nylon. It&#x27;s been a little over 2 months now, and my arms are still not as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but they&#x27;re so very improved from before. I no longer flinch when I think someone is going to try to touch my arm, where before I was living in fear of what they&#x27;d think when they felt my skin. I&#x27;m thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> Cerave cleansers are the best, no garbage, bad ingredients and is good for most highly sensitive skin types. For even more sensitive skin I highly recommend their baby wash/shampoo!</li>
            <li> Amazing product wading with this twice a day helped eliminate a majority of the facial acne I&#x27;ve been struggling with for years. I use their moisturizer after every wash.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleanser i have ever used that didn&#x27;t leave my face tight or irritated afterward.The texture of it in my hands feel very much like a gel. If your skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be agreeing with your cleanser, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> A subscribe-and-save customer. This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve found for breakout-prone skin. I like Cetaphil too, but this foaming cleanser is the best for my skin. It&#x27;s also highly recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> This is awesome soap. Wish I would have realized though that it is for normal to oily skin. I must not have read far enough. If you have dry skin you will want to use the one that is the hydrating cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t foam up but works really well. On the flip side this hasn&#x27;t made my skin dry either so I&#x27;m sure I will still use but probably not everyday like I will the hydrating cleanser.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser&#x27;s pH is perfect for the skin and has helped to clear up and repair my damaged skin.  It leaves skin feeling clean but not tight and dry.  The price is great and I see no need to spend a ridiculous amount of money on high end cleansers.</li>
            <li> great for oily acne prone skin. cleans without drying out. love it</li>
            <li> If you have acne prone skin, this will not help you. Too oily and greasy, does not work for people with moderately oily skin.</li>
            <li> My face gets dry and flaky in the winter and allot of products will give me a breakout, since I have been using this I have not had a breakout, my skin gets more even feeling and I have no more flakes after I wash my face and apply face cream, I also ordered it because it has hyaluronic acid it in which lifts, I definitely recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin and want something to compliment a lifting cream!-)</li>
            <li> i tried this product but found it did not agree with my skin. No other comment. That says it all.</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out due to adult acne recently. I&#x27;ve tried lot of acne products out there but didn&#x27;t treat it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve used CeraVe, and my face is becoming clear!!!&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing with CeraVe, I apply milky cleanser with cotton ball, and cotton ball remains completely clean showing no dirt. I tried cotton ball cleanser after many different facewash and they always left some sort of remaining.</li>
            <li> Recommend product for all skin types, it simply works amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;If this product doesn&#x27;t work for you, you can always try the non foaming version.&lt;br /&gt;I use CeraVe Foaming, CeraVe Moisturizing, Stridex(red box), and Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;I am already seeing results and have only been using these product for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I just got this in today and tried it out. It instantly started to make me break out double what I already was. I have tried every product on the market for acne and this is by far the worst. I have never had a product make my face break out that badly that fast. I know that it was not an allergic reaction, because I am not allergic to anything. It does not foam and is really thick and does not go on easily in the least. The bottle is also a lot smaller than what I was thinking it would be. On top of all that it is really overpriced. I am going to go back to using nutragena. I am going to look into returning this product which is something I never do. If I were you I would save your money and go and buy something else.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to anyone who normally buys cetaphil normal to oily skin face wash, and did I mention its cheaper. :D</li>
            <li> It dried my face out, created more whiteheads than I&#x27;ve had in years since high school, and started to create milia-like bumps under my nose that were never there until I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could just be me but I&#x27;m going back to Cetaphil for my cleanser.</li>
            <li> THis product definitely cleans and tones your skin. I feel like it might be a bit too drying for my skin type.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does the trick. I use it prior to using the CeraVe AM or CeraVe PM moisturizers. It&#x27;s gentle and removes my foundation effectively. I would recommend the full line of Cerave Products but lotions instead of creams (less chance of contamination)</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by a dermatologist. Very gentle facial cleaner. Skin feels fantastic after using it. I also like the pump so that the amount is always consistent.</li>
            <li> I spent the better part of my teenage years and young adulthood constantly fighting breakouts, acne, blotchiness and an overall bad complexion. I had been using Proactiv for the last few years, and found that it had been the most effective of acne cleansers I had tried. Yet despite it, I continued to get a lot of breakouts, my skin was constantly peeling, and I got black heads like crazy no matter how much I tried to prevent them. About two or three weeks go, I finally got sick of it all. I&#x27;m 25 years old, but my dry, dull, flaky skin texture made me like ten years older, complete with an adult case of severe acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after reading into skin care for what seemed like the millionth time, I decided- for once- to look into how to treat very pale skin, rather than acne-prone skin, because I&#x27;d recently also gotten a job where I had to work 2nd shift and rarely got to see the sun. (I&#x27;m pale by nature anyway. Put me on a night shift and I&#x27;m practically a ghost. I thought maybe the lack of Vitamin D could be contributing to a worsening of my complexion.) It was only then that it *really* started to don on me.... Maybe instead of having acne prone skin-- I actually had very *sensitive* skin (as pale skin is usually considered) and all the acne treatments were just aggravating it and making it worse. I decided to try this cleanser and a Cerave lotion, paired with an Aveeno exfoliater once or twice a week, just to test that theory out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: I saw results in less than 48 hours. I haven&#x27;t had a complexion like this since pre-puberty, and I am not exaggerating on that. While it&#x27;s still anything but perfect-- The pimples have stopped, the blackheads are gradually clearing, my skin is soft and supple, and the premature lines around my eyes are starting to disappear. Several days ago, I even discovered I could start completely skipping foundation all together and *only* use a light application of concealer with a clear mineral powder for my makeup routine. My fiance has even been convinced several times now that I have been wearing foundation when I have not worn it for a long while now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am insanely pleased with this product and its coinciding lotion. If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s been fighting acne/breakouts/bad complexions for many years and using acne products in an attempt to treat it with no luck-- take a moment and consider if, possibly, you actually have very sensitive skin. You might just be damaging it every time you wash your face! Cerave is great, and is still doing a marvelous job of gradually repairing my skin. I&#x27;m usually not the sort to go out of my way to review products like this online, but I have been so impressed with this cleanser that I just had to put the word out there for anyone else who might find themselves in a similar predicament as what I described. It might not work for everyone out there, but it definitely did the trick for me!</li>
            <li> I did read the reviews on this after trying so many other products that wasted my money.  I wish I would have found CeraVe sooner.  I was getting adult acne due to hormonal changes, I believe.  Almost worse than my teen acne.  I kept looking in the mirror to see how many new zits popped up over night and am so relieved to see almost none.  I&#x27;m soooo happy and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Loving this face was so far. Background:I have oily acne prone skin, but my eyes get easily dried out as I suffer from dermatitis around the eyes during certain times of the year.  I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days so far, but I really like this face wash. It definately doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin (which I was worried about because it&#x27;s for normal/oily skin), has a nice thick consistency (easily spreads..it&#x27;s watery), smells nice without being girly, and does its job of taking off the day and makeup. Granted I only wear bb cream and face powder (I use a separate eye makeup remover-earth science gel..the best!), so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it does or doesn&#x27;t take off eye makeup. But if you&#x27;re a person who has sensitive, oily, or problematic skin, try this.  I was getting I the point of desperation of clearing up my acne and nothing was helping. This so far has.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues of acne with my face, even until recently at the age of 48, so I&#x27;ve been using medicated cleanser for over three decades. Although I used more mild medicated cleaner, my face still felt slightly irritated and often too dry right after washing, accompanied with patches of red spots that lasted a couple of hours.  With this cleanser, it is no longer the case; my complexion is even, feels lighter, and even appears to be glowing.  The &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; part is a bit misleading; it doesn&#x27;t foam up, it just have a bit of bubble.  Nonetheless, it does the job, and does it right.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin. Most face cleansers dry my face out quite badly. CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser is very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like so many other face washes out there. It is a bit pricey for what it is but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Having used this product for nearly 2 years I can honesty say that it is great!&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea has been a problem for many years &amp; I tried it as a sample from my dermatologist. I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my skin looks clean and clear.</li>
            <li> l loved it very much.</li>
            <li> Not tighten, flow out, a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this foaming cleaner.  I use it alongside my Foreo face cleaning device.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any diff,.</li>
            <li> I like this facial soap so much i subscribed to it.  Good lather; no perfumes.</li>
            <li> It works! Better than all the hundred if not thousands of dollars I&#x27;ve wasted on fancy brands. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, removes makeup nicely &amp; my skin feels soft &amp; amazing. I moisturized with the renewing cerave. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the product but it arrived leaking, so I only got half a bottle of it.</li>
            <li> Feels very concentrated so don&#x27;t need to use a lot. Skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Does a good job without drying out skin.</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best for my skin hands down. I have sensitive skin and most face washes dry it out and cause me to breakout. Using this has cleared my skin and made me look like the sexy beast I was always meant to look like.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial cleanser - I have been buying it for a good year and a half now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is on the oily side and prone to pimples.  I started a regimen where I clean first with a mixture of sunflower and castor oil, then wash the oil off with this cleanser.  It has worked well for me in conjunction with a good moisturizer and occasional AHA - my skin is much less oily and my acne is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing is it feels like it cleans well but it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like a lot of other cleansers.  One container lasts me quite a while too - probably three months of twice-a-day use.  The price is pretty reasonable too.  Overall highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It stopped my breakouts. Yahooooo :) I am so happy that I tried this.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne and oiliness. I have been using this cleanser for 2 years and it does a good job at not irritating my skin like salicylic acids and scrubs do. It has not made me break out, but has not really helped my acne either. It&#x27;s hard to find a cleanser to do either of those things, so I have not switched.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser ive ever used at ANY price! I get breakouts from almost everything ive tried yet my skin is prone to being easily burned from the stronger cleansers. Im very pleased to have found something that is gentle on my 62 yr old sensitive skin, effective at cleaning oils &amp; makeup, &amp; is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The cleanser made my face very soft and clean. However, I noticed that I had a significant increase of pimples on my face because of the moisturizers. I had to discontinue. I don&#x27;t recommend it for people that are prone to acne.</li>
            <li> it makes me face feel tight :(</li>
            <li> loved it at first, but now seems to be drying out my skin a little much, so went back to Olay product!</li>
            <li> I purchased both the Foaming Facial Cleanser and the Hydrating Cleanser and absolutely love both of them. I recently started using Retin A and needed a gentle yet thorough cleanser that was not going to over strip my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Foaming Facial Cleanser is perfect for use at the end of the day when I want to get all my creams, serums, sunscreens and makeup off and prep my skin for my retin a application. It leaves my skin silky clean and never feels tight. Always feel perfectly balanced and never stripped. As if it takes off all the bad stuff but none of the stuff my skin actually needs to keep. Gentle around eyes and never stings, even with an exfoliating puff or spinning facial brush. I have dry/sensitive skin and this is a wonderful product for me. My husband has oily/sensitive skin and he loves how it gets his face and bald head &amp;#34;degreased&amp;#34; and silky smooth without ever irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydrating cleanser is great for morning when I don&#x27;t have anything on my skin to wash off but my retin a and my skin is needing a rich, moisturizing cleanse. Although I could use it any time of day. My skin feels really hydrated after using the Hydrating Cleanser,so the name really is not false marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are chock full of high quality ingredients, void of useless fillers and preservatives and toxins and are not cheaply made yet very affordably priced. I will point out that they have parabens. I avoid them when I can but in a cleanser that is washed off of my skin I&#x27;m less concerned than I would be over a cream or lotion that sits and soaks in to my body all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, these cleansers are very similar. One foams and one is a cream cleanser. One is super hydrating and the other is mildy hydrating. Both are great for any skin type in my opinion. Just depends on your goal.</li>
            <li> I have been using CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser for about 6 months, it works well, my skin looks fresh and clean after I use it. for years now, and it has always worked great for me. Leaves my skin clean, fresh and moisturized. I recently found another cleanser that looks promising, it contains collagen, green tea &amp; glycolic acid [[ASIN:B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]]. I just ordered it and can’t wait to use it – my sister said that it works amazingly well. Will let you know how it goes!</li>
            <li> love this product, great facial cleaner only need a very small pea size drop at a time this product will last a long time. I have used other products from Cera Ve super products.</li>
            <li> This cleanser started out okay, but after a few days of using it, my skin started to dry out really bad, I thought maybe it was because of travel and different water types and other factors so I continued to use it for maybe two or even three weeks, but my face was so dry, so flaky and so itchy that I knew it had to be the cleanser. As soon as I stopped using it my face started healing. While I was using it, it literally made my face HURT! Even when I tried to put moisturizer on it just burned and I&#x27;ve never had my face hurt like it did with this stuff! Be careful! And if you think something might be wrong, don&#x27;t give this product the benefit of the doubt just because your derm recommended!!</li>
            <li> Product gave my face an allergic reaction and made me breakout all over my face... I am very upset that I can&#x27;t even return it. If I had known that I never would have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I realized a long time ago that my skin is extremely sensitive and not similar with everyone else. I have moderately to extremely oily face and I heard this product was a really good cleanser, but I can say, after many washes, I could live without it. I am only going to finish the product because I don&#x27;t like wasting a product, and I have spent money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-unscented&lt;br /&gt;-smooth&lt;br /&gt;-makes slight foam when rubbed with water and hands&lt;br /&gt;-clear; seems like there isn&#x27;t not a lot of chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-did nothing for my face&lt;br /&gt;-my face is still oily, if not, oilier&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t even out my skin, makes it easier for acne to spread about like constellation stars trying to connect the acne dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not worth the hype. It&#x27;s an average product which although did not work for me, could work for you. Good day.</li>
            <li> Feels like a very gentle yet effective cleanser. Wait, was that written on the bottle? Did it subconsciously get to me? Hmm, not sure at the moment. Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t foam up as it says it does. In fact, it foams up LESS than other face washes that DON&#x27;T advertise the foaming effect. I&#x27;m not sure if face washes are like toothpaste (i.e., foaming doesn&#x27;t actually DO anything), but I do like the feeling of a nice thick foam on my face. Try Shiseido Perfect Whip for that. You&#x27;ll smell like an Asian mom, but lotion will cover that up. Unless you use Asian mom lotion too.</li>
            <li> Great face wash. Does not over dry even while clearing acne.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product I decided to try it and I am so glad I did!  My face feels clean but not dry and I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation at all. I am also trying the CeraVe day &amp; night moisturizers and am very happy with the results. I have paid over twice as much for other cleansers that promised to be non-drying and non-irritating but didn&#x27;t stand up to the promises; CeraVe delivers!</li>
            <li> very good facial wash .does what it says .foams up very well leaves skin feeling lovely and clean will buy again.</li>
            <li> This has worked great for me. I have oily yet dry skin, and I also break out. I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use moisturizer after I was my face I don&#x27;t break out. I really like this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry my face out to yet cleans it well… even with my make-up on. This is now a &#x27;must have&#x27; &#x27;longterm&#x27; product for me.</li>
            <li> I was just getting tired of my acne prone skin despite thousands spent on prescriptions.  If I had run into my current dermatologist earlier, I would have such less scarring... this is a great product.  All teens should be on this.</li>
            <li> great product -----gentle and does the job</li>
            <li> Good cleanser, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin at all. Is clear in texture.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t foam. Maybe my dispenser is damaged. I pump this really thick cleanser and have to add water before I can use it. Don&#x27;t think I&amp;#34;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff has saved my acne-prone skin. If CeraVe ever stops making this cleanser, I&#x27;ll be the first in line to buy a hundred bottles so I never run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It lathers well&lt;br /&gt;- It removes makeup, including mascara, eyeliner and eyeshadow primer&lt;br /&gt;- It is cleansing without being drying&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s affordable (as of the time I wrote this review, at least)&lt;br /&gt;- You can shave your legs with it as well!&lt;br /&gt;- Since I started using it, my acne has decreased dramatically. Now I only get occasional bumps. If I run out and use another cleanser for a few days, my acne comes right back. CeraVe is an underrated skincare brand, but their basics are all great and work without being too harsh or drying, and they&#x27;re very affordable. I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie and I love this cleanser more than any big department store brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it does not dry my face out and it makes my face feels great after use</li>
            <li> One of if not the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve tried Clean &amp; Clear and Clearasil products but they simply just don&#x27;t cut it like CeraVe. It&#x27;s not too rough on the skin and doesn&#x27;t dry you out. Would recommend if you experience mild blemishes and simply want a cleanser you can rely on.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has dried my skin out, so I use it less. There is no smell, so I can see it as a perk and negative at the same time. The quantity is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall problem is I don&#x27;t see it doing any better than a bargain brand or any other brand would do. I get the same amount of pimples, albeit not many. But I find it hard to go back to this because it truly is average in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Got this a little while ago because my old acne products would dry out my skin and I heard that the whole &amp;#34;Kill it with Kindness&amp;#34; approach worked better than carpet-bombing your skin with various harsh products. I really cannot express how much better my face feels with this stuff. Totally didn&#x27;t expect an 8 dollar bottle of cleanser to work this well. I really don&#x27;t even need to moisturize after using it, my skin just feels better all day.</li>
            <li> I used Cetaphil for years but read this was better.  While it has more ingredients, more chemical ingredients, apparently said chemicals are better or less agitating to the skin.  I really haven&#x27;t noticed.  However I did notice I broken out slightly for a week after switching but that has gone away.  Unlike Cetaphil, you can&#x27;t leave this on like a moisturizer... it gets sticky.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;-no film left over after use&lt;br /&gt;-lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-non drying&lt;br /&gt;-will last a few months even when used daily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-does not treat acne, blackheads, or anything of the sort&lt;br /&gt;-will remove some, but not all, makeup</li>
            <li> Of course everyone has their own skin types and needs. From what i was reading i was expecting that it would be a nice facial cleaner that would be easier on my face than oxyclean. I used for about 2 weeks and broke out fairly bad and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the foaming facial cleanser for approximately 1.5 years now. I have oily skin that needs to be thoroughly cleansed in order to avoid any type of breakout. The cleanser foams nicely and removes excess oil and makeup without drying my skin. The best part of this cleanser is that it leaves your skin at the correct pH level and doesn&#x27;t strip the skin&#x27;s natural acid mantle. I have also used it wit the Olay Advanced Cleaning System tool and the Clarisonic Mia with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new packaging on the bottle allows you to lock the pump, which is convenient if you are traveling and don&#x27;t want to spill the cleanser everywhere. This cleanser achieves wonderful results and lasts a very long time- a great value, given its low, affordable cost.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews on the internet about different products after Estee Lauder discontinued ANOTHER one of their products that I used and decided to try it.  I had acne as a teen, and I was left with the red pigmentation, some pits, and also unbelievable oiliness on my forehead and nose, and sometime even on my cheeks.  My skin is also sensitive, so I have to be careful what I use.  I&#x27;ve been able to use this and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dried out.  I would have to say that overall, it&#x27;s a very good cleanser for people with combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have roseacea and this product has balanced it and made my skin clear. There is no film left on my skin, and does not leave my skin feeling tight.  This is great!</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best cleanser I have EVER used. I have combination skin with a very oily nose and the rest just being crazy sensitive and my previous cleanser was drying me out even more which was just horrendous. This works like a charm it&#x27;s gentle enough but also cleans leaving my skin soft and fresh in combination with a couple times a week exfoliating. Really worth the price and half a pump will do the trick which means it last FOREVER.</li>
            <li> It made my skin nice and soft and I love the lather. I&#x27;mm allergic to most face cleaners and so far no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Good product! Recommended by my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling wonderfully clean!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne my entire life, and at 28, I was finally tired of using the same old acne treatments that did not seem to fully control my breakouts. I have tried everything from Neutorgena and PanOxyl to Proactiv for several years. Proactiv worked for a while, but the breakouts continued, and I had basically accepted the fact that acne was going to be a daily struggle. I am a pharmacist, and this is my go-to product for patients asking for a good cleanser, and so I finally decided to give it a shot myself. I am so incredibly glad that I did. I have been using it for just about 3 weeks and my skin is completely clear, and so soft. I use it morning and night, and it does an amazing job of removing makeup, even eye makeup, without irritation. I cannot even remember a time that my skin looked and felt as good as it does since using Cerave. I would recommend this product to anybody who has dealt with acne, it can really make a difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little oily, this is the first time I bought this cleanser, it is indeed better than big, I believe, more durable</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning power of CeraVe along with the ease of use.  Wetting the face with warm water, I apply a small amount of the cleanser with my hand and rub gently with small circular motion.  It foams up and then it stops. (Even if it gets into my eyes, it never bothers me, no sting).  After rinsing well, I pat dry.  I adore the feel of it, like soft syrup!!!  Plus, it lasts a long time, because it takes just a little bit to wash the entire face.  So, I just bought a couple more pump bottles of it, just so I&#x27;d never run out.  p.s.  No facial tightness afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I&#x27;ve ever used that is so good that I&#x27;ve stopped looking for something better. We&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now. I can&#x27;t find this oily skin version in stores where I live anymore, so I&#x27;m glad I could find it here. You get a really good amount for the price, and it keeps both my and my husband&#x27;s skin clearer than anything else we&#x27;ve used (including the department store stuff that&#x27;s twice as much money for a quarter of the amount of product). I don&#x27;t use any waterproof makeup but I do use MAC longwear foundation as well as an eye primer. I&#x27;ve never noticed any makeup leftover after I wash with this, though I do use a mildly exfoliating wash cloth with it so that probably helps. This is great stuff, and I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue the oily skin version!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months now twice a day and I have seen great results.  Pimples are rarely appearing and my mild scarring has almost all faded into clear healthy skin.  This will be my go to face wash from now on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Super Amazing and it helps to control my Eczema! ...Great Product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks now &amp; have been having 1 or 2 big pimples the whole time. Yesterday I woke up with a third and these are sore &amp; red.  I never have this kind of acne so I googled &amp;#34;harmful ingredients is facial cleanser &amp;#34; and found an article listing many of the ingredients found in this cleanser. Here&#x27;s a link if interested.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.collective-evolution.com/2012/04/10/you-have-the-right-to-know-17-chemicals-to-avoid-in-cosmetic-and-personal-care-products/ I slathered some raw honey all over my face to sooth the soreness. It&#x27;s awful how companies put so many harmful toxic &amp; carcinogenic substances in their products &amp; then say it &amp;#34;helps restore and maintain&amp;#34;.  What a bunch of lies!</li>
            <li> One of the best cleansers I have ever used! I have tried numerous cleansers on the market over the years. Most of them are okay, but due to my sensitive skin I constantly break out using other cleansers. This cleanser is not too harsh on my skin and I like the texture of it. Still, I limit myself to using it only at bedtime and that is enough for me. It keeps my skin feeling fresh and clean. I just ordered a second bottle, will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser. I have oily skin and when I wash this, it&#x27;s very gentle to my skin. it takes longer for me to get oily on my face again, to compare with Clean n Clear Burst in the morning, or any of clean n clear products for facial cleaning. although i like it, but i have to be honest that this one does make my cheek areas and around my eye brows dry in the WINTER or COLD Weather. this is good to use from Spring to Autumn. So what about WINTER? no big deal. I&#x27;m still using this one in this cold weather. what i&#x27;m doing is after I wash my face with this, I let it dry by itself, use some ALCOHOL-FREE Toner, wait for 5 mins. And then I mix 2 pumps of Aloe Vera Gel with 2 drops of Python Oil (i bought this from my country). sometimes I use emu oil instead of python. but you actually can use any kind of oil that you like. I suggest grape seed oil because it&#x27;s better price and it absorb as fast as 2 others that i use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have 2 drops of oil in the sunscreen before I go out on daytime, I mix it together and apply it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;All of what I&#x27;m saying above is not only keep your facial skin dry from the winter, but actually will keep moisturizing your skin as well. Once your skin got enough moist, it will secrete less oil. Isn&#x27;t that what we all want, less Oily Skin :)</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and after a week I can already feel the difference. My favorite thing about this cleanser is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot in order for it to work. Just half a pump should lather up enough to wash your entire face, meaning the bottle will last for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so it&#x27;s important for me to use gentle products. My dermatologist recommended CeraVe and gave me a sample.  The next day I went looking for this product locally and did find it but Amazon has the best price and if you get an&lt;br /&gt;auto-subscription it&#x27;s even less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic facial cleanser but my advice is to use lotion right after using it because it dries your face out but other than that it really works!</li>
            <li> Foams up nicely and cleans off easily.</li>
            <li> Very good! I have acne prone skin and I have had no breakouts with this product. Leaves the skin clean and hydrated. LOVE LOVE! I have tried many products. I&#x27;d recommend incorporate some type of exfoliator once or twice a week for aging or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a mild acne problem and have been prone to a little razor burn as well.  Since switching to this product both problems have gone away.  The only downside I have found after several months of use is if I neglect to use it for even 1 day my skin is noticeably worse, and it takes several days to go back to looking healthy again.  Not a problem with the product, just something to keep in mind when purchasing.</li>
            <li> We switched to this facial cleanser and/or Netragena due to&lt;br /&gt;developing allergic reactions to had been used for a couple&lt;br /&gt;of years. It is mild, but cleanses teen skin well, at least In our&lt;br /&gt;household.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this cleanser. A little bit (a dime-sized squirt) will foam up nicely in your hands with a tiny bit of water. It does a great job of cleaning my face without making my skin feel tight and dry - but I couldn&#x27;t use this without using a moisturizer afterwards. I noticed a difference in the feel of my skin after just a few days of use. It&#x27;s a great addition to your skin care routine if you&#x27;ve got skin that tends to be a little on the oily side.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended the CeraVe products to me when I went in to see her for a case of dermatitis.  (My sister-in-law&#x27;s dermatologist also recommended this line to her, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love how gentle the hydrating wash is, and it also nicely removes make-up.  My skin feels clean afterwards, but not tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, and it also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that all of the CerVe products have parabens as preservatives.  If they didn&#x27;t have them, these would be the perfect products!</li>
            <li> I used to use Cetaphil, but it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me anymore.  I read some prior reviews and beauty blogger pages and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I remove my makeup with an oil cleanser, and then follow that up with this using my Clarisonic.  It foams up really nice (but not too crazy) and leaves my skin feeling really clean.  No breakouts.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my skin get dry. Usually I have problem with cleansers but this one is really good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the product as I&#x27;ve been using it for over quite a few years, but, the pumping mechanism on this bottle was non-operational.  It simply doesn&#x27;t work, thus, quite messy every time I use it.  The pump drips all over the counter when it is taken out of the bottle when I pour a small amount into my palm, not to mention the wastefulness.  I tried finding a cap that would fit the opening of the bottle but had no success.  If it weren&#x27;t for this dispensing problem, it would have 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Bought more at the drugstore.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I like it, lives your skin clean feeling but not dry even if you have oily skin this can be used.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive, acne-prone, normal to oily skin. Use it twice a day!</li>
            <li> I actually use this and I like it just fine. It&#x27;s no nonsense clean. Like there isn&#x27;t an exciting thing in this bottle, but my Mom is convinced she has patchy dry skin so I bought it for her and she hasn&#x27;t complained since. PLUS it barely takes any of this stuff to clean your whole face, so the bottle will probably last a year, so... I mean... the cost savings alone...</li>
            <li> My derm suggested that I use this as a facial wash morning and night and it cleanses and hydrates my skin perfectly. I have oily sensitive acne prone skin and everything irritates it but this product is God-send my face loves it and has cleared up alot since using. I tried to get off it and use goats milk soap since it works lovely on my body gives it a nice glow but my skin broke out as a result and I went back to Cerave it has cleared up within 3 days. I&#x27;m so happy, they say if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Very soft and gentle...perfect for daily use</li>
            <li> I seem to be in the minority when it comes to this face wash because after I wash it off, it leaves my face feeling really dry and tight. I switched from Cetaphil to this because the Cetaphil just didn&#x27;t make my face feel completely clean. This one certainly does, but at a price. If it wasn&#x27;t for the dry and tight feelings, this cleanser would be perfect because it cleans my face well and has helped immensely in diminishing my acne. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it until I find a product that works just as well as CeraVe but won&#x27;t leave my face too dry.</li>
            <li> I am that person that has tried freaking everything. My acne and skin was so messed up from years of abusing it with harsh chemicals like benzyl peroxide and other harsh cleansers. I read some good reviews on this...so why not? best decision ever! This cleanser has literally restored my skin back to what it was...before it was leathery, flaky, dry, disgusting piece of poop. I&#x27;m not kidding...this thing is amazing! I have bought loads of money worth of the \\&quot;best\\&quot; Japanese (very revered) skin care products out there and nothing has done my skin as much wonders as cerave. It doesn&#x27;t give that awful tight feeling after washing your face, removes makeup pretty well, and leaves my face feeling hydrated!!! AWESOME TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY :D</li>
            <li> I guess my oil slick face is just too much for this stuff. It feels nice but strips everything away and leaves my skin overcompensating and producing even more grossness.</li>
            <li> Amazing facial wash!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to me by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser.  It&#x27;s a large bottle, so it lasts me a fairly long time.  it is gentle and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I have to say it was a not good experience with this product. I bought a NEW CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleaser from Amazon. But when I got it, I seriously doubt it was a second hand because the bottle was already open and the liquid was spilled in the plastic bag making the bottle very sticky. Some of the liquid even got out of the plastic bag and got on the other items I have in the UPS box making them sticky too!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel fresh and clean without drying out my dry-prone skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> This face cleanser is the best cleanser I have found. I been trying out different cleansers for many years. This doesn&#x27;t dry out your face, helps with acne, and keeps the face hydrated. It foams up very well, and makes you feel very refreshed and cleaned afterwards. Also does a good job at removing makeup. This is the only face wash product I&#x27;ll ever use now!</li>
            <li> No need  to buy make up remover wipes when you have this product.  You get a much cleaner finish, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin especially are the eyes area. This product is perfect especially for sensitive skin people.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! It gets sudsy and my face feels clean after I rinse my face</li>
            <li> I have had black heads on my nose for years. I&#x27;ve used this cleanser 3 times, and they&#x27;re almost completely gone. To say I&#x27;m impressed would be a gross understatement. I have normal skin and limited break outs, but black heads on my nose have always been an issue. No more!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work with my skin :( what a waste of time and money!!! very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I finally found product that is great for my sensitive skin and my acne. I read&lt;br /&gt;the reviews and I decided to give it a try and I was very happy I did. I had so&lt;br /&gt;much acne and blotches I could not even wear makeup and after 3 days of using this product&lt;br /&gt;my blotches are gone and my acnes are fading.. I am very, very, very happy.</li>
            <li> To be honest I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, I&#x27;ve used the hydrating cleanser but my experience with this brand leads me to believe it will be great.</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend that this was a good product.  I really have found it to be true!  It cleans my face like nothing else I&#x27;ve used.  I also bought the face cream for during the day and I use this Cleanser at night.  My skin is softer and cleaner than it ever was.</li>
            <li> i wish i heard about this cleanser sooner because i LOVEEE it! it&#x27;s amazing! don&#x27;t let the bad reviews about it not removing makeup deter you because it does not claim to be a makeup reviewer anywhere on it&#x27;s label. i suffered from acne and nothing worked to really clear it up... especially not proactiv, other common drug store cleansers, or what a dermatologist prescribed me. my physician prescribed me a pill for my acne and when i started the pill i decided to start using a new cleanser because my other one did nothing for me. the pill cleared up my acne completely and this cleanser was the perfect compliment for my face. i don&#x27;t like the hydrating cleanser because it&#x27;s like lotion... i want something that will clean my face, not add oils or a waxy layer to my skin. this cleanser cleanses my face without being too drying. my face feels clean and moisturized without being stripped and it keeps my acne away. this cleanser keeps my face in perfect condition and i will continue to use it for the rest of my life. i don&#x27;t know how i went without it for so long. i definitely would recommend it to a friend and believe that this product deserves more credit than it gets. it definitely is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Good facial cleanser, will buy again! I belong to the baby boomers era and was trying to find a good facial cleanser that will work well for me, and I found this Cerave Facial Cleanser. It works really good and recommend this to people who like me was looking for a facial cleanser that works well.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for years now and this is the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s now in my subscribe and save. My skin is very happy as is my wallet.</li>
            <li> Good product. It&#x27;s mild on your skin and has a pleasant foaming action. I use this and then exfoliate with a wet washcloth. Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I keep this facewash in the shower and use it everyday. It takes off makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Nothing special but better than most store brand washing I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but as in all skin care products, it takes time.  But I&#x27;m using it...</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry at all afterwards. This is all we use for our face. I mean the whole family. I first tried it when I bought a bottle of it from my dermatologist. Then found out I could get it on am Amazon. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it from anywhere else.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I also have combination (dry/oily) skin and this cleanser is amazing. Not really &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; but still gets the job done. I use this with the Olay pro-x spin brush for a deeper clean and it&#x27;s awesome. This cleanser leaves your skin soft and not dry or oily. If my face does start to feel dry, I use their moisturizer and that product is also a must buy. I also have acne and my acne started clearing after a week of use (using twice a day, everyday) with no further breakouts.</li>
            <li> Clear but rich, you will only need a dab mixed with water for your face,  I like the fact I can see the soapy foam on my face and it works extremely well with my facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic that I use to wash my face. This cleanser leaves my Clarisonic sparkling white after I wash my face. My other cleansers have left it somewhat duty. I know that if it&#x27;s cleaning my Clarisonic that well it must be cleaning my face great also!</li>
            <li> Its really gentle on the face, it almost feels like it isn&#x27;t soap when it contacts your face because its so mild. But you feel clean when its washed off. I say its excellent as a daily cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t rob your skin of complete moisture and elasticity.</li>
            <li> Its amazing I love it I have oily skit</li>
            <li> Your skin is going to love this cleanser! I have super sensitive combination skin and this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have struggle for years with dry skin.  This has been the best investment I could have ever found.  I love the cleanser, lotion and sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I use Jack Black in the morning shower and then I use this stuff at night. It is a light and effective cleaner and does not dry out my skin. But as with all skin products, your mileage may vary with this one. Give it a whirl, it lasts quite a long time too...one pump per wash is all it takes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that will break out at the drop of a hat.  This product doesn&#x27;t cause redness or breakouts.  Cleans beautifully without drying my skin.  I am using my 3rd bottle and thrilled to have found it after reading other people&#x27;s reviews.  It took the place of the dove face products that are no longer sold in the United States.  That was the only other product I could tolerate and bummed when I couldn&#x27;t get it anymore (or only at an outrageous price)  This product did not work well on my teenage sons&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have finally found a facial soup that works!  I have been using CeraVe for three months now and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash. Use daily on my oily acne prone face with no irritation. Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> Feels great and my face (which has historically felt very oily) stays clean all day with this product + a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> after researching and watching review videos decided to get this for my acne. it did not clear, I still would get blemishes and same oily skin. I gave up on it and tried Dermalogica medibac kit .... 2 weeks using it and only difference I notice is smaller pores but blemishes are still there- if anything cause more on my chin..will continue to search.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and combination skin and a bit of rosacea.... I was using Neutrogena ultra calming but I realized there had to be something out there that was even more gentle.... I decided to try this one because of the great reviews. well, I am happy to say it works great!!!! I washed my entire face with it including my eyes because that would prove if it is truly gentle... no burning or stinging and the redness of my rosacea is lighter looking just by washing my face...who would ever think a cleanser could do that...this one does!!!!even my occasional breakouts are under control but I do use the cerave lotion afterwards....</li>
            <li> Helping me take back control of my skin, and put a stop to my current breakout</li>
            <li> This is a great cleaner for reactive or sensitive skin because it is especially gentle. It works best if you take the time to lather up and then rub gently.</li>
            <li> this is a very good mild foaming cleanser that does the job just right. I like this wash a lot. My dermatologist recommended it to me when I was battling with acne a few years back, and it&#x27;s just a great wash....</li>
            <li> A great gentle cleanser, a little goes a long way.  i didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because it&#x27;s not quite as gentle as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, but dries the skin a little.</li>
            <li> This is a good, gentle cleanser at a very good price.  (I will spend good money on lotions and potions, but I just can&#x27;t embrace spending too much on a cleanser that washes away.)  While this foaming cleanser is indicated for normal to oily skin, my combination, heading toward dry skin tolerates it well without that parched feeling and no sensitivity issues.  If your skin is extremely dry and you don&#x27;t need the foaming action (which I do, it&#x27;s a mental thing), then I would try the hydrating formula which is also highly rated.  This formula produces a slight lather and rinses without any residue.  I withheld one star because I don&#x27;t find that it removes makeup well, especially eye makeup, so you have to use a makeup remover prior to washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CeraVe produces only a few skin care products, but I&#x27;ve found that they&#x27;re all well formulated, fragrance free and affordable.  And just as importantly, they don&#x27;t perform animal testing. I appreciate when a beauty company can produce a product without resorting to archaic practices.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this cleanser.  I like the fact that it has a pump and I don&#x27;t have to fuss with a cap in the shower.  It does not have any scent which you may or may not prefer.  Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean:)  I will buy again!  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff.  CeraVe is a good brand and recommended by our dermatologist.  The bottle is large and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Makes you&#x27;re face feel so refreshed, it&#x27;s actually better than the hydrate cleanse because the foam really gets under your skin barriers.</li>
            <li> It does the job without being strong enough to dry out my face. Will buy more!</li>
            <li> Woooowwaaaa this stuff is absolutely incredible.  By far the best face wash I have ever used and those from Amazon that I have tried include Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash and Aveeno Active Naturals Foaming Cleanser.  [...] has a great list of comedogenic and harsh ingredients to avoid  when choosing a good face wash and this one has none of them.  Since washing my face with this product I have had a noticeable drop in breakouts and redness.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin has felt much more comfortable after shaving if I use this before a shave.  It smells great, feels great and washes off easily making for quite an enjoyable experience.  A little bit goes a long way too so it will certainly last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 12/22: There exists a chemical that is infinitely more effective at curing acne vulgaris than any other face wash on the market.  It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s readily available (at least for most of the people reading this review), and you can find it almost anywhere you go.  It&#x27;s water!  My acne has been very stubborn for years but ever since I stopped using soapy washes and cleansed only with water my face is clearer than I can remember.  Try it for three days at least. See what happens.</li>
            <li> Works well, and not too harsh.  Last winter I wound up with ezcema on my forehead due to the harsh weather.  Since I have been using CeraVe I have not had dry face skin!  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month or so now and I notice no change. I feel like my face, which is usually dry, feels greasy after I wash with this. Also, my upper cheeks got really red. It might work for most, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Dermatologist and it works great. It&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t bother my Rosacea. Now can I find something to control the Rosacea.</li>
            <li> Gentle on your skin but still leaves your face refreshed and clean</li>
            <li> Shoutout to the folks at Reddit&#x27;s skincare group! They made this recommendation and I&#x27;m grateful, as this was a great purchase. It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh, lathers up great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling too dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> This works great for me. Moisturizes the skin and helps in rebuilding the skin barrier. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product works well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> After trying what seems like every face soap on the market, this is clearly the best in my view. It cleans without drying or causing blemishes, odorless, feels great. Takes several rinses to totally get it off, but that seems like a good thing in my view. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and had leaked all over the box.</li>
            <li> Very solid quality face wash.  I used Cetaphil before and enjoyed it, but felt it was time for a switch.  This facial cleanser eliminates dirt, grime, sweat, and oil much better than Cetaphil (in my opinion) and although it can be a  bit harsh for those cold, windy, winter months, it&#x27;s still a great staple cleanser and one that I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> Just what the title says. This is the gentlest face wash I&#x27;ve ever used, and it seems more effective than the other anti-acne face washes I&#x27;ve used. My skin looks much better after using it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well and affordable</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry me out. I even use as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Great for adult acne. Non irritating. Face feels very clean when I use this. Doesn&#x27;t foam much, but works for me</li>
            <li> Quite frankly, I purchased this based on the number of good reviews.  What a huge disappointment.  Goes to show that you can&#x27;t depend on reviews no matter how many good ones there are.  I use a Clarisonic orbital facial scrubber (which I bought after trying out my girlfriend&#x27;s...and absolutely love it).  CeraVe has NO FOAMING ACTION at all!  It&#x27;s terrible when using an orbital machine...even when I use over 5 pumps for one application.  I&#x27;ll never buy this product again!  The best facial cleaner I&#x27;ve used is...Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Cleanser.  It&#x27;s worth the extra money BY FAR.  You only need to use a dime size on my orbital machine and foams up very nicely...cleanses very well, leaving no lingering residue and does it without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> Although I always purchase eyemakeup removers, I hate the hassle of that extra step. I was looking for a mild cleanser that would be gentle on my eyes, but remove all my makeup at once. This product definitely does that. It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. It doesn’t dry out your skin. I love how much it lathers and you don’t have to use much.</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser. Very gentle. I had a lot of acne problem from oily skin and every time I use this cleanser, my skin felt smooth and not greasy afterwards. Very useful in the summer when the heat made my skin extra oily. It has also reduced my acne and pimples.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick, you really only need one pump to wash your entire face.</li>
            <li> The product is very good and really comfortable to use it. I strongly recommend it for all people out there.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using the CeraVe product my face feels and looks cleaner and smoother. The push opener was a bit tricky to open but it works fine now.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin and some of the face soaps I&#x27;ve used tend to dry it out because I usually use products that treat acne. I only break out occasionally. This soap feels like a gel when applying. It lathers up pretty well with a bit of foam, especially when I use in conjunction with my Shiseido cleansing brush. It washes off pretty easily and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling stripped. It washes my makeup off pretty well, too. I really like that it&#x27;s so gentle and it actually feels like it&#x27;s cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> No added colors or fragrance. Skin feels clean and soft. I love using with my spin brush! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so clean</li>
            <li> This is unlike any of the other clear, foaming face washes I have used. My favorite previously was neutrogena and I thought it was really great until I got this as an impulse buy. This face wash is so much better than any of the other neutrogena or clean and clear face washes I have used. I have quite oily skin with light acne and this has dried up all of the regular acne and keeps me reaching for the moisturizer because it washes off the oil so well!</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time I&#x27;ve used this product. I have used only the moisturizer and love it. I will be ordering this again. Great product, mild cleanser and really cleanses your face without drying.</li>
            <li> Its gentle on your skin and will not dry it. Excellent for a daily face wash.</li>
            <li> I am Very satisfied with the Full Satisfactionresults of this product I Will recommend this product to my friends and family</li>
            <li> At first I had trouble getting it to foam; that was my own fault. I gave it another shot with my clarasonic brush and had foam everywhere. It&#x27;s great. All of the ingredients are dermatologist recommended, at least recommended by mine. I am 35, with no lines or wrinkles, fair skin and occasional hormone related acne on my chin (ugh). I see a difference in the overall look of my skin and I have only been using this product about 5 days. My skin looks....even and healthy is the only way I can describe it. I really like this cleaner and plan on purchasing it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Like many women, I have tried a lot of cleansers in search of the perfect one. I had been using neutrogena fresh foaming cleanser because it actually left my face feeling clean. But had I not tried cerave foaming cleanser, I wouldn&#x27;t have known that I could wash my face and have my skin feeling clean and MOISTURIZED! This has definitely been the best cleanser I have tried and I love that is it quality product without the hefty price tag.</li>
            <li> this cleans my skin so will that I don&#x27;t have black heads, before I would have to exfoliate once a week, but since my skin is clean i only have to do it once in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a foaming cleanser.  This product does not foam as it is dispensed from the bottle.  It foams when mixed with water on the skin.  Otherwise it is a nice product.  It leaves my face feeling a little tight but I prefer that over feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It leaves my face feeling clean without feeling stripped. Was initially concerned about it not being all-natural and being a big bottle- I took a chance because of the high rating. Not disappointed even after a couple of months. Fully recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she said that it makes her face painfully sensitive. She does not like it, and I will not buy it again. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gentle, and I am surprised that a dermatologist even recommended it.</li>
            <li> Not at all abrasive but definitely cleanses my face to a sqeaky clean and smooth feel. I love it and would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended the lotion to me and I decided to get the cleanser as well.  I love it!  I use this in combination with a retinol cream.  My skin is looking better than ever.</li>
            <li> CeraVe face cleanser is so good. I use it all the time, it lathers so well and clean my face wonderfully. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Also recommended by my daughters dermatologist as part of acne regimen. Not heavy and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the face wash I have every used! My face feel perfectly balanced when I&#x27;m done washing. So cool</li>
            <li> I first started using this because my lips were constantly chapped and drying out to the point where there were cuts on the corners of them. No lip product would work. So I stopped washing my face and it helped a little. I saw this at the store and thought I would see if maybe my lips were chapped because I needed more moisture. I have been using this for a week and my lip problems are gone. My skin feels so soft and looks great! Plus it works better than higher priced facial cleansers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and this is by far the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, but it cleans very well, there is no oily kind of residue, the skin is tight, clean and yet moist enough after you wash it off. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The nozzle to my face wash was broken off, causing the pump to not work. Now I have to unscrew the lid every time I use it. Poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for over a month and my skin has noticeably cleared up. The cleanser is a bit drying for my skin - I notice that after I wash and dry my face it feels tight and I need to put a moisturizer on right away. Overall it works well and I&#x27;m happy with my skin being clearer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of this stuff to clean your entire face so this big bottle lasts far longer than it looks like it would. Very gentle on the skin but seems to clean well.</li>
            <li> It cleans well but can be drying. If you do not have oily skin (especially if you have dry skin) I recommend the other cleanser that &amp;#34;nourishes&amp;#34; or whatever it&#x27;s called, it&#x27;s also by CeraVe.</li>
            <li> Love this!  A dear friend recommended to me and I think it works great!</li>
            <li> Very good product for people with sensitive skin.  It cleans nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now.</li>
            <li> Works great as a gentle shampoo especially for baldies like me.</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle and works well.  The same active ingredient as Phisoderm, but this soap is nicer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It lathers really well, cleanses well but leaves my skin moisturized, and it&#x27;s very gentle. The seller shipped this to me lightning fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while, waaay before my dermatologist suggested it. It&#x27;s leaves your skin very soft and smooth. You must remember its a cleanser, not a soap. I use a brush(clarisonic) or wash cloth.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never really had skin issues. i&#x27;m not prone to breaking out, nor am i prone to dry or flaky skin. i&#x27;ve never had a problem with a face wash drying out my skin. even bar soap or bronner&#x27;s is fine.    i just wanted a generic, good-quality face wash. this was the most popular form of cerave, which i&#x27;d heard good things about, so i figured i should be safe with a product labeled &#x27;normal to oily.&#x27; boy was i mistaken. every time i use this product i come out of the shower with a completely red face, feeling like i&#x27;ve just lost my epidermis.    i was told by other people that i should&#x27;ve gone for the milder version of this stuff, but a product labeled with &#x27;normal&#x27; should work for normal skin. the only reason i&#x27;m giving this two stars and not one is because i suppose it would work for people with oily skin. everyone else BEWARE.</li>
            <li> I use this foaming cleanser and the second part of my cleansing routine. I first use an oil cleanser and then this after. All I need</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Works perfectly for my normal/combo skin.</li>
            <li> Really good standard cleanser.  Feels very clean and doesn&#x27;t have artificial colors/smells added.</li>
            <li> This help out my skin alot</li>
            <li> This face wash is awesome. I&#x27;m not quiet sure why its different than others but its worth the buy. It leaves your skin feeling clean - but not oily at all. I noticed an improvement in how my skin looks and feels after only using for a week or so. Definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FACE WASH!!! :) works excellent and does not dry my face out at all. Cleans off makeup very well and at the other end of the spectrum turns my face into a great canvas for makeup application. Over all a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reading advice on the subreddit /r/SkincareAddiction, and I am so happy that I did. Everything, and I mean, everything irritates my skin. And I thought that by my 30s I would have no more skin issues-nope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost every product I have tried has either dried my skin out or caused breakouts, even Cetaphil. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks, and my skin has not dried out or had problems with sudden breakouts. I purchased a second bottle for my pre-teen daughter. She is just entering puberty and her face has been a wreck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor girl. We tried the traditional teenage washes- Neutrogina, Noxema, Oxy, but her skin is sensative and she complained of burning. She had no such complaint with CeraVe, and after a week, her skin only has a few blemishes. After we give our faces a couple of more weeks to adjust to the new product, we are definitely going to try the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser ever!!!!! It removes makeup perfectly and leaves the skin so smooth! I have acne, cystic acne, and most of the time oily skin, but some times it gets dry, with dry patches. This cleanser is perfect eather way! Balance the oiliness and moisture my skin! I also think it helped a lot with my acne! Can&#x27;t leave without anymore!!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne since a child so I&#x27;m always looking for a better face wash. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have honestly tried almost every facewash out there and this blows all of them out of the water. It made my skin feel amazing and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all. It is also cheaper than most acne washes. I use the fashwash two-three times a day and this has still lasted me longer than three months! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li> good first few days broke out with small spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m located in Asia and I&#x27;ve not seen this brand before. Purchased it based on the numerous 5 stars and the price, and it was a good decision that I made. It was a clear fragrance-free gel (doesn&#x27;t smell horrible at all, just unscented) that foams well. I have used it once and my skin feels clean yet not tight. Feels better than some other more expensive luxury brands that I&#x27;ve used before. I trust that it&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;ve already order the CeraVe baby wash for my kids. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle cleanser, which is great, but it does a poor job of getting my face clean. No, my face isn&#x27;t irritated, but the trauma from a day in LA is still visibly there after using this. Switching back to my old cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have had acne for years and always used the OTC face washes w/ salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide in addition to my prescription acne medication.  Even though I used all this, I still would wake up with white heads almost every morning.  Just two days of using this instead of the OTC facewashes, and no more white heads!  I am completely happy with the result.  It is making me somewhat dry however, so I will try to normal skin version next.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for skin that needs pampering.  I have rosacea, and recently I experienced a bad outbreak.  I&#x27;ve never used special cleansers before because I never needed to, but with this flare up, I knew I needed to find something that was extra gentle.  This was a good cleanser which made my face feel clean, but soft and moisturized as well.  No tightness and no dryness.  I paired this up with the CeraVe cream, and I&#x27;m seeing great improvement in my skin&#x27;s condition.</li>
            <li> This cleanser feels great on my skin and washes it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, his face is very clean without oil now. My boyfriend likes this very much.</li>
            <li> Cleans your face without drying it out.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is awesome. I had gone to the dermatologist about some dry skin and he recommended CeraVe lotion. It&#x27;s a little pricey but I bought some. After using the lotion my dry skin cleared up. I noticed my face was pretty dry after my showers and even had some peeling spots. I realized it was my cleanser. So, I started looking for a foaming cleanser that would remove make up and even stubborn waterproof mascara. This cleanser works! My dry skin on my face is so much better and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. My skin feels soft after using it and there&#x27;s no trace of make up left. There is also no smell to this cleanser which I think is a plus.</li>
            <li> Best for sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate. Removes makeup. Doesn&#x27;t aggravate acne. The only kind of face wash I want to use now.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face washes I&#x27;ve ever used. Not sure why it says foaming, because it&#x27;s just like a regular gel type cleanser. It only &amp;#34;foams&amp;#34; i guess when you lather it in your hands. Not too much of a smell, but it gets the job done. It&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> I have used Purpose Gentle Facial Cleansing Wash for a few years but notice around the cold fall/winter days my t-zone dries quite terribly and I start to shed dead skin like a snake. Decided to try out one day Cerave Foaming Cleanser and what do you know my dryness subsided. This cleaner is farther gentle. The consistency is not thick and lathers well with just wet hands in the shower. With Purpose it&#x27;s thicker and more rough on the skin. I have sensitive oily skin. Been using Cerave for over 2yrs now!</li>
            <li> It is a complete cleaner. It might not be great on dry skin, but use it on normal skin and it is great for oily areas like the nose or forehead.                                            Omana</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s big,low price,hight quality and wash clean。It is a good choice，if your skin is oil and sensitive！</li>
            <li> My face is smooth like a baby butt.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and have combination skin with pretty severe hormonal acne. All my teenage and adult life I have always thought that I could never use a product that was \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; or \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; because I thought I needed to massacre the bacteria that was causing my blemishes with acids, peroxides, antibiotics, etc. After suffering from the worst year of acne, I finally saw my dermatologist. She recommended CeraVe products, specifically the Foaming wash, and gave me a prescription for Sprionolactone and Tretinoin. 4 or so months later I was clear, and finally felt like I could take a step back and actually take care of my skin and not battle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cleanser. I use this in the evening after using [[ASIN:B0019LVFSU Almond Oil]] and a soft washcloth to remove my makeup. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel too dry afterwards, yet looks and feels perfectly clean. I follow up with my Tretinoin prescription, and finally moisturize with two drops of [[ASIN:B004DTQ9L8 Acure Organics Argan Oil]] and a pump of [[ASIN:B000YJ2SLG CeraVe Moisturzing Lotion]]. In the morning I use the [[ASIN:B000YJ2SKM CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser]] and [[ASIN:B002MSN3QQ EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 sunscreen]]. I can&#x27;t imagine my skincare routine without CeraVe products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that all of the products I use will work for everyone, but I think CeraVe is gentle enough that it will work for most people.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the face and makes skin look and feel refreshed</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe! It has really helped to clear my skin!</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired more expensive products thinking more money equals higher quality, but that&#x27;s not true for the CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser. It has a light pleasant smell and is a very generous amount of cleanser for the low price. It works very well and has improved my skin tremendously!! I have combination skin with an oily t-zone which becomes pretty terrible in the Arizona summers; but within a few months of using this product I have noticed (as well as friends and family) my skin is much clearer this summer than last.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this product, it arrived a week late and was completely busted open in the package. Thank goodness Amazon has great customer service and they replaced the product for me. I like this facial cleanser. It does a great job at removing light to heavy makeup. I&#x27;m still unsure as to why it is called, &amp;#34;Foaming Facial Cleanser&amp;#34; as no matter how much I try to lather any amount of product, I can NOT work up enough to justify calling it &amp;#34;foam.&amp;#34; I had to remove a star because since I&#x27;ve been using this, I have found it dries my skin out. I&#x27;m left with dry patches along my jawline and forehead. I haven&#x27;t changed anything else in my skincare routine apart from this cleanser, so I find this must be the culprit. I may try the hydrating version.</li>
            <li> Bought this item to use alongside my clarisonic. Works well; gets soapy and non drying. I have normal-combination skin not oily but since CeraVe doesn&#x27;t have this face wash in combo skin form, I bought this one instead. Works fine. Not over drying and face feels clean after washing. Generous in size; you get a lot for the price paid unlike some overpriced dept brands. One full pump is too much product for one face wash, so I only do a half pump to get the product out.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has been great on my face for the past year. I use this with the acne.org regimen and I feel as if it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have never had terrible skin but always  problems with slight breakouts, dark spots, closed comedones. This has helped so much so far and my skin is beginning to look much better. I would recommend this to everyone I know and hope that it works as well for them as it has for me. I will definitely be ordering another when I begin to run low</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; eczema, this facial cleaner is great!!!</li>
            <li> the cleanser is good ,i bought it for both of me and my friend</li>
            <li> This product broke my face out so bad. I even felt bad donating it to the women&#x27;s shelter in my community but I couldn&#x27;t justify throwing a way $12 in which I paid.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out and keeps my face feelig clean, but not over dried. Didn&#x27;t miraculously cure my acne or change my life, but it&#x27;s a pretty solid product.</li>
            <li> This is our go to face wash!  It&#x27;s pure and fresh and nondrying and we use it each and every day!</li>
            <li> This is a must for me.  It&#x27;s so gentle. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a few days but I really like it. I hope it continues to meet my expectations. It&#x27;s a face wash that doesn&#x27;t seem to make my face greasy almost immedetly after using it.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this cleanser! My hubby uses it as well as my son!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. It&#x27;s easy and cleans the face leaving no residue. You only need to use small amount. Great value!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. My skin is really sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t break me out. Will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see much results, but does feel face feeling somewhat clean</li>
            <li> good stuff and you can feel your face skin as clean as breathing! magic!</li>
            <li> i like this product! nothing miracle but really good cleanser. recommend this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no surprise this is a cult classic. I have been using it for one year and honestly, for the other 29 years of my life I must have been a total idiot. I spent tons of money on Tom Ford, Chanel, La Mer, etc etc for face washes until one lost suitcase landed me in a Walgreens picking up this. Ever since that first use, this has been an Amazon regular item for me. I go through about one bottle every two months but I use it to wash my face and to shave with. It has the most subtle clean smell--about as close to scent free as you can get. I really always liked to feel squeaky clean when using face washes (I know, shame on me) and this leaves your skin clean and almost squeaky clean but not quite because--it doesn&#x27;t rip the moisture out of your skin like a lot of products. So gentle! I also wear a ridiculous amount of makeup (toner, foundation, concealer, powder, blush, thick black cat eyes, etc) and it takes it all off in one wash which is also something I don&#x27;t see from other products (except for Shu Uemura&#x27;s oil washes). Such a bargain! You will be addicted!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser! My face feels amazing after using these! It&#x27;s only been one day but I really think this cleanser is one of the best on the market. It foams up and clears my pores out wonderfully. I will be using this twice a day.. Once in the morning and once at night! I will update this review in a few weeks with an update! As of right now this is GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleanser that i&#x27;ve used thats actually made a difference. I know this brand is very popular in the skincare community, but I had no idea what to expect. I have extremely oily skin that is very acne prone, and many facial products only seem to further irritate it. The best I could get before was washing my face with water because cleansers were such an issue, Water at least didn&#x27;t make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is my go to now. It was a last resort and it made a world of difference for me, and those changes were noticeable in about a week. Even on my period, I had minimal-no breakouts. This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: It also feels super soft on your face :)</li>
            <li> Other facial cleansers have the tendency of making my face incredibly dry and makes my face oily by mid-day. I have incredibly sensitive skin and a very hard time finding products that work for me. This is a gentle cleanser that leaves my face feeling fresh all day without increasing oil production. In just one week my face is clearer and no new blemishes have appeared. I&#x27;m very happy with this product so far!</li>
            <li> I love cerave products and tried this one, when my regular CeraVe [[ASIN:B00U1YCRD8 CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser, 8 Ounce]] SA Renewing cleanser wasn&#x27;t available. I found my skin to miss the salicylic acid from the SA line. My skin just wasn&#x27;t as glowing. My skin did feel a little tight after use, just like with the SA line, but not uncomfortably so. No lingering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see not being able to use this in Fall and having to move to the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser. All in all, a good summer value but might be better for oilier skin types in cooler months.</li>
            <li> THIS CLEANSER ACTUALLY DONT BREAK ME OUT. I LIKE IT WILL I&#x27;M IN THE SHOWER</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. My skin broke out more and still felt dirty every time I used it. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Helps with acne. Better than p..active.</li>
            <li> This item is in good packaging. The connector can be turned back to the sealed position after use, and this design really surprise me a lot</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my acne because everything I use either dries my skin out or just doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried everything (proactive, clean and clear, ect.) and this stuff definitely works the best. Best cleanser for me.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I switch from my expensive Boscia facial cleanser to this once I started Differin last year. He was absolutely right. The combination of Differin and CeraVe has kept my face extremely clear. This face wash lathers up very nicely and does a great job of removing dirt and oil! Bonus: so much cheaper than expensive Boscia!</li>
            <li> So far the wife loves it as it does not dry her face out like other cleansers while removing her makeup.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cleanser after reading so many positive reviews but I&#x27;m quite disappointed with this product. It makes my skin extremely dry and I even noticed some white-heads after using this product. It might work for the oily skin people but for a dry skin it&#x27;s a complete NO.</li>
            <li> worked just as advertised</li>
            <li> love how soft it leaves my face</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days so hopefully my opinion on it won&#x27;t change to negative, but it&#x27;s a great cleanser. After just one day my skin feels noticeably smoother and I don&#x27;t feel those pesky tiny \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; that I used to feel on my face. I&#x27;m using this with the CeraVe moisturizing cream and my skin feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Loved this product until I started wearing foundation and the cleanser just struggled with completely taking it off. I had to scrub at my cheeks with a rag which is terrible for your skin because it can cause wrinkles. If it couldn&#x27;t even take off all of my foundation then I didn&#x27;t trust it with cleansing my skin. I switched to Philosophy Face Wash and my foundation just comes off right away so I&#x27;m definitely sticking with that. Still love their CeraVe Moisturizing Cream though!</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash ever. ITs not over drying or harsh for my sensitive skin. I have combo skin also but this seems to work for me very well. I do have occassional breakouts but this helps keep it at bay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CeraVe hydrating cleanser for many years. I didn&#x27;t notice that this had a green top instead of a white one. I think this would be ideal for someone with very oily skin but mine runs to dry and sensitive. I promise to be more careful next time.</li>
            <li> Best face soap ever. Foamy, odorless, rinses clean and soft. Changed the texture of my face skin to be more like that of my inner arm. Soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> CeraVe did not irritate at all and gets my skin clean! is gentle and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> unlike cetaphil and other nonfoaming gentle cleansers, this takes one pump and good massage w/ hands on face, and gets your face CLEAN!  With cetaphil I always have to wash twice (the gentle cleanser...tried the daily but it irritates my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for sensitive and acne prone skin - trust me i have bad acne and my skin is super oily in some parts but super dry in others and reacts to even the slightest perfumes or anything!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.&lt;br /&gt;But it was surprisingly smooth and nice to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it  to people</li>
            <li> Cheaper than getting it in the store.  I have a subscription to save even more.  Works even better than Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> May be i choose the wrong one but it dries my skin a lot. It immediately requires a good moisturizer.Always i feel dry when i put it in face.Please let me know if i can return the product</li>
            <li> The only face wash I use.</li>
            <li> Quality cream! Highly recommend to all!</li>
            <li> like better if pump worked</li>
            <li> I purchased CeraVE Foaming Facial Cleanser after reading great reviews.  So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;I have good skin but was noticing at night my face was looking/feeling oily.  The first day I used this I pumped 1.5 pumps into my hand and quickly realized that it was WAY too much.  The next day I used about a quarter sized pump and that was still a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that a dime sized pump is the sweet spot for me.  I like that this foams and I sometimes use it in conjunction with the Olay Pro-X power brush.  It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean and there is no over powering smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get this product at the best price add it to your Subscribe and Save and make sure you have 5 or more items so you save 15% off your entire delivery.  It&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper than any B&amp;M (Brick and Mortar) store.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser, hands down! I have struggled in the past with dry skin and breakouts, a horrible combo, but since switching from St. Ives and Aveeno to CeraVe&#x27;s foaming cleanser twice a dry, my skin is hydrated and radiant with no breakouts! I wish I had found this sooner.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is just unlike anything else. It feels wonderful going on your face and leaves the skin thoroughly cleansed but silky smooth afterwards. Definitely the most moisturizing cleanser ever. You don&#x27;t need much, so this bottle will last a long time. Unbelievable value considering the quality and quantity of the product. It really does blow all the other cleansers I have ever used away. Totally hooked.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of this cleanser so, yes I love CeraVe cleanser.  It is clear loose gel like with no scent.  With little water, it foams a decent amount.  It cleans oil very well.  I use extra virgin olive oil to remove my waterproof mascara and gel liner.  By the way, works as good if not better than any makeup remover.  I filled by prior CeraVe empty bottle with EVOO:) anyway, it cuts through the evoo makeup remover very well and rest of my makeup.  It does not dry out your skin or make it feel dry.  It pairs well with my Clairsonic.  I have this item on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Finally found a non drying face wash for my acneic skin .</li>
            <li> One of if not the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve tried Clean &amp; Clear and Clearasil products but they simply just don&#x27;t cut it like CeraVe.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this! I have oily, sensitive skin with the occasional rosacea breakout, and CeraVe has worked very well for me. It washes off well and leaves your skin feeling clean. I have mild rosacea that is mainly under control, but recently was having problems with breakouts that even the prescriptions from the dermatologist weren&#x27;t completely taking care of. Plus, I could never entirely get rid of blackheads on my nose and chin.  I was using Neutrogena and that had been working OK for me, but then it seemed to stop, or even to make my skin worse. I bought this after some Internet research on sensitive skin and rosacea. I was a bit skeptical because I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;alternative&amp;#34; cleansers, like Cetaphil, that didn&#x27;t work with my skin at all. After about three days . . . I&#x27;m not exaggerating, three days . . . the improvement was amazing. I have not had to use the prescription breakout cream once. And the blackheads? GONE.  I now use this in the morning and moisturize with a little Eucerin Daily Protection Moisturizing Face Lotion, and use Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Cleanser facial wash at night. It has proven to be a very effective combination. My skin is clearer, smoother, and trouble-free.</li>
            <li> Good at removing makeup, acne not so much</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this isn&#x27;t abrasive. It foams well so it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to clean your entire face.</li>
            <li> My husband and i love this facial cleaner.  I have combination and he has normal, great for both</li>
            <li> Cleans very gently but more importantly. Efficiently! So many other gentle cleaners are gentle but still leave makeup behind. This one does the trick!</li>
            <li> works great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> May be okay for most people, but my skin is super sensitive and my face felt like it was on fire and then turned red.  I had to wash it off and purchase another brand of foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> The hubby got this to replace the Neutrogena he was using for a long time and loves it.  Half the price for the amount you get as well.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my skin type. I have a lot of problems with blackheads and never kind find the proper product. I went to the dermatologist. It turns out I was using products that were too harsh. I have dry skin and I wasn&#x27;t using sufficient moisturizer which was causing my pores to constrict and clog. I started using CeraVe foaming facial cleanser and CeraVe facial moisturizer twice a day. My complexion is much clearer and less dingy.</li>
            <li> It is more like a moisturizer than a cleanser! I don&#x27;t feel clean after washing my face! It just feels more moist! And I start to see more break outs after using this product! To be fair I have a oily skin! Maybe it works for you if you have a dry skin i don&#x27;t know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, why they called foaming cleanser? Shouldn&#x27;t it come out like foam? Mine just pumps liquid soap out of the bottle!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one few recent health/personal/beauty products that I purchased from amazon based on user reviews and ratings! I&#x27;m starting to feel suspicious about these ratings!!!!!</li>
            <li> It replaced my soap, it&#x27;s my dairy face wash now.</li>
            <li> Cerave works good for cleansing but still over dries the face. It also stings the eye if a little gets in your eye. Now I use hemp oil as a natural cleanser, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Cleans face without the harshness of some soaps.  Has a slight &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; smell to it; however, it removes dirt and oil leaving the face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Not foaming. Comes out as a gel. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin and had used salicylic acid face washes ever since I was a teen. But after having a baby, I broke out in bad eczema everywhere including my face and neck so I needed to use something gentler. I found this face wash and have been very happy. It keeps my oily skin in check so that I don&#x27;t break out in acne, but it didn&#x27;t irritate the eczema. The eczema is mostly gone now as it was hormonal related, but I am continuing to use this face wash from now on.</li>
            <li> This cleanser seems to do the trick.  It cleanses my face and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tight and dry after use. Would def recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin, especially for eczema fare ups. I was having a break out on my neck after never having eczema ever in my life. It was brought on by the stress of my wedding and school. I use it on my problem areas during a shower. I also use the Cera Ve facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> enestician from the dermatoligist office suggested this facial cleanser for my granddaughter.  She is 13 and also has roascea.  Works great</li>
            <li> Love it as it contains simple ingredient</li>
            <li> The perfect scent free gentle cleanser. Never drying, irritating, or tight feeling. I use it nightly and it removes my eye makeup as well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful skin doesn&#x27;t  have to cost a fortune. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Best foaming cleanser for sensitive skin.  This cleans without stripping my skin, so my skin does not feel tight after use.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other foaming cleansers but this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> Works good but it does dry out your skin. I have put lotion on my face after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of facial cleansers over the years, but having sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t helped me to find one that both works in clearing up acne and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  CeraVe is a step in the right direction, but ultimately wasn&#x27;t the right cleanser for me and just seemed like a cheaper version of Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydrosultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG 150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and), PEG 6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the large list of ingredients in the cleanser, only one stuck out as a natural ingredient: water. Cocamidopropyl Hydrosultaine is the second largest ingredient in the cleanser and is a synthetic surfactant. Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate is the fourth ingredient on the list and is also a synthetic surfactant, but considered to be an allergenic at higher concentrations.  None of the ingredients in CeraVe are great for you, but again none of them are terrible. Only a few showed studies of being mild or low-level toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFICACY: I tried using it for a month, but it would consistently cause my face to slowly dry out. Not NEARLY as quickly or badly as soap does, but it was noticeable. I was also a bit turned off by the fact that it doesn&#x27;t suds very well.  For all the synthetic ingredients in the cleanser, you&#x27;d think they would add a few that allowed it to actually suds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: For those with mildly sensitive skin, this is a nice, cheaper alternative to Cetaphil. For those with allergies to the synthetic, chemical garbage that they often load cleansers with, skip this and keep looking. I would recommend a quality castile soap like [[ASIN:B00DAI76TC Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Fair Trade &amp; Organic Castile Liquid Soap - (Baby Unscented, 32 oz)]]. These have natural ingredients and suds up much better - plus you can use this on your hair, skin, for shaving, and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*For those who wonder: I ended up just using apple cider vinegar on my face each night and it&#x27;s done better for my acne and blackheads than anything else, completely clearing them up and not causing dryness.  After a year of this method, it&#x27;s definitely the right option for me, but everyone&#x27;s face is different so it might not be what&#x27;s right for you.*tile Liquid Soap - (Baby Unscented, 32 oz)]].

            <li> I am over 30 and still get spots, tried lots of other scrubs and cleansers and they cleared my skin a little and that was about it. This product however seemed to really clear my skin and i definately noticed a reduction in spots. It is really gentle on your skin and doesnt dry it out too much.</li>
            <li> good, but drys me out.</li>
            <li> Great gentle facial cleanser.  I have acne prone skin and use this daily with great results.</li>
            <li> I feel obligated to leave a comment to counteract the negative review discussing that this product contains methylparabens and claims that it is a carcinogen. If you look up scholarly journal articles discussing the safety of methylparabens, they have been tested as safe. Specifically, in the article entitled \\&quot;Final amended report on the safety assessment of Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Isopropylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, and Benzylparaben as used in cosmetic products.\\&quot; (located in the PubMed database), Methylparabens were known to slightly increase the estrogenic activity of breast cancer cells in vitro (aka: in a test tube), but the activity was significantly less than estradiol has on breast cancer cells, which is a naturally occuring hormone in our bodies. In other words, our own hormones have a much more adverse affect on breast cancer cells than methylparabens do, and that&#x27;s only if it is able to come into contact with existing breast cancer cells. There is huge difference between causing cancer (which mehtylparabens do not) and affecting existing cancer cells. What&#x27;s more is that the article stated that you cannot absorb methylparabens into your body past the first layer of skin (the stratum corneum), unless your skin is broken or you have some sort of skin irritation that has opened the first layer of skin. Even then, the absorption rate is barely 1%. Unless you&#x27;re planning on drinking the stuff, you shouldn&#x27;t need to worry about this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended this line to me, and as a 2nd year medical student, I can tell you that doctors are not in the business of recommending products that cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product that is great for sensitive skin and especially great in the winter when I am more prone to dry skin!</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used! Not over drying and irritating combination skin. No strong smell. Great product for good price!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, but I need a thorough PM cleanser in order to completely remove my physical sunblock. This cleanser fits the bill - it removes my sunblock easily without irritating my skin. I have tried so many different products but this is the only one I consistently repurchase. Definitely worth a try if you have issues with cleansers for sensitive skin not doing a good enough job of removing sunblock and makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser and use it daily. it gets the makeup off and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin too much. Rinses clean also.</li>
            <li> I read reviews for this cleanser before purchasing it, and I&#x27;m a little disappointed. It&#x27;s a thinner texture than other clear facial foaming cleansers I have used, and definitely does not foam as much or clean as thoroughly. I&#x27;m used to being able to remove my makeup by just washing with my facial cleanser, and this will not do the job. My eye makeup in particular is hardly touched - and I&#x27;m not using anything waterproof. I&#x27;ll keep using this, but I doubt I&#x27;ll repurchase. I&#x27;ll probably go back to Clean&amp;Clear or Purpose or similar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds/thousands of dollars trying to repair and get clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;Tried Accutane, Proactive, Acnefree products, salicylic acid, etc.&lt;br /&gt;All of them did not work. My acne was around jaw line/chin/ and check.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had hormonal acne.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It was cleansers and lotions that I was using.&lt;br /&gt;Here are products I&#x27;ve been using to get rid of acne and repair my face from previous acne.&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser(2% Salicylic Acid) - Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control(10% Benzoyl Peroxide) - Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Skin Relief 24hr Moisturizing lotion - Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mid day(by lunch time my face is oily)&lt;br /&gt;Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night (before sleep)&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser(2% Salicylic Acid) - Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Skin Relief 24hr moisturing lotion - Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its all over the counter products I got from Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been 2 weeks and soo far no severe acne.</li>
            <li> Agree with other that is dries my skin.  One review says this &amp;#34;hydrates&amp;#34; the skin.  I didn&#x27;t read ingredient list but I think this&#x27;s impossible, unless it has oil moisturizers like &amp;#34;Dove.&amp;#34;  Also its very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, like honey.  I would use this after a sweaty day.  I have seen little if any foaming.</li>
            <li> I used purity for years, then I decided to search for a drugstore product. I have been using this for six years, and I still be it.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I ran out of cetaphil and found it on Amazon for cheaper than what i paid for a little bottle of Cetaphil. I have to say, This is better than cetaphil! My skin is so much more softer. Day by day my skin is clearing up more and more.</li>
            <li> First off, it doesn&#x27;t foam, it is kind of a thick liquid that when you rub you hands together it gets slick but no foam. It cleans alright, but won&#x27;t buy it again. Which could take year to use.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel not clean my face.</li>
            <li> Completely transformed the appearance and texture of my 35 year old skin. Dry forehead gone, dewy appearance back! No longer wear foundation. Mineral powder only. Wash twice daily.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t really work for me.. I was kind of disappointed.. My acne came back worse than it had been in years after I used this!</li>
            <li> the cream is soft and clear, the price is low. i like this brand</li>
            <li> i will buy this brand for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This face wash dried out my skin and gave it a shiny appearance. Based off all of the positive reviews, this works for many, but sadly not me.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and does not dry out my face. Good for both man and woman.</li>
            <li> My skin looks really, really good after washing with this product.  It is strong enough to remove makeup and leaves my skin so white and smooth - flawless....</li>
            <li> When I break out I have moderate/moderate severe acne and I found the reason for me breaking out is oftentimes the facial cleanser being too irratating, so I found this one, and so far it&#x27;s been great! I can really feel the difference the moment I put it on my face. Also look into their Facial Moisturizer, it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY Love this stuff. It&#x27;s absolutely been the most amazing cleaner Ive ever used. I have the WORST sensitive skin. I break out from everything except this stuff even cleansers and beauty products that claim to be for sensitive skin and fragrance free. A dermatologist recommended this brand to me and now I am hooked. I use the entire line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CeraVe for almost 2 months now, and I love it.  It&#x27;s very gentle, and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in how clear my skin is!</li>
            <li> My wife must use this product to wash her face, and other CeraVe products to wash her body due to a severe nickel and perfume allergy that she developed just three years ago.  It leaves her face clean and smooth, it is a great cleaner but not harsh to sensitive skin and non-drying.  One bottle lasts months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had tried to buy this product locally, but found the stores couldn&#x27;t be depended on to have it in stock.  I assume it is a slow moving item.&lt;br /&gt;As usual, Amazon has the product cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash, it helps make my skin very smooth along with the other products that I use. It doesn&#x27;t dry you out and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight after washing. I have noticed a decrease in mini random pimples popping up since using this, but I must state that I don&#x27;t have serious acne issues. I will get the occasional breakout though, and this does help keep them at bay. This will hold up as a winter and a summer wash making your face feel very clean. I also use this to wash off my makeup. Two washes while just scrubbing with my fingers, gets my mascara and my serious smoky eyeshadow off, leaving behind minimal residue on my toner soaked cotton swab afterwards. I was afraid that it wasn&#x27;t going to be good with washing off my makeup which is important, but it&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and such a big bottle of it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for acne prone skin! I wear heavy makeup while I&#x27;m a work and all I need is a makeup wipe and this foaming cleanser to remove everything. I love using it morning and night because it NEVER makes my skin feel tight, dry, or uncomfortable. It&#x27;s calming and soothing and I feel like it normalizes my skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> Good cleanser if you want something mild and with no scent!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this facial cleanser because I read that for combination skin the best kind of cleanser to use is a gentle foaming cleanser. Well this did nothing good for my skin, it gave my skin a tight feeling, which I cant stand! It also caused small pimples to develop on my nose, especially on the creases of my nose. I threw this away a week after I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since being in 5th grade. I am now 20. I&#x27;ve been on and off Doxycycline (Doryx) since 2012. I use Acanya for spot treatment, which works absolute wonders... But I needed something to prevent breakouts. I went to my dermatologist to get another prescription for Doryx because I was starting to break out pretty bad and the Acanya couldn&#x27;t keep up. She told me it was going to take a while for the prescription to come in, which was totally fine with me. A girl shadowing her recommended some face washs. I have tried literally all the face washs at the drug store, so I was excited to try something new. She gave me CeraVe, a Neutrogena brand wash, and also Cetaphil. I tried CeraVe first with the Cetaphil and I have no need to use anything else. Within 3 days I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts. I was just amazed! I ran out of the sample pretty quick, because it was only .5ML. Let me tell you, I bought 5 of these! Love it!</li>
            <li> I use foaming facial cleanser each morning and in the evening.  I have rosacea and this cleanser is both mild and effective.  My teenage son also uses this product. Great product.</li>
