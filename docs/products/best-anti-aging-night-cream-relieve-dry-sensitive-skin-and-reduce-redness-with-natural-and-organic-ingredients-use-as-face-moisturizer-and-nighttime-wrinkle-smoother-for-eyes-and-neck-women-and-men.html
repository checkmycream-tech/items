            <li>This, along with a high-quality makes it quite nice.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and my skin is looking great!</li>
            <li>This night cream was so nice to use.</li>
            <li>Especially right between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really thick formula that I found wonderful and had excellent moisturizing.</li>
            <li>One really nice thing about the Mee Bee skin product line for many people is that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, no scent, clean feel.</li>
            <li>It went on very smoothly</li>
            <li>The company states that:  \\&quot;We are first and foremost beekeepers tending to our bees and making sure they are happy and healthy.</li>
            <li>Great natural products and way better than Burt&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>so this was fantastic for that!</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my skin feel.  </li>

            <li>and I am so glad I did</li>
            <li>I make sure to cover my neck and lips too</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as many moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for night time use especially for people like me who have oily skin.</li>
            <li>Combined with a day product I&#x27;ve fallen in love with, my skin has not had any scaly patches, redness, itchiness, or reaction to the product itself.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the amount of moisture I get and</li>
            <li>favorite part is the scent.</li>
            <li>and I look forward to being able to continue to use it to correct my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love this night cream</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients and the feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a night cream that isn&#x27;t filled with a bunch of ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce</li>
            <li>Much better products can be found at Walmart or a drug store.</li>
            <li>I love the company&#x27;s mission and wanted to love the product.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and it uses relatively safe chemicals (it scored 3 in the Cosmetic Database by EWG).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how this makes my skin feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this wonderful product!</li>

            <li>I love this night cream.  </li>

            <li>my skin is experiencing a lot of good stuff right now.</li>
            <li>I honestly can not say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>and I showed him the words &amp;#34;BEE NOURISHED&amp;#34; he was very excited.</li>
            <li>Not at all greasy, no smell, feels wonderful, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a nightly regimen as well can be used on elbows and hands because it is made for dry skin.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cruelty free, which is very important to me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is so far a great product.</li>
            <li>and we all know that 100% pure honey has many, many benefits across the board!</li>
            <li>How cool is that!</li>
            <li>I just love the creamy texture and sweet almond oil/pure honey that gives it a nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>The cream absorbs very quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>The cream does not carry a strong  and overbearing smell  like some creams do.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that the cream does not have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>smells subtle and wonderful, goes on great and really hydrates without feeling sticky-love it!</li>
            <li>Light and sweet!</li>
            <li>this cream absorbs quickly into my your skin unlike a lot of night creams that leave a &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling the Mee Night Cream does not!  </li>
            <li>I feel like sometimes I really want a night to pamper myself and this cream helps me do that, without having to do much for great results.</li>
            <li>The all natural ingredients are wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I recently received this product for review and I am so happy when I receive cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also free of dyes and unscented which I find extremely important for a face cream.</li>
            <li>and I am always searching  for products that fit well for me.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I wake up with skin that feels light, no morning grease or oil.</li>
            <li>It has softened up the light lines around my eyes too.  </li>
            <li>This product feel truly healthy, soothing, fresh.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and when I wake up in the morning, I end up with smooth nourished skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and it does not have a smell.</li>
            <li>I can put it on at night and put my make up on smoothly in the morning.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the freshness of nature  that my face wakes up with.  </li>
            <li>The Mee Bee does have a scent, but it&#x27;s primarily from the blend of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>When i wake up in the morning my skin looks so smooth and renewed.</li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t important to you</li>
            <li>I think this company really cares about their customers and provides the best ingredients possible.</li>
            <li>Best Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Avocado Oil, Shea Butter &amp; Pure Honey]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Best Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Avocado Oil, Shea Butter &amp; Pure Honey]]    </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin at night and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I first have to point out that I really enjoy the smell of this night cream!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as rich as the shea butter</li>
            <li>RICH  AND GOES ON</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also pretty in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the Mee Beauty Best cream because it has honey and other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy it did take away the dry skin though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Friends have told me honey is great for a lot of various reasons from helping with dry skin to helping decrease redness in the skin, so I was super happy to try this after reading that beekeepers include fresh honey to this cream.</li>
            <li>Happy with the cream so far, clean, silky and perfume free, live up to its moisturizing expectation as the name suggest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure, safe, has luxurious ingredients etc.</li>
            <li>Organic jojoba, Shea butter, avacado oil, sweet almond oil, vitamin e,  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a greasy residue left on my hand, which made me feel good because I didn&#x27;t want it on my face either.</li>
            <li>Thick texture perfect for a night cream.  </li>
            <li>works very well for me :-)  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this face</li>
            <li>barbadensis (Aloe) Juice, Prunus dulcis (Sweet Almond)</li>
            <li>Aloe barbadensis (Aloe) Juice, Prunus dulcis (Sweet Almond)</li>
            <li>Now I look forward to my new night time routine because my skin feels rested and I&#x27;m ready for a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from recognizable ingredients (some organic) and fragrance-free, which I appreciate because I&#x27;m hypersensitive to strong smelling products.</li>
            <li>so you really get a nice layer of cream without much, I&#x27;d say try a dime (pocket change) size</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought it initially because it said it would help save the honey bees, but I will continue to buy this cream as it feels great and makes my skin feel very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love mee products - all natural and it has a clean finish.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I noticed a significant changes in my skin from the first night.</li>
            <li>I recently received a sample of  Best of Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin</li>
            <li>I enjoy the Night Face Cream because its so light and I wake up feeling soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>Mee night cream is super rich and moisturises very well</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to receive this product for review recently.</li>
            <li>I rarely find anything that doesn&#x27;t give me oily skin, skin irritation and redness</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any more outbreaks, clearly my skin was &amp;#34;dying of thirst&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product contains organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin you will really love this cream.</li>
            <li>They are actually beekeepers and harvest their own honey</li>
            <li>This is a nice face cream that glides on easily and has a slight hint of honey, which I happen to like.</li>
            <li>and I am always trying to find the right cream that would moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li>I put this right on my son&#x27;s nose and cheeks</li>
            <li>she has been using this everyday for about a month and her skin looks great and very hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have trouble falling asleep if I can smell perfumed scents even if I find the scent pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is a very light cream but moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>cream is infused with honey straight from the beehive, the manufacturers are beekeepers!</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients and the fact that it is paraben free.  </li>
            <li>so I have to be really careful of what kind of face creams I use.</li>
            <li>and boy did I wake up to some soft and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>and when I woke up it was pretty much nonexistent!</li>
            <li>After only using the cream for a month, I already see a reduction of lines around my eyes and have notice that my skins feel more moisturized during the day and night.</li>
            <li>One thing I have problems with is many creams actually cause an adverse reaction to my skin, Mee does NOT do this.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty moisturize-y.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already seen great results, lately I had been struggling with redness in my cheeks after washing or exfoliating and after using this for a week</li>
            <li>I just stumbled upon the Mee facial lotion and am so glad.</li>
            <li>but find I have to put more on 30 min later.</li>
            <li>I have allergies to harsh products and very sensitive skin, this cream was great.</li>
            <li>It does stay a bit &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; on my face for about an hour and doesn&#x27;t sink right in, so if you&#x27;re going to straight to bed</li>
            <li>There is a pleasant scent to this cream but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy but not heavy</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li>This cream is rich and not irritating for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and you wake up with very moisturized skin that is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it that my skin immediately felt cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I love facial creams but as I&#x27;ve gotten older</li>
            <li>I bought this product for the first time based on previous amazon ratings and I was really surprised by how good it is.</li>
            <li>I use it at night, and my face is super soft in the morning.  </li>

            <li>I AM AN OLDER PERSON!</li>
            <li>This cream is infused with pure, unrefined honey, straight from the hive</li>
            <li>Like most people I have very dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>I want to let you know though it really does not take much of this to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>Who wants to have ashy skin?</li>
            <li>Gentle and nourishing.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, but both of these products have really been disciplining it to be even tempered.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Much needed, too.</li>
            <li>Each night after washing my face thoroughly I apply, gently massaging into my face and neck</li>
            <li>It does seem to moisturize very well., and I like using it.</li>
            <li>I used about a quarter size for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>always enjoy purchasing from a company that gives back.</li>
            <li>High recommend!</li>
            <li>Also makes my face really shiny.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>It has the added benefit of being all-natural and contains real NYC honey.  </li>
            <li>It was gentle on my skin and did not bother the gentle area around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like using it after I use my vitamin C serum, which is drying.  </li>
            <li>if i use it too much it makes my face break out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other mee products and love them just as much.</li>
            <li>I like to be able to smell other things not my face cream.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue use of this product and will be purchasing a few as gifts as it is amazing!</li>
            <li>They are with 100% pure, natural ingredients like pure honey straight from the beehive.</li>
            <li>The addition of the honey to all of the Mee Beauty products is definitely something that makes them special.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I would have liked it to be and the way it dries on my face is just not ok.</li>
            <li>it is very soothing and creamy , I have spent alot of money looking for moisturizers for my face and this is the only one that I have liked</li>
            <li>It may be a bit light for my dry skin in Colorado.  </li>
            <li>This night cream is a nice thick consistency which means you don&#x27;t need much to cover your face/neck.</li>
            <li>My main requirement for a night cream is that it has to be unscented.</li>
            <li>And it is also nice to know that this product is made locally, by a small company in New York state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t use a lot, but I&#x27;ve tried using more in order to make my skin feel less dehydrated and it just doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>am highly recommending this cream based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>I like the list of high quality organic ingredients and the way the cream feels on my face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so it is also a good value.  </li>
            <li>No one wants to rub chemicals on their face, and mine is rather sensitive</li>
            <li>I really like this night cream because it is infused with honey and is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>When I woke up the next morning, my face wasn&#x27;t dry at all like so many times before.</li>
            <li>Infused with pure honey straight from the beehive and deep penetrating avocado oil and Shea Butter to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li>I am a new Mee consumer.  </li>
            <li>This super thick, rich formula keeps my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moist and not greasy with absolutely no smell, no dyes, no purfumes and clean.</li>
            <li>Apply at night after you have cleaned your face and let dry the cream will quickly absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My face felt very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I like the way this night cream moisturizer is packaged, it had a safety seal to ensure your mind that you were the first to open the product and use it.</li>
            <li>So whenever I find a small-batch product from a small business that I like, I am sure to recommend it to those around me.  </li>
            <li>I use this cream each night on my face and my skin still feels soft and hydrated in the morning!  </li>
            <li>It is thick and rich and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, no irritation, no redness, no oily skin.</li>
            <li>After a few days, new break outs started to surface and throughout the day, there would be more red dots on my face!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive facial skin and this lotion is not only moisturizing</li>
            <li>the fact that Purely Mee donates 1% of their revenue to saving them definitely resonated with me.  </li>
            <li>But with a little moisture spray or oil, it may be fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I trust this product with my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Immediately after you put it on, you&#x27;ll notice your skin is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>and then my skin feels as soft as a newborn.</li>
            <li>I guess I have sensitive skin and Mee</li>
            <li>In the morning my face feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The old saying &amp;#34;a</li>
            <li>and I wake up with soft, supple skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this cream so far.</li>
            <li>It is oily but it doesn&#x27;t last it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use much to moisturize my entire face during the night.  </li>
            <li>All Natural Ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li>We use natural beekeeping methods without pesticides or chemicals.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you have sensitive skin, like me.</li>
            <li>The natural scent was a pleasure too.</li>
            <li>If you are young and anti-aging ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, Ferulic acid.etc.</li>
            <li>but it can be used day and night, just harder to establish a make up routine over it when fresh.</li>
            <li>Love that this is thick and creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It is made with Raw Honey, Shea Butter and Organic Aloe, Paraben Free and Made in the USA</li>
            <li>Over the past year I&#x27;ve read so many articles about the dilemma facing bees and ultimately our planet if we don&#x27;t do something to prevent their extinction so</li>
            <li>I paid a pretty penny for a fancy companyâ€™s night cream and it left me feeling greasy from the application, and not all that moisturized a while later.  </li>
            <li>I am constantly battling dry skin, after one night, I have a fresh dewy look.</li>
            <li>The 2oz bottle may sound small but there is really a lot of cream and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is also very ungreasy, and my skin feels soft and properly moisturized the next morning.  </li>
            <li>They also use organic Jojoba oil, shea butter, sweet almond oil &amp; vitamin E just to name a few.</li>
            <li>I prefer products from smaller companies, as opposed to big conglomerates that make items in large batches.  </li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mee Beauty Bee night cream isn&#x27;t thick, but goes on easily</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was my serums because I started a new pre-serum, so I stopped using that for a few days and continued to use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about the creams that I use due to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The tough winter months are no longer a match for my skin as it is now healthy and radiant.  </li>
            <li>It was not greasy and left me skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s made up of only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and my face is finally starting to calm down.</li>
            <li>This is a good product I&#x27;m just not into thick creams I felt likeit was oily/sticky and just very heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>little goes a long way&amp;#34; is true here because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to reap the benefits.  </li>
            <li>I live in a climate where in the winter my face gets chapped and dry</li>
            <li>But it is true, you only need a few dabs to completely cover your face, so it&#x27;ll last a really long time.</li>
            <li>No dry patches, and it isn&#x27;t leaving my face greasy either.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I feel a slight burning sensation when I first put on the product.</li>
            <li>It also makes my face shinier than other products that I&#x27;ve used, and while I don&#x27;t mind that since it&#x27;s a night cream, my face still seems shinier than normal in the morning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly dry or oily skin on my face, but I&#x27;d say that if you have dry, this would work particularly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> While the ingredients seem to be good, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin quality or reduction in breakouts.</li>
            <li> The ingredient that I liked to see was the addition of the aloe for healing and the shea for a great moisturizing experience.  </li>

            <li> I received it to test and provide my honest feedback.  </li>
            <li> This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This, along with a high-quality makes it quite nice.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and my skin is looking great!</li>
            <li> This night cream was so nice to use.</li>
            <li> Especially right between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really thick formula that I found wonderful and had excellent moisturizing.</li>
            <li> One really nice thing about the Mee Bee skin product line for many people is that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, no scent, clean feel.</li>
            <li> It went on very smoothly</li>
            <li> The company states that:  \\&quot;We are first and foremost beekeepers tending to our bees and making sure they are happy and healthy.</li>

            <li> so this was fantastic for that!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> (even more so in the winter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this night time moisturizer and will be purchasing from this seller again when I run out of cream.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did</li>
            <li> I make sure to cover my neck and lips too</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as many moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for night time use especially for people like me who have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Combined with a day product I&#x27;ve fallen in love with, my skin has not had any scaly patches, redness, itchiness, or reaction to the product itself.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the amount of moisture I get and</li>
            <li> favorite part is the scent.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to being able to continue to use it to correct my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love this night cream</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients and the feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a night cream that isn&#x27;t filled with a bunch of ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce</li>
            <li> Much better products can be found at Walmart or a drug store.</li>
            <li> I love the company&#x27;s mission and wanted to love the product.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and it uses relatively safe chemicals (it scored 3 in the Cosmetic Database by EWG).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this makes my skin feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Love this face lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I may have a bee issue :))</li>

            <li> I love mee products.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> This cream is lovely.</li>
            <li> this is a lovely moisturizer.</li>
            <li> ive tried many.</li>
            <li> my skin is experiencing a lot of good stuff right now.</li>
            <li> I honestly can not say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> and I showed him the words &amp;#34;BEE NOURISHED&amp;#34; he was very excited.</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy, no smell, feels wonderful, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a nightly regimen as well can be used on elbows and hands because it is made for dry skin.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cruelty free, which is very important to me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is so far a great product.</li>
            <li> and we all know that 100% pure honey has many, many benefits across the board!</li>
            <li> How cool is that!</li>
            <li> I just love the creamy texture and sweet almond oil/pure honey that gives it a nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> The cream absorbs very quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> The cream does not carry a strong  and overbearing smell  like some creams do.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that the cream does not have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> smells subtle and wonderful, goes on great and really hydrates without feeling sticky-love it!</li>
            <li> Light and sweet!</li>
            <li> this cream absorbs quickly into my your skin unlike a lot of night creams that leave a &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling the Mee Night Cream does not!  </li>
            <li> I feel like sometimes I really want a night to pamper myself and this cream helps me do that, without having to do much for great results.</li>
            <li> The all natural ingredients are wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product for review and I am so happy when I receive cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also free of dyes and unscented which I find extremely important for a face cream.</li>
            <li> and I am always searching  for products that fit well for me.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I wake up with skin that feels light, no morning grease or oil.</li>
            <li> It has softened up the light lines around my eyes too.  </li>
            <li> This product feel truly healthy, soothing, fresh.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and when I wake up in the morning, I end up with smooth nourished skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and it does not have a smell.</li>
            <li> I can put it on at night and put my make up on smoothly in the morning.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the freshness of nature  that my face wakes up with.  </li>
            <li> The Mee Bee does have a scent, but it&#x27;s primarily from the blend of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> When i wake up in the morning my skin looks so smooth and renewed.</li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t important to you</li>

            <li> Best Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Avocado Oil, Shea Butter &amp; Pure Honey]]    </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin at night and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I first have to point out that I really enjoy the smell of this night cream!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as rich as the shea butter</li>
            <li> RICH  AND GOES ON</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also pretty in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the Mee Beauty Best cream because it has honey and other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy it did take away the dry skin though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Friends have told me honey is great for a lot of various reasons from helping with dry skin to helping decrease redness in the skin, so I was super happy to try this after reading that beekeepers include fresh honey to this cream.</li>
            <li> Happy with the cream so far, clean, silky and perfume free, live up to its moisturizing expectation as the name suggest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure, safe, has luxurious ingredients etc.</li>
            <li> Organic jojoba, Shea butter, avacado oil, sweet almond oil, vitamin e,  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a greasy residue left on my hand, which made me feel good because I didn&#x27;t want it on my face either.</li>
            <li> Thick texture perfect for a night cream.  </li>
            <li> works very well for me :-)  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this face</li>
            <li> barbadensis (Aloe) Juice, Prunus dulcis (Sweet Almond)</li>
            <li> Aloe barbadensis (Aloe) Juice, Prunus dulcis (Sweet Almond)</li>
            <li> Now I look forward to my new night time routine because my skin feels rested and I&#x27;m ready for a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made from recognizable ingredients (some organic) and fragrance-free, which I appreciate because I&#x27;m hypersensitive to strong smelling products.</li>
            <li> so you really get a nice layer of cream without much, I&#x27;d say try a dime (pocket change) size</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought it initially because it said it would help save the honey bees, but I will continue to buy this cream as it feels great and makes my skin feel very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love mee products - all natural and it has a clean finish.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I noticed a significant changes in my skin from the first night.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of  Best of Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin</li>
            <li> I enjoy the Night Face Cream because its so light and I wake up feeling soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Mee night cream is super rich and moisturises very well</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive this product for review recently.</li>
            <li> I rarely find anything that doesn&#x27;t give me oily skin, skin irritation and redness</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any more outbreaks, clearly my skin was &amp;#34;dying of thirst&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product contains organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you will really love this cream.</li>
            <li> They are actually beekeepers and harvest their own honey</li>
            <li> This is a nice face cream that glides on easily and has a slight hint of honey, which I happen to like.</li>
            <li> and I am always trying to find the right cream that would moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li> I put this right on my son&#x27;s nose and cheeks</li>
            <li> she has been using this everyday for about a month and her skin looks great and very hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have trouble falling asleep if I can smell perfumed scents even if I find the scent pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is a very light cream but moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> cream is infused with honey straight from the beehive, the manufacturers are beekeepers!</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients and the fact that it is paraben free.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be really careful of what kind of face creams I use.</li>
            <li> and boy did I wake up to some soft and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> and when I woke up it was pretty much nonexistent!</li>
            <li> After only using the cream for a month, I already see a reduction of lines around my eyes and have notice that my skins feel more moisturized during the day and night.</li>
            <li> One thing I have problems with is many creams actually cause an adverse reaction to my skin, Mee does NOT do this.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty moisturize-y.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already seen great results, lately I had been struggling with redness in my cheeks after washing or exfoliating and after using this for a week</li>
            <li> I just stumbled upon the Mee facial lotion and am so glad.</li>
            <li> but find I have to put more on 30 min later.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to harsh products and very sensitive skin, this cream was great.</li>
            <li> It does stay a bit &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; on my face for about an hour and doesn&#x27;t sink right in, so if you&#x27;re going to straight to bed</li>
            <li> There is a pleasant scent to this cream but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy but not heavy</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li> This cream is rich and not irritating for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and you wake up with very moisturized skin that is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it that my skin immediately felt cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I love facial creams but as I&#x27;ve gotten older</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time based on previous amazon ratings and I was really surprised by how good it is.</li>
            <li> I use it at night, and my face is super soft in the morning.  </li>

            <li> I AM AN OLDER PERSON!</li>
            <li> This cream is infused with pure, unrefined honey, straight from the hive</li>
            <li> Like most people I have very dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I want to let you know though it really does not take much of this to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> Who wants to have ashy skin?</li>
            <li> Gentle and nourishing.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but both of these products have really been disciplining it to be even tempered.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Much needed, too.</li>
            <li> Each night after washing my face thoroughly I apply, gently massaging into my face and neck</li>
            <li> It does seem to moisturize very well., and I like using it.</li>
            <li> I used about a quarter size for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> always enjoy purchasing from a company that gives back.</li>
            <li> High recommend!</li>
            <li> Also makes my face really shiny.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> It has the added benefit of being all-natural and contains real NYC honey.  </li>
            <li> It was gentle on my skin and did not bother the gentle area around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like using it after I use my vitamin C serum, which is drying.  </li>
            <li> if i use it too much it makes my face break out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other mee products and love them just as much.</li>
            <li> I like to be able to smell other things not my face cream.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue use of this product and will be purchasing a few as gifts as it is amazing!</li>
            <li> They are with 100% pure, natural ingredients like pure honey straight from the beehive.</li>
            <li> The addition of the honey to all of the Mee Beauty products is definitely something that makes them special.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I would have liked it to be and the way it dries on my face is just not ok.</li>
            <li> it is very soothing and creamy , I have spent alot of money looking for moisturizers for my face and this is the only one that I have liked</li>
            <li> It may be a bit light for my dry skin in Colorado.  </li>
            <li> This night cream is a nice thick consistency which means you don&#x27;t need much to cover your face/neck.</li>
            <li> My main requirement for a night cream is that it has to be unscented.</li>
            <li> And it is also nice to know that this product is made locally, by a small company in New York state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t use a lot, but I&#x27;ve tried using more in order to make my skin feel less dehydrated and it just doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> am highly recommending this cream based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I like the list of high quality organic ingredients and the way the cream feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so it is also a good value.  </li>
            <li> No one wants to rub chemicals on their face, and mine is rather sensitive</li>
            <li> I really like this night cream because it is infused with honey and is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning, my face wasn&#x27;t dry at all like so many times before.</li>
            <li> Infused with pure honey straight from the beehive and deep penetrating avocado oil and Shea Butter to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> I am a new Mee consumer.  </li>
            <li> This super thick, rich formula keeps my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moist and not greasy with absolutely no smell, no dyes, no purfumes and clean.</li>
            <li> Apply at night after you have cleaned your face and let dry the cream will quickly absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My face felt very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I like the way this night cream moisturizer is packaged, it had a safety seal to ensure your mind that you were the first to open the product and use it.</li>
            <li> So whenever I find a small-batch product from a small business that I like, I am sure to recommend it to those around me.  </li>
            <li> I use this cream each night on my face and my skin still feels soft and hydrated in the morning!  </li>
            <li> It is thick and rich and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, no irritation, no redness, no oily skin.</li>
            <li> After a few days, new break outs started to surface and throughout the day, there would be more red dots on my face!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive facial skin and this lotion is not only moisturizing</li>
            <li> the fact that Purely Mee donates 1% of their revenue to saving them definitely resonated with me.  </li>
            <li> But with a little moisture spray or oil, it may be fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I trust this product with my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Immediately after you put it on, you&#x27;ll notice your skin is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> and then my skin feels as soft as a newborn.</li>
            <li> I guess I have sensitive skin and Mee</li>
            <li> In the morning my face feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The old saying &amp;#34;a</li>
            <li> and I wake up with soft, supple skin.  </li>
            <li> I like this cream so far.</li>
            <li> It is oily but it doesn&#x27;t last it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use much to moisturize my entire face during the night.  </li>
            <li> All Natural Ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use natural beekeeping methods without pesticides or chemicals.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you have sensitive skin, like me.</li>
            <li> The natural scent was a pleasure too.</li>
            <li> If you are young and anti-aging ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, Ferulic acid.etc.</li>
            <li> but it can be used day and night, just harder to establish a make up routine over it when fresh.</li>
            <li> Love that this is thick and creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It is made with Raw Honey, Shea Butter and Organic Aloe, Paraben Free and Made in the USA</li>
            <li> Over the past year I&#x27;ve read so many articles about the dilemma facing bees and ultimately our planet if we don&#x27;t do something to prevent their extinction so</li>
            <li> I paid a pretty penny for a fancy companyâ€™s night cream and it left me feeling greasy from the application, and not all that moisturized a while later.  </li>
            <li> I am constantly battling dry skin, after one night, I have a fresh dewy look.</li>
            <li> The 2oz bottle may sound small but there is really a lot of cream and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is also very ungreasy, and my skin feels soft and properly moisturized the next morning.  </li>
            <li> They also use organic Jojoba oil, shea butter, sweet almond oil &amp; vitamin E just to name a few.</li>
            <li> I prefer products from smaller companies, as opposed to big conglomerates that make items in large batches.  </li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mee Beauty Bee night cream isn&#x27;t thick, but goes on easily</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was my serums because I started a new pre-serum, so I stopped using that for a few days and continued to use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about the creams that I use due to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The tough winter months are no longer a match for my skin as it is now healthy and radiant.  </li>
            <li> It was not greasy and left me skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s made up of only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> and my face is finally starting to calm down.</li>
            <li> This is a good product I&#x27;m just not into thick creams I felt likeit was oily/sticky and just very heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way&amp;#34; is true here because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to reap the benefits.  </li>
            <li> I live in a climate where in the winter my face gets chapped and dry</li>
            <li> But it is true, you only need a few dabs to completely cover your face, so it&#x27;ll last a really long time.</li>
            <li> No dry patches, and it isn&#x27;t leaving my face greasy either.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I feel a slight burning sensation when I first put on the product.</li>
            <li> It also makes my face shinier than other products that I&#x27;ve used, and while I don&#x27;t mind that since it&#x27;s a night cream, my face still seems shinier than normal in the morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly dry or oily skin on my face, but I&#x27;d say that if you have dry, this would work particularly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m in the desert and suffer excruciatingly dry skin, as well as sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As a new mother, I am very careful about not only what I eat, but also what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> Probably not necessary if you only have mildly dry skin.</li>
            <li> A tiny dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The stuff is pretty thick</li>

            <li> Lotion is a must for me, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products in an effort to find a few effective treatments that don&#x27;t contain a lot of fragrances and weird not-really-good-for-your-skin inclusions.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and while this does seem to make it feel a little softer to the touch overall, my skin still feels somewhat dry after I put it on.</li>
            <li> You really do not need much of this thick and creamy formula, a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has become a little sensitive</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning too, just a little under my face powder, and it keeps my face feeling soft all day long.  </li>
            <li> how long it sticks around.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesnâ€™t take very much to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> These two ounces will go a long way ...  </li>
            <li> All natural ingredients is what really got my attention and made me want to give this a try, plus I love to try and find products that help my horrible dry skin.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, you&#x27;ll note that the container is much smaller than you would expect.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is now his &amp;#34;nice cream&amp;#34; to put anywhere he feels dry.  </li>
            <li> immediate relief from dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is the night cream for you.  </li>
            <li> had a dry spot on my forehead the night I put this night cream on my face</li>
            <li> My face is so dry to be so oily</li>
            <li> I tend to be oily on my cheeks and forehead, but dry around my nose and chin area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of moisturizes to help combat my dry skin.</li>
            <li> If your skin is normal, just use a little less</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product, as my skin tends to get very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are so pure and nothing is added to thin it out</li>
            <li> It is perfect as a night and eye cream during the cold winter months when your skin is drying out and badly in need of moisture.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it really is not that greasy</li>
            <li> I smoothed this thick cream on my face before bed and woke up moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> A lot of other creams that I have tried leave my face feeling tight by mid day, but this cream keeps working.  </li>
            <li> goes a long way, just a little on the tips of my fingers</li>
            <li> I know I don&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t want anyone to assume that I was in a one-on-one fight with a bag of flour due to  my face being so ashy...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what that is or if other people experience that, but it goes away immediately</li>
            <li> and I have been searching for a moisturizer that I can use at night that doesnâ€™t leave my face like a big oil slick by the morning.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t had any ill effects from this cream (breakouts, etc), it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me either.</li>
            <li> I used to use a night cream that left a thick layer and greasiness and with this</li>
            <li> it is non irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This premium ultra thick night cream will moisturize, nourish, and prepare your face for the challenges of the next day.</li>
            <li> I live on the east coast and right now we are being pounded with frigid weather and my skin is taking a beating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d avoid the pillowcase for a bit, or use less than me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month or so, and I&#x27;ve used up about half of it.</li>
            <li> This night cream is slightly scented not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have really bad dry skin around my nose and this night cream took care of it over night the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no sweet flowery smell like the body wash, but rather a someone earthy</li>
            <li> The cream itself has no fragrance and a little</li>
            <li> and I definitely like to moisturize extra during the cold months</li>
            <li> I tried it one night with the promise to myself that I could wipe it off after a few minutes if it felt greasy or itchy.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical about using any product on my skin especially on my face.</li>
            <li> I was silly enough to buy the hype about this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not very much, so be careful not to go through it in a week, I imagine this is very expensive to make</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is thick, but doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> The cream thick but lightweight.</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream that I have been using both at night and during the day.</li>
            <li> My skin was extremely dry this past week because I was taking lots of cold medications.</li>
            <li> This may work for others, but for me I have quite sensitive skin and just didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> Even oily, just a very small amount.</li>
            <li> While this has a slight scent, it&#x27;s just a vague inoffensive honey smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle honey smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> This cream was healing and comforting and kept my skin from feeling tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tough customer</li>
            <li> It is very thick and nourishing, however it never feels greasy!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this broke me out like crazy.</li>
            <li> However, it made my skin break out badly.</li>
            <li> I did and woke up with really bad sleep creases around the eye area.</li>
            <li> He has been sick all this week.  </li>
            <li> Plus I hate that greasy feeling that some creams and lotions leave on your skin.</li>
            <li> Mainly, I hate knowing that part of what I am paying goes to the advertising.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product because a make up guru said it was an amazing night time cream. I don&#x27;t agree. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I would have liked it to be and the way it dries on my face is just not ok.</li>
            <li> Recently I started using Mee Beauty Night Cream. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I used it that my skin immediately felt cool and refreshed.  Now I look forward to my new night time routine because my skin feels rested and I&#x27;m ready for a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CREAM! I honestly can not say enough good things about it! It&#x27;s a really thick formula that I found wonderful and had excellent moisturizing. It is winter in ohio and I definitely like to moisturize extra during the cold months so this was fantastic for that! It was not greasy and left me skin feeling soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is infused with honey straight from the beehive, the manufacturers are beekeepers! How cool is that! The formula is enriched with all kinds of good stuff! Organic jojoba, Shea butter, avacado oil, sweet almond oil, vitamin e,  and of course...the honey! And it&#x27;s cruelty free, which is very important to me!&lt;br /&gt;It is also free of dyes and unscented which I find extremely important for a face cream. I like to be able to smell other things not my face cream. I am happy to have recieved this product to review. I will definitely continue use of this product and will be purchasing a few as gifts as it is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel.  I like the natural ingredients and the fact that it is paraben free.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> No one wants to rub chemicals on their face, and mine is rather sensitive so I have to be really careful of what kind of face creams I use. I like the way this night cream moisturizer is packaged, it had a safety seal to ensure your mind that you were the first to open the product and use it. All natural ingredients is what really got my attention and made me want to give this a try, plus I love to try and find products that help my horrible dry skin. (even more so in the winter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night cream goes to work while you sleep and you wake up with very moisturized skin that is smooth and soft. You really do not need much of this thick and creamy formula, a little really goes a long way. I have really bad dry skin around my nose and this night cream took care of it over night the first time I tried it. I want to let you know though it really does not take much of this to cover your whole face. The ingredients are so pure and nothing is added to thin it out so you really get a nice layer of cream without much, I&#x27;d say try a dime (pocket change) size amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends have told me honey is great for a lot of various reasons from helping with dry skin to helping decrease redness in the skin, so I was super happy to try this after reading that beekeepers include fresh honey to this cream. I feel like sometimes I really want a night to pamper myself and this cream helps me do that, without having to do much for great results. I am really pleased with this night time moisturizer and will be purchasing from this seller again when I run out of cream. I received this product for purpose of testing, an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and I am always trying to find the right cream that would moisturize my skin.  I recently received a sample of  Best of Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin and I would like to give you my honest view about this moisturizing  cream. I am a regular shopper on  Amazon just like everyone else and I am always searching  for products that fit well for me.  I like this product and I want to tell anyone that would listen,  my experience with the moisturizing cream. Now  keep in mind,  I have sensitive skin so I was skeptical about using any product on my skin especially on my face. The cream does not carry a strong  and overbearing smell  like some creams do.  The texture of the cream is very soft and silky. I applied the cream to my face and rubbed it in. I didn&#x27;t have a greasy residue left on my hand, which made me feel good because I didn&#x27;t want it on my face either. When I woke up the next morning, my face wasn&#x27;t dry at all like so many times before. My face felt very soft and hydrated. I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin. I live on the east coast and right now we are being pounded with frigid weather and my skin is taking a beating. Who wants to have ashy skin? I know I don&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t want anyone to assume that I was in a one-on-one fight with a bag of flour due to  my face being so ashy...lol.  I really like this night cream because it is infused with honey and is 100% natural. In addition to having honey as an ingredient, it has vitamin E which is great for your skin too.  So there are no excuses for having that flour fight look in the morning if you use this cream at night.</li>
            <li> I was given a promotional discount to review this product.  This is a good product I&#x27;m just not into thick creams I felt likeit was oily/sticky and just very heavy on my skin.  I&#x27;m happy it did take away the dry skin though.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Thick texture perfect for a night cream.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy, no smell, feels wonderful, and it lasts a long time. You should definitely buy this product!</li>
            <li> Gentle and nourishing. Calming and soothing. Made with honey. This cream is lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this exclusively for my son with Autism. He has been sick all this week.  His nose is red and sore, his cheeks are red and chaffed. I had been using Aquaphor on him but it is so greasy; when he sleeps it gets on his pillow &amp; sheets. I asked him if I could use this cream on his face &amp;#34;Is it nice cream, mommy?&amp;#34; When I told him it was made with honey and I showed him the words &amp;#34;BEE NOURISHED&amp;#34; he was very excited. &amp;#34;The Bee Movie &amp;#34; is his favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a winner here. It soothes my son&#x27;s skin. It absorbs quickly. There is a pleasant scent to this cream but not overwhelming. I put this right on my son&#x27;s nose and cheeks and he was immediately relieved. It is now his &amp;#34;nice cream&amp;#34; to put anywhere he feels dry.  I trust this product with my son&#x27;s sensitive skin. Of course I had to try it myself; immediate relief from dry skin. This cream is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was given the opportunity to test and try this cream and I am so glad I did .I am highly recommending this cream based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I noticed a significant changes in my skin from the first night. Immediately after you put it on, you&#x27;ll notice your skin is incredibly soft. I make sure to cover my neck and lips too so everything feels hydrated.  Like other reviewers have said, you&#x27;ll note that the container is much smaller than you would expect. But it is true, you only need a few dabs to completely cover your face, so it&#x27;ll last a really long time. I should also mention that I started using the Olay Pro-X Cleansing brush at the same time, so my skin is experiencing a lot of good stuff right now. The night cream is a really good compliment to my night time regiment. I wake up with skin that feels light, no morning grease or oil. I have combination skin, but both of these products have really been disciplining it to be even tempered. The only thing is that I feel a slight burning sensation when I first put on the product. I don&#x27;t know what that is or if other people experience that, but it goes away immediately and then my skin feels as soft as a newborn. I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is the night cream for you.  It is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive this product for review recently. I am very picky about the creams that I use due to sensitive skin. Plus I hate that greasy feeling that some creams and lotions leave on your skin. This product was wonderful.  The all natural ingredients are wonderful for sensitive skin. I tried it one night with the promise to myself that I could wipe it off after a few minutes if it felt greasy or itchy. It went on very smoothly and I didn&#x27;t notice that I had it on when I went to bed.  After a few days, I could tell that my skin was looking much healthier.  Can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> I first have to point out that I really enjoy the smell of this night cream! I can smell the honey and I love the smell of honey! The container came sealed just waiting for me to open it up and try it out! This night cream is a nice thick consistency which means you don&#x27;t need much to cover your face/neck. I put it on my face and neck and let it do it&#x27;s work while I went to sleep and boy did I wake up to some soft and smooth skin. It literally hydrated my skin while I was asleep doing all the work for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a dry spot on my forehead the night I put this night cream on my face and when I woke up it was pretty much nonexistent! I would definitely recommend this night cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> love it! great product, prompt shipping. I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I used to use a night cream that left a thick layer and greasiness and with this I have t had to worry about any of that!!!</li>
            <li> I just got this a week ago.  I am still finishing up my regular night cream.  I have been giving this a trial run.  It&#x27;s not as rich as the shea butter I have used before, but that product has been sinking in quantity and quality, so I tried this.  I do like it.  It absorbs exceptionally well, and stays feeling good on my skin for hours.  It may be a bit light for my dry skin in Colorado.  But with a little moisture spray or oil, it may be fantastic.  I will post again after I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and I want to like it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing again. It&#x27;s made from recognizable ingredients (some organic) and fragrance-free, which I appreciate because I&#x27;m hypersensitive to strong smelling products. While this has a slight scent, it&#x27;s just a vague inoffensive honey smell.  However, it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as many moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. I have sensitive combination skin and while this does seem to make it feel a little softer to the touch overall, my skin still feels somewhat dry after I put it on. The stuff is pretty thick and I normally don&#x27;t use a lot, but I&#x27;ve tried using more in order to make my skin feel less dehydrated and it just doesn&#x27;t do anything. In humid weather, it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb at all and just leaves a greasy sheen on my face. It also makes my face shinier than other products that I&#x27;ve used, and while I don&#x27;t mind that since it&#x27;s a night cream, my face still seems shinier than normal in the morning. While I haven&#x27;t had any ill effects from this cream (breakouts, etc), it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me either.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time based on previous amazon ratings and I was really surprised by how good it is. It is a very light cream but moisturizing at the same time. It&#x27;s perfect for night time use especially for people like me who have oily skin.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2db0f7e0308602237fb8a6e53f014b75]] My main requirement for a night cream is that it has to be unscented. I have trouble falling asleep if I can smell perfumed scents even if I find the scent pleasant. Mee night cream is super rich and moisturises very well and it is unscented! I use it on my face, my hands, and my heels. It is absorbed quickly and does not feel greasy. And it is also nice to know that this product is made locally, by a small company in New York state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This night cream is provided by Mee Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> Good stuff, no scent, clean feel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream!!! As a new mother, I am very careful about not only what I eat, but also what I put on my skin. Bee Nourished is the facial moisturizers that I have been looking for.  I like the list of high quality organic ingredients and the way the cream feels on my face. I appreciate that the cream does not have a strong fragrance. After only using the cream for a month, I already see a reduction of lines around my eyes and have notice that my skins feel more moisturized during the day and night. My mom also purchased this product and loves it. This cream is a keeper--Iâ€™ll be sure to purchase it again!</li>
            <li> Excellent , my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  I am a new Mee consumer.  One thing I have problems with is many creams actually cause an adverse reaction to my skin, Mee does NOT do this.  I guess I have sensitive skin and Mee works very well for me :-)  Very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the desert and suffer excruciatingly dry skin, as well as sensitive skin. Lotion is a must for me, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products in an effort to find a few effective treatments that don&#x27;t contain a lot of fragrances and weird not-really-good-for-your-skin inclusions. I&#x27;ve been using this since it arrived 2 weeks ago. I put it on after my shower, where I wash my face with the oil-cleanse method, or a non-soap cleanser. I apply about 1 T to my entire face and massage it in. It does stay a bit &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; on my face for about an hour and doesn&#x27;t sink right in, so if you&#x27;re going to straight to bed I&#x27;d avoid the pillowcase for a bit, or use less than me. In the morning my face feels soft and moisturized. Combined with a day product I&#x27;ve fallen in love with, my skin has not had any scaly patches, redness, itchiness, or reaction to the product itself. I&#x27;m a tough customer and I really like it. Probably not necessary if you only have mildly dry skin. This is pretty moisturize-y.</li>
            <li> This is a nice face cream that glides on easily and has a slight hint of honey, which I happen to like. I know this face cream is listed as a night cream, but I used the Mee Best Anti Aging cream in the morning after I washed my face, and it  kept my skin moisturised all through the day.</li>
            <li> I ONLY RECEIVED THIS  A SHORT WHILE  AGO BUT I LIKE IT! ,RICH  AND GOES ON WELL AND IT SEEMS MY LINES ARE SOFTER  I AM AN OLDER PERSON!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s works, but it&#x27;s sooo nice to put it on</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I love the amount of moisture I get and how long it sticks around. It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, no irritation, no redness, no oily skin. I rarely find anything that doesn&#x27;t give me oily skin, skin irritation and redness so this was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is the scent. Light and sweet! My skin just sucked up the moisture. Much needed, too. My face is so dry to be so oily and I look forward to being able to continue to use it to correct my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other mee products and love them just as much. I am glad to have had the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li> This face cream is one of the best that I have tried...and I&#x27;ve tried many!  It&#x27;s thick and creamy, but not greasy.  A lot of other creams that I have tried leave my face feeling tight by mid day, but this cream keeps working.  I use it at night, and my face is super soft in the morning.  I use it in the morning too, just a little under my face powder, and it keeps my face feeling soft all day long.  It has softened up the light lines around my eyes too.  I love this stuff and would recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this night cream it is very soothing and creamy , I have spent alot of money looking for moisturizers for my face and this is the only one that I have liked it is non irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother. She loves it, so I put another order. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients and the feel. It is thick, but doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. It truly does leave my skin feeling calmed and nurtured.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy but not heavy this cream absorbs quickly into my your skin unlike a lot of night creams that leave a &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling the Mee Night Cream does not!  Apply at night after you have cleaned your face and let dry the cream will quickly absorb into the skin.  There is NO obnoxious  scent and my skin has NOT had any any issues with it at all.  It is made with Raw Honey, Shea Butter and Organic Aloe, Paraben Free and Made in the USA I am loving this cream!!!  The 2oz bottle may sound small but there is really a lot of cream and it lasts a long time.  I have been using it for over a week and still have a lot in the jar.  The old saying &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; is true here because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to reap the benefits.  I received this product at a discount for my review, but the experience and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love facial creams but as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has become a little sensitive so I try to watch what I use, otherwise I end up slathering steroidal gels all over for the following week.  Over the past year I&#x27;ve read so many articles about the dilemma facing bees and ultimately our planet if we don&#x27;t do something to prevent their extinction so the fact that Purely Mee donates 1% of their revenue to saving them definitely resonated with me.  The cream itself has no fragrance and a little goes a long way, just a little on the tips of my fingers is enough.  Each night after washing my face thoroughly I apply, gently massaging into my face and neck and I wake up with soft, supple skin.  This cream is infused with pure, unrefined honey, straight from the hive and I&#x27;ve read that honey infused creams not only soothe and soften but they create a film that allows for moisture to be retained which helps the skin re-hydrate.  I&#x27;ve already seen great results, lately I had been struggling with redness in my cheeks after washing or exfoliating and after using this for a week I haven&#x27;t had any more outbreaks, clearly my skin was &amp;#34;dying of thirst&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a night cream that isn&#x27;t filled with a bunch of ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce but with things I already know have proven results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I was silly enough to buy the hype about this product. I found it to be a third-rate product at best.  Much better products can be found at Walmart or a drug store.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked the simplicity of the ingredients. Its made with some organic ingredients and honey, which is known for this anti-inflammatory uses. Unfortunately, this broke me out like crazy. At first, I thought it was my serums because I started a new pre-serum, so I stopped using that for a few days and continued to use this as a night cream. After a few days, new break outs started to surface and throughout the day, there would be more red dots on my face! I immediately stopped using it and my face is finally starting to calm down. This may work for others, but for me I have quite sensitive skin and just didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> I love the company&#x27;s mission and wanted to love the product. However, it made my skin break out badly. Had to return it</li>
            <li> Nice night cream, perfect for my combination skin. Not oily what so ever, absorbs into skin perfectly!</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it really is not that greasy, it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and it uses relatively safe chemicals (it scored 3 in the Cosmetic Database by EWG). It does seem to moisturize very well., and I like using it. I also think that the price is very good for what you get.</li>
            <li> Perfect unscented and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> I just stumbled upon the Mee facial lotion and am so glad. I have super sensitive facial skin and this lotion is not only moisturizing but it is calming to the skin. I can even use it in my eye lid area with no irritation. A tiny dab goes a long way. This product feel truly healthy, soothing, fresh.</li>
            <li> I love mee products - all natural and it has a clean finish.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a heaviness on your skin but it maintains the moisture in your skin.  Thanks for the awesome customer service also!</li>
            <li> my daughter has acne and is all about organic. she has been using this everyday for about a month and her skin looks great and very hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was looking for night creams, that will help with my combination skin. I tend to be oily on my cheeks and forehead, but dry around my nose and chin area. I definitely think this has made a difference. I use it at night and when I wake up in the morning, I end up with smooth nourished skin. Love that this is thick and creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I also appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s made up of only natural ingredients. I&#x27;m also pretty in love with the smell. It&#x27;s a subtle honey smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month or so, and I&#x27;ve used up about half of it. I used about a quarter size for my whole face and neck. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love that this product contains organic and natural ingredients. It has some wonderful ingredients that help to moisturize your skin. The cream thick but lightweight. It has a texture of whipped butter and it feels wonderful on your skin. It is fragrance free and it does not have a smell. It&#x27;s wonderful that they are beekeepers and they use their own honey. This is good for all skin types. The cream absorbs very quickly and is not greasy. I absolutely love how this makes my skin feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I always enjoy purchasing from a company that gives back. They donate to the One percent for the Planet. They also offer a 100% Guarantee on their product so there&#x27;s not reason not to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I received this night cream in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. Regardless, I only recommend products that I would personally use myself. I think this company really cares about their customers and provides the best ingredients possible. I would definitely recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I am constantly battling dry skin, after one night, I have a fresh dewy look. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this face lotion. Perfect for night time and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily. I can put it on at night and put my make up on smoothly in the morning. Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I think this night cream is amazing! I received it to test and provide my honest feedback.  I live in a climate where in the winter my face gets chapped and dry and I have been searching for a moisturizer that I can use at night that doesnâ€™t leave my face like a big oil slick by the morning.  After using this product for a couple of weeks I can honestly see a great improvement in my skin, specifically in my cheeks and forehead.  The tough winter months are no longer a match for my skin as it is now healthy and radiant.  My foundation now doesnâ€™t look weathered and dry which is a big bonus.  I just love the creamy texture and sweet almond oil/pure honey that gives it a nice fresh scent.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This night cream is slightly scented not overpowering. It is thick and rich and easily absorbed. It is a night cream but it can be used day and night, just harder to establish a make up routine over it when fresh. I use it around my face, eyes and neck and have not had any issues with irritation. It is a neutral color so as to not leave any cake-y residue on my face. It is infused with a honey style substance(kind of scared to wear it outside I may have a bee issue :)) Perfect for a nightly regimen as well can be used on elbows and hands because it is made for dry skin. *product received to facilitate a review*</li>
            <li> I love the Mee Beauty Best cream because it has honey and other natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great Cream...makes my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> This is so far a great product. I got it 3 day ago and within those three days my skin has felt amazing. All organic product. Its a must have!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cream you can use day or night during the dryness of winter this is an excellent choice. My skin was extremely dry this past week because I was taking lots of cold medications. This cream was healing and comforting and kept my skin from feeling tight and uncomfortable. If you have sensitive skin you will really love this cream. It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all and in fact is sort of a miracle. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cream in exchange for a review. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I paid a pretty penny for a fancy companyâ€™s night cream and it left me feeling greasy from the application, and not all that moisturized a while later.  This moisturizer is great!  It is affordable, for one.  I also like that it doesnâ€™t take very much to go a long way.  It is also very ungreasy, and my skin feels soft and properly moisturized the next morning.  I love that there is added honey into the cream.  I have heard that honey is a great additive to beauty products.  I prefer products from smaller companies, as opposed to big conglomerates that make items in large batches.  Mainly, I hate knowing that part of what I am paying goes to the advertising.  So whenever I find a small-batch product from a small business that I like, I am sure to recommend it to those around me.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and results  of great ingredients that is whipped into this jar.  Been looking for a great night cream to work while I sleep and it definitely does. I enjoy the freshness of nature  that my face wakes up with.  High recommend!</li>
            <li> smells subtle and wonderful, goes on great and really hydrates without feeling sticky-love it!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. The feel and the way that is absorbed is perfect for my skin. I use it as a night cream as well as over my facial sunscreen during the day for additional moisturizing benefit.</li>
            <li> I like this cream so far. It is oily but it doesn&#x27;t last it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> Happy with the cream so far, clean, silky and perfume free, live up to its moisturizing expectation as the name suggest.</li>
            <li> I love mee products. What&#x27;s not to love? They are with 100% pure, natural ingredients like pure honey straight from the beehive. They are actually beekeepers and harvest their own honey and we all know that 100% pure honey has many, many benefits across the board! They also use organic Jojoba oil, shea butter, sweet almond oil &amp; vitamin E just to name a few. This super thick, rich formula keeps my skin well hydrated &amp; I am very pleased with this product and the results I am seeing!</li>
            <li> While the ingredients seem to be good, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin quality or reduction in breakouts. Also makes my face really shiny. Don&#x27;t use this around your eyes...I did and woke up with really bad sleep creases around the eye area. I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if any of these moisturizers do a damn thing.</li>
            <li> The Mee Beauty Nourished night cream won&#x27;t make you fall asleep with the smell of lilac or lavender.  One really nice thing about the Mee Bee skin product line for many people is that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  The only one that does have added fragrance is the moisturizing body wash, but that&#x27;s not a product that will remain on the skin during the day or overnight.  The Mee Bee does have a scent, but it&#x27;s primarily from the blend of ingredients.  There&#x27;s no sweet flowery smell like the body wash, but rather a someone earthy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mee Beauty Bee night cream isn&#x27;t thick, but goes on easily and I didn&#x27;t need much.  The ingredient that I liked to see was the addition of the aloe for healing and the shea for a great moisturizing experience.  Honey, of course, is a great product whether it&#x27;s ingested or put on the skin.  I don&#x27;t have particularly dry or oily skin on my face, but I&#x27;d say that if you have dry, this would work particularly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This luxury experience is rather pricey, but you do get what you pay for.  These two ounces will go a long way ...  I didn&#x27;t have to use much to moisturize my entire face during the night.  The addition of the honey to all of the Mee Beauty products is definitely something that makes them special.  All of the features, which are listed below, make them an especially nice line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â˜¼  Paraben-Free&lt;br /&gt;â˜¼  Fragrance-Free&lt;br /&gt;â˜¼  Dye-Free&lt;br /&gt;â˜¼  Cruelty-Free&lt;br /&gt;â˜¼  All Natural Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;â˜¼  Organic Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;â˜¼  Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;â˜¼  Pure Honey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not seeing an objectionable ingredients.  I do like to read about a company and check out mission statements, especially when the products are derived from animals or insects.  The company states that:  \\&quot;We are first and foremost beekeepers tending to our bees and making sure they are happy and healthy. We use natural beekeeping methods without pesticides or chemicals.\\&quot;  This, along with a high-quality makes it quite nice.  I especially like the addition of the aloe and shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe barbadensis (Aloe) Juice, Prunus dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Emulsifying Wax, Pure Honey, Stearic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Phenoxyethanol, Persea americana (Avocado) Oil, Simmondsia chinensis (Organic Jojoba) Oil, Shea Butter (Naturally Refined), Xanthan Gum (Polysaccharide Gum), Lecithin, Salix nigra (Black Willow Bark) Extract, Azadirachta indica (Neem) Oil, Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) Oleoresin, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEE BEAUTY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSWLOR2 Best Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Avocado Oil, Shea Butter &amp; Pure Honey]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSHAYGY Daily Moisturizer - Face Cream By Mee Beauty - Made with Pure Honey &amp; Organic Coconut Oil - Bee Hydrated]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BS1SP2U Daily Moisturizer Body Lotion for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Natural &amp; Organic Ingredients]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00GKTSKKM Moisturizing Body Wash By Mee Beauty Infused with Premium Pure Honey, Organic Aloe Vera, &amp; Green Tea]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.a butter.

            <li> This is perfect and just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s moist and not greasy with absolutely no smell, no dyes, no purfumes and clean. I recommend this product if you have sensitive skin, like me.</li>
            <li> Great product! It is perfect as a night and eye cream during the cold winter months when your skin is drying out and badly in need of moisture. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream.  Very moisturizing and my skin is looking great!</li>
            <li> Like most people I have very dry skin in the winter. I&#x27;ve used a couple of moisturizes to help combat my dry skin. Especially right between my eyebrows. I have started using this product 2 nights ago, and I already can feel the difference in my face. No dry patches, and it isn&#x27;t leaving my face greasy either. Like I have noticed some creams have.  Plus it has ingredients I can pronounce. This product will be used quite alot during the winter months!</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  Only, I don&#x27;t just use it at night....it&#x27;s my day cream too!</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  It is very thick and nourishing, however it never feels greasy!  I use this cream each night on my face and my skin still feels soft and hydrated in the morning!  It has the added benefit of being all-natural and contains real NYC honey.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the the night cream,but i use retain A so I put in on after retain  but find I have to put more on 30 min later. I am my fourth jar.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Mee Beauty products! I enjoy the Night Face Cream because its so light and I wake up feeling soft and refreshed! Great natural products and way better than Burt&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This premium ultra thick night cream will moisturize, nourish, and prepare your face for the challenges of the next day. Infused with pure honey straight from the beehive and deep penetrating avocado oil and Shea Butter to seal in moisture. I recently received this product for review and I am so happy when I receive cruelty free products. This product helps you while helping nature. This night cream was so nice to use. I smoothed this thick cream on my face before bed and woke up moisturized and soft. It was gentle on my skin and did not bother the gentle area around my eyes. I have allergies to harsh products and very sensitive skin, this cream was great. The natural scent was a pleasure too. I do not like fragrances in my facial products. I will continue to use this product, as my skin tends to get very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> This cream is rich and not irritating for my very sensitive skin.  A little bit goes a long way, so it is also a good value.  I really like using it after I use my vitamin C serum, which is drying.  This cream is lovely.</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream that I have been using both at night and during the day. I bought it initially because it said it would help save the honey bees, but I will continue to buy this cream as it feels great and makes my skin feel very moisturized.</li>
            <li> Its very good at moisturizing but if i use it too much it makes my face break out. When i wake up in the morning my skin looks so smooth and renewed.</li>
            <li> If you are young and anti-aging ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, Ferulic acid.etc. aren&#x27;t important to you this is a lovely moisturizer. I have very dry skin at night and it works beautifully. ive tried many. If your skin is normal, just use a little less and it&#x27;s perfect. Even oily, just a very small amount. It&#x27;s pure, safe, has luxurious ingredients etc. There&#x27;s not very much, so be careful not to go through it in a week, I imagine this is very expensive to make and so there it is.</li>
