            <li>Nice cordless clipper.</li>

            <li>I should also add there was no pulling or yanking of any kind.</li>
            <li>After adjusting, I used it to cut hair (my own) and it worked quite well.  </li>
            <li>In fact, this week, I&#x27;ve had people tell me they liked my haircut.  </li>
            <li>Both my boys liked when I used this to cut their hair.  </li>
            <li>Battery life was sufficient and it was nice to hold.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say this thing is a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>I just received this item and it looks nice.</li>
            <li>guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers seem to cut really well, and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li>I even cut my own hair with it.</li>
            <li>I adjusted length to 1/8 inches and it trimmed off his hair nicely.</li>
            <li>nice item, nice seller.</li>
            <li>I have not used it for my  4-year-old son, but a 28-year-old friend has used it and quite liked it.</li>
            <li>Works really nice.</li>
            <li>I actually liked the design feature that allowed me to transition between lengths without having to go get another attachment.  </li>
            <li>nice price.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, good quality, user friendly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The combs adjust very easily and come off</li>
            <li>Very easy use.</li>
            <li>Its quite and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes I was done and it looked pretty good!</li>
            <li>This is cheap and good item.</li>
            <li>nice hair cut tool, my kids love it.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>It feels great in the hand and easy to clean and wipe off the hair.</li>
            <li>attractive, well designed, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This kids unit is very light weight.</li>
            <li>Good product, quick delivery</li>
            <li>So easy to use and nice and quit for kids.  </li>
            <li>But, ultimately we enjoyed a very smooth,</li>
            <li>They run on rechargeable batteries, which is a huge plus for me!  </li>
            <li>accurate description!</li>
            <li>Great packaging, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>pleased+++</li>
            <li>We are now able to cut his hair without a fight and a traumatic experience.</li>
            <li>I mostly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It can be charged, and the cord removed, so I was able to follow him around the house while trimming.</li>
            <li>It just take more time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>hates clippers but a lil more tolerant of these</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and I was hoping it would work in my kids hair salon.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d better be fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay for home use,</li>
            <li>...that thing feels like it is going to strip out over time, and thus you won&#x27;t be able to lock in the length setting like you need to</li>
            <li>For that alone, it is a worthwhile product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Satisfied</li>
            <li>I have cut my kids&#x27; hair for many years and the cord always getting in the way was a pain.</li>
            <li>The clippers cut ok.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, the more we use them, the more he will accept them.  </li>
            <li>This is a lot quiter than most hair clippers.</li>
            <li>My boys with ASD do much better with these.</li>
            <li>My grandson gets a very close haircut, and for that these clippers work great.</li>
            <li>I love the width.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and cuts great!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Really quiet, perfect!</li>
            <li>The attachment comb could have been better designed.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying my Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>The best thing about them is that it&#x27;s quiet.  </li>
            <li>Do not go by my word that my kid hates, he just hates it for no reason. :)</li>
            <li>The LO looks cute , and we save the $$ with going to the hair salon.</li>
            <li>Every haircut consisted of &amp;#34;cut, get scratched, break, and try again.&amp;#34; After reading the reviews I decided to try one more.</li>
            <li>if you have more than one kiddo waiting in line, you&#x27;ll have to use the cord.</li>
            <li>just replaced it hope that will be better</li>
            <li>bought to trim cats butt, need more practice</li>
            <li>so kids feel comfortable!</li>
            <li>It does not pull their hair and I feel safe using it on them...</li>
            <li>and they volunteer to get their hair cut :-).</li>
            <li>kids like these and feel safe with them.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d be able to trim it up.  </li>
            <li>Cordless AND able to use the included cord.</li>
            <li>Now it is May 18th, and the item is not working any more after being used twice.  </li>
            <li>However they do fit nicely in my hand and are lightweight.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, really.</li>
            <li>liked it because it is easy to use for me, I can easily hold it in my hand and move it the way I like while trimming my kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>And for the first time in all of these years, it looked as good as the haircutter or barber does.  </li>
            <li>you are in need of a kid friendly hair clipper, you may want to take a peek at this Norelco!</li>
            <li>If you are going to cut hair yourself, then this insures it&#x27;s easy and safe</li>
            <li>Works great nice &amp; quiet</li>
            <li>I also love the quick langth adjustment heads!  </li>
            <li>It has very good settings about different lengths.  </li>
            <li>Works very good and it is very quiet</li>
            <li>The notches don&#x27;t allow for the locking pin to be perfectly seated, so there&#x27;s a need to be careful when assuming you&#x27;ve got the length set at whichever length you want.</li>
            <li>The accessory pack includes a hair removal brush, an instruction CD and most importantly the apron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the hang of it soon, but the first couple of times I had to hold them up to his hair and kind of</li>
            <li>good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I loved the cordless feature because it makes maneuvering around a wiggly kid that much easier.  </li>
            <li>my sons hair doesn&#x27;t feed through easily?  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t know how easy it could be with the help of this clipper.</li>
            <li>clipper is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The guards are easy to use and change.</li>
            <li>Easy to use .  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The motor doesn&#x27;t seem particularly strong.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine in texture.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine with me, because I got them for the kids.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my son didn&#x27;t cry at all, and he looks handsome and cute with his new hair cut :)</li>
            <li>Without the guards on, it makes a very nice trimmer for beards, necks, eyebrows and other hairy bits that you want a nice clean line on.  </li>
            <li>Trimming hair can be a huge task for us.  </li>
            <li>Quiet and worked great.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money and my favorite it save us from going to the barber for now.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s an important aspect of it.</li>
            <li>Feels like a cheap beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>The only thing that isn&#x27;t that great, is the trimming around the ears.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>He was scared of the sound of the clipped used at the hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>this model seems to be weight, sound level, and attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No clippers should be completely silent but my son heard it as soon as I turned it on and wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>This is lightweight but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>The light can&#x27;t be on,when the Hair Clipper is charged.</li>
            <li>Great product,it is quiet for children.</li>
            <li>, I have mixed signals with this product - while the kids liked it, I didn&#x27;t feel like it gave as nice of a hair cut.  </li>
            <li>We loved it at our house, my grandson doesn&#x27;t like loud noises and this worked miracles for us.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Best used after you wash and dry the hair first.</li>
            <li>and I ended up flinging it right off the end more than once.  </li>
            <li>very useful item.</li>
            <li>will get the haircut in a comfortable and familiar setting.</li>
            <li>Fun, kid friendly color!  </li>
            <li>It worked just as described and was super easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>If you see this review hasn&#x27;t been edited in a good long while, then you may safely assume things are going well.  </li>
            <li>but now it is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>This hair clipper is easy to use, quiet, in good quality and light.</li>
            <li>Was to use, kids friendly.</li>
            <li>Totally worth buying!</li>
            <li>We are pretty satisfied with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>Things I liked: they were really quiet, the rounded plastic comb was safe and there were no complaints of pain.</li>
            <li>The rounded edges really do glide through his hair and must be much more comfortable because once I started he didn&#x27;t pull away.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get too excited about the 15 length settings though--it is really only good for shorter</li>
            <li>I have two children, one has special needs and now it is a breeze to trim/cut his hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things that were not so ok: anything over the 1/2&amp;#34; setting didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and feels good on their head.</li>
            <li>good product, quiet, baby didn&#x27;t mind it</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>Our regular hair clipper was bought at Costco, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>All you need is the Philips shaver and you can do some creative hair styling with your kids till they are much older.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very quiet and good to use.</li>
            <li>Works good, but NOT as quiet as it was advertised  to be @ all</li>
            <li>The motor isn&#x27;t as strong as most adult shavers so it struggles in some kids hair.</li>
            <li>I use either a plug in or more often an adult Philips rechargeable as I can cut the hair in the bath tub more easily and clean it up better there (or the back yard in the summer time).</li>
            <li>this is a lot more kid friendly than the normal shavers.</li>
            <li>The bright colors and soft plastic of the guides certainly help ease children&#x27;s fear about getting their hair &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We found them to be fine and very workable for kids!  </li>
            <li>As I said before, it doesn&#x27;t go as finely as corded trimmers, and they don&#x27;t seem to lift hair as well for a consistent cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I did fine.</li>
            <li>and I have already had to super glue it once.</li>
            <li>After charging for 8 hours, you are supposed to get 45 minutes of cordless power so you can either cut hair quickly or recharge between uses or even use it</li>
            <li>Luckily it didn&#x27;t do any damage that couldn&#x27;t be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second best thing is that you can recharge the clippers overnight and use them the next day.  </li>
            <li>We keep it short to avoid getting it cut more often, so we just used it on the lowest setting and it worked ok.</li>
            <li>We currently have a Wahl electric clipper that we&#x27;ve been pleased with, but I thought this might be better for the kids.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and holds the charge well.</li>
            <li>We love the hair cut and will most definitely use them again!  </li>
            <li>Cleaning it super easy - just remove the comb, using your finger, push the top blade up and backwards and it pops open allowing you access to clean it with the supplied brush.</li>
            <li>perfect, perfect, perfect my little boy is scare of loud noises nothing serious, so I had his Dad&#x27;s hair clippers and it makes a starting noise that is loud and rumbles too much...</li>
            <li>Whole thing went over easy.  </li>
            <li>Very convience &amp; Easy handling.</li>
            <li>Based on the 157 posted reviews (to date), the Philips Norelco Hair Clipper appeals to parents who want to cut the hair of toddlers, kids of any age with sensory issues and developmental delays, and families who want to touch-up barber straight or fine hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll even use it to trim up my hubby&#x27;s hair when he wants a trim because his hair is fine, too.</li>
            <li>The sound is still relatively large, adjust the minimum 3mm allowed</li>
            <li>This was also very lightweight and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>When I went to use them they didn&#x27;t sound much quieter than the pair we had</li>
            <li>That being said, they are still more quiet than most and work very well.  </li>
            <li>The contouring flex of the comb was nice, though not entirely necessary.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad on the pricey side but worth it if you plan on using it over and over.</li>
            <li>That feature alone is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it took longer to cut their hair than stopping to swap out the combs on my old clippers because I had to make a lot more passes.  </li>
            <li>but this one seemed worth trying because it&#x27;s for kids.  </li>
            <li>I wish it cut better, BUT 2 thumbs up for finally getting a good cut on him before total meltdown mode.</li>
            <li>I wanted one that was geared for kids more than my adult versions, thinking it would be easier to cut my son&#x27;s hair with a clipper meant for children.</li>
            <li>As an adult using the device I would have liked another head for very close trimming hence the 4 star review.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>That in itself is worth the price, but add to that the ability to walk around without the encumbrance of a power cord</li>
            <li>Something that is clear to most by looking</li>
            <li>Very silent so it did not scare him and the blades cut his hair nicely.</li>
            <li>It made giving my 11 month old a haircut pretty easy, aside from his wiggling!</li>
            <li>The soft blue hair guards work great and are easily adjustable with the length clearly marked.</li>
            <li>The comb guide can be adjusted so you get to cut hair to the right length.</li>
            <li>it is completely safe and battery is also good enough for single cut.</li>
            <li>I was spending between $10-$20 a haircut every month or so for what seemed to be very easy, a # 3 on the sides and back</li>
            <li>The hair clipper is not as quiet as I thought it would be, but it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really notice anything special about the movement of the contour-following comb, but I could have just missed it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the guide is made of cheap plastic which breaks easily</li>
            <li>+:  this is quiet, comfortable, and easy to use on a baby.  </li>
            <li>clipper itself worked OK, and was really super quiet.</li>
            <li>These were perfect for my little boy who was scared to death of regular clippers.  </li>
            <li>They bend; that&#x27;s good, in that you can sort of conform them to the head, but less good, in that bending them makes them somewhat less</li>
            <li>two primary comments related to the sound and the feel.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as some adult clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Cordless is nice, and battery life was sufficient for a single haircut.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m very pleased with this clipper.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My daughter like it very much.</li>
            <li>Works very smoothly and quietly.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to get my son to sit through a haircut due to the quieter sound</li>
            <li>This works fine so far.</li>
            <li>good for my little baby, recommend this product to everybody who has the kids</li>
            <li>He had a little hair but the hair clipper did a good job.</li>
            <li>Super quiet, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>, I will say this was the first haircut that didn&#x27;t involve lots of screaming and</li>
            <li>At first he said no, so I told him they were just his size</li>
            <li>The noise was more bearable than traditional clippers.  </li>
            <li>These clippers broke within minutes of the first use.</li>
            <li>My husband used to cut my 3-year-old son&#x27;s hair with his clippers and they were so loud my son would throw a FIT.</li>
            <li>What I REALLY love about these hair clippers, is that they are so quiet.</li>
            <li>Plastic guide broke halfway through first trim of my three year olds hair.  </li>
            <li>and I usually only have the top trimmed every 3-4 haircuts.  </li>
            <li>I figure I&#x27;ll only have to get a haircut (to get the top trimmed)</li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco!</li>
            <li>I did notice a comb pattern showing in his hair that concerned me at first.</li>
            <li>plastic broke the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>The Norelco Kids Hair Clipper does exactly what it advertises...</li>
            <li>I love that they are so quiet and cordless.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it’s a big, plastic slide that’s not so easy to adjust and a real pain to clean.</li>
            <li>First use of this kids clipper and there were zero tears.  </li>
            <li>When we tried this at home,  for the first time, he still cried, but for the second time, he got better.  </li>
            <li>Best item to buy if you are looking at saving some monies from expensive hair cuts for children.</li>
            <li>but this is smooth, last two times has been pretty cool for the boys</li>
            <li>It went pretty well.</li>
            <li>My youngest is extremely sound sensitive too.  </li>
            <li>Now I either have to repurchase the whole clipper (which of course I won&#x27;t do!)</li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that some hair cuttings get caught in the space between the comb and the top of the razor.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my 2 1/2 yr old son hates the sound of clippers and runs at the sight of them.  </li>
            <li>Found that my clippers had been used when I opened the box to try them out for the first time.</li>
            <li>It was also nice in that even without the guard, the teeth aren&#x27;t too sharp and I was able to trim around the ears and back of the neck without any complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While being light is great, the attachments should be better made and will likely fail before the shaver does.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I also felt that the adjustment mechanism for setting the hair length could be a little more secure.</li>
            <li>Works well for my son who is 1 year old but honestly is the same as my beard trimmer I feel.</li>
            <li>Light compared to other shavers (relates to the cheap attachments mentioned below)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient for me to cut my baby&#x27;s hair in this so hot summer.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and does a good job cutting his hair.</li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery eventually gets too weak, so we were very happy to have found exactly the same model on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>quiet, and easy to use</li>
            <li>I had to trim it up and cut the back, but it was easy.  </li>
            <li>They are very quiet and cut his hair easily.  </li>
            <li>only downside is that the lock/stopper of the height adjustment on the side of the clipper is unstable and easy to slip to a difference height.</li>
            <li>I adjusted the easy to maneuver clipper head to 9mm (which is equivalent to a # 3) and started to sheer through the sides</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quiet, no instructions needed!</li>
            <li>easy to use, low noise.</li>
            <li>Quiet, easy to use and hair</li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t have that problem with</li>
            <li>The clipper is comfortable to hold for adults who have small hands, e.g., most moms, but not so comfortable for people like me with big hands, but still passable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works fine as a regular hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>And my sons hair is very thick, and they went through his hair great.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not water proof, after one use and gentle wash</li>
            <li>He still squirms around but not as much as before.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful</li>
            <li>Very noisy.</li>
            <li>Guide combs are too flimsy, but blades cut very well.</li>
            <li>It took me five days of training/playing with the clippers to get him comfortable enough to allow them to be held to his head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying real clippers</li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>son says that he won&#x27;t dread hair cuts as much anymore.</li>
            <li>This inconsistency is compounded by the fact that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much power as a corded model, and therefore seems to miss spots, even when I went slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and these have helped so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The sound is very quiet</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>their distinctive and polished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a lightweight and quiet tool, this is a rugged and precise pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>and these lasted through almost the whole cut without plugging in.</li>
            <li>I would imagine this would be very convenient for fading.</li>
            <li>He and I both much prefer these.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My boy really needs it.</li>
            <li>They cut very well</li>
            <li>Very well made clippers.  </li>
            <li>My Wahl clippers are much quieter than these Norelco &amp;#34;Ultra-Quiet&amp;#34; Kids Clippers.  </li>
            <li>He also hates combs and things running through his hair and that&#x27;s where I saw a real difference in these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of having one guard that adjusts, but it didn&#x27;t click into place as firmly as I expcted</li>
            <li>It does and actually works better than my adult cordless one.</li>
            <li>The top feature is the low noise when operating - even my 2 year old has no problem letting me trim her hair with this unit.</li>
            <li>With the second option, my results look a lot more professional.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell if you have it set right.  </li>
            <li>First off, they are very quiet which is huge because my son can&#x27;t stand loud noises.</li>
            <li>This was only the first hair cut since delivery , hopefully the second haircut will go even better</li>
            <li>Very quiet and kids friendly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The clippers are much quitter and the vibration is much lower than normal clippers.</li>
            <li>Both me and my daughter like to give him a nice trim around his ears, and this doesn&#x27;t really have a small attachment for that, so we use a very small trimmer for that area, but other then that, these clippers are wonderful.</li>
            <li>(and would do more of that with long or adult hair)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the unit looks nice but we won’t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use, especially with my son, who moves around a lot (4 years old).</li>
            <li>It is a quiet, soft, sounding hum, not a buzz sound like so many other clippers.</li>
            <li>There were only a couple of moments where the clippers were full of hair and had to be cleaned out.  </li>
            <li>The first time we took my 1 yr old to the barber shop, he screamed like someone was trying to torture him.</li>
            <li>, this is a good clipper to have -- and it takes only 3 or 4 cuts at home for the clipper to pay for itself in savings, not to mention your little one(s)</li>
            <li>Ok, a bit hard to clean completely.  </li>
            <li>My seven-year-old son hates hair cuts, but he was very cooperative as he climbed into his chair so I could try out this new set of clippers.</li>
            <li>These clippers aren&#x27;t much quieter than any new pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this steadily now for two years with no problems.</li>
            <li>But, I was able to use it enough to determine that the power level was the same whether I plugged it in or used the battery</li>
            <li>(For the record, I only cleaned up the sides and back, because I wouldn&#x27;t trust myself to cut the top, and wouldn&#x27;t use clippers to do so</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this as my grandson is autistic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This clipper does an excellent job of shaving all around the hairline - especially around the ears where painful snagging is most likely to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this for kids.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Even then, their hair had long spots and just didn&#x27;t look as cleanly cut.  </li>
            <li>Being cordless makes them so easy to use on a two year old who can&#x27;t sit still for very long.  </li>
            <li>, just know it&#x27;s not super easy or fast on all hair types.</li>
            <li>We had let his hair grow pretty long which was working just fine for us until his habit of twirling his hair left him with a bald spot.  </li>
            <li>My 20 month old has curly hair, but not too much of it yet.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t know that I would call this an ultra-quiet machine, it is still much quieter than the adult clippers I have been using.</li>
            <li>I was able to cut his hair at home without a traumatic crying event.</li>
            <li>It took more than a day to charge it full and it was exhausted within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The actual cut isn&#x27;t as exact as the adult shavers but this can be overcome by repeatedly going over the finished areas--downside is even more time spent on the hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>, I thought it would be quieter than normal clippers as it is claimed</li>
            <li>works nice on my sons thick hair .still</li>
            <li>It is easy to give haircuts with and is a little less noisier than most cilppers.</li>
            <li>I believe that the combs being so easily breakable is a design fault, especially considering it&#x27;s a kids related product.</li>
            <li>The combs are easily removed if you want to get down to the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it is about a third narrower than a typical adult set of clippers, it ran much more smoothly over my son&#x27;s head, especially around his ears.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I understand that Norelco wanted to make it easy to dial up and down the length of the comb but the way it’s designed needs work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received them yesterday, so I asked him if he wanted me to cut his hair with the new trimmers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for the non traditional hair household that is looking for a sharp yet safe cut.</li>
            <li>I love these I used them on my 7 year old autistic son he is very sensitive to haircuts</li>
            <li>Very surprised at how quite they are.  </li>
            <li>Pretty quiet hair clipper.</li>
            <li>We had bought this clipper model before from a local store and that first one lasted us about 3 years.</li>
            <li>motor is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>Rounded comb makes sure you don&#x27;t nick a small ear, or scratch the skin.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I wished I had found these sooner!</li>
            <li>Used for my 3.5 year old boy, it works well!</li>
            <li>Very quiet, however the guard broke the at the first attempt to remove it.  </li>
            <li>They are quiet and gentle, but may not be as powerful as standard clippers.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever, my four-year-old sat quietly as mom cut his hair!</li>
            <li>Plus it was loud!  </li>
            <li>It took a little bit longer to finish the job as the blade isn&#x27;t as wide as the Wahl, but it was a good tradeoff.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller guard (doesn&#x27;t stick out as much length-wise as the Wahl ones)</li>
            <li>I abandoned it mid-cut this last time for my cheap beard trimmer and finished up the cut in about half the time it took me to labor over the first parts.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Also not that quiet, but much more quiet than regular adult ones.  </li>
            <li>This is very handy, particularly when cutting a squirming child&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>/&gt;It succeeds in the first two but somewhat fails in the last.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many many clippers over my life and it&#x27;s easily the worst.</li>
            <li>That being said, had Norelco thrown in a case and made the attachments better quality, it would be hard not to give it a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>autistic and hair cuts have always been a huge struggle.</li>
            <li>Clearly, Norelco thought of their market when designing this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cut as well or as fast as regular adult clippers.</li>
            <li>I used it on my squirmy 7 month old grandson with ease.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend cut our son&#x27;s hair with it twice so far and we have no complaints.</li>
            <li>With this product I can give him a hair cut like a professional.</li>
            <li>Just use the plastic clip guides to direct your cut.</li>
            <li>Fortunately a corded option is available, as this small amount of running time for such a long charging time is disproportionate.</li>
            <li>This is too loud for a baby.</li>
            <li>The gaurd broke off and we ended up having to completely buzz off my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>My 8 month old boy did not even notice when I shaved his hair using this clipper.</li>
            <li>Just remember they need to be charged before using them, something we didn&#x27;t have to do with our old clippers.</li>
            <li>It completely ruined my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It’s far from “ultra”</li>
            <li>The charge keeps for awhile and they&#x27;re not as loud and noisy as the plug-in variety.  </li>
            <li>but he didn&#x27;t mind these until they got near his ears.</li>
            <li>We did still use the adult clippers for his sides but it was MUCH easier to only need the bigger clippers for the sides then his whole head.</li>
            <li>It works for my 2 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>This is an inexpensive kid&#x27;s hair clipper that won&#x27;t pull their hair and isn&#x27;t so noisy that it scares them (like our adult clippers).</li>
            <li>Used this to cut my one month old baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Plastic guard broke after one use on a 2 year old.</li>
            <li>I got this clipper for my 8 year old and 6 year old.</li>
            <li>I cut my 9 year old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>tested on my 1 yr old toddler.</li>
            <li>soft guide things that people seem to be worried about don&#x27;t bother me, I don&#x27;t see a problem with them.  </li>
            <li>We bought it to cut the hair of a two year old.</li>
            <li>It came on time and it is quiet and works fast.</li>
            <li>this is not an adult shaver.</li>
            <li>Just tried to give my 6 month old his a haircut yesterday.</li>
            <li>Used it to trim the side hair for our 3 month old.</li>
            <li>It is not silent but really much quieter.</li>
            <li>This allows for many lengths with few combs, as you can adjust the actual clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s a good enough though not great clipper.</li>
            <li>It lasts a full haircut without issue or running down near the end.</li>
            <li>Even for a kid, it could be embarrassing if the guide suddenly collapsed into its shortest setting, right in the middle of one&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>The problem is with older kids, such as my 9 year old, I do not seem to have that much control in switching between hair length settings as I have with another Philips Norelco trimmer in the same price range, the Philips Norelco QC5560/40 Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this shaver is fine for short length haircuts for kids but understand that the features that make it better for kids also slow the process down</li>
            <li>Fairly small and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>Comb snapped after second use, and  replacement part is same price as whole new unit.  </li>
            <li>far as the sound level is concerned, it’s about half the noise of traditional plug in trimmers.  </li>
            <li>The small contact surface on the guide, and the fact it&#x27;s not made of some super-hard plastic like the combs on professional clippers, makes it relatively comfortable on the kid&#x27;s scalp (or so I&#x27;ve been told by the test subjects...).  </li>
            <li>I only paid high price to get a quieter clipper</li>
            <li>The key thing I have found which makes the clipper work 2x to 4x better is to pop open the blade cover and clean out all the little hair trapped under it.</li>
            <li>This Norelco kids trimmer is light and less noisy than the traditional trimmer.</li>
            <li>&quot; long, so the clippings were long enough not to fall free through the slots.</li>
            <li>They are small and light weight.  </li>
            <li>Also small and light weight so easier control.  </li>
            <li>they are not silent but they are way quieter then normal clippers.</li>
            <li>Considering the dark coloring, noise, and sharp looking edges of most trimmers</li>
            <li>Understand, I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the clippers for anything, they just didn&#x27;t live up to what my hopes and expectations were.</li>
            <li>Every clipper has it&#x27;s special little &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; that makes you choose it (large variety of clipper guards to help you cut evenly, a close trim blade, extra long cord, etc.)  </li>
            <li>Two, they work fairly quickly and since he is so wiggly and impatient</li>
            <li>For his fine baby hairs it&#x27;s hard to deal with because you have to move the clipper against hair growth</li>
            <li>Overall a very nice cordless for cutting kids hair</li>
            <li>This Philips clipper is designed specifically for young kids -- I say young because the clip head is kind of small, and the attached comb guide is has a small contact surface area.</li>
            <li>I was cautious it would not be strong enough for my 20 yr old&#x27;s thick hair</li>
            <li>It works easily on his very fine hair, when the hair builds up close to the cutting mechanism I just use a little brush to clear it off and</li>
            <li>The second contour comb is larger and only for the longer lengths, which it didn&#x27;t do that well with--essentially making the large comb</li>
            <li>If you have a very small child, this might be a good starter as it is quieter and gentler, perhaps less intimidating than a bigger clipper.  </li>
            <li>Its noise level is just barely enough for our autistic son to be comfortable enough to let us cut his hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a big difference as far as noise .</li>
            <li>This Kids Hair is far from silent.</li>
            <li>Nearly two years later.</li>
            <li>I bought this clipper after my 13 month old son had a big cry at the hair stylist&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Called norelco, and apparently they are no longer manufacturing this product</li>
            <li>These clippers are NOT ultra quiet as advertised, in fact the are just as loud if not louder than the $11 clippers i bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only two settings (as far as the length of the cut).</li>
            <li>I used this on my 6 year old son&#x27;s hair in between regular cuts.  </li>
            <li>My son appreciates the soft guards, especially around the ears.</li>
            <li>Occasionally you have to stop and brush the hair out of the clippers but has not proven to be a hassle so far.</li>
            <li>Works well enough to cut my 10m old hair.  </li>
            <li>When it grows out it is unmanageable and cutting here or there just looks…not good.</li>
            <li>I think people might think this model is particularly quiet because by the time they needed new clippers, their old ones were run down - and old clippers are particularly loud.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my son who is autistic and HATES to have his hair cut based on the reviews that they were super quiet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also started to use this on my beard and it trims thick facial hair just as easily as anything else.</li>
            <li>Broke half way during first use.</li>
            <li>very light, smooth cutting, less noise and battery</li>
            <li>Great for cutting my toddlers hair!  </li>
            <li>For the right price (less than $50) I would get it if you plan on taking care of the family haircuts at home in the long run.</li>
            <li>Because his hair isn&#x27;t super thick yet, I use it on the shorter setting and it works quite well.</li>
            <li>(granted, I did have to go over a few spots again, but this was my first time ever cutting my own hair)  </li>
            <li>My son has autism and this product was so much less loud than our old clippers.</li>
            <li>I really like that there are only 2 different guides and you just slide them up and down to adjust the size.</li>
            <li>These clippers are nice, they are much quieter then the regular clippers, but they&#x27;re not as quiet as I expected, my son use to cry so bad because of the other clippers vibration and noise, he still wines but not as much with these clippers</li>
            <li>The little cleaning brush which comes with the clipper works very well.</li>
            <li>They make it much easier to cut a little one&#x27;s hair without them complaining that the trimmer is hurting them.  </li>
            <li>So much easier without a cord to dodge little hands putting up a struggle.  </li>
            <li>Which is both good and bad depending on your use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nice cordless clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never cut my own hair before.  </li>
            <li> I should also add there was no pulling or yanking of any kind.</li>
            <li> After adjusting, I used it to cut hair (my own) and it worked quite well.  </li>
            <li> In fact, this week, I&#x27;ve had people tell me they liked my haircut.  </li>
            <li> Both my boys liked when I used this to cut their hair.  </li>
            <li> Battery life was sufficient and it was nice to hold.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say this thing is a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I just received this item and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers seem to cut really well, and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I even cut my own hair with it.</li>
            <li> I adjusted length to 1/8 inches and it trimmed off his hair nicely.</li>
            <li> nice item, nice seller.</li>
            <li> I have not used it for my  4-year-old son, but a 28-year-old friend has used it and quite liked it.</li>
            <li> Works really nice.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the design feature that allowed me to transition between lengths without having to go get another attachment.  </li>
            <li> nice price.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, good quality, user friendly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The combs adjust very easily and come off</li>
            <li> Very easy use.</li>
            <li> Its quite and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 minutes I was done and it looked pretty good!</li>
            <li> This is cheap and good item.</li>
            <li> nice hair cut tool, my kids love it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> It feels great in the hand and easy to clean and wipe off the hair.</li>
            <li> attractive, well designed, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This kids unit is very light weight.</li>
            <li> Good product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> So easy to use and nice and quit for kids.  </li>
            <li> But, ultimately we enjoyed a very smooth,</li>
            <li> They run on rechargeable batteries, which is a huge plus for me!  </li>
            <li> accurate description!</li>
            <li> Great packaging, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> pleased+++</li>
            <li> We are now able to cut his hair without a fight and a traumatic experience.</li>
            <li> I mostly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It can be charged, and the cord removed, so I was able to follow him around the house while trimming.</li>
            <li> It just take more time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> hates clippers but a lil more tolerant of these</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and I was hoping it would work in my kids hair salon.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d better be fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay for home use,</li>
            <li> ...that thing feels like it is going to strip out over time, and thus you won&#x27;t be able to lock in the length setting like you need to</li>
            <li> For that alone, it is a worthwhile product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Satisfied</li>
            <li> I have cut my kids&#x27; hair for many years and the cord always getting in the way was a pain.</li>
            <li> The clippers cut ok.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, the more we use them, the more he will accept them.  </li>
            <li> This is a lot quiter than most hair clippers.</li>
            <li> My boys with ASD do much better with these.</li>
            <li> My grandson gets a very close haircut, and for that these clippers work great.</li>
            <li> I love the width.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and cuts great!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Really quiet, perfect!</li>
            <li> The attachment comb could have been better designed.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> The best thing about them is that it&#x27;s quiet.  </li>
            <li> Do not go by my word that my kid hates, he just hates it for no reason. :)</li>
            <li> The LO looks cute , and we save the $$ with going to the hair salon.</li>
            <li> Every haircut consisted of &amp;#34;cut, get scratched, break, and try again.&amp;#34; After reading the reviews I decided to try one more.</li>
            <li> if you have more than one kiddo waiting in line, you&#x27;ll have to use the cord.</li>
            <li> just replaced it hope that will be better</li>
            <li> bought to trim cats butt, need more practice</li>
            <li> so kids feel comfortable!</li>
            <li> It does not pull their hair and I feel safe using it on them...</li>
            <li> and they volunteer to get their hair cut :-).</li>
            <li> kids like these and feel safe with them.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d be able to trim it up.  </li>
            <li> Cordless AND able to use the included cord.</li>
            <li> Now it is May 18th, and the item is not working any more after being used twice.  </li>
            <li> However they do fit nicely in my hand and are lightweight.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, really.</li>
            <li> liked it because it is easy to use for me, I can easily hold it in my hand and move it the way I like while trimming my kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> And for the first time in all of these years, it looked as good as the haircutter or barber does.  </li>
            <li> you are in need of a kid friendly hair clipper, you may want to take a peek at this Norelco!</li>
            <li> If you are going to cut hair yourself, then this insures it&#x27;s easy and safe</li>
            <li> Works great nice &amp; quiet</li>
            <li> I also love the quick langth adjustment heads!  </li>
            <li> It has very good settings about different lengths.  </li>
            <li> Works very good and it is very quiet</li>
            <li> The notches don&#x27;t allow for the locking pin to be perfectly seated, so there&#x27;s a need to be careful when assuming you&#x27;ve got the length set at whichever length you want.</li>
            <li> The accessory pack includes a hair removal brush, an instruction CD and most importantly the apron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the hang of it soon, but the first couple of times I had to hold them up to his hair and kind of</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I loved the cordless feature because it makes maneuvering around a wiggly kid that much easier.  </li>
            <li> my sons hair doesn&#x27;t feed through easily?  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know how easy it could be with the help of this clipper.</li>
            <li> clipper is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The guards are easy to use and change.</li>
            <li> Easy to use .  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The motor doesn&#x27;t seem particularly strong.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fine in texture.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine with me, because I got them for the kids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my son didn&#x27;t cry at all, and he looks handsome and cute with his new hair cut :)</li>
            <li> Without the guards on, it makes a very nice trimmer for beards, necks, eyebrows and other hairy bits that you want a nice clean line on.  </li>
            <li> Trimming hair can be a huge task for us.  </li>
            <li> Quiet and worked great.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money and my favorite it save us from going to the barber for now.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s an important aspect of it.</li>
            <li> Feels like a cheap beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The only thing that isn&#x27;t that great, is the trimming around the ears.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> He was scared of the sound of the clipped used at the hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> this model seems to be weight, sound level, and attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No clippers should be completely silent but my son heard it as soon as I turned it on and wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li> This is lightweight but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> The light can&#x27;t be on,when the Hair Clipper is charged.</li>
            <li> Great product,it is quiet for children.</li>
            <li> , I have mixed signals with this product - while the kids liked it, I didn&#x27;t feel like it gave as nice of a hair cut.  </li>
            <li> We loved it at our house, my grandson doesn&#x27;t like loud noises and this worked miracles for us.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> Best used after you wash and dry the hair first.</li>
            <li> and I ended up flinging it right off the end more than once.  </li>
            <li> very useful item.</li>
            <li> will get the haircut in a comfortable and familiar setting.</li>
            <li> Fun, kid friendly color!  </li>
            <li> It worked just as described and was super easy to understand.  </li>
            <li> If you see this review hasn&#x27;t been edited in a good long while, then you may safely assume things are going well.  </li>
            <li> but now it is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> This hair clipper is easy to use, quiet, in good quality and light.</li>
            <li> Was to use, kids friendly.</li>
            <li> Totally worth buying!</li>
            <li> We are pretty satisfied with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> Things I liked: they were really quiet, the rounded plastic comb was safe and there were no complaints of pain.</li>
            <li> The rounded edges really do glide through his hair and must be much more comfortable because once I started he didn&#x27;t pull away.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get too excited about the 15 length settings though--it is really only good for shorter</li>
            <li> I have two children, one has special needs and now it is a breeze to trim/cut his hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things that were not so ok: anything over the 1/2&amp;#34; setting didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and feels good on their head.</li>
            <li> good product, quiet, baby didn&#x27;t mind it</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> Our regular hair clipper was bought at Costco, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> All you need is the Philips shaver and you can do some creative hair styling with your kids till they are much older.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very quiet and good to use.</li>
            <li> Works good, but NOT as quiet as it was advertised  to be @ all</li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t as strong as most adult shavers so it struggles in some kids hair.</li>
            <li> I use either a plug in or more often an adult Philips rechargeable as I can cut the hair in the bath tub more easily and clean it up better there (or the back yard in the summer time).</li>
            <li> this is a lot more kid friendly than the normal shavers.</li>
            <li> The bright colors and soft plastic of the guides certainly help ease children&#x27;s fear about getting their hair &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We found them to be fine and very workable for kids!  </li>
            <li> As I said before, it doesn&#x27;t go as finely as corded trimmers, and they don&#x27;t seem to lift hair as well for a consistent cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I did fine.</li>
            <li> and I have already had to super glue it once.</li>
            <li> After charging for 8 hours, you are supposed to get 45 minutes of cordless power so you can either cut hair quickly or recharge between uses or even use it</li>
            <li> Luckily it didn&#x27;t do any damage that couldn&#x27;t be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second best thing is that you can recharge the clippers overnight and use them the next day.  </li>
            <li> We keep it short to avoid getting it cut more often, so we just used it on the lowest setting and it worked ok.</li>
            <li> We currently have a Wahl electric clipper that we&#x27;ve been pleased with, but I thought this might be better for the kids.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and holds the charge well.</li>
            <li> We love the hair cut and will most definitely use them again!  </li>
            <li> Cleaning it super easy - just remove the comb, using your finger, push the top blade up and backwards and it pops open allowing you access to clean it with the supplied brush.</li>
            <li> perfect, perfect, perfect my little boy is scare of loud noises nothing serious, so I had his Dad&#x27;s hair clippers and it makes a starting noise that is loud and rumbles too much...</li>
            <li> Whole thing went over easy.  </li>
            <li> Very convience &amp; Easy handling.</li>
            <li> Based on the 157 posted reviews (to date), the Philips Norelco Hair Clipper appeals to parents who want to cut the hair of toddlers, kids of any age with sensory issues and developmental delays, and families who want to touch-up barber straight or fine hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll even use it to trim up my hubby&#x27;s hair when he wants a trim because his hair is fine, too.</li>
            <li> The sound is still relatively large, adjust the minimum 3mm allowed</li>
            <li> This was also very lightweight and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> When I went to use them they didn&#x27;t sound much quieter than the pair we had</li>
            <li> That being said, they are still more quiet than most and work very well.  </li>
            <li> The contouring flex of the comb was nice, though not entirely necessary.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad on the pricey side but worth it if you plan on using it over and over.</li>
            <li> That feature alone is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it took longer to cut their hair than stopping to swap out the combs on my old clippers because I had to make a lot more passes.  </li>
            <li> but this one seemed worth trying because it&#x27;s for kids.  </li>
            <li> I wish it cut better, BUT 2 thumbs up for finally getting a good cut on him before total meltdown mode.</li>
            <li> I wanted one that was geared for kids more than my adult versions, thinking it would be easier to cut my son&#x27;s hair with a clipper meant for children.</li>
            <li> As an adult using the device I would have liked another head for very close trimming hence the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> That in itself is worth the price, but add to that the ability to walk around without the encumbrance of a power cord</li>
            <li> Something that is clear to most by looking</li>
            <li> Very silent so it did not scare him and the blades cut his hair nicely.</li>
            <li> It made giving my 11 month old a haircut pretty easy, aside from his wiggling!</li>
            <li> The soft blue hair guards work great and are easily adjustable with the length clearly marked.</li>
            <li> The comb guide can be adjusted so you get to cut hair to the right length.</li>
            <li> it is completely safe and battery is also good enough for single cut.</li>
            <li> I was spending between $10-$20 a haircut every month or so for what seemed to be very easy, a # 3 on the sides and back</li>
            <li> The hair clipper is not as quiet as I thought it would be, but it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice anything special about the movement of the contour-following comb, but I could have just missed it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the guide is made of cheap plastic which breaks easily</li>
            <li> +:  this is quiet, comfortable, and easy to use on a baby.  </li>
            <li> clipper itself worked OK, and was really super quiet.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for my little boy who was scared to death of regular clippers.  </li>
            <li> They bend; that&#x27;s good, in that you can sort of conform them to the head, but less good, in that bending them makes them somewhat less</li>
            <li> two primary comments related to the sound and the feel.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as some adult clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Cordless is nice, and battery life was sufficient for a single haircut.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m very pleased with this clipper.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My daughter like it very much.</li>
            <li> Works very smoothly and quietly.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to get my son to sit through a haircut due to the quieter sound</li>
            <li> This works fine so far.</li>
            <li> good for my little baby, recommend this product to everybody who has the kids</li>
            <li> He had a little hair but the hair clipper did a good job.</li>
            <li> Super quiet, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> , I will say this was the first haircut that didn&#x27;t involve lots of screaming and</li>
            <li> At first he said no, so I told him they were just his size</li>
            <li> The noise was more bearable than traditional clippers.  </li>
            <li> These clippers broke within minutes of the first use.</li>
            <li> My husband used to cut my 3-year-old son&#x27;s hair with his clippers and they were so loud my son would throw a FIT.</li>
            <li> What I REALLY love about these hair clippers, is that they are so quiet.</li>
            <li> Plastic guide broke halfway through first trim of my three year olds hair.  </li>
            <li> and I usually only have the top trimmed every 3-4 haircuts.  </li>
            <li> I figure I&#x27;ll only have to get a haircut (to get the top trimmed)</li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco!</li>
            <li> I did notice a comb pattern showing in his hair that concerned me at first.</li>
            <li> plastic broke the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Kids Hair Clipper does exactly what it advertises...</li>
            <li> I love that they are so quiet and cordless.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it’s a big, plastic slide that’s not so easy to adjust and a real pain to clean.</li>
            <li> First use of this kids clipper and there were zero tears.  </li>
            <li> When we tried this at home,  for the first time, he still cried, but for the second time, he got better.  </li>
            <li> Best item to buy if you are looking at saving some monies from expensive hair cuts for children.</li>
            <li> but this is smooth, last two times has been pretty cool for the boys</li>
            <li> It went pretty well.</li>
            <li> My youngest is extremely sound sensitive too.  </li>
            <li> Now I either have to repurchase the whole clipper (which of course I won&#x27;t do!)</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that some hair cuttings get caught in the space between the comb and the top of the razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my 2 1/2 yr old son hates the sound of clippers and runs at the sight of them.  </li>
            <li> Found that my clippers had been used when I opened the box to try them out for the first time.</li>
            <li> It was also nice in that even without the guard, the teeth aren&#x27;t too sharp and I was able to trim around the ears and back of the neck without any complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While being light is great, the attachments should be better made and will likely fail before the shaver does.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I also felt that the adjustment mechanism for setting the hair length could be a little more secure.</li>
            <li> Works well for my son who is 1 year old but honestly is the same as my beard trimmer I feel.</li>
            <li> Light compared to other shavers (relates to the cheap attachments mentioned below)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient for me to cut my baby&#x27;s hair in this so hot summer.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and does a good job cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery eventually gets too weak, so we were very happy to have found exactly the same model on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> quiet, and easy to use</li>
            <li> I had to trim it up and cut the back, but it was easy.  </li>
            <li> They are very quiet and cut his hair easily.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that the lock/stopper of the height adjustment on the side of the clipper is unstable and easy to slip to a difference height.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the easy to maneuver clipper head to 9mm (which is equivalent to a # 3) and started to sheer through the sides</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quiet, no instructions needed!</li>
            <li> easy to use, low noise.</li>
            <li> Quiet, easy to use and hair</li>
            <li> I certainly won&#x27;t have that problem with</li>
            <li> The clipper is comfortable to hold for adults who have small hands, e.g., most moms, but not so comfortable for people like me with big hands, but still passable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works fine as a regular hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> And my sons hair is very thick, and they went through his hair great.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not water proof, after one use and gentle wash</li>
            <li> He still squirms around but not as much as before.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful</li>
            <li> Very noisy.</li>
            <li> Guide combs are too flimsy, but blades cut very well.</li>
            <li> It took me five days of training/playing with the clippers to get him comfortable enough to allow them to be held to his head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying real clippers</li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> son says that he won&#x27;t dread hair cuts as much anymore.</li>
            <li> This inconsistency is compounded by the fact that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much power as a corded model, and therefore seems to miss spots, even when I went slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and these have helped so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The sound is very quiet</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> their distinctive and polished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a lightweight and quiet tool, this is a rugged and precise pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> and these lasted through almost the whole cut without plugging in.</li>
            <li> I would imagine this would be very convenient for fading.</li>
            <li> He and I both much prefer these.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My boy really needs it.</li>
            <li> They cut very well</li>
            <li> Very well made clippers.  </li>
            <li> My Wahl clippers are much quieter than these Norelco &amp;#34;Ultra-Quiet&amp;#34; Kids Clippers.  </li>
            <li> He also hates combs and things running through his hair and that&#x27;s where I saw a real difference in these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea of having one guard that adjusts, but it didn&#x27;t click into place as firmly as I expcted</li>
            <li> It does and actually works better than my adult cordless one.</li>
            <li> The top feature is the low noise when operating - even my 2 year old has no problem letting me trim her hair with this unit.</li>
            <li> With the second option, my results look a lot more professional.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell if you have it set right.  </li>
            <li> First off, they are very quiet which is huge because my son can&#x27;t stand loud noises.</li>
            <li> This was only the first hair cut since delivery , hopefully the second haircut will go even better</li>
            <li> Very quiet and kids friendly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The clippers are much quitter and the vibration is much lower than normal clippers.</li>
            <li> Both me and my daughter like to give him a nice trim around his ears, and this doesn&#x27;t really have a small attachment for that, so we use a very small trimmer for that area, but other then that, these clippers are wonderful.</li>
            <li> (and would do more of that with long or adult hair)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the unit looks nice but we won’t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use, especially with my son, who moves around a lot (4 years old).</li>
            <li> It is a quiet, soft, sounding hum, not a buzz sound like so many other clippers.</li>
            <li> There were only a couple of moments where the clippers were full of hair and had to be cleaned out.  </li>
            <li> The first time we took my 1 yr old to the barber shop, he screamed like someone was trying to torture him.</li>
            <li> , this is a good clipper to have -- and it takes only 3 or 4 cuts at home for the clipper to pay for itself in savings, not to mention your little one(s)</li>
            <li> Ok, a bit hard to clean completely.  </li>
            <li> My seven-year-old son hates hair cuts, but he was very cooperative as he climbed into his chair so I could try out this new set of clippers.</li>
            <li> These clippers aren&#x27;t much quieter than any new pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this steadily now for two years with no problems.</li>
            <li> But, I was able to use it enough to determine that the power level was the same whether I plugged it in or used the battery</li>
            <li> (For the record, I only cleaned up the sides and back, because I wouldn&#x27;t trust myself to cut the top, and wouldn&#x27;t use clippers to do so</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this as my grandson is autistic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This clipper does an excellent job of shaving all around the hairline - especially around the ears where painful snagging is most likely to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this for kids.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Even then, their hair had long spots and just didn&#x27;t look as cleanly cut.  </li>
            <li> Being cordless makes them so easy to use on a two year old who can&#x27;t sit still for very long.  </li>
            <li> , just know it&#x27;s not super easy or fast on all hair types.</li>
            <li> We had let his hair grow pretty long which was working just fine for us until his habit of twirling his hair left him with a bald spot.  </li>
            <li> My 20 month old has curly hair, but not too much of it yet.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t know that I would call this an ultra-quiet machine, it is still much quieter than the adult clippers I have been using.</li>
            <li> I was able to cut his hair at home without a traumatic crying event.</li>
            <li> It took more than a day to charge it full and it was exhausted within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The actual cut isn&#x27;t as exact as the adult shavers but this can be overcome by repeatedly going over the finished areas--downside is even more time spent on the hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> , I thought it would be quieter than normal clippers as it is claimed</li>
            <li> works nice on my sons thick hair .still</li>
            <li> It is easy to give haircuts with and is a little less noisier than most cilppers.</li>
            <li> I believe that the combs being so easily breakable is a design fault, especially considering it&#x27;s a kids related product.</li>
            <li> The combs are easily removed if you want to get down to the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it is about a third narrower than a typical adult set of clippers, it ran much more smoothly over my son&#x27;s head, especially around his ears.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I understand that Norelco wanted to make it easy to dial up and down the length of the comb but the way it’s designed needs work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received them yesterday, so I asked him if he wanted me to cut his hair with the new trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for the non traditional hair household that is looking for a sharp yet safe cut.</li>
            <li> I love these I used them on my 7 year old autistic son he is very sensitive to haircuts</li>
            <li> Very surprised at how quite they are.  </li>
            <li> Pretty quiet hair clipper.</li>
            <li> We had bought this clipper model before from a local store and that first one lasted us about 3 years.</li>
            <li> motor is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> Rounded comb makes sure you don&#x27;t nick a small ear, or scratch the skin.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I wished I had found these sooner!</li>
            <li> Used for my 3.5 year old boy, it works well!</li>
            <li> Very quiet, however the guard broke the at the first attempt to remove it.  </li>
            <li> They are quiet and gentle, but may not be as powerful as standard clippers.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, my four-year-old sat quietly as mom cut his hair!</li>
            <li> Plus it was loud!  </li>
            <li> It took a little bit longer to finish the job as the blade isn&#x27;t as wide as the Wahl, but it was a good tradeoff.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller guard (doesn&#x27;t stick out as much length-wise as the Wahl ones)</li>
            <li> I abandoned it mid-cut this last time for my cheap beard trimmer and finished up the cut in about half the time it took me to labor over the first parts.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Also not that quiet, but much more quiet than regular adult ones.  </li>
            <li> This is very handy, particularly when cutting a squirming child&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> /&gt;It succeeds in the first two but somewhat fails in the last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many many clippers over my life and it&#x27;s easily the worst.</li>
            <li> That being said, had Norelco thrown in a case and made the attachments better quality, it would be hard not to give it a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> autistic and hair cuts have always been a huge struggle.</li>
            <li> Clearly, Norelco thought of their market when designing this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut as well or as fast as regular adult clippers.</li>
            <li> I used it on my squirmy 7 month old grandson with ease.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend cut our son&#x27;s hair with it twice so far and we have no complaints.</li>
            <li> With this product I can give him a hair cut like a professional.</li>
            <li> Just use the plastic clip guides to direct your cut.</li>
            <li> Fortunately a corded option is available, as this small amount of running time for such a long charging time is disproportionate.</li>
            <li> This is too loud for a baby.</li>
            <li> The gaurd broke off and we ended up having to completely buzz off my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My 8 month old boy did not even notice when I shaved his hair using this clipper.</li>
            <li> Just remember they need to be charged before using them, something we didn&#x27;t have to do with our old clippers.</li>
            <li> It completely ruined my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It’s far from “ultra”</li>
            <li> The charge keeps for awhile and they&#x27;re not as loud and noisy as the plug-in variety.  </li>
            <li> but he didn&#x27;t mind these until they got near his ears.</li>
            <li> We did still use the adult clippers for his sides but it was MUCH easier to only need the bigger clippers for the sides then his whole head.</li>
            <li> It works for my 2 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive kid&#x27;s hair clipper that won&#x27;t pull their hair and isn&#x27;t so noisy that it scares them (like our adult clippers).</li>
            <li> Used this to cut my one month old baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Plastic guard broke after one use on a 2 year old.</li>
            <li> I got this clipper for my 8 year old and 6 year old.</li>
            <li> I cut my 9 year old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> tested on my 1 yr old toddler.</li>
            <li> soft guide things that people seem to be worried about don&#x27;t bother me, I don&#x27;t see a problem with them.  </li>
            <li> We bought it to cut the hair of a two year old.</li>
            <li> It came on time and it is quiet and works fast.</li>
            <li> this is not an adult shaver.</li>
            <li> Just tried to give my 6 month old his a haircut yesterday.</li>
            <li> Used it to trim the side hair for our 3 month old.</li>
            <li> It is not silent but really much quieter.</li>
            <li> This allows for many lengths with few combs, as you can adjust the actual clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s a good enough though not great clipper.</li>
            <li> It lasts a full haircut without issue or running down near the end.</li>
            <li> Even for a kid, it could be embarrassing if the guide suddenly collapsed into its shortest setting, right in the middle of one&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> The problem is with older kids, such as my 9 year old, I do not seem to have that much control in switching between hair length settings as I have with another Philips Norelco trimmer in the same price range, the Philips Norelco QC5560/40 Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this shaver is fine for short length haircuts for kids but understand that the features that make it better for kids also slow the process down</li>
            <li> Fairly small and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Comb snapped after second use, and  replacement part is same price as whole new unit.  </li>
            <li> far as the sound level is concerned, it’s about half the noise of traditional plug in trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The small contact surface on the guide, and the fact it&#x27;s not made of some super-hard plastic like the combs on professional clippers, makes it relatively comfortable on the kid&#x27;s scalp (or so I&#x27;ve been told by the test subjects...).  </li>
            <li> I only paid high price to get a quieter clipper</li>
            <li> The key thing I have found which makes the clipper work 2x to 4x better is to pop open the blade cover and clean out all the little hair trapped under it.</li>
            <li> This Norelco kids trimmer is light and less noisy than the traditional trimmer.</li>
            <li> &quot; long, so the clippings were long enough not to fall free through the slots.</li>
            <li> They are small and light weight.  </li>
            <li> Also small and light weight so easier control.  </li>
            <li> they are not silent but they are way quieter then normal clippers.</li>
            <li> Considering the dark coloring, noise, and sharp looking edges of most trimmers</li>
            <li> Understand, I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the clippers for anything, they just didn&#x27;t live up to what my hopes and expectations were.</li>
            <li> Every clipper has it&#x27;s special little &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; that makes you choose it (large variety of clipper guards to help you cut evenly, a close trim blade, extra long cord, etc.)  </li>
            <li> Two, they work fairly quickly and since he is so wiggly and impatient</li>
            <li> For his fine baby hairs it&#x27;s hard to deal with because you have to move the clipper against hair growth</li>
            <li> Overall a very nice cordless for cutting kids hair</li>
            <li> This Philips clipper is designed specifically for young kids -- I say young because the clip head is kind of small, and the attached comb guide is has a small contact surface area.</li>
            <li> I was cautious it would not be strong enough for my 20 yr old&#x27;s thick hair</li>
            <li> It works easily on his very fine hair, when the hair builds up close to the cutting mechanism I just use a little brush to clear it off and</li>
            <li> The second contour comb is larger and only for the longer lengths, which it didn&#x27;t do that well with--essentially making the large comb</li>
            <li> If you have a very small child, this might be a good starter as it is quieter and gentler, perhaps less intimidating than a bigger clipper.  </li>
            <li> Its noise level is just barely enough for our autistic son to be comfortable enough to let us cut his hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a big difference as far as noise .</li>
            <li> This Kids Hair is far from silent.</li>
            <li> Nearly two years later.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper after my 13 month old son had a big cry at the hair stylist&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Called norelco, and apparently they are no longer manufacturing this product</li>
            <li> These clippers are NOT ultra quiet as advertised, in fact the are just as loud if not louder than the $11 clippers i bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only two settings (as far as the length of the cut).</li>
            <li> I used this on my 6 year old son&#x27;s hair in between regular cuts.  </li>
            <li> My son appreciates the soft guards, especially around the ears.</li>
            <li> Occasionally you have to stop and brush the hair out of the clippers but has not proven to be a hassle so far.</li>
            <li> Works well enough to cut my 10m old hair.  </li>
            <li> When it grows out it is unmanageable and cutting here or there just looks…not good.</li>
            <li> I think people might think this model is particularly quiet because by the time they needed new clippers, their old ones were run down - and old clippers are particularly loud.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my son who is autistic and HATES to have his hair cut based on the reviews that they were super quiet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started to use this on my beard and it trims thick facial hair just as easily as anything else.</li>
            <li> Broke half way during first use.</li>
            <li> very light, smooth cutting, less noise and battery</li>
            <li> Great for cutting my toddlers hair!  </li>
            <li> For the right price (less than $50) I would get it if you plan on taking care of the family haircuts at home in the long run.</li>
            <li> Because his hair isn&#x27;t super thick yet, I use it on the shorter setting and it works quite well.</li>
            <li> (granted, I did have to go over a few spots again, but this was my first time ever cutting my own hair)  </li>
            <li> My son has autism and this product was so much less loud than our old clippers.</li>
            <li> I really like that there are only 2 different guides and you just slide them up and down to adjust the size.</li>
            <li> These clippers are nice, they are much quieter then the regular clippers, but they&#x27;re not as quiet as I expected, my son use to cry so bad because of the other clippers vibration and noise, he still wines but not as much with these clippers</li>
            <li> The little cleaning brush which comes with the clipper works very well.</li>
            <li> They make it much easier to cut a little one&#x27;s hair without them complaining that the trimmer is hurting them.  </li>
            <li> So much easier without a cord to dodge little hands putting up a struggle.  </li>
            <li> Which is both good and bad depending on your use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old male with fairly thick, straight hair</li>
            <li> The two clipper guards snap on/off easily and actually worked because they flex where the other clippers I&#x27;ve had can be a little sharp.  </li>
            <li> These were only slightly quieter than my normal pair of plug in clippers.</li>
            <li> (Vacuum, hair dryer, blender etc.)</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to get through a full head of hair which is not good for babies with short patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> It is broken after I clean it.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last a long time when fully charged,</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time (I&#x27;ve only charged it once</li>
            <li> The charger cord is long so you can technically still use it when it&#x27;s charging if you need to.</li>
            <li> yes it is a little quieter than regular ones but not hugely so.the clip guide slid right on and made the haircut foolproof  even as he squirmed through it.i ended up having to use scissors to finish up.it</li>
            <li> last very long when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The battery charge on this doesn&#x27;t last very long though, so</li>
            <li> cut of a 3 year old with a mohawk are done in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> They work well, but felt a little flimsy, and I am somewhat concerned about how long they would last if they were removed frequently to switch.  </li>
            <li> It is much quieter than any clipper I&#x27;ve ever seen, but that doesn&#x27;t mean to say it&#x27;s silent.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s nothing to stop you from doing adult haircuts; it will just take a little longer (get out that plug-in cord!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> since I got this my little one loves it and my 7 year old too.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is cordless, so you don&#x27;t have the cord in front of his face while cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> Allows you to be more flexible while cutting, something you NEED when tackling kids hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it takes a really long time</li>
            <li> It took twice as long to cut his hair...</li>
            <li> Not as silent as I expected but still O.K.</li>
            <li> individual \\&quot;ski\\&quot; is only attached at the rear end, to a narrow band of plastic across the back of the guide head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time with my baby boys.</li>
            <li> It was taking too long to get through my sons&#x27; thick hair, so I switched to the Wahl, which got it done much faster.  </li>
            <li> He has thick straight</li>
            <li> My son has thicker hair near the top of his head that can bog down the other razor which leads to some hair pulling instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only slightly more quieter than regular clippers, so that was a little disappointing</li>
            <li> Not silent, but quieter than other clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is a bit smaller compared to other electric clippers, but I like that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> (it was about 4 or so inches long!)</li>
            <li> Quiet compared other shavers (relates to the speed issue below)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not nearly as quiet as I thought they would be based on the other reviewed.</li>
            <li> Not as quiet as I would have thought it would be from the description and other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the cutting guides as hair accumulates and has to be cleaned out, but overall, it&#x27;s not a bad clipper.</li>
            <li> I will use it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Still, if you use an electric clipper, you ought to know at least something about hair cutting, as even a good clipper can&#x27;t save you from everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m getting at is that these clippers are quiet enough, but they&#x27;re not something a ninja could use to covertly dispatch someone in the dead of night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smaller (narrow) width helps on smaller heads (but slows the process</li>
            <li> even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;- I did not need to use the clippers long enough to run down the battery, as clipping my son&#x27;s hair is usually a ten minute or less task.</li>
            <li> old grandson, that usually screams and cries every time he gets a haircut.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of sending back, so I&#x27;ll keep it and use it.</li>
            <li> It only goes down to a #1 equivalent.  </li>
            <li> If you only have small kids to worry about, you can&#x27;t beat the low noise of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> A final very minor nitpick is that the inch and metric markings on the guide did not accurately correspond to each other.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one year old son would scream with other clippers, he dose not love these</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if your child has sensory issues or other special needs, make hair cutting easier.</li>
            <li> Definitely not silent, but absolutely quieter and less frightening than my regular clippers.</li>
            <li> Finally, I can do haircut my little baby.</li>
            <li> But do be careful, as the guides are a little flimsy and don&#x27;t look like they will last if used too roughly.</li>
            <li> clipper has rounded edges all over and plastic guides to help with accurate cutting.</li>
            <li> smooth and quite, but my 1 year boy still afraid of it....</li>
            <li> Not as quite as expected.</li>
            <li> comb broken after light use, got 2nd one and broken again after couple of use.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention I have to almost take off the hair guard almost every time to remove the hair that gets jammed in there on every pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very noisy.</li>
            <li> While this allows flexing that might increase comfort, it also seems very flimsy and easily broken to me.</li>
            <li> Be careful when attempting to take the guide off, I accidentally snapped one of the hinges that opens the blades for cleaning when trying to take off the guide.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like his is too thick and soft</li>
            <li> I finally decided having three people hold him down was not worth the trip to the mall to get his haircut.  </li>
            <li> In our case we were trying to trim 1-1/2\\&quot; long hair down to 5/8\\</li>
            <li> The of the blade isn&#x27;t as wide as regular clippers so less coverage per pass which makes it take a little longer .</li>
            <li> I used to cut my little boys hair with my big clippers, but they were heavy, noisy, and big for his little head.  </li>
            <li> Soon these accumulated clippings were preventing new hairs from reaching the cutter blades, and the cutting action stopped.</li>
            <li> I usually use a regular hair clipper for them and use #2,1, and 1/2 combs.  </li>
            <li> It’s not watertight and the battery seems small for such a unit.  </li>
            <li> If you charge the battery, then they don&#x27;t have to be plugged in (which means I can be more inconspicuous cutting his hair)!  </li>
            <li> (my kids have had some pretty questionable haircuts over the years).  </li>
            <li> I mean, I love such guides in principle, but the ones on here are a bad design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quiet and makes for cutting hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, in actual use, we found that the cut hairs rapidly built up in the area above the \\&quot;skis\\&quot; and in front of the band.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that it annoying for anybody.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son who has Down syndrome and sensory issues.</li>
            <li> Just start at the highest level and then work your way down to get to the trim that you want.  </li>
            <li> me having to hold his arms down .</li>
            <li> We have literally had to hold him down to finish.</li>
            <li> The moment it arrived, I sat my son down and cut his hair.  </li>
            <li> Claire who is in technical support department of philips north america said there is no similar complains from other customers, ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> They do have less vibration but not quieter.</li>
            <li> I got yelled at a lot less with this unit.</li>
            <li> This was my first time cutting hair</li>
            <li> this clipper is very capable, and I don&#x27;t have any issues with cutting through my son&#x27;s extra thick hair after he refused to get a haircut for 3 to 4 months!</li>
            <li> and he caved a little.  </li>
            <li> Runs quite, doesn&#x27;t scare the little ones.  </li>
            <li> If you have little guys who can&#x27;t sit still, these are the clippers for you.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re a family that always looks for ways to save money, as we&#x27;re not rich.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, I only use this clipper once when my baby 6 months old, now one of the small brush stuff is broken for no reason, and i can&#x27;t use it for my baby anymore</li>
            <li> it purred and whirled and especially near the ears it w as impossible due to the noise..</li>
            <li> The blades are so dull, I literally have to pass the clipper over the same spot of hair at least 3-5 times to get it to cut.</li>
            <li> So I decided to purchase this and try the whole cutting hair at home.</li>
            <li> used by professional barbers, the guide here has marks in inches, which is not a real problem for kids, unless you&#x27;re about to have your kid auditioning for Sesame Street or Disney Channel something, in which case you wouldn&#x27;t be cutting his/her hair yourself to begin with, would</li>
            <li> it is dead.</li>
            <li> are a few things I quite like about this hair</li>
            <li> and then you&#x27;re in trouble.</li>
            <li> every few months, that&#x27;s saving me around $40 every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I thought the cut was coming out uneven.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, I removed them a few times, and nothing broke.  </li>
            <li> Parents with autistic children... buy these clippers.</li>
            <li> waste your $ on this clipper.</li>
            <li> His hair seems to grow unevenly</li>
            <li> I have a son with ALOT of sensory issues (Autistic).  </li>
            <li> Narrow within and slower</li>
            <li> Even worse, the return window for this item is only one month.  </li>
            <li> Had trouble trimming at lengths longer than an inch</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 2 adjustable guards included to prevent you from an uneven cut, or accidentally cutting too much hair.  </li>
            <li> otherwise I could just buy an ordinary clipper with almost half of its price.</li>
            <li> While I did notice the difference as I ran the clippers through his hair, there was no negative effect on the hair cutting process itself.</li>
            <li> My child is Autistic and will usually kick and scream and do anything to stop his hair from being cut.</li>
            <li> No more screaming, yelling, or crying.</li>
            <li> He is still a little uncomfortable bit we can actually manage a hair cut with these.</li>
            <li> My 1 yr old hated the adult clippers we used on him, and was terrified.</li>
            <li> But I managed ti cut all his hair and with very little fuss.</li>
            <li> As it is now, it&#x27;s slick plastic but not so slick that I dropped it while using</li>
            <li> They are not much more than an electric razor.</li>
            <li> length comb should have also been designed to be small and nimble.  </li>
            <li> do need to plug into outlet to let charge before use.easy to hold and use.it has a small cleaning brush too.i</li>
            <li> Perhaps this would not be a problem if you were just giving a small trim and the clippings were shorter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought philips products more than five times, I&#x27;v never seen this terrible things before.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it makes almost the same noise.</li>
            <li> I previously was cutting my son&#x27;s hair with a typical lowest-model Wahl trimmer, which is big, bulky, noisy, and therefore scary.  </li>
            <li> Until, lately, I&#x27;ve always cut my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> biggest complaint is storage.</li>
            <li> It was such a struggle before cutting his hair</li>
            <li> Its sound is rather horrible.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with thick hair</li>
            <li> It is not simple and takes longer than usual with lots of break for him, but doable versus impossible at the barber shop.  </li>
            <li> Quieter but not good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> But if your child (or husband, or whatever) isn&#x27;t very small and can handle a stronger clipper experience, go with something else.</li>
            <li> And it turns out that it always cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the blade, which is stupid.  </li>
            <li> Works but guards are weak and break in a year.</li>
            <li> My son is 4 and shuts down when it comes to cutting his hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found that this one is too lightweight, both in the plastic body and the motor, which was slow and weak.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Things that didn&#x27;t work for me: The flip open cutting unit doesn&#x27;t have sufficient resistance to remain closed--it opened a couple of times while cutting.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this model.</li>
            <li> and they used to get annoyed with the machine used in the saloon</li>
            <li> Poor advertising.</li>
            <li> But the one thing they&#x27;ve always had in common for me is that the cord is annoying and the clipper feels heavy in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still noisy my kid is very afraid of getting hair cut due to noise on clippers</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but these came recommended.  </li>
            <li> Not that it takes a rocket scientist to figure out what went wrong, but it is an inconvenience with a squirming child that is asking when you&#x27;re going to be finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 yo son is autistic and he screams bloody murder when we cut his hair.</li>
            <li> Once we actually used them he cried hysterically.  </li>
            <li> poor quality material!</li>
            <li> They do cut without the guides, but thats useless.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> I once had a trimmer that I did not use for a while that stopped holding a charge well and became nearly useless.</li>
            <li> I was too angry to throw it into the trash bin.</li>
            <li> There must be some type of tone difference because he absolutely hated our other set and chose the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed to say the least in these clippers.</li>
            <li> Cutting my toddlers hair with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will keep your clipper from being clogged up improving its cutting speed.</li>
            <li> unit is rated at 8 hours charging for about 45 minutes of cutting and in practice it works out about like that.</li>
            <li> would give it four stars if that darn cutting unit would have stayed shut.</li>
            <li> Also, while the guide swivels and is somewhat flexible, I found that this led to some inconsistent cutting lengths.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord while you are cutting hair.</li>
            <li> What I do not like about this clipper are the ski-like cutting guides that control the length of the remaining hair.</li>
            <li> I have no training at all in hair cutting, I&#x27;ve just learned from trial and error</li>
            <li> When I was cutting my kid&#x27;s hair, the clipper accidentally fell on the floor.</li>
            <li> It made a difference when cutting my child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> and I was sick of spending 35$ a haircut when it was so difficult for him</li>
            <li> This clipper is made for safety and prevention of badly scalped haircuts.</li>
            <li> I felt so bad.</li>
            <li> If you have wanted to clip your children&#x27;s hair, but afraid you might make mistakes -- this hair clipper will help!  </li>
            <li> The guides are completely worthless &amp; do nothing to assist.</li>
            <li> My son hated getting haircuts.  </li>
            <li> It was terrifying for him.</li>
            <li> I got these to trim my dog who has horrible anxiety issues with going to the groomer.</li>
            <li> Amazon should stop selling this awful product for kids.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is amazing, good quality, user friendly!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my son who is autistic and HATES to have his hair cut based on the reviews that they were super quiet.  Now they are quiet but not as quiet as I had hoped.  That being said, they are still more quiet than most and work very well.  The fact that they are cordless is nice as well.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the guide is made of cheap plastic which breaks easily and I have already had to super glue it once.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it! After watching several youtube videos, I got the nerve to order this.  I used it on my squirmy 7 month old grandson with ease. Great packaging, fast delivery. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> pleased+++ Perfect for children who have Autism and cant go to barber shops!!! A blessing!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son who has Down syndrome and sensory issues. He HATES getting his haircut. These were perfect. Quiet and worked great. We are now able to cut his hair without a fight and a traumatic experience.</li>
            <li> My son is autistic and hair cuts have always been a huge struggle. The clippers are much quitter and the vibration is much lower than normal clippers. He is still a little uncomfortable bit we can actually manage a hair cut with these. It has taken a heart breaking situation and made it manageable. These clippers are a god send</li>
            <li> quiet, and easy to use</li>
            <li> Not water proof, after one use and gentle wash it is dead.</li>
            <li> Cutting my toddlers hair with this.&lt;br /&gt;LIke: quite, does cut even, cordless&lt;br /&gt;Dislike: my sons hair doesn&#x27;t feed through easily?  It&#x27;s like his is too thick and soft so it takes a really long time and we have to go shorter just so it can catch and cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I mostly recommend it. If you are going to cut hair yourself, then this insures it&#x27;s easy and safe, just know it&#x27;s not super easy or fast on all hair types.</li>
            <li> My 1 yr old hated the adult clippers we used on him, and was terrified. I bought these hoping they would make haircuts a more pleasant experience, and they did!! He loves getting his hair combed, and he thought that was all we were doing when we used these. It is a quiet, soft, sounding hum, not a buzz sound like so many other clippers. It can be charged, and the cord removed, so I was able to follow him around the house while trimming. I am super happy with these, and have already recommended them to my sister for her son who hates getting his hair cut!</li>
            <li> Works but guards are weak and break in a year.</li>
            <li> The razor worked well. My boyfriend cut our son&#x27;s hair with it twice so far and we have no complaints. It is worth the money and my favorite it save us from going to the barber for now.</li>
            <li> Pretty quiet hair clipper. Its noise level is just barely enough for our autistic son to be comfortable enough to let us cut his hair. It is not simple and takes longer than usual with lots of break for him, but doable versus impossible at the barber shop.  We had bought this clipper model before from a local store and that first one lasted us about 3 years. The rechargeable battery eventually gets too weak, so we were very happy to have found exactly the same model on Amazon.  NOTE: this clipper is very capable, and I don&#x27;t have any issues with cutting through my son&#x27;s extra thick hair after he refused to get a haircut for 3 to 4 months! It just take more time the longer we wait between haircuts. The key thing I have found which makes the clipper work 2x to 4x better is to pop open the blade cover and clean out all the little hair trapped under it. This will keep your clipper from being clogged up improving its cutting speed. The little cleaning brush which comes with the clipper works very well. I do the cleaning in about 10 seconds and in between every 5 minutes of haircut when my son has his needed break. We can now get through the haircut session in 1/2 the time it used to take us.  Also, remember to take your time, since this is a &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; children clipper not your regular industrial strength version.</li>
            <li> My son hated getting haircuts.  I finally decided having three people hold him down was not worth the trip to the mall to get his haircut.  I read about this product and I have to say it&#x27;s works like a charm.  It&#x27;s quite and very easy to use.  The guard is perfect.  Just start at the highest level and then work your way down to get to the trim that you want.  He still squirms around but not as much as before.  With this product I can give him a hair cut like a professional.</li>
            <li> Works well for my son who is 1 year old but honestly is the same as my beard trimmer I feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay , I will say this was the first haircut that didn&#x27;t involve lots of screaming and me having to hold his arms down . The of the blade isn&#x27;t as wide as regular clippers so less coverage per pass which makes it take a little longer . It&#x27;s only slightly more quieter than regular clippers, so that was a little disappointing I was hoping for a big difference as far as noise . This was only the first hair cut since delivery , hopefully the second haircut will go even better</li>
            <li> Finally opened the box to look over the product before I cut my toddlers hair. The clippers were used at some point before they were shipped to us! SO GROSS! Someone else&#x27;s hair is in them!</li>
            <li> This Kids Hair is far from silent. The noise makes my kid upset.</li>
            <li> This is not nearly as quiet as it claims to be. My son screams his head off because he hates anything that makes noises. (Vacuum, hair dryer, blender etc.) It is very easy to use and does a good job cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> Until, lately, I&#x27;ve always cut my son&#x27;s hair.  My son has sensory issues and is refusing to let me cut his hair with the regular trimmers.  I was skeptical, but these came recommended.  I received them yesterday, so I asked him if he wanted me to cut his hair with the new trimmers.  At first he said no, so I told him they were just his size and he caved a little.  I asked him if he wanted to do it (he&#x27;s 5) and he said yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked GREAT - he cut most of his hair all by himself!  I had to trim it up and cut the back, but it was easy.  They are very quiet and cut his hair easily.  He has thick straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> Not as quite as expected.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to get my son to sit through a haircut due to the quieter sound</li>
            <li> works nice on my sons thick hair .still hates clippers but a lil more tolerant of these</li>
            <li> The noise level is very low and doesn&#x27;t bother our Maltese. We bought these to cut her hair and they do a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and I was hoping it would work in my kids hair salon. I was looking for a clipper that I could use on babies.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Hair clogs and doesn&#x27;t go through the hair in one motion.&lt;br /&gt;2. You have to take one stroke at a time to get the hair off&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t work well with thick hair&lt;br /&gt;4. Takes a long time to get through a full head of hair which is not good for babies with short patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Works well on almost bald babies and baby fuzz...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These Norelco Kids Hair Clippers do what they say.  We found them to be fine and very workable for kids!  In terms of how they work, I had no problems with this hair clipper.  It worked just as described and was super easy to understand.  Instructions are included with tips and tricks you may want to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few things I quite like about this hair clipper:&lt;br /&gt;- Fun, kid friendly color!  Very bright and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;- They run on rechargeable batteries, which is a huge plus for me!  (A cord is included, too.)&lt;br /&gt;- The noise was more bearable than traditional clippers.  Clearly, Norelco thought of their market when designing this.&lt;br /&gt;- The comb tips are rounded and don&#x27;t look intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;- This allows for many lengths with few combs, as you can adjust the actual clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in need of a kid friendly hair clipper, you may want to take a peek at this Norelco!</li>
            <li> Very helpful and I just recommended to my friends</li>
            <li> Not happy with this model. Very noisy. Returned it.</li>
            <li> This clipper is made for safety and prevention of badly scalped haircuts. Still, if you use an electric clipper, you ought to know at least something about hair cutting, as even a good clipper can&#x27;t save you from everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper has rounded edges all over and plastic guides to help with accurate cutting. This all means that the chances of injury are greatly reduced, and that the cutter goes where you want it to go. Just use the plastic clip guides to direct your cut. But do be careful, as the guides are a little flimsy and don&#x27;t look like they will last if used too roughly. They bend; that&#x27;s good, in that you can sort of conform them to the head, but less good, in that bending them makes them somewhat less accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is rated at 8 hours charging for about 45 minutes of cutting and in practice it works out about like that. Fortunately a corded option is available, as this small amount of running time for such a long charging time is disproportionate. What if you want to do two haircuts? You&#x27;d better be fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor doesn&#x27;t seem particularly strong. That&#x27;s okay for home use, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you can do nice haircuts with some care, and even though the clipper is kid size there&#x27;s nothing to stop you from doing adult haircuts; it will just take a little longer (get out that plug-in cord!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s a good enough though not great clipper.</li>
            <li> This works fine so far. But I will pledge to return to this review should a problem arise.  I have some doubts about the durability of the thing. The setting guide, the thing that click click clicks into each slot as you set your desired length-of-cut...that thing feels like it is going to strip out over time, and thus you won&#x27;t be able to lock in the length setting like you need to and then you&#x27;re in trouble. Just saying. But we will see. If you see this review hasn&#x27;t been edited in a good long while, then you may safely assume things are going well.  UPDATE: Nearly two years later. We use the heck out of this clipper. I have been using this steadily now for two years with no problems. I&#x27;m upping the rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Things I liked: they were really quiet, the rounded plastic comb was safe and there were no complaints of pain. The clippers excelled in the shorter lengths, up to about a 1/2&amp;#34;. Cordless is nice, and battery life was sufficient for a single haircut. The contouring flex of the comb was nice, though not entirely necessary.  The weight is nice and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that were not so ok: anything over the 1/2&amp;#34; setting didn&#x27;t work very well. The second contour comb is larger and only for the longer lengths, which it didn&#x27;t do that well with--essentially making the large comb useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that didn&#x27;t work for me: The flip open cutting unit doesn&#x27;t have sufficient resistance to remain closed--it opened a couple of times while cutting. Not that it takes a rocket scientist to figure out what went wrong, but it is an inconvenience with a squirming child that is asking when you&#x27;re going to be finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nice clipper for cutting at or below 1/2&amp;#34;. It is quiet and feels good on their head. For that alone, it is a worthwhile product. Don&#x27;t get too excited about the 15 length settings though--it is really only good for shorter lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it four stars if that darn cutting unit would have stayed shut.</li>
            <li> Broke half way during first use.</li>
            <li> Great product! accurate description! Very quiet! But my kid still hates hair cuts! Lol</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 yo son is autistic and he screams bloody murder when we cut his hair. We have literally had to hold him down to finish. Not with these...he sits quietly while we cut his hair. AMAZING!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. We got it in two days after we order it without prime. It have variety of trim length adjustment. Was to use, kids friendly. Love it.</li>
            <li> perfect, perfect, perfect my little boy is scare of loud noises nothing serious, so I had his Dad&#x27;s hair clippers and it makes a starting noise that is loud and rumbles too much... so it was a pain to cut his hair.  since I got this my little one loves it and my 7 year old too. it&#x27;s all good and works well . I had it for 3 months now.</li>
            <li> This is too loud for a baby. Not even quiet.</li>
            <li> These clippers broke within minutes of the first use. The gaurd broke off and we ended up having to completely buzz off my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My husband used to cut my 3-year-old son&#x27;s hair with his clippers and they were so loud my son would throw a FIT. Just used these tonight for the first time and they were great! Very quiet, my son sat the entire time. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Guide combs are too flimsy, but blades cut very well.</li>
            <li> If you have wanted to clip your children&#x27;s hair, but afraid you might make mistakes -- this hair clipper will help!  The comb guard that covers the blades, prevents you from clipping too close.  Best used after you wash and dry the hair first.</li>
            <li> Ok, a bit hard to clean completely.  Satisfied</li>
            <li> Great product. Especially if ur child has any sensory issues. My child is Autistic and will usually kick and scream and do anything to stop his hair from being cut. But I managed ti cut all his hair and with very little fuss. Thank you Phillips. Would recommend this to all parents. Best buy I have made in his 4yrs. Sonja</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this hair clipper can be used without the cord! I have cut my kids&#x27; hair for many years and the cord always getting in the way was a pain. This one solves that problem! After charging for 8 hours, you are supposed to get 45 minutes of cordless power so you can either cut hair quickly or recharge between uses or even use it corded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is pretty quiet. Not silent, but quieter than other clippers I&#x27;ve used. It comes with two adjustable combs for 15 length settings from 1/8 inch to 1 3/4 inches (3-42 mm). The combs are easily removed if you want to get down to the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a 2 year warranty. Cleaning it super easy - just remove the comb, using your finger, push the top blade up and backwards and it pops open allowing you access to clean it with the supplied brush. The clippers themselves could use a rubberized grip to help the user hold onto it easier. As it is now, it&#x27;s slick plastic but not so slick that I dropped it while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the company includes a bag to store this in in the future. Other than that, I&#x27;m very pleased with this clipper.</li>
            <li> My 20 month old has curly hair, but not too much of it yet. When it grows out it is unmanageable and cutting here or there just looks…not good. These Norelco Clippers are a wonderful alternative. First off, they are very quiet which is huge because my son can&#x27;t stand loud noises. Two, they work fairly quickly and since he is so wiggly and impatient that&#x27;s an important aspect of it. Because his hair isn&#x27;t super thick yet, I use it on the shorter setting and it works quite well. It&#x27;s a tad on the pricey side but worth it if you plan on using it over and over.</li>
            <li> Purchased these clippers based on the reviews for kids with sensory issues.  My son has sensory issues and haircuts are a traumatic experience for him.  Upon getting these clippers he still screamed and cried about getting his haircut.  It took me five days of training/playing with the clippers to get him comfortable enough to allow them to be held to his head.  Once we actually used them he cried hysterically.  The clippers cut ok.  There were only a couple of moments where the clippers were full of hair and had to be cleaned out.  Hopefully, the more we use them, the more he will accept them.  Understand, I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the clippers for anything, they just didn&#x27;t live up to what my hopes and expectations were.</li>
            <li> Quieter but not good for thick hair. Feels like a cheap beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a lot quiter than most hair clippers. My boys with ASD do much better with these.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco Kids Clippers are great! I use this on my 4 yr. old grandson, that usually screams and cries every time he gets a haircut. When I got these, I tried them on him, and he didn&#x27;t cry once. I love the fact that it is cordless, so you don&#x27;t have the cord in front of his face while cutting his hair. I&#x27;m sure that it annoying for anybody. What I REALLY love about these hair clippers, is that they are so quiet. That feature alone is worth the purchase. My grandson gets a very close haircut, and for that these clippers work great. The only thing that isn&#x27;t that great, is the trimming around the ears. Both me and my daughter like to give him a nice trim around his ears, and this doesn&#x27;t really have a small attachment for that, so we use a very small trimmer for that area, but other then that, these clippers are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nice cordless clipper. very light, smooth cutting, less noise and battery last very long when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the lock/stopper of the height adjustment on the side of the clipper is unstable and easy to slip to a difference height.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. No more screaming, yelling, or crying. In fact, my son thinks he can cut his own hair now, lol.</li>
            <li> The perfect solution for my son with autism. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Still noisy my kid is very afraid of getting hair cut due to noise on clippers</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper after my 13 month old son had a big cry at the hair stylist&#x27;s.  He was scared of the sound of the clipped used at the hair stylist.  This Philip&#x27;s clipper was quiet enough not to scare my son.  I was able to cut his hair at home without a traumatic crying event.</li>
            <li> good product, quiet, baby didn&#x27;t mind it and I saved time and money on bringing him to the barber shop</li>
            <li> Plastic guide broke halfway through first trim of my three year olds hair.  Called norelco, and apparently they are no longer manufacturing this product, so they could not sell me a replacement piece, as it is a specialty piece and not a standard replaceable length guide.&lt;br /&gt;They told me to return it to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic guide was junk. I&#x27;m buying real clippers</li>
            <li> This hair clipper is actually pretty great!  I&#x27;m a 35 year old male with fairly thick, straight hair that&#x27;s fine in texture.  I&#x27;ve never cut my own hair before.  I was spending between $10-$20 a haircut every month or so for what seemed to be very easy, a # 3 on the sides and back and I usually only have the top trimmed every 3-4 haircuts.  I browsed around and figured found this.  I ordered it, looked up a chart for conversions online (just search hairstylists chart for fades) and printed out the chart.  It has a number of settings going up to over an inch.  I charged it for about two hours and decided to give it a try.  I adjusted the easy to maneuver clipper head to 9mm (which is equivalent to a # 3) and started to sheer through the sides ands used a mirror to do the back.  After about 5 minutes I was done and it looked pretty good! (granted, I did have to go over a few spots again, but this was my first time ever cutting my own hair)  With this nifty device I figure I&#x27;ll only have to get a haircut (to get the top trimmed) every few months, that&#x27;s saving me around $40 every 3 months. I should also add there was no pulling or yanking of any kind. Thanks Norelco!</li>
            <li> same complain.  poor quality material! comb broken after light use, got 2nd one and broken again after couple of use.  Claire who is in technical support department of philips north america said there is no similar complains from other customers, ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> My seven-year-old son hates hair cuts, but he was very cooperative as he climbed into his chair so I could try out this new set of clippers. In his opinion, these clippers make all the difference in the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His two primary comments related to the sound and the feel. Although I don&#x27;t know that I would call this an ultra-quiet machine, it is still much quieter than the adult clippers I have been using. He likes that. Also, the combs have curved instead of pointed tips. While I did notice the difference as I ran the clippers through his hair, there was no negative effect on the hair cutting process itself. I did notice a comb pattern showing in his hair that concerned me at first. I thought the cut was coming out uneven. But, ultimately we enjoyed a very smooth, even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;- I did not need to use the clippers long enough to run down the battery, as clipping my son&#x27;s hair is usually a ten minute or less task. But, I was able to use it enough to determine that the power level was the same whether I plugged it in or used the battery power.&lt;br /&gt;- I love the width. Because it is about a third narrower than a typical adult set of clippers, it ran much more smoothly over my son&#x27;s head, especially around his ears.&lt;br /&gt;- The combs adjust very easily and come off smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;- The design of the comb attachments make cleaning the blades very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really notice anything special about the movement of the contour-following comb, but I could have just missed it. The clippers did navigate well across my son&#x27;s head, so that might have been part of the success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is storage. This product needs a storage bag, especially with two combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son says that he won&#x27;t dread hair cuts as much anymore. I call that a winner!</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job.  Runs quite, doesn&#x27;t scare the little ones.  Rounded comb makes sure you don&#x27;t nick a small ear, or scratch the skin.  Adjustable up to 15 different lengths.  Rechargeable, can be used with or without the cord.  Blades never need to be oiled before use.  Fairly small and easy to maneuver.  Comes with comb, cape, scissors, and a DVD on how to cut hair.</li>
            <li> This product is great for children with autism because giving a hair cut can be problematic and this product ease the comfort.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and kids friendly as advertised. As a non-experience hair stylist this clipper gave me the confidence to have the job done. It feels great in the hand and easy to clean and wipe off the hair. I will use it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Good product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> My grandson sat still while his mother cut his hair. He did not move or cry while getting his hair cut.</li>
            <li> my son like it,and he didn&#x27;t cry when i cut his hair,i will recommend it to my friends.very good .</li>
            <li> This product worked great for us. My son hates going the salon. It was terrifying for him. Now I can do his hair cuts at home. And save money.</li>
            <li> plastic broke the first time i used it. Philips says the item is discontinue and i cannot repair or get parts for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, and easy to use. My 8 month old boy did not even notice when I shaved his hair using this clipper.</li>
            <li> My grandson actually let us cut his hair using this. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed to say the least in these clippers. They are not much more than an electric razor. I got these to trim my dog who has horrible anxiety issues with going to the groomer. The guides are completely worthless &amp; do nothing to assist. The clippers would not trim the fur w/&#x27;the guides on regardless of the direction I ran them in across her coat. They do cut without the guides, but thats useless.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Kids Hair Clipper does exactly what it advertises... It&#x27;s a clipper to cut you hair.  Or your child&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 adjustable guards included to prevent you from an uneven cut, or accidentally cutting too much hair.  They work well, but felt a little flimsy, and I am somewhat concerned about how long they would last if they were removed frequently to switch.  They are held on by &amp;#34;arms&amp;#34; on the side, and if one of those breaks, the guard is likely to be unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I removed them a few times, and nothing broke.  After adjusting, I used it to cut hair (my own) and it worked quite well.  In fact, this week, I&#x27;ve had people tell me they liked my haircut.  (For the record, I only cleaned up the sides and back, because I wouldn&#x27;t trust myself to cut the top, and wouldn&#x27;t use clippers to do so anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rechargeable, which means you are not tethered to an electrical outlet.  This is very handy, particularly when cutting a squirming child&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, these worked great....I&#x27;ve docked it a point only because I&#x27;m somewhat concerned about the possibility of breakage in the future.... for current performance, it&#x27;s a 5 star.</li>
            <li> If you have little guys who can&#x27;t sit still, these are the clippers for you.  I love that they are so quiet and cordless.  Being cordless makes them so easy to use on a two year old who can&#x27;t sit still for very long.  Just remember they need to be charged before using them, something we didn&#x27;t have to do with our old clippers.</li>
            <li> Both my boys liked when I used this to cut their hair.  I usually use a regular hair clipper for them and use #2,1, and 1/2 combs.  This norelco is faster to switch between sizes, but doesn&#x27;t go as short.  It only goes down to a #1 equivalent.  Also, while the guide swivels and is somewhat flexible, I found that this led to some inconsistent cutting lengths.  This inconsistency is compounded by the fact that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much power as a corded model, and therefore seems to miss spots, even when I went slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it took longer to cut their hair than stopping to swap out the combs on my old clippers because I had to make a lot more passes.  Even then, their hair had long spots and just didn&#x27;t look as cleanly cut.  The up side is that they stayed still and didn&#x27;t complain the entire time.  It was also nice in that even without the guard, the teeth aren&#x27;t too sharp and I was able to trim around the ears and back of the neck without any complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s two combs, each of which work on multiple lengths, however, the click mechanism doesn&#x27;t line up the visible length that&#x27;s printed on them, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell if you have it set right.  As I said before, it doesn&#x27;t go as finely as corded trimmers, and they don&#x27;t seem to lift hair as well for a consistent cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have mixed signals with this product - while the kids liked it, I didn&#x27;t feel like it gave as nice of a hair cut.  Battery life was sufficient and it was nice to hold.  But the guards are also somewhat flimsy and I actually broke the swivel of one when it fell on the floor.  I also wish it came with a bag or case since you have to keep track of the charger, two combs and the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly!!! Thank you Norelco</li>
            <li> Love this! It is quiet and cuts great! My one year old son would scream with other clippers, he dose not love these but he just fidgets instead of screams. Some reviews said they are not quiet- they are not silent but they are way quieter then normal clippers. I also love the quick langth adjustment heads!  They even cut my husbands hair good too. Totally worth buying!</li>
            <li> Works great nice &amp; quiet</li>
            <li> This is cheap and good item.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this!!! It completely ruined my son&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s total garbage.</li>
            <li> These clippers aren&#x27;t much quieter than any new pair of clippers.  I think people might think this model is particularly quiet because by the time they needed new clippers, their old ones were run down - and old clippers are particularly loud. So maybe in contrast these seemed very quiet. Anyway! What I&#x27;m getting at is that these clippers are quiet enough, but they&#x27;re not something a ninja could use to covertly dispatch someone in the dead of night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the integrated, sliding, length adjustment.  The notches don&#x27;t allow for the locking pin to be perfectly seated, so there&#x27;s a need to be careful when assuming you&#x27;ve got the length set at whichever length you want. One one occasion the clipper length changed during the middle of a cut. Luckily it didn&#x27;t do any damage that couldn&#x27;t be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these, personally.</li>
            <li> It is good. But the plastic head cover is fragile. It is broken after I clean it. I could not replace it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The first time we took my 1 yr old to the barber shop, he screamed like someone was trying to torture him. I felt so bad. So I decided to purchase this and try the whole cutting hair at home. Lo and behold, it turned out awesome. This was my first time cutting hair and I didn&#x27;t know how easy it could be with the help of this clipper. The best thing is that it is cordless so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord while you are cutting hair. My hubby even tried it to cut his hair and now will not use his regular clipper. Saves me a ton of money from har salon trips.</li>
            <li> Great for cutting my toddlers hair!  Really quiet, perfect!</li>
            <li> These were perfect for my little boy who was scared to death of regular clippers.  Now he begs me to cut his hair!  They are quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have a Wahl clipper but this one seemed worth trying because it&#x27;s for kids.  Unfortunately, I found that this one is too lightweight, both in the plastic body and the motor, which was slow and weak.  It was taking too long to get through my sons&#x27; thick hair, so I switched to the Wahl, which got it done much faster.  I liked the idea of having one guard that adjusts, but it didn&#x27;t click into place as firmly as I expcted and I ended up flinging it right off the end more than once.  Being cordless is definitely a plus, and you can also use it corded if you don&#x27;t have it charged up beforehand.  If you have a very small child, this might be a good starter as it is quieter and gentler, perhaps less intimidating than a bigger clipper.  But if your child (or husband, or whatever) isn&#x27;t very small and can handle a stronger clipper experience, go with something else.</li>
            <li> This Norelco kids trimmer is light and less noisy than the traditional trimmer. I applaud Norelco for thinking up such a product but why target just kids?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key differentiator between a regular trimmer and this model seems to be weight, sound level, and attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It succeeds in the first two but somewhat fails in the last.  The attachment comb could have been better designed. It’s bulky and a bit cumbersome to remove and attach.  It’s almost as if they were designing a kids product and not a tool to be used by adults on kids.  There’s a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length comb should have also been designed to be small and nimble.  Instead, it’s a big, plastic slide that’s not so easy to adjust and a real pain to clean. I understand that Norelco wanted to make it easy to dial up and down the length of the comb but the way it’s designed needs work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the sound level is concerned, it’s about half the noise of traditional plug in trimmers.  It still puts out quite a bit of noise so don’t think they created a miracle.  It’s far from “ultra” quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the unit looks nice but we won’t know how long it will last.  It’s not watertight and the battery seems small for such a unit.  It’s almost as if they repurposed one of their shavers for hair use.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my Philips Norelco CC5059/60 Kids Hair Clipper.  The best thing about them is that it&#x27;s quiet.  Second best thing is that you can recharge the clippers overnight and use them the next day.  The charge keeps for awhile and they&#x27;re not as loud and noisy as the plug-in variety.  My dogs are not scared of the Philips hair clippers and they cut very nicely.  If you are looking for some hair clippers for a child or maybe for your pets then you&#x27;ll want to pick up a Philips Norelco CC5059/60 clippers today.</li>
            <li> My son is 4 and shuts down when it comes to cutting his hair and I had to just buy these to do the job myself because he gets so upset and these have helped so much cause they r quiet, so very quiet! And my sons hair is very thick, and they went through his hair great. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I saved and eagerly ordered this especially the review that it was quiet..it purred and whirled and especially near the ears it w as impossible due to the noise..yes it is a little quieter than regular ones but not hugely so.the clip guide slid right on and made the haircut foolproof  even as he squirmed through it.i ended up having to use scissors to finish up.it is well and compactly packaged&lt;br /&gt;You do need to plug into outlet to let charge before use.easy to hold and use.it has a small cleaning brush too.i might keep this hopefully he gets used to it..</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quiet, no instructions needed!</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because I have a son with a lot of sensory issues and giving him a hair cut is a nightmare... let alone taking him to a salon to get it done! We keep it short to avoid getting it cut more often, so we just used it on the lowest setting and it worked ok. It didn&#x27;t cut as well or as fast as regular adult clippers. That is the only downfall for me. It took twice as long to cut his hair... but he didn&#x27;t mind these until they got near his ears. They aren&#x27;t as quite as I thought they would be but are quieter then the clippers we used before. Overall good product. I wish it cut better, BUT 2 thumbs up for finally getting a good cut on him before total meltdown mode. We did still use the adult clippers for his sides but it was MUCH easier to only need the bigger clippers for the sides then his whole head.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s realy good for my son</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Korean.</li>
            <li> I previously was cutting my son&#x27;s hair with a typical lowest-model Wahl trimmer, which is big, bulky, noisy, and therefore scary.  First use of this kids clipper and there were zero tears.  Whole thing went over easy.  It took a little bit longer to finish the job as the blade isn&#x27;t as wide as the Wahl, but it was a good tradeoff.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller guard (doesn&#x27;t stick out as much length-wise as the Wahl ones) even made it work well for the tighter contours of beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Do not go by my word that my kid hates, he just hates it for no reason. :)&lt;br /&gt;I think he knows that it is going to change his hair style... it does not hurt him at all... it is completely safe and battery is also good enough for single cut. If you like short hair cut it will last for years coz you may be using it quite often but for shorter duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it because it is easy to use for me, I can easily hold it in my hand and move it the way I like while trimming my kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> good for my little baby, recommend this product to everybody who has the kids</li>
            <li> It works for my 2 yrs old.  Trimming hair can be a huge task for us.  When we tried this at home,  for the first time, he still cried, but for the second time, he got better.  It has very good settings about different lengths.  We are pretty satisfied with the outcome.  The LO looks cute , and we save the $$ with going to the hair salon.</li>
            <li> It can not shaved the head bald. The shortest is 3mm.</li>
            <li> Parents with autistic children... buy these clippers. I have tried over twenty types of  hair clippers with my son and nothing worked. Every haircut consisted of &amp;#34;cut, get scratched, break, and try again.&amp;#34; After reading the reviews I decided to try one more. Thanks goodness I did. This clipper is not silent but it is quieter than all of the others and my son did not react at all when I turned it on. I was cautious it would not be strong enough for my 20 yr old&#x27;s thick hair but it cut through it like butter! Wow, I wished I had found these sooner!</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT &amp;#34;Ultra quiet to help the child feel at ease&amp;#34; !!</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive kid&#x27;s hair clipper that won&#x27;t pull their hair and isn&#x27;t so noisy that it scares them (like our adult clippers). The battery charge on this doesn&#x27;t last very long though, so if you have more than one kiddo waiting in line, you&#x27;ll have to use the cord. For the right price (less than $50) I would get it if you plan on taking care of the family haircuts at home in the long run.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this thing is a piece of garbage. I&#x27;ve used many many clippers over my life and it&#x27;s easily the worst. I wanted one that was geared for kids more than my adult versions, thinking it would be easier to cut my son&#x27;s hair with a clipper meant for children. WRONG. The blades are so dull, I literally have to pass the clipper over the same spot of hair at least 3-5 times to get it to cut. Not to mention I have to almost take off the hair guard almost every time to remove the hair that gets jammed in there on every pass.&lt;br /&gt;It may be a quiet clipper, but the operation of it draws out the time of the cut tenfold so you lost any benefit from the muted noise. I abandoned it mid-cut this last time for my cheap beard trimmer and finished up the cut in about half the time it took me to labor over the first parts.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your $ on this clipper.</li>
            <li> +:  this is quiet, comfortable, and easy to use on a baby.  -:  the baby keeps crawling away or turns around to watch when I am trying to cut the hair on the back of his head.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re a family that always looks for ways to save money, as we&#x27;re not rich. One of these ways is we give our kids haircuts (and I myself go to the local Chinatown for 5-buck cuts.)  Our regular hair clipper was bought at Costco, and it does a good job. This Philips clipper is designed specifically for young kids -- I say young because the clip head is kind of small, and the attached comb guide is has a small contact surface area. The comb guide can be adjusted so you get to cut hair to the right length. Instead of the &amp;#34;size 0&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;size 1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;size 2&amp;#34;, etc. used by professional barbers, the guide here has marks in inches, which is not a real problem for kids, unless you&#x27;re about to have your kid auditioning for Sesame Street or Disney Channel something, in which case you wouldn&#x27;t be cutting his/her hair yourself to begin with, would you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is easy to use. The small contact surface on the guide, and the fact it&#x27;s not made of some super-hard plastic like the combs on professional clippers, makes it relatively comfortable on the kid&#x27;s scalp (or so I&#x27;ve been told by the test subjects...).  It&#x27;s also usable as a cordless clipper, as it contains a built-in LiIon battery that can run about 35 minutes per charge.  I&#x27;ve noticed no clipping performance difference whether on AC or on recharged battery.  The clipper is comfortable to hold for adults who have small hands, e.g., most moms, but not so comfortable for people like me with big hands, but still passable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have boys younger than 8 or 9, this is a good clipper to have -- and it takes only 3 or 4 cuts at home for the clipper to pay for itself in savings, not to mention your little one(s) will get the haircut in a comfortable and familiar setting.</li>
            <li> Used for my 3.5 year old boy, it works well!</li>
            <li> Very good for my fidgety son.</li>
            <li> Good design.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, however the guard broke the at the first attempt to remove it.  I had high hopes for this as my grandson is autistic.&lt;br /&gt;I had to return them</li>
            <li> Great one for kids and as well as parents as well to use in home in week ends enjoy it</li>
            <li> Performs well and doesn&#x27;t pinch.As an adult using the device I would have liked another head for very close trimming hence the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> These clippers are NOT ultra quiet as advertised, in fact the are just as loud if not louder than the $11 clippers i bought at Walmart. They do have less vibration but not quieter.</li>
            <li> The sound is very quiet</li>
            <li> Not as silent as I expected but still O.K.</li>
            <li> It is good.My daughter like it very much.</li>
            <li> I just received this item and it looks nice. But it seems a used one . just replaced it hope that will be better</li>
            <li> Best item to buy if you are looking at saving some monies from expensive hair cuts for children. All you need is the Philips shaver and you can do some creative hair styling with your kids till they are much older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is battery operated and hence there is no dangling wires that can endanger your children.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and good to use. Used this to cut my one month old baby&#x27;s hair. Works very well.</li>
            <li> easy to use, low noise.</li>
            <li> bought to trim cats butt, need more practice</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, especially with my son, who moves around a lot (4 years old). I like the rounded edges and it&#x27;s not very noisy.</li>
            <li> Used CC5059 for a year then the battery died. It took more than a day to charge it full and it was exhausted within 5 minutes. Bought CC5060 and the battery is improved. But CC5060 does not have the accessory pack in CC5059. The accessory pack includes a hair removal brush, an instruction CD and most importantly the apron. Basically I bought two set but can fully use the function of one.</li>
            <li> Plastic guard broke after one use on a 2 year old.</li>
            <li> I got this clipper for my 8 year old and 6 year old. We currently have a Wahl electric clipper that we&#x27;ve been pleased with, but I thought this might be better for the kids. It is a bit smaller compared to other electric clippers, but I like that it is cordless. It is easy to give haircuts with and is a little less noisier than most cilppers. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the cutting guides as hair accumulates and has to be cleaned out, but overall, it&#x27;s not a bad clipper.</li>
            <li> Quiet and makes for cutting hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> Based on the 157 posted reviews (to date), the Philips Norelco Hair Clipper appeals to parents who want to cut the hair of toddlers, kids of any age with sensory issues and developmental delays, and families who want to touch-up barber straight or fine hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can another group to the list of users: Parents who want to trim the edges of their child&#x27;s tightly-curled corkscrew hair without reducing the volume or &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; factor. This clipper does an excellent job of shaving all around the hairline - especially around the ears where painful snagging is most likely to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordinary scissors cut and trim hair. Only clippers (or a razor) can achieve that edge that gives fades their distinctive and polished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a lightweight and quiet tool, this is a rugged and precise pair of clippers. I highly recommend it for the non traditional hair household that is looking for a sharp yet safe cut.</li>
            <li> Works good, but NOT as quiet as it was advertised  to be @ all</li>
            <li> Very easy use. Wasn&#x27;t hurt my baby skin</li>
            <li> Best kid hair clipper we ever used.</li>
            <li> The sound is still relatively large, adjust the minimum 3mm allowed</li>
            <li> smooth and quite, but my 1 year boy still afraid of it....</li>
            <li> Works very good and it is very quiet so kids feel comfortable! Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> So easy to use and nice and quit for kids.  It does not pull their hair and I feel safe using it on them... No cuts</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use and has a good battery life, good for the price.</li>
            <li> No clippers should be completely silent but my son heard it as soon as I turned it on and wasn&#x27;t happy. Maybe he just has amazing hearing. There&#x27;s only two settings (as far as the length of the cut). But, it cuts well...like clippers are supposed to. Just wish I could figure out how to change the tooth blades.</li>
            <li> What I do not like about this clipper are the ski-like cutting guides that control the length of the remaining hair. I mean, I love such guides in principle, but the ones on here are a bad design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each individual \\&quot;ski\\&quot; is only attached at the rear end, to a narrow band of plastic across the back of the guide head. While this allows flexing that might increase comfort, it also seems very flimsy and easily broken to me. Worse yet, in actual use, we found that the cut hairs rapidly built up in the area above the \\&quot;skis\\&quot; and in front of the band. Soon these accumulated clippings were preventing new hairs from reaching the cutter blades, and the cutting action stopped. Perhaps this would not be a problem if you were just giving a small trim and the clippings were shorter. In our case we were trying to trim 1-1/2\\&quot; long hair down to 5/8\\&quot; long, so the clippings were long enough not to fall free through the slots. I also felt that the adjustment mechanism for setting the hair length could be a little more secure. Even for a kid, it could be embarrassing if the guide suddenly collapsed into its shortest setting, right in the middle of one&#x27;s head. A final very minor nitpick is that the inch and metric markings on the guide did not accurately correspond to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper itself worked OK, and was really super quiet. We will keep it for detail trimming without the guide.</li>
            <li> Not quite at all ...&lt;br /&gt;useless for me ...</li>
            <li> Worth it. I have twin boys and they used to get annoyed with the machine used in the saloon but this is smooth, last two times has been pretty cool for the boys and they volunteer to get their hair cut :-).</li>
            <li> These work great! I cut my 9 year old&#x27;s hair (it was about 4 or so inches long!) and these lasted through almost the whole cut without plugging in. They are quiet and gentle, but may not be as powerful as standard clippers. That&#x27;s fine with me, because I got them for the kids. Be careful when attempting to take the guide off, I accidentally snapped one of the hinges that opens the blades for cleaning when trying to take off the guide. I really like that there are only 2 different guides and you just slide them up and down to adjust the size. I would imagine this would be very convenient for fading. This was also very lightweight and comfortable in my hand. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Considering the dark coloring, noise, and sharp looking edges of most trimmers it&#x27;s no wonder kids like these and feel safe with them. The bright colors and soft plastic of the guides certainly help ease children&#x27;s fear about getting their hair &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery in this device is great as well. It charges quickly and holds the charge well. I&#x27;ve also started to use this on my beard and it trims thick facial hair just as easily as anything else. All said and done, though, the fact that you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in is priceless. I once had a trimmer that I did not use for a while that stopped holding a charge well and became nearly useless. I certainly won&#x27;t have that problem with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s attractive, well designed, and easy to clean. You just can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Amazing pair of clippers. I have two children, one has special needs and now it is a breeze to trim/cut his hair. Very quiet. Definitely recommend if your child has sensory issues or other special needs, make hair cutting easier.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers for use with children.  I used to cut my little boys hair with my big clippers, but they were heavy, noisy, and big for his little head.  He and I both much prefer these.  They are small and light weight.  If you charge the battery, then they don&#x27;t have to be plugged in (which means I can be more inconspicuous cutting his hair)!  The battery seems to last a long time when fully charged, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are blue plastic (my son likes the blue!) and guard well against nicks and cuts.  The one thing different about these clippers that takes some getting used to, are the measurements on the guard.  I&#x27;m used to #1, #2, etc, but this is labeled instead by measurements.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the hang of it soon, but the first couple of times I had to hold them up to his hair and kind of guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers seem to cut really well, and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> tested on my 1 yr old toddler. nice stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome device!! Finally, I can do haircut my little baby.</li>
            <li> We loved it at our house, my grandson doesn&#x27;t like loud noises and this worked miracles for us.  It was such a struggle before cutting his hair but now it is quick and easy.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a million hair clippers.  And it turns out that it always cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the blade, which is stupid.  Every clipper has it&#x27;s special little &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; that makes you choose it (large variety of clipper guards to help you cut evenly, a close trim blade, extra long cord, etc.)  But the one thing they&#x27;ve always had in common for me is that the cord is annoying and the clipper feels heavy in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kids clipper was perfect.  The moment it arrived, I sat my son down and cut his hair.  And for the first time in all of these years, it looked as good as the haircutter or barber does.  I have no training at all in hair cutting, I&#x27;ve just learned from trial and error (my kids have had some pretty questionable haircuts over the years).  This is lightweight but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  The two clipper guards snap on/off easily and actually worked because they flex where the other clippers I&#x27;ve had can be a little sharp.  Without the guards on, it makes a very nice trimmer for beards, necks, eyebrows and other hairy bits that you want a nice clean line on.  It holds a charge for a long time (I&#x27;ve only charged it once and it&#x27;s gone through 1 haircut, 5 beard trimmings and numerous side jobs.  The charger cord is long so you can technically still use it when it&#x27;s charging if you need to.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, my four-year-old sat quietly as mom cut his hair! That in itself is worth the price, but add to that the ability to walk around without the encumbrance of a power cord and you&#x27;re talking excellence in a product. It is much quieter than any clipper I&#x27;ve ever seen, but that doesn&#x27;t mean to say it&#x27;s silent. The guards are easy to use and change. Battery life is good, in fact the charge on it was used to cut his hair out of the box! Five stars!</li>
            <li> I used this on my 6 year old son&#x27;s hair in between regular cuts.  His hair seems to grow unevenly so I thought I&#x27;d be able to trim it up.  It works easily on his very fine hair, when the hair builds up close to the cutting mechanism I just use a little brush to clear it off and continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft guide things that people seem to be worried about don&#x27;t bother me, I don&#x27;t see a problem with them.  They make it much easier to cut a little one&#x27;s hair without them complaining that the trimmer is hurting them.  The parts that come off can be washed/rinsed in water so I don&#x27;t have a problem cleaning them after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this and I&#x27;ll even use it to trim up my hubby&#x27;s hair when he wants a trim because his hair is fine, too.</li>
            <li> I have a son with ALOT of sensory issues (Autistic).  I was going to purchase a more expensive brand, but it was corded.  So happy that I got these!  Super quiet, easy to use.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This clipper totally rocks!  Its quite and very easy to use.  We bought it to cut the hair of a two year old. So much easier without a cord to dodge little hands putting up a struggle.  Also small and light weight so easier control.  I highly recommend getting this for kids.</li>
            <li> It came on time and it is quiet and works fast. My boy really needs it.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair as well as my son&#x27;s. I use either a plug in or more often an adult Philips rechargeable as I can cut the hair in the bath tub more easily and clean it up better there (or the back yard in the summer time). This kids unit is very light weight. If you are use to the plug in ones, you will pick this up and go &amp;#34;Uhhh, will it have any power to it?&amp;#34;. It does and actually works better than my adult cordless one. It lasts a full haircut without issue or running down near the end. Blades are very sharp. My son has thicker hair near the top of his head that can bog down the other razor which leads to some hair pulling instead of cutting. This was not an issue with this kids cordless. The soft blue hair guards work great and are easily adjustable with the length clearly marked. My son appreciates the soft guards, especially around the ears. I got yelled at a lot less with this unit. Overall a very nice cordless for cutting kids hair and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;ultra quiet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> very useful item. Easy to use .  I like this. I even cut my own hair with it.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, I only use this clipper once when my baby 6 months old, now one of the small brush stuff is broken for no reason, and i can&#x27;t use it for my baby anymore</li>
            <li> This unit itself looks very nice and of good quality. The top feature is the low noise when operating - even my 2 year old has no problem letting me trim her hair with this unit. The problem is with older kids, such as my 9 year old, I do not seem to have that much control in switching between hair length settings as I have with another Philips Norelco trimmer in the same price range, the Philips Norelco QC5560/40 Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper. With the second option, my results look a lot more professional. If you only have small kids to worry about, you can&#x27;t beat the low noise of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Something that is clear to most by looking but I will say anyway--this is not an adult shaver. Which is both good and bad depending on your use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Quiet compared other shavers (relates to the speed issue below)&lt;br /&gt;+ Light compared to other shavers (relates to the cheap attachments mentioned below)&lt;br /&gt;++ Cordless AND able to use the included cord. Allows you to be more flexible while cutting, something you NEED when tackling kids hair.&lt;br /&gt;+ Curved guides take some of the discomfort out of getting a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;+ Smaller (narrow) width helps on smaller heads (but slows the process down)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Narrow within and slower speed means haircuts take longer.&lt;br /&gt;- While being light is great, the attachments should be better made and will likely fail before the shaver does.&lt;br /&gt;- The actual cut isn&#x27;t as exact as the adult shavers but this can be overcome by repeatedly going over the finished areas--downside is even more time spent on the hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;- The motor isn&#x27;t as strong as most adult shavers so it struggles in some kids hair. (and would do more of that with long or adult hair)&lt;br /&gt;- Plan on getting a case or plastic tote for keeping everything together. There is not anything included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this shaver is fine for short length haircuts for kids but understand that the features that make it better for kids also slow the process down which makes the end result take longer. That being said, had Norelco thrown in a case and made the attachments better quality, it would be hard not to give it a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has helped you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend it</li>
            <li> A bit loud than I expected and no European adapter charger cannot get one</li>
            <li> Just tried to give my 6 month old his a haircut yesterday. It went pretty well. He has spiky hair around frontal region. I adjusted length to 1/8 inches and it trimmed off his hair nicely. For his fine baby hairs it&#x27;s hard to deal with because you have to move the clipper against hair growth direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my son didn&#x27;t cry at all, and he looks handsome and cute with his new hair cut :)</li>
            <li> nice hair cut tool, my kids love it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on March 10th.  I am out of country till April 10th.  Now it is May 18th, and the item is not working any more after being used twice.  It cannot be powered and the head doesn&#x27;t work properly.  Even worse, the return window for this item is only one month.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3KPS36J0XSCNE]]I bought CC5059/60, It&#x27;s not ultra quiet. Its sound is rather horrible. My son cried when he heard this noise. I was too angry to throw it into the trash bin. I&#x27;ve bought philips products more than five times, I&#x27;v never seen this terrible things before.Amazon should stop selling this awful product for kids.</li>
            <li> Very surprised at how quite they are.  They cut very well and I had no complaints of noise or hair being pulled from my boys.  My youngest is extremely sound sensitive too.  Occasionally you have to stop and brush the hair out of the clippers but has not proven to be a hassle so far.</li>
            <li> I currently have two toddlers and this is just what I needed!</li>
            <li> I love these I used them on my 7 year old autistic son he is very sensitive to haircuts and I was sick of spending 35$ a haircut when it was so difficult for him these worked wonderfully I would definitely recommend this product to anyone 😃</li>
            <li> Quiet, easy to use and hair cut of a 3 year old with a mohawk are done in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Had trouble trimming at lengths longer than an inch</li>
            <li> This hair clipper is easy to use, quiet, in good quality and light. My 3-yr-old loves it. The first time I used it, I did fine. The clipper came the very next day after I ordered it. I highly recommend it. It will save your money!</li>
            <li> Quite &amp; awesome that they are cordless</li>
            <li> I was thinking that I could cut my child&#x27;s hair while he&#x27;s asleep but this is too noisy, I thought it would be quieter than normal clippers as it is claimed but unfortunately it makes almost the same noise. I only paid high price to get a quieter clipper otherwise I could just buy an ordinary clipper with almost half of its price.</li>
            <li> I used it to trim my one-month-old baby. He had a little hair but the hair clipper did a good job.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as quiet as I thought they would be based on the other reviewed. These were only slightly quieter than my normal pair of plug in clippers. However they do fit nicely in my hand and are lightweight.</li>
            <li> this is great for giving kids haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t perfectly raise up all the hair to cut like i would have liked.  i.e. i had to go over the same area a couple of times to get the desired length evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but this is a lot more kid friendly than the normal shavers.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as some adult clippers I&#x27;ve used. I sometimes have to go over the same area again to get all the hairs cut.  Also not that quiet, but much more quiet than regular adult ones.  Works well enough to cut my 10m old hair.  Used it last night.  Easy to clean</li>
            <li> nice item, nice seller.</li>
            <li> Used it to trim the side hair for our 3 month old. Very silent so it did not scare him and the blades cut his hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Not as quiet as I would have thought it would be from the description and other reviews. Works fine as a regular hair trimmer. Not worth the hassle of sending back, so I&#x27;ll keep it and use it.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t work, but I just used it for 3 times in one year. So disappointed!!! The light can&#x27;t be on,when the Hair Clipper is charged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient for me to cut my baby&#x27;s hair in this so hot summer. Like it. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very convience &amp; Easy handling.</li>
            <li> Works very smoothly and quietly. I have not used it for my  4-year-old son, but a 28-year-old friend has used it and quite liked it.</li>
            <li> Just as prior reviews clip broke before I could even use it. Plus it was loud!  Sent it back</li>
            <li> When I was cutting my kid&#x27;s hair, the clipper accidentally fell on the floor. The plastic comb immediately broke apart. The combs are not covered by warranty and replacement parts are unavailable. Now I either have to repurchase the whole clipper (which of course I won&#x27;t do!) or trash it. I believe that the combs being so easily breakable is a design fault, especially considering it&#x27;s a kids related product. Will never recommend this clipper to anyone.</li>
            <li> The hair clipper is not as quiet as I thought it would be, but it is very easy to use. My son can now avoid the visits to the haircut places, which he dreads.</li>
            <li> Great product,it is quiet for children.</li>
            <li> Very well made clippers.  This is a great product, really. However, I returned mine the next day, because they are anything BUT quiet. My Wahl clippers are much quieter than these Norelco &amp;#34;Ultra-Quiet&amp;#34; Kids Clippers.  If they were quiet, I would probably rate them at 5 stars.  Poor advertising.</li>
            <li> My son has autism and this product was so much less loud than our old clippers. It is not silent but really much quieter. It made a difference when cutting my child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely not silent, but absolutely quieter and less frightening than my regular clippers. It made giving my 11 month old a haircut pretty easy, aside from his wiggling! I like that the different lengths are adjustable without having a ton of different attachments to keep track of. It also is convenient that this is cordless and rechargeable. Good product! I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time with my baby boys.</li>
            <li> Works really nice. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that some hair cuttings get caught in the space between the comb and the top of the razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my 2 1/2 yr old son hates the sound of clippers and runs at the sight of them.  We had let his hair grow pretty long which was working just fine for us until his habit of twirling his hair left him with a bald spot.  We decided it was time to buzz it short.  When I went to use them they didn&#x27;t sound much quieter than the pair we had so I turned them both on and asked my son to pick.  There must be some type of tone difference because he absolutely hated our other set and chose the Norelco.  He also hates combs and things running through his hair and that&#x27;s where I saw a real difference in these clippers.  The rounded edges really do glide through his hair and must be much more comfortable because once I started he didn&#x27;t pull away.  I loved the cordless feature because it makes maneuvering around a wiggly kid that much easier.  Lastly, I had no problems with the different lengths.  I actually liked the design feature that allowed me to transition between lengths without having to go get another attachment.  (Speed counts!)  I used three different lengths between to the two attachments to create the style I wanted.  We love the hair cut and will most definitely use them again!  Now hopefully he&#x27;ll leave that bald spot alone and let it grow back!</li>
            <li> so far so good. Hope it&#x27;ll be durable</li>
            <li> nice price. prompt shipment .but the voice is not quiet</li>
            <li> Found that my clippers had been used when I opened the box to try them out for the first time. They came preloaded with hair. Gross.</li>
            <li> Comb snapped after second use, and  replacement part is same price as whole new unit.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> These clippers are nice, they are much quieter then the regular clippers, but they&#x27;re not as quiet as I expected, my son use to cry so bad because of the other clippers vibration and noise, he still wines but not as much with these clippers</li>
