            <li>more so far).&lt;br /&gt;Oil</li>
            <li>It was a gift for someone else, but they are enjoying it.</li>
            <li>Very clean cut, about 3~4 days growth from shaving my head bald with a razor.</li>
            <li>do notice this blade can catch skin or any bumps on your head more easily than the 000 and 0000 blades.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and they work perfectly with the classic 76 hair clippers</li>
            <li>Great blade way smooth highly recommended</li>
            <li>Love them prefect fit at a cheaper value</li>
            <li>Sharp, perfect.</li>
            <li>Easy to change.</li>
            <li>I WOKS FINE.</li>
            <li>Cuts super close, take care, it will cut you if it encounters a protuberance!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this blade and Oster Classic 76 Hair Clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my recent purchase of the oster number.</li>
            <li>It is just what you would expect it to be and fit.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This blade is great and get close enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Good love,,,  it cut&#x27;s so low</li>
            <li>great clipper to use before a straight razor, gets hair very close to scalp....</li>
            <li>The closest you can get without using a straight razor!!!  </li>
            <li>On time ,love it thank you very much</li>
            <li>It was a clean and close shave.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a blade that does more lining up, but this works well for getting real close</li>
            <li>It does a great job, leaving a sharply defined line on my side burns and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;CON</li>
            <li>In fact, many barber shops don&#x27;t even have a blade that comes close to the Oster Classic 76 hair clipper blade.  </li>
            <li>This blade is perfect that what I needed; it cuts close and tight to skin also sharp furthermore, good fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but other than that its chep and effective!</li>
            <li>Does a great job, easy to clean, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Defenately worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I only put clipper guards on it, and it still cuts very clean!</li>
            <li>It leaves just the right amount of stubble and NEVER pulls.</li>
            <li>and I also bought a #00000 from the same manufacture and they both (# 00000, 1 ) sound strong and looks clean and new.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using those cheap &amp;#34;bic&amp;#34; razors to clean up the back of my neck hairs and this blade replaced that.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t wait to order the 1a and more later ..</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I first started with the 000 blade, then went to the shorter 0000 blade, and now I&#x27;m using this 00000 blade (which is the shortest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that this blade comes in hand when doing bald heads or skin tight fades.</li>
            <li>It gets really close for those nice tight fades.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, but the blade cut into skin, when I do fade</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Real close cut.  </li>
            <li>But the description is very deceptive.  </li>
            <li>All Sizes&amp;#34;, which makes it sound like you are getting multiple blades of mutiple sizes.</li>
            <li>The clippers cut much closer and don&#x27;t leave much room for error.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cut there hair at home.</li>
            <li>Gives a much closer shave than anyone of the cheep consumer products that are out there.</li>
            <li>Comes oiled in the package and ready to go.</li>
            <li>The 00000 blade cuts hair very close to scalp, leaving an even \\&quot;five-o-clock\\&quot; shadow on your head.</li>
            <li>Shaves very well.</li>
            <li>its very close and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably never go back to cheap clippers.  </li>
            <li>This is such a smooth cut.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference between 00000 or 000.</li>
            <li>very close cut.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is this is reusable, the cut while not quite as close doesn&#x27;t irate my skin and after a day looks the same as the hairs grow back.</li>
            <li>Super tight cuts and smooth comfort for my clients</li>
            <li>Skin close cut and very durable blade for my Oster Classic 76 clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry no comment about the cutting quality as I&#x27;m sure they should be fine do to the fact I&#x27;m using oster 76 light as my machine .</li>
            <li>Only used 1time after oiling they pulled not bad for the money ,l was using my 76 ers</li>
            <li>I recommend this clipper blade if you are not ready for a total clean shaven, bald scalp, but a very even, clean close cut scalp.</li>
            <li>use this product in conjunction with the Oster Classic 76 hair clipper to finish my hair cut i.e. the neck, ear and mustache areas.</li>
            <li>My Oster Classic 76 clippers came with a 2, 1 and 000.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Oster Classic 76 about 6 months ago</li>
            <li>A must have for anyone owning classic 76.</li>
            <li>He had the old-school Oster Classic and he would sometime shave my face for me with it.  </li>
            <li>I was using the 000 blade and was ready for a closer cut without going completely shaved.</li>
            <li>keep the blade sharp and smooth, I recommend using Oster Kool Lube, Oster Blade Wash, and Oster blade oil.  </li>
            <li>I am new to US and I was looking for a new hair clipper.</li>
            <li>When fitted on my [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]] it gives the type of hair cut I desire.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m using a #2 on the sides where the hair is thick, a 1a on top where it&#x27;s fast retreating</li>
            <li>them about every 4 uses, so far they have performed like new each time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really been an issue for me, but it causes me to be a bit more careful and work a little slower.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my brother that is a professional barber...</li>
            <li>This product was good but difficult to install as there were barely any directions on how to install it.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I love the smoothness / power of the clippers and the fact that the blades are completely replaceable (although that does add extra cost to an already expensive item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to change blades, you just push down on the sharp end to slip off the old blade and slip on the new blade.  </li>
            <li>Although this &amp;#34;Blade&amp;#34; is specifically for Oster &amp;#34;Classic 76 Clipper&amp;#34; it just won&#x27;t &amp;#34;seat and vibrate&amp;#34; properly(so won&#x27;t remove hair.)&lt;br /&gt;I oiled it and retried it several times after new &amp;#34;Springs and Brushes&amp;#34;, but, to no avail.</li>
            <li>These are expensive clippers and blades, so I take care of them to hopefully get my full money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>but this will get it down very close to that.</li>
            <li>New items always closed and still in origianl packaging.</li>

            <li> The nice thing is this is reusable, the cut while not quite as close doesn&#x27;t irate my skin and after a day looks the same as the hairs grow back.</li>
            <li> Super tight cuts and smooth comfort for my clients</li>
            <li> Skin close cut and very durable blade for my Oster Classic 76 clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry no comment about the cutting quality as I&#x27;m sure they should be fine do to the fact I&#x27;m using oster 76 light as my machine .</li>
            <li> Only used 1time after oiling they pulled not bad for the money ,l was using my 76 ers</li>
            <li> I recommend this clipper blade if you are not ready for a total clean shaven, bald scalp, but a very even, clean close cut scalp.</li>
            <li> use this product in conjunction with the Oster Classic 76 hair clipper to finish my hair cut i.e. the neck, ear and mustache areas.</li>
            <li> My Oster Classic 76 clippers came with a 2, 1 and 000.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oster Classic 76 about 6 months ago</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone owning classic 76.</li>
            <li> He had the old-school Oster Classic and he would sometime shave my face for me with it.  </li>
            <li> I was using the 000 blade and was ready for a closer cut without going completely shaved.</li>
            <li> keep the blade sharp and smooth, I recommend using Oster Kool Lube, Oster Blade Wash, and Oster blade oil.  </li>
            <li> I am new to US and I was looking for a new hair clipper.</li>
            <li> When fitted on my [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]] it gives the type of hair cut I desire.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using a #2 on the sides where the hair is thick, a 1a on top where it&#x27;s fast retreating</li>
            <li> them about every 4 uses, so far they have performed like new each time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really been an issue for me, but it causes me to be a bit more careful and work a little slower.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my brother that is a professional barber...</li>
            <li> This product was good but difficult to install as there were barely any directions on how to install it.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love the smoothness / power of the clippers and the fact that the blades are completely replaceable (although that does add extra cost to an already expensive item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to change blades, you just push down on the sharp end to slip off the old blade and slip on the new blade.  </li>
            <li> Although this &amp;#34;Blade&amp;#34; is specifically for Oster &amp;#34;Classic 76 Clipper&amp;#34; it just won&#x27;t &amp;#34;seat and vibrate&amp;#34; properly(so won&#x27;t remove hair.)&lt;br /&gt;I oiled it and retried it several times after new &amp;#34;Springs and Brushes&amp;#34;, but, to no avail.</li>
            <li> These are expensive clippers and blades, so I take care of them to hopefully get my full money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> but this will get it down very close to that.</li>
            <li> New items always closed and still in origianl packaging.</li>
            <li> Did not fit on my Oster Classic 76 Clipper Machine</li>
            <li> but I find that this shave is close enough and there were reviews of the other blade as heating</li>
            <li> be careful however, very sharp..has tiny thin blade</li>
            <li> I bought this blade to replace a similar one that I have had for the previous 3 years.  </li>
            <li> FOR SOME STRANGE REASON THIS BLADE IS TOO SHARP</li>
            <li> I expected this one to be close like razor, not so.</li>
            <li> not much else to say.</li>
            <li> AND NICKS.MY OLD FEW MISSING TEETH,BUT OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> It does take a little extra time to do it yourself, but I can do it in less than 5 minutes plus cleanup.</li>
            <li> Blade is so sharp I can use it to shave my face.  </li>
            <li> and I use it to shave my head every other day.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it did not come with a blade protecter for storage purposes.</li>
            <li> Gets the hair down to &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; the skin.  </li>
            <li> Typical clipper blade.  </li>
            <li> There is another slightly closer non Oster blade that claims to cut it to .1mm instead of this blade&#x27;s .2mm</li>
            <li> No more trips to the barber shop.  </li>
            <li> I usually cut my hair every week so for it to hold up for over 3 years speaks volumes about the type of quality this blade is.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t dull for years.</li>
            <li> very sharp cutting.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this item it was broken when it arrived and it appeared to have been used already.  </li>
            <li> Terrible experience.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great!  I was hoping for a blade that does more lining up, but this works well for getting real close</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, but the blade cut into skin, when I do fade</li>
            <li> Good product. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Close shave, even cut, and very easy to maintain. I am very pleased with the blade and recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Cuts close but not close enough, for me that is.  Made some adjustments ( not recommended for those who do not know what they are doing, may lead to injury ), now it cut just one step under actual shaving.</li>
            <li> Brand new blade that worked perfect for me.  If you&#x27;re achieving the bald look, this is the one.  Would purchase from this user again.</li>
            <li> Real close cut.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this is not the item I ordered,  i wanted to return it but just got a run around of questions</li>
            <li> Love them prefect fit at a cheaper value</li>
            <li> Great blade way smooth highly recommended</li>
            <li> PRO&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in conjunction with the Oster Classic 76 hair clipper to finish my hair cut i.e. the neck, ear and mustache areas. It does a great job, leaving a sharply defined line on my side burns and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that it did not come with a blade protecter for storage purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not razor close but it is the closest I have seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to have razor shave but this will get it down very close to that.</li>
            <li> The product is very good, high quality product.  But the description is very deceptive.  The description states &amp;#34;Blades All Sizes&amp;#34;, which makes it sound like you are getting multiple blades of mutiple sizes.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a hair stylist, is great. Does a great job, easy to clean, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Blade did not meet my expectations and return made to be incredibly impossible!&lt;br /&gt;This is one I&#x27;ll just have to accept the loss I guess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my recent purchase of the oster number. 76 clippers. The clippers cut much closer and don&#x27;t leave much room for error.</li>
            <li> FOR SOME STRANGE REASON THIS BLADE IS TOO SHARP AND IT GRABS AND NICKS.MY OLD FEW MISSING TEETH,BUT OTHER THAN THAT I WOKS FINE.</li>
            <li> Too off set making it not short enough.  Quality product though.</li>
            <li> If you want a close hair cut, this is a must-have addition to your blade collection.  My Oster Classic 76 clippers came with a 2, 1 and 000. I bought the 10-piece comb set separately.  After two self-cuts I purchased the 00000..  I use the 1 and 00000 and three of the combs for the results I want.  Perhaps this should be a bundle for Oster to consider.</li>
            <li> Blade is so sharp I can use it to shave my face.  Would buy again.  Use to groom my dog and to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> I am new to US and I was looking for a new hair clipper. I have been using several of them before before I came to US. This is best you can get with a hair clipper and closest to shaving. I have used it for almost 2 months and I have yet to come across any disadvantages of it. The shipping took around 3 days and was in excellent condition. I would like recommend to anyone who is in need of a clipper which will get him close to the shave. Fits excellently with the oster classic 76.</li>
            <li> Works good. It is just what you would expect it to be and fit. Six more words required? Whose review is it anyway?</li>
            <li> Typical clipper blade.  I love a close trim and it does the job I need it to.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality Product for the price! Delivered on time Wonderful thank you for a great product! This was a gift for my brother that is a professional barber...He was very pleased</li>
            <li> The closest you can get without using a straight razor!!!  I love my 00000 clipper blade.  It saves me time and money!!!  No more trips to the barber shop.  In fact, many barber shops don&#x27;t even have a blade that comes close to the Oster Classic 76 hair clipper blade.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cut there hair at home.</li>
            <li> Although this &amp;#34;Blade&amp;#34; is specifically for Oster &amp;#34;Classic 76 Clipper&amp;#34; it just won&#x27;t &amp;#34;seat and vibrate&amp;#34; properly(so won&#x27;t remove hair.)&lt;br /&gt;I oiled it and retried it several times after new &amp;#34;Springs and Brushes&amp;#34;, but, to no avail.</li>
            <li> I use this blade to shave. It leaves just the right amount of stubble and NEVER pulls. Shaving done in under a minute.</li>
            <li> well made accessory, close shave</li>
            <li> Gets the hair down to &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; the skin.  I don&#x27;t use this if time-constrained.  Try 000 or 1 with the wider teeth instead.</li>
            <li> Gives a much closer shave than anyone of the cheep consumer products that are out there. Defenately worth the money.</li>
            <li> Stop waiting!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this blade and butch it up, big time.</li>
            <li> On time ,love it thank you very much</li>
            <li> The closest you can get with a blade without ripping off skin.  Great blade, super close when you need it, works great with the guards, too, of course.  I&#x27;m a barber and this is my go-to blade.  Sharp, perfect.</li>
            <li> This blade is perfect that what I needed; it cuts close and tight to skin also sharp furthermore, good fast shipping. I recommend this to anyone who are looking to buying for oster brand.</li>
            <li> Only used 1time after oiling they pulled not bad for the money ,l was using my 76 ers</li>
            <li> Great...My order came in ahead of time I was very pleased #!#</li>
            <li> When fitted on my [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]] it gives the type of hair cut I desire.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to get that close cut on flattops. Works great to give a quick shave without the hassle of shaving.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this item it was broken when it arrived and it appeared to have been used already.  Terrible experience.</li>
            <li> great blade i use it allmost every day vary happy</li>
            <li> I needed this for my Oster 76 and it works great. Comes oiled in the package and ready to go.</li>
            <li> Well pleased&lt;br /&gt;By Richard Willis - July 19, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;Shipment arrived and it sounds nice!!!..much better then the guard I had on it.!!(#000) now I have the 1 and I also bought a #00000 from the same manufacture and they both (# 00000, 1 ) sound strong and looks clean and new. I&#x27;m a barber so I can&#x27;t wait to order the 1a and more later ..only 3 days to arrive too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry no comment about the cutting quality as I&#x27;m sure they should be fine do to the fact I&#x27;m using oster 76 light as my machine . I&#x27;m looking forward to making a nice blend with these !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@richthebarber</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Leaves an incredibly close cut and it&#x27;s built nicely. I can even use this for dry-shaving my face. I love this.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oster Classic 76 about 6 months ago and I use it to shave my head every other day.  I love the smoothness / power of the clippers and the fact that the blades are completely replaceable (although that does add extra cost to an already expensive item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to change blades, you just push down on the sharp end to slip off the old blade and slip on the new blade.  I first started with the 000 blade, then went to the shorter 0000 blade, and now I&#x27;m using this 00000 blade (which is the shortest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 00000 basically just leaves stubble.  For comparison, if you shave your head with a razor, this is about 1 day of growth.  If you like the look of very short stubble, this is the best way I&#x27;ve found to make it come out even every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice this blade can catch skin or any bumps on your head more easily than the 000 and 0000 blades.  It hasn&#x27;t really been an issue for me, but it causes me to be a bit more careful and work a little slower.  This blade does have the anti-bacterial coating, but I have no idea if it actually makes a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep the blade sharp and smooth, I recommend using Oster Kool Lube, Oster Blade Wash, and Oster blade oil.  I&#x27;m not trying to plug-in the brand here and I&#x27;m not affiliated with Oster in anyway.  These are expensive clippers and blades, so I take care of them to hopefully get my full money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> GREAT ADDITION TO THE OSTER LINE UP. THANKS FOR THE GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Did not fit on my Oster Classic 76 Clipper Machine</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery! I always receive my order before the ETA given. Quality products! New items always closed and still in origianl packaging. Will defiantly buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product with an. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> This clipper blade works great with my Oster 76 clippers. I was using the 000 blade and was ready for a closer cut without going completely shaved. The 00000 blade cuts hair very close to scalp, leaving an even \\&quot;five-o-clock\\&quot; shadow on your head. I recommend this clipper blade if you are not ready for a total clean shaven, bald scalp, but a very even, clean close cut scalp.</li>
            <li> The 00000 blade is the perfect solution for my bald hairstyle. There is no reason to pay $12 - $15 for a person to chop off your hair in 30 secs. It does take a little extra time to do it yourself, but I can do it in less than 5 minutes plus cleanup.</li>
            <li> The oster 00000  blade is a great blade to have. It gets really close for those nice tight fades. I&#x27;ve been a barber for over 15 years and I can honestly say that this blade comes in hand when doing bald heads or skin tight fades. A must have for anyone owning classic 76.</li>
            <li> If you cut your own hair, you will be pleased with this product.  The clipper and the blade are pro level.  Even if you have gotten the hang of it YET you will, be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I should have posted a picture of my fade</li>
            <li> great product that really and great price</li>
            <li> Good love,,,  it cut&#x27;s so low</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Shaves very well. I am very pleased with this blade and Oster Classic 76 Hair Clipper. The best clipper I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Works great and fit as it should. The blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Easy to change. Easy to clean. Won&#x27;t corrode. Won&#x27;t dull for years. Nice product to match my Oster Classic 76 in chrome :D</li>
            <li> its very close and gets the job done. the only thing is that when i cut my clients hair sometime the blade pulls hair. but other than that its chep and effective!</li>
            <li> Super tight cuts and smooth comfort for my clients</li>
            <li> Close shave with my Oster 76 model.  I&#x27;ll probably never go back to cheap clippers.  This is such a smooth cut.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference between 00000 or 000. I expected this one to be close like razor, not so.</li>
            <li> Wanted the closest cut for my head without using a razor.  The 00000 is that.  Skin close cut and very durable blade for my Oster Classic 76 clippers.</li>
            <li> Good attachment and gladly needed.</li>
            <li> Very clean cut, about 3~4 days growth from shaving my head bald with a razor. Not one cut or pull using this blade (about 6 months usage or more so far).&lt;br /&gt;Oil them about every 4 uses, so far they have performed like new each time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> very sharp cutting. very close cut. almost cuts as close as a razor. not much else to say. its a clipper blade.</li>
            <li> Delivery time was excellent I&#x27;ve use my Oster 00000 and the performance is excellent as well, Oster gets a 5 star rating from me!</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected. Arrived quickly and a great value.</li>
            <li> This product was good but difficult to install as there were barely any directions on how to install it. Once I installed it, it worked great</li>
            <li> My wife has been using those cheap &amp;#34;bic&amp;#34; razors to clean up the back of my neck hairs and this blade replaced that. The nice thing is this is reusable, the cut while not quite as close doesn&#x27;t irate my skin and after a day looks the same as the hairs grow back. There is another slightly closer non Oster blade that claims to cut it to .1mm instead of this blade&#x27;s .2mm but I find that this shave is close enough and there were reviews of the other blade as heating up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the Oster numbering scheme:&lt;br /&gt;Oster number scheme: depth in inches.&lt;br /&gt;#00000 - 1/125&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;#0000 - 1/100&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;#000 - 1/50&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;#0a - 3/64th&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - 3/32th&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;#1a - 1/8th&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;#1.5 - 5/32th&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - 1/4th&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;#3.5 - 3/8th&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;#3.75 - 1/2&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using a #2 on the sides where the hair is thick, a 1a on top where it&#x27;s fast retreating but still there and a #00000 on the hair on the back of my neck. YMMV.</li>
            <li> Back in college, I used to get my hair cut by another guy on my same dorm floor.  He had the old-school Oster Classic and he would sometime shave my face for me with it.  It was a clean and close shave.  This blade is great and get close enough for me.  I still go over my face with a foil shaver afterwards to get extra close.  I would recommend it to anyone shaving their head or their face.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for someone else, but they are enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Great for a close cut. Just about as close as you can get without using a razor.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and they work perfectly with the classic 76 hair clippers</li>
            <li> great clipper to use before a straight razor, gets hair very close to scalp....be careful however, very sharp..has tiny thin blade</li>
            <li> I bought this blade to replace a similar one that I have had for the previous 3 years.  I usually cut my hair every week so for it to hold up for over 3 years speaks volumes about the type of quality this blade is.</li>
            <li> This is the only blade I use on my Oster 76 and I only put clipper guards on it, and it still cuts very clean!</li>
            <li> Cuts super close, take care, it will cut you if it encounters a protuberance!</li>
