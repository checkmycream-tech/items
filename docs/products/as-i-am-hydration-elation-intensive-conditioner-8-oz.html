            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Have purchased items in the salon and even Sally&#x27;s stores that work better and allow for savings over salon prices.  </li>
            <li>However, I love the result</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more for something that works for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair has more shine and bounce and my curls are defined.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this conditioner because I love</li>
            <li>I felt like the conditioner sat on top of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The second time I tried this conditioner I used a heating cap and still wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>I put a lot more conditioner and comb it through and again used my heating cap.</li>
            <li>Wen was much better.</li>
            <li>My hair felt ok after using it.</li>

            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product because I LOVE the Coconut Co-wash and Leave-In Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Another fan favorite, I like this one too....</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I love the consistency of it.</li>
            <li>I love this product make my daughter hair fil nourish.</li>
            <li>I saw this product on you tube and decided that I would try it because the young lady hair turn out beautifully.  </li>
            <li>My favorite favorite conditioner, can&#x27;t find anything that works so good for my 4c natural hair, if I could I&#x27;ll buy a gallon if it :)</li>
            <li>so it is easy to frizz and damage.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair</li>
            <li>A huge problem with</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so smooth and shiny...</li>
            <li>The product has a good thick consistency and a great smell as well.</li>
            <li>and so so far so good.</li>
            <li>I am sort of a product junkie and more often I tend to try out new products for my healthy hair journey.  </li>
            <li>Awesome as usual.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was okay, but nothing to get excited about.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very creamy, but goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is nothing special.</li>
            <li>I used this as my first deep condition ever, and it seemed to work great.</li>
            <li>So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>This is the top of the line when it comes to making kinky hair soft and strong.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the product line, I received compliments from many about my hair which is natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used that actually defrizzes my hair and makes it look healthy!</li>
            <li>The crown of my head has a more kinky coarse texture that isn&#x27;t as easy to manage as the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It gives me the most trouble when it comes to staying moisturized/soft and this conditioner worked wonders with that free spirited section.</li>
            <li>I was able to do some finger detangling, as the slip is perhaps not as amazing as some other conditioners that I was able to try prior to getting braids.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t really notice a significant difference in the moisture of my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft now that when I do a ponytail, my hair looks so cool and smooth.</li>
            <li>After you set your hair in your favorite style, I generally do a braid out, you should notice the difference.  </li>
            <li>I love the silky texture it left my hair with.</li>
            <li>It will instantly become a staple in my healthy hair routine</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>so now I don&#x27;t mind the price so much!</li>
            <li>I have natural hair--chemical free.</li>
            <li>Quality could have been better, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner did wonders for moisturizing my hair after a protein treatment dried it out more than I was comfortable with.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and none of them get rid of my dry scalp including this one.</li>
            <li>This is the best brand hair product out there for dry damaged or curly dry hair it really softens and hydrate bringing your hair back to life!</li>
            <li>My hair is a fine type 4 with looser curls in the back.</li>
            <li>I used this along with their Coconut CoWash and my hair was very moisturized.</li>
            <li>and I owe it much to this product.  </li>
            <li>I really hope this product never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li>the As I Am Coconut Cowash so much.  </li>
            <li>cleans hair very well.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I realized that despite its claims to balance hydration and strength, its strengthening elements were just too much for me.</li>
            <li>I am ready to order again</li>
            <li>At this point I cannot honestly tell you the type of hair that I have, meaning 4a,  4b, or  4c because I feel that my hair type is not really important to me.  </li>
            <li>This has become a main stay in my hair care routine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair just feel soft, and I can saay that really feel the hydration in it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money I promise you (and trust me I&#x27;m a product junkie, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of deep conditioners)</li>
            <li>I had great curl clumping overall after rinsing, especially for wearing my hair straightened for over a month, and my wash and gos/twist out lasted days longer than I could usually expect.</li>
            <li>BUT this product does make it a lot easier to live with.</li>
            <li>2) I was saying to myself, \\&quot;another NEW product attempting to target the naturalist.\\</li>
            <li>True, the container is too small but worth it.</li>
            <li>It moisturizers my hair and leaves it very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft like butter after using!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I much prefer the &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; range of conditioners, particularly the Naked colour protecting conditioner (which does have a water-soluble silicone ingredient).</li>
            <li>I can tell you that I am  African American, however my mom is partially indian with very fine hair and my dads hair is kinky, I guess.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but so very worth it.</li>
            <li>I brought this product because I read reviews of how it was very moisturizing and left the hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>,the only thing I don&#x27;t like as much is the smell but nothing I can&#x27;t cope with</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li>When I washed it out my hair felt soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The end result after straightening my hair felt so soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for over 4 years.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve seen a drastic change in my hair is using Unite Luxury Intense Mask.</li>
            <li>No shedding and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to natural hair devotees</li>
            <li>This made my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>To say the least, I have tried so many products</li>
            <li>But the steam from the shower will open up your hair follicles and allow the conditioner to really penetrate the way it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>After I did this regimen my hair was so soft.  </li>
            <li>Using this product made my  curls soft, defined and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I mean olive oil does a better job than this.</li>
            <li>I Am you definitely have a new customer!</li>
            <li>I mainly use these products when I wear my hair curly but the hydration elation and double butter cream work</li>
            <li>I am african american with fine curly hair that is very dry.</li>
            <li>if you have extremely thick hair and/or DC more than twice a month, it may not necessarily work for you.</li>
            <li>At first I was very apprehensive about buying this product because 1) for the price, you only get a little in this jar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural but I straighten my hair regularly.</li>
            <li>The only products I used that weren&#x27;t from this line were miss jessie&#x27;s pillow soft curls and a Shea Moisture holding/refreshing oil mist.</li>
            <li>the As I Am \\&quot;Double Cream Butter Moisturizer\\&quot; along with some natural organic shea butter.  </li>
            <li>My hair was left soooo soft, moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li>only complaint is the scent is too strong for those with fragrance senitivities.  </li>
            <li>This is what I am currently using on my natural, transitioning hair as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I went to my local Sallys beauty supply store and I stumbled across this product because I was in desperate need of a good deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It works well for dry natural hair like mine</li>
    </ol>

            <li> BUT this product does make it a lot easier to live with.</li>
            <li> 2) I was saying to myself, \\&quot;another NEW product attempting to target the naturalist.\\</li>
            <li> True, the container is too small but worth it.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers my hair and leaves it very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft like butter after using!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I much prefer the &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; range of conditioners, particularly the Naked colour protecting conditioner (which does have a water-soluble silicone ingredient).</li>
            <li> I can tell you that I am  African American, however my mom is partially indian with very fine hair and my dads hair is kinky, I guess.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but so very worth it.</li>
            <li> I brought this product because I read reviews of how it was very moisturizing and left the hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> ,the only thing I don&#x27;t like as much is the smell but nothing I can&#x27;t cope with</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> When I washed it out my hair felt soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The end result after straightening my hair felt so soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for over 4 years.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve seen a drastic change in my hair is using Unite Luxury Intense Mask.</li>
            <li> No shedding and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to natural hair devotees</li>
            <li> This made my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> To say the least, I have tried so many products</li>
            <li> But the steam from the shower will open up your hair follicles and allow the conditioner to really penetrate the way it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> After I did this regimen my hair was so soft.  </li>
            <li> Using this product made my  curls soft, defined and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I mean olive oil does a better job than this.</li>
            <li> I Am you definitely have a new customer!</li>
            <li> I mainly use these products when I wear my hair curly but the hydration elation and double butter cream work</li>
            <li> I am african american with fine curly hair that is very dry.</li>
            <li> if you have extremely thick hair and/or DC more than twice a month, it may not necessarily work for you.</li>
            <li> At first I was very apprehensive about buying this product because 1) for the price, you only get a little in this jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural but I straighten my hair regularly.</li>
            <li> The only products I used that weren&#x27;t from this line were miss jessie&#x27;s pillow soft curls and a Shea Moisture holding/refreshing oil mist.</li>
            <li> the As I Am \\&quot;Double Cream Butter Moisturizer\\&quot; along with some natural organic shea butter.  </li>
            <li> My hair was left soooo soft, moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the scent is too strong for those with fragrance senitivities.  </li>
            <li> This is what I am currently using on my natural, transitioning hair as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I went to my local Sallys beauty supply store and I stumbled across this product because I was in desperate need of a good deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It works well for dry natural hair like mine</li>
            <li> I usually notice just how dry my hair can get when I decide to wear it curly because I use keratin products to maintain my straight hair styles (my hair is not protein sensitive).</li>
            <li> It is very price, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount and do not rinse...it brings out my natural curls without frizzing, which stays soft all day.  </li>
            <li> The third time I used this conditioner I parted my hair into 4 sections and used this conditioner in one section and three different deep conditioners in each of the other three sections.  </li>
            <li> I finally found something that moisturizes my hair, all the other products Ive tried didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I wish I knew this products long time ago!</li>
            <li> It helps my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really dry today</li>
            <li> I always air dry.</li>
            <li> I tend to find that a lot of shampoos dry my hair out</li>
            <li> As a natural hair person, my thick hair craves a deep condition about every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I was a victim of this for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this conditioner and I will tell you that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry afterward and just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> When  I first used this deep conditioner I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but definitely worth</li>
            <li> I big-chopped in April 2013 but due to a military deployment have been in braids until February 2014.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely over-priced and cheaper at wal-mart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shared this product w/ other naturals.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re opposed to silicones then this conditioner performs just as well as other silicone-free conditioners e.g. the body shop conditioners.</li>
            <li> My only con with this product is the price, which you can get about 4-6 uses out of if you have thick coily hair.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s thick enough to not slide out of my hair.</li>
            <li> The down side is the size of the container, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, I know, but it&#x27;s the only deep condition</li>
            <li> It waves up slightly with a slight coil to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also used it after a protein treatment that dried out my hair to correct it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I noticed it a few weeks ago when I was in Sally&#x27;s but was discouraged by the price.  </li>
            <li> The size of this container is kind of outrageous for the price.</li>
            <li> So my hair is a mixture between both not too course and not fine.  </li>
            <li> Not a strong scent which I like</li>
            <li> My curls are a very tight coil.  </li>
            <li> On top of not working well, the smell is AWFUL so be prepared for that!!  </li>
            <li> I have to say that although it&#x27;s sort of small, it has lasted me over 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I wish to make a small remark pained me a lot.</li>
            <li> I ended up walking past this product</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s too expensive to throw away), using only after clarifying, but I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> It saved me from having to cut off all my hair due to a Keratin treatment gone wrong.</li>
            <li> I tried it again a week later, and my hair began to break like crazy!!</li>
            <li> Because of this, I found myself with a useless purchase, since all the liquid was poured into the box ..</li>
            <li> Very bad delivery ..</li>
            <li> No. Was horrible for my hair.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought because I needed a more intence conditioner and decided to give it a try. It works! I love how my hair is getting better and more managable.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Came on time and have been using it once a week. Hair feels soft like butter after using! Would definitely recommend. Will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used. It saved me from having to cut off all my hair due to a Keratin treatment gone wrong. I use it with and without heat at night. YOU WILL LOVE THIS CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li> great product for kinky coily hair like mine. read about the experience of others with my hair texture and decided to try it...wow! leave hair manageable and moisturized</li>
            <li> I like this product. I put it into a spray bottle and add water. I spritz my hair with it in the morning and at night. It helps my dry scalp. I have tried so many products and none of them get rid of my dry scalp including this one. BUT this product does make it a lot easier to live with.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but I still love it. Leaves the hair feeling very healthy. I have a problem with dryness.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this conditioner and I will tell you that a little goes a long way. This conditioner is very creamy, but goes on very smooth. I used this along with their Coconut CoWash and my hair was very moisturized. I also used it after a protein treatment that dried out my hair to correct it. This product also made my hair very easy to detangle. I must say this is a keeper for me.  My only con with this product is the price, which you can get about 4-6 uses out of if you have thick coily hair.&lt;br /&gt;They need to offer a bigger jar.</li>
            <li> This product was as perfect as they come; especially for afro-american hair. I love the silky texture it left my hair with. I love this.</li>
            <li> On top of not working well, the smell is AWFUL so be prepared for that!!  Have purchased items in the salon and even Sally&#x27;s stores that work better and allow for savings over salon prices.  oh yes...they smell much better also!</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner work for my hair I can detangle with no problem. And I leave it over night cause my hair needs it. And it feel so good</li>
            <li> I have to say that although it&#x27;s sort of small, it has lasted me over 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells, like coconut sugar!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell. But I didn&#x27;t really notice a significant difference in the moisture of my hair. I mean olive oil does a better job than this. It&#x27;s extremely over-priced and cheaper at wal-mart.</li>
            <li> This is what I am currently using on my natural, transitioning hair as a deep conditioner. My hair loves this stuff but for the price I wish the size were a bit bigger to accommodate the frequency in which women usually deep condition their hair. As a natural hair person, my thick hair craves a deep condition about every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My favorite favorite conditioner, can&#x27;t find anything that works so good for my 4c natural hair, if I could I&#x27;ll buy a gallon if it :)</li>
            <li> I brought this product because I read reviews of how it was very moisturizing and left the hair soft and manageable. It did not do it for me. The bottle is enough for maybe 3 applications. I did get the moisturizing effect, instead it felt like I was just coating my hair. My hair felt dry afterward and just not what I expected. Everything that glitters is not gold. Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I liked using this product a lot. It made my hair feel soft and very manageable.  I&#x27;d probably buy this again... Maybe...</li>
            <li> This is the top of the line when it comes to making kinky hair soft and strong.  A huge problem with the As I Am Line is that they have neglected to make a post-shampoo rinse-out conditioner.  So I end up using this for that purpose, as well as for a deep conditioner.  It is pricey when used either way, but if you can swing it, do so.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so smooth and shiny...I have curly hair(3a/3b) and I have tried a lot another products and this one is defenetely one of my favorites,the only thing I don&#x27;t like as much is the smell but nothing I can&#x27;t cope with</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my natural 4a hair smells good and leaves hair hydrated and manageable.  It will instantly become a staple in my healthy hair routine</li>
            <li> My item was delivered on time. I appreciate the punctuality. But I wish to make a small remark pained me a lot. Why produict is not wrapped in a package of protection? Because of this, I found myself with a useless purchase, since all the liquid was poured into the box .. Very bad delivery ..</li>
            <li> I saw this product on you tube and decided that I would try it because the young lady hair turn out beautifully.  I  must remember everything don&#x27;t work for everyone.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that moisturizes my hair, all the other products Ive tried didn&#x27;t work.  Can I get this in stores?&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product. It moisturizers my hair and leaves it very soft and manageable. It works well when I apply it before sitting under my steamer.</li>
            <li> I am african american with fine curly hair that is very dry. I tried this conditioner. I detangled my hair and left it in for an hour. When I washed it out my hair felt soft and moisturized. I then used the john freida frizz ease leave in spray in conditioner to blow out my hair. The end result after straightening my hair felt so soft and moisturized I could believe it and it kept that feel until my next wash ( a week later ). I know the results have a lot to do with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> No. Was horrible for my hair. Gave it away.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for conditioning and moisturizing the hair. The smell is also wonderful. I got this product to help with my split ends and so far I have been impressed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Sally&#x27;s today.  I noticed it a few weeks ago when I was in Sally&#x27;s but was discouraged by the price.  My hair felt really dry today so I decided to go for it.  I really like it! My hair feels so soft and much more manageable.  I have no idea what my hair type is.  I&#x27;ve been natural for over 4 years.  My curls are a very tight coil.  I washed my hair with Ouidad&#x27;s ultra nourishing cleansing oil and combed this product thru my hair after towel drying.  I left it in for about an hour.  I tend to generoursly use my products.  I&#x27;ll probaby get 3-4 uses out of this size jar.  However, I love the result so now I don&#x27;t mind the price so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural but I straighten my hair regularly. I usually notice just how dry my hair can get when I decide to wear it curly because I use keratin products to maintain my straight hair styles (my hair is not protein sensitive). This conditioner did wonders for moisturizing my hair after a protein treatment dried it out more than I was comfortable with. The crown of my head has a more kinky coarse texture that isn&#x27;t as easy to manage as the rest of my hair. It gives me the most trouble when it comes to staying moisturized/soft and this conditioner worked wonders with that free spirited section. I had great curl clumping overall after rinsing, especially for wearing my hair straightened for over a month, and my wash and gos/twist out lasted days longer than I could usually expect. The size of this container is kind of outrageous for the price. I think it would get 5 stars from me if this came in the same sized packaging as the coconut co-wash for this price. My hair is mid-back length, dark, 4a/3c (if you buy into the number label stuff), normal to low porosity, and dense with a mixture of spongy and silky textures. I have used about 1/4 of this container after just 2 uses, following the instructions on the label, and adding honey and olive oil to the conditioner before sitting under a hooded dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this along with the As I Am coconut co-wash, leave in conditioner, curling jelly, and double butter cream. The only products I used that weren&#x27;t from this line were miss jessie&#x27;s pillow soft curls and a Shea Moisture holding/refreshing oil mist. I mainly use these products when I wear my hair curly but the hydration elation and double butter cream work well when I straighten my hair too.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product line, I received compliments from many about my hair which is natural. I&#x27;ve shared this product w/ other naturals.</li>
            <li> This intensive conditioner is everything! Love, love and love! I use this product as a deep conditioner and let it sit on my hair for 30mins with my conditioning heating cap on. My curls are always well moisturized, defined and clumped nicely together. This has become a main stay in my hair care routine. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I have nothing to compare it to. I big-chopped in April 2013 but due to a military deployment have been in braids until February 2014. I used this as my first deep condition ever, and it seemed to work great. I was able to do some finger detangling, as the slip is perhaps not as amazing as some other conditioners that I was able to try prior to getting braids. The down side is the size of the container, so if you have extremely thick hair and/or DC more than twice a month, it may not necessarily work for you. However, based off my experience I would definitely recommend to others. My hair is a fine type 4 with looser curls in the back. The product has a good thick consistency and a great smell as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a drastic change in my hair when I use this but it&#x27;s not a bad product. Not a strong scent which I like and it&#x27;s thick enough to not slide out of my hair. I have fine, wavy hair so it is easy to frizz and damage. The only thing I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve seen a drastic change in my hair is using Unite Luxury Intense Mask. It&#x27;s expensive, I know, but it&#x27;s the only deep condition I&#x27;ve ever used that actually defrizzes my hair and makes it look healthy! It is worth the money I promise you (and trust me I&#x27;m a product junkie, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of deep conditioners)</li>
            <li> Best Leave in conditioner I have ever used.  I have natural hair--chemical free. I have seen amazing hair growth and I owe it much to this product.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with the price.  Store conditioners have never worked on my hair.  I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more for something that works for me.  I do use with every wash (approx 1 per week after I co-wash).  I use a small amount and do not rinse...it brings out my natural curls without frizzing, which stays soft all day.  I really hope this product never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> It works well for dry natural hair like mine</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Sallys and I have used it and so so far so good. No shedding and my hair is so soft. I wish I knew this products long time ago! I use this product along with the coconut co-wash. I also use shea moisture products. My hair is so soft now that when I do a ponytail, my hair looks so cool and smooth. True, the container is too small but worth it. Take this from a review reader.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by my daughter and once I smelled the product I immediately ordered the cleanser, conditioner and co-wash.  My hair has more shine and bounce and my curls are defined.  I would recommend this to natural hair devotees</li>
            <li> I decided to try this conditioner because I love the As I Am Coconut Cowash so much.  It is very price, but a little goes a long way.  This made my hair so soft.  I do not use it every week, only once a month as a deep conditioner.  It does an awesome job. I&#x27;m really loving the As I Am product line.</li>
            <li> Awesome as usual. All thier products are wonderful for my 3b curly hair.  only complaint is the scent is too strong for those with fragrance senitivities.  JessiCurl make no fragrance 3b curly hair products.</li>
            <li> When  I first used this deep conditioner I was not impressed. I felt like the conditioner sat on top of my hair.  The second time I tried this conditioner I used a heating cap and still wasn&#x27;t impressed.  The third time I used this conditioner I parted my hair into 4 sections and used this conditioner in one section and three different deep conditioners in each of the other three sections.  I put a lot more conditioner and comb it through and again used my heating cap. This time my hair was noticeably softer and this was one of the softer sections out of the four.</li>
            <li> Quality could have been better, especially for the price.  Wen was much better.</li>
            <li> I have african 4b hair. I have used this conditioner 3 times not as a deep conditioner. I left it in my hair for 10 minutes after shampooing then rinsed. I always air dry. It has good slip. My hair felt ok after using it. In my opinion it is nothing special. I much prefer the &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; range of conditioners, particularly the Naked colour protecting conditioner (which does have a water-soluble silicone ingredient). I guess the lack of silicones in this conditioner is what makes it just an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; conditioner for me. If you&#x27;re opposed to silicones then this conditioner performs just as well as other silicone-free conditioners e.g. the body shop conditioners.</li>
            <li> love this intensive conditoner</li>
            <li> I am sort of a product junkie and more often I tend to try out new products for my healthy hair journey.  At this point I cannot honestly tell you the type of hair that I have, meaning 4a,  4b, or  4c because I feel that my hair type is not really important to me.  To say the least, I have tried so many products and I have not fell in love with any... that&#x27;s until I found this.  I went to my local Sallys beauty supply store and I stumbled across this product because I was in desperate need of a good deep conditioner.  At first I was very apprehensive about buying this product because 1) for the price, you only get a little in this jar. 2) I was saying to myself, \\&quot;another NEW product attempting to target the naturalist.\\&quot;  I ended up walking past this product several times before I actually picked it up and bought it.  Let me tell you, the best decision I ever made.  I can tell you that I am  African American, however my mom is partially indian with very fine hair and my dads hair is kinky, I guess.  So my hair is a mixture between both not too course and not fine.  It waves up slightly with a slight coil to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  This is definitely a product that I will purchase again.  I tend to find that a lot of shampoos dry my hair out so I another product I recommend is Creame of Nature Ultra Moisturizing Shampoo.  I shampoo my hair and then I  apply Hydration Elation, I tend to apply the conditioner either before the shower or while I am taking one.  The trick to using this product is using it in the shower \\&quot;WITHOUT\\&quot; a shower cap.  What a lot of us ladies tend to do is run for the shower cap and I was a victim of this for quite a while.  But the steam from the shower will open up your hair follicles and allow the conditioner to really penetrate the way it is supposed to.  I either rinse the conditioner out towards the end of my shower or leave it on longer.  If you leave it on longer I suggest using a shower cap \\&quot;after the shower steam treatment\\&quot;to seal in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinse the conditioner out I use the As I Am \\&quot;Double Cream Butter Moisturizer\\&quot; along with some natural organic shea butter.  After you set your hair in your favorite style, I generally do a braid out, you should notice the difference.  After I did this regimen my hair was so soft.  The softest its ever been.  This is now my staple product to use.  My hair was left soooo soft, moisturized but not greasy. I love this moisturizer.  It is expensive but definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I Am you definitely have a new customer!</li>
            <li> My hair just feel soft, and I can saay that really feel the hydration in it. I will keep those in my hair regimen</li>
            <li> Using this product made my  curls soft, defined and moisturized. Highly recommend. A little pricey but so very worth it.</li>
            <li> cleans hair very well.</li>
            <li> Awesome, my dry hair days is beautiful moist hair now, I started to used it on my clients, It&#x27;s prices for the amount,  But you beauty cost..</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I LOVE the Coconut Co-wash and Leave-In Conditioner. The first time I used it, it was okay, but nothing to get excited about. I tried it again a week later, and my hair began to break like crazy!! I had to immediately clarify my hair in order to save my strands. That&#x27;s when I realized that despite its claims to balance hydration and strength, its strengthening elements were just too much for me. I will finish the product (it&#x27;s too expensive to throw away), using only after clarifying, but I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Another fan favorite, I like this one too.... I followed as directed and didn&#x27;t have any problems.... it did what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> It softens my hair and detangles it well. It smell okay and I love the consistency of it. It does the job well enough.  Its good but not a MUST HAVE for me.  But I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
