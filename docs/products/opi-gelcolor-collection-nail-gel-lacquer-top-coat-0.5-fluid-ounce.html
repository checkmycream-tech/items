            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>This top coat is wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you do your own shellac manicure, gotta have this!  </li>
            <li>Plus $12 off the bill because I brought my own product!  </li>
            <li>This item arrived promptly, and was in good quality.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>This looks so good.  </li>
            <li>the gel top coat finish is beautiful, super shiny, it goes on perfect.</li>
            <li>great top coat; it adds a lot of shine to gel nailpolish.</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It cured so easy and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Nice gel top!  </li>
            <li>I have been doing my own &amp;#34;shellaced&amp;#34; nails for over a year now.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to have nail protection for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Perfect price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice shine and prevents chipping if you seal the edges of your nail.</li>
            <li>I decided to do my own gelcolor nails and purchased everything on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>OPI really makes a great gel color product!</li>
            <li>I started looking on Amazon for products that would strengthen my nails and was thrilled to see this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks happy Colorado man!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best gel top coat I have ever used!</li>
            <li>No chip and beautiful glossy fresh look all the time</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very nice and clean.</li>
            <li>wow this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>But what I love most about this OPI Gel top coat is that it makes it look so shinny and even!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, sent very promptly, good price, I would recommend to others ,I was  very impressed with service</li>
            <li>Way better than sensational nails kit and the light with that kit works with these.</li>
            <li>if I could I would summit a photo of my nail after using all the products they look beautiful with out the high price.</li>
            <li>Everyone loves their great colors and clever names!</li>
            <li>When I use this top coat it doesn&#x27;t matter what brand of gel color</li>
            <li>I do feel like you get more for your money when buying OPI vs CND.</li>
            <li>Opi products work better than gelish or UV gel.</li>
            <li>Will buy more again.</li>
            <li>Can not beat O P I for top quality.</li>
            <li>I ordered both the top and bottom coat from this seller.</li>
            <li>The foundation, gel lacquer polish and the top coat will not be a product i will purchase again.</li>
            <li>They even gave a free sticker decal stencil!</li>
            <li>I love that it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>I love at home gel color.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Tried everything to make it work and it was the most streaky thing ever</li>
            <li>, then i use this gel top coat and my nails</li>
            <li>i will point out also that i don&#x27;t like the big brush that it comes with, so i use the brush from the sally hansen bottle and it works perfect.</li>
            <li>Used this many times.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Need to buy 2 or more at this price.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased the Gel Lacquer Top Coat and have a question that hopefully someone can answer for me.</li>
            <li>Once I have applied the top coat...</li>
            <li>I have always used OPI products and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>To recap,  yes, I will buy more and yes, I will recommend it to friends.  </li>
            <li>I have used gels without a top coat</li>
            <li>but it defiantly looks better and shinny after applying a topcoat (like any polish)</li>
            <li>GelColor Nail Lacquer Top Coat</li>
            <li>Then she switched to this top coat.</li>
            <li>I did not like this top coat.  </li>
            <li>Get the UV gloves also, love them&#x27;</li>
            <li>Shiny and protective - I absolutely love the quality of OPI gels.</li>
            <li>I LOVE &amp;#60;3.</li>
            <li>YOU NEED THIS TOP COAT</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I now have a wonderful manicure with only 1 coat of OPI Gel.</li>
            <li>This top coat is the exact.one I have searched for</li>
            <li>This top coat looks amazing, high shine and lasts a good two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The bottom coat was fine but the top coat was not.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE 6-9-12: The polish and Top Coat stayed on (left hand) for 2 weeks and remained beautiful and shiney.</li>
            <li>It is widely regarded as the best polish on the market.</li>
            <li>(cuz we loved them so much).</li>
            <li>This is a great top coat - I switched from Gelish to OPI and have never looked back.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It would also chip and peel easily.</li>
            <li>I have also put the gelcolor top coat over my regular OPI nail polish and it works great.  </li>
            <li>My brush is ruined so I&#x27;ll have to find a product to clean my brush before attempting to apply this top coat again.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I ordered my own so that as I travel, I can consistently have my gel product preference with me.  </li>
            <li>Even though both bottles were shipped together in bubble wrap and stayed together, the bottom coat was fine.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of GELISH top coat in 2011 and then decided to try this OPI top coat in spring 2013,</li>
            <li>This top coat leaves my nails SUPER shiny.</li>
            <li>aArrived all chunky and would not go on smooth.</li>
            <li>and maybe not even get close to the \\&quot;free edge\\&quot;</li>
            <li>While I purchased a UV light the instructions stated to cure for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>It works really well and goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smooth application.</li>
            <li>Nothing cheap.</li>
            <li>After using the UV light bubbles would form.</li>
            <li>Cures in 30 seconds with LED light.</li>
            <li>You have to use the UV light for these Items to work</li>
            <li>I use a UV light but may upgrade to an LED.</li>
            <li>but by mistake I bought a UV light which works fabulously.  </li>
            <li>Overall the quality is great.</li>
            <li>basically it is an absolute MUST HAVE!!!.</li>
            <li>I achieved very professional results and am very pleased with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i originally bought the Sally Hansen gel polish kit</li>
            <li>My first time with gel polish and will definitely do more.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the sephora at-home gel polish kit, and OPI blows the sephora brand out of the water.</li>
            <li>Nice brand new bottle.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, works with a UV nail light I purchased on Groupon.</li>
            <li>Before curing if you get some on your skin clean it off or that will cause it to peel</li>
            <li>But I have always loved OPI regular lacquer</li>
            <li>Not only did I get a great, long lasting manicure, I got a great neck, arms and hand massage!  </li>
            <li>I really like OPI top coat</li>
            <li>Need right curing light</li>
            <li>and i ran out quickly doing my families nails</li>
            <li>Use this to finish your Gel Nails and leave them super shiny.  </li>
            <li>I use this polish with the LED light from sephora, but this polish stays on longer and offers better protection to my paper-thin nails.</li>
            <li>The spa doesn&#x27;t mind and I can use high quality product :)</li>
            <li>does not stay on a long time, CND is a much better top coat than  OPI products.</li>
            <li>I loved it because my nails looked like they were just done - every single day.</li>
            <li>First class business and can&#x27;t wait for her to use this!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>I love the price and how quickly I received it , now I can do a professional job on my nails at home.</li>
            <li>Love the gel polishes that OPI offers.</li>
            <li>I am giving this product 2 stars because I saw other reviewers had good experience with it.</li>
            <li>I received the product within a couple of days and used it right away.  </li>
            <li>and then I put on OPI Gel Top Coat on and dry in my UV light.  </li>
            <li>and when I get home, I apply the OPI Gel Top Coat polish, dry in my UV light</li>
            <li>I tried to cheap out and use the base as the top coat, but didn&#x27;t work - this is a required piece of the process and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>If The product is not thick along The time, it would be fantastic.....</li>
            <li>OPI is a good brand, but this top coat takes a really long time to dry, unless you have one of those salon dryers...</li>
            <li>This will not dry without the ;amp and your nails will be sticky without using the Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;It has been almost 2 weeks since I got this lamp, and the top coat, and my nails look like I just got them done.</li>
            <li>This product did not last on my nail more than five days.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have had a problem with a return from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but this is my first return.</li>
            <li>This was  exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>so the smaller brush is better for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First time using the OPI</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I did my nails for the first time using the OPI gel collection about 9 days ago</li>
            <li>not a good product will not stay own and I have had professionals to make sure it just was not my doing.</li>
            <li>so I normally don’t go a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to make sure I check to see where the polish is coming from on my next orders.  </li>
            <li>This is great as long as your purchase the correct lamp to dry the polish.</li>
            <li>let it dry and use the gelcolor top coat</li>
            <li>I am almost certain this product was &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; when I received it-- which should have been &amp;#</li>
            <li>I used this on Friday morning and today is Monday afternoon and have had my hands in a lot of water, scrubbing dishes, cooking and my nails are still looiking shiney and ready for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Peels off as fast as you put it on.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>do I need to hold it under a specific light or what?</li>
            <li>And you ABSOLUTELY need to wipe your nails with Alcohol after they are done curing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and they sent out a replacement very promptly</li>
            <li>real opi product.  </li>
            <li>34;new.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disturbed by this</li>
            <li>Much improved formula from OPI Axxum.</li>
            <li>Take the whole kit to the Spa where I have my nails done.  </li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and it lasts as long as the gel manicures I get from a nail salon.</li>
            <li>This top coat works well with OPI colors...and perhaps other brands of gel (although I can&#x27;t testify about that).  </li>
            <li>I have contacted OPI through the main web site and am waiting for a reply.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of a regular manicure with regular polish.</li>
            <li>Great product, affordable and lasts two or more weeks, when you use OPI base coat with it .</li>
            <li>I am not for sure if I should purchase the other OPI products for gel nails because I use this as a plan clear polish and it peels within two days.</li>
            <li>It keeps my manicures looking fresh until my next visit to the salon.</li>
            <li>so I knew that it was most likely a bottle that was sitting around for a long time.  </li>
            <li>live and learn</li>
            <li>FOund this elsewhere for 35$ not worth it, found it on amazon for 15$  worth it, always try amazon first</li>
            <li>and I must say it works better than the other brand that I was using!!!</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered, the only downfall was that the bottle had already been opened and used.</li>
            <li>This top coat leaves my nails extremely shiny and my gel manicure will usually last about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Second to a Base coat the top coat is the most important.</li>
            <li>Normally I prefer clear nails, so I&#x27;m on a hunt for just clear gel polish.</li>
            <li>Very pretty soft pink gel lasts for 3+ weeks.</li>
            <li>The key to doing this is to make sure that your regular polish must be absolutely dry.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste the time purchasing this product it does not work.  </li>
            <li>and it never dried.  </li>
            <li>I have used this quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>and wow is all i can say,</li>
            <li>So far I had this on one nail</li>
            <li>cause i spent to much money to throw them away....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other brands but no problem with these.</li>
            <li>I even brought nail lamp gel still would not dry toke over hour and nail color became gunny</li>
            <li>otherwise it will never dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Perfect price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice shine and prevents chipping if you seal the edges of your nail.</li>
            <li> I decided to do my own gelcolor nails and purchased everything on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> OPI really makes a great gel color product!</li>
            <li> I started looking on Amazon for products that would strengthen my nails and was thrilled to see this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks happy Colorado man!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best gel top coat I have ever used!</li>
            <li> No chip and beautiful glossy fresh look all the time</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice and clean.</li>
            <li> wow this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> But what I love most about this OPI Gel top coat is that it makes it look so shinny and even!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, sent very promptly, good price, I would recommend to others ,I was  very impressed with service</li>
            <li> Way better than sensational nails kit and the light with that kit works with these.</li>
            <li> if I could I would summit a photo of my nail after using all the products they look beautiful with out the high price.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves their great colors and clever names!</li>
            <li> When I use this top coat it doesn&#x27;t matter what brand of gel color</li>
            <li> I do feel like you get more for your money when buying OPI vs CND.</li>
            <li> Opi products work better than gelish or UV gel.</li>
            <li> Will buy more again.</li>
            <li> Can not beat O P I for top quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered both the top and bottom coat from this seller.</li>
            <li> The foundation, gel lacquer polish and the top coat will not be a product i will purchase again.</li>
            <li> They even gave a free sticker decal stencil!</li>
            <li> I love that it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> I love at home gel color.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> Tried everything to make it work and it was the most streaky thing ever</li>
            <li> , then i use this gel top coat and my nails</li>
            <li> i will point out also that i don&#x27;t like the big brush that it comes with, so i use the brush from the sally hansen bottle and it works perfect.</li>
            <li> Used this many times.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Need to buy 2 or more at this price.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased the Gel Lacquer Top Coat and have a question that hopefully someone can answer for me.</li>
            <li> Once I have applied the top coat...</li>
            <li> I have always used OPI products and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> To recap,  yes, I will buy more and yes, I will recommend it to friends.  </li>
            <li> I have used gels without a top coat</li>
            <li> but it defiantly looks better and shinny after applying a topcoat (like any polish)</li>
            <li> GelColor Nail Lacquer Top Coat</li>
            <li> Then she switched to this top coat.</li>
            <li> I did not like this top coat.  </li>
            <li> Get the UV gloves also, love them&#x27;</li>
            <li> Shiny and protective - I absolutely love the quality of OPI gels.</li>
            <li> I LOVE &amp;#60;3.</li>
            <li> YOU NEED THIS TOP COAT</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I now have a wonderful manicure with only 1 coat of OPI Gel.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the exact.one I have searched for</li>
            <li> This top coat looks amazing, high shine and lasts a good two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The bottom coat was fine but the top coat was not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 6-9-12: The polish and Top Coat stayed on (left hand) for 2 weeks and remained beautiful and shiney.</li>
            <li> It is widely regarded as the best polish on the market.</li>
            <li> (cuz we loved them so much).</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat - I switched from Gelish to OPI and have never looked back.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It would also chip and peel easily.</li>
            <li> I have also put the gelcolor top coat over my regular OPI nail polish and it works great.  </li>
            <li> My brush is ruined so I&#x27;ll have to find a product to clean my brush before attempting to apply this top coat again.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered my own so that as I travel, I can consistently have my gel product preference with me.  </li>
            <li> Even though both bottles were shipped together in bubble wrap and stayed together, the bottom coat was fine.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of GELISH top coat in 2011 and then decided to try this OPI top coat in spring 2013,</li>
            <li> This top coat leaves my nails SUPER shiny.</li>
            <li> aArrived all chunky and would not go on smooth.</li>
            <li> and maybe not even get close to the \\&quot;free edge\\&quot;</li>
            <li> While I purchased a UV light the instructions stated to cure for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It works really well and goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth application.</li>
            <li> Nothing cheap.</li>
            <li> After using the UV light bubbles would form.</li>
            <li> Cures in 30 seconds with LED light.</li>
            <li> You have to use the UV light for these Items to work</li>
            <li> I use a UV light but may upgrade to an LED.</li>
            <li> but by mistake I bought a UV light which works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> Overall the quality is great.</li>
            <li> basically it is an absolute MUST HAVE!!!.</li>
            <li> I achieved very professional results and am very pleased with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i originally bought the Sally Hansen gel polish kit</li>
            <li> My first time with gel polish and will definitely do more.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the sephora at-home gel polish kit, and OPI blows the sephora brand out of the water.</li>
            <li> Nice brand new bottle.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, works with a UV nail light I purchased on Groupon.</li>
            <li> Before curing if you get some on your skin clean it off or that will cause it to peel</li>
            <li> But I have always loved OPI regular lacquer</li>
            <li> Not only did I get a great, long lasting manicure, I got a great neck, arms and hand massage!  </li>
            <li> I really like OPI top coat</li>
            <li> Need right curing light</li>
            <li> and i ran out quickly doing my families nails</li>
            <li> Use this to finish your Gel Nails and leave them super shiny.  </li>
            <li> I use this polish with the LED light from sephora, but this polish stays on longer and offers better protection to my paper-thin nails.</li>
            <li> The spa doesn&#x27;t mind and I can use high quality product :)</li>
            <li> does not stay on a long time, CND is a much better top coat than  OPI products.</li>
            <li> I loved it because my nails looked like they were just done - every single day.</li>
            <li> First class business and can&#x27;t wait for her to use this!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> I love the price and how quickly I received it , now I can do a professional job on my nails at home.</li>
            <li> Love the gel polishes that OPI offers.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 2 stars because I saw other reviewers had good experience with it.</li>
            <li> I received the product within a couple of days and used it right away.  </li>
            <li> and then I put on OPI Gel Top Coat on and dry in my UV light.  </li>
            <li> and when I get home, I apply the OPI Gel Top Coat polish, dry in my UV light</li>
            <li> I tried to cheap out and use the base as the top coat, but didn&#x27;t work - this is a required piece of the process and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> If The product is not thick along The time, it would be fantastic.....</li>
            <li> OPI is a good brand, but this top coat takes a really long time to dry, unless you have one of those salon dryers...</li>
            <li> This will not dry without the ;amp and your nails will be sticky without using the Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;It has been almost 2 weeks since I got this lamp, and the top coat, and my nails look like I just got them done.</li>
            <li> This product did not last on my nail more than five days.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have had a problem with a return from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this is my first return.</li>
            <li> This was  exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> so the smaller brush is better for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First time using the OPI</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I did my nails for the first time using the OPI gel collection about 9 days ago</li>
            <li> not a good product will not stay own and I have had professionals to make sure it just was not my doing.</li>
            <li> so I normally don’t go a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to make sure I check to see where the polish is coming from on my next orders.  </li>
            <li> This is great as long as your purchase the correct lamp to dry the polish.</li>
            <li> let it dry and use the gelcolor top coat</li>
            <li> I am almost certain this product was &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; when I received it-- which should have been &amp;#</li>
            <li> I used this on Friday morning and today is Monday afternoon and have had my hands in a lot of water, scrubbing dishes, cooking and my nails are still looiking shiney and ready for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Peels off as fast as you put it on.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> do I need to hold it under a specific light or what?</li>
            <li> And you ABSOLUTELY need to wipe your nails with Alcohol after they are done curing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and they sent out a replacement very promptly</li>
            <li> real opi product.  </li>
            <li> 34;new.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disturbed by this</li>
            <li> Much improved formula from OPI Axxum.</li>
            <li> Take the whole kit to the Spa where I have my nails done.  </li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and it lasts as long as the gel manicures I get from a nail salon.</li>
            <li> This top coat works well with OPI colors...and perhaps other brands of gel (although I can&#x27;t testify about that).  </li>
            <li> I have contacted OPI through the main web site and am waiting for a reply.</li>
            <li> I use it on top of a regular manicure with regular polish.</li>
            <li> Great product, affordable and lasts two or more weeks, when you use OPI base coat with it .</li>
            <li> I am not for sure if I should purchase the other OPI products for gel nails because I use this as a plan clear polish and it peels within two days.</li>
            <li> It keeps my manicures looking fresh until my next visit to the salon.</li>
            <li> so I knew that it was most likely a bottle that was sitting around for a long time.  </li>
            <li> live and learn</li>
            <li> FOund this elsewhere for 35$ not worth it, found it on amazon for 15$  worth it, always try amazon first</li>
            <li> and I must say it works better than the other brand that I was using!!!</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered, the only downfall was that the bottle had already been opened and used.</li>
            <li> This top coat leaves my nails extremely shiny and my gel manicure will usually last about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Second to a Base coat the top coat is the most important.</li>
            <li> Normally I prefer clear nails, so I&#x27;m on a hunt for just clear gel polish.</li>
            <li> Very pretty soft pink gel lasts for 3+ weeks.</li>
            <li> The key to doing this is to make sure that your regular polish must be absolutely dry.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste the time purchasing this product it does not work.  </li>
            <li> and it never dried.  </li>
            <li> I have used this quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> and wow is all i can say,</li>
            <li> So far I had this on one nail</li>
            <li> cause i spent to much money to throw them away....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other brands but no problem with these.</li>
            <li> I even brought nail lamp gel still would not dry toke over hour and nail color became gunny</li>
            <li> otherwise it will never dry.</li>
            <li> The top coat arrived broken and the product was all over the other two bottles and soaked the shipping box as well.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little long to dry 10-15 mins but this could be my dryer because it is the first gel I tried by myself.  </li>
            <li> I am unable to use this and am trying to return it for a new fresh bottle.  </li>
            <li> and my nails are super shinny and makes nails very hard.</li>
            <li> I did not want to use it when all the other nails products would not dry</li>
            <li> and my nails are shiny and sparkly all month long.</li>
            <li> takes long time to dry</li>
            <li> I guess they will just collect dust till they dry out</li>
            <li> idk but this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> Also must wipe off the tacky layer after curing with alcohol or it will never feel dry.</li>
            <li> I let the manicure dry</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit pricey, but I can see it will last quite a while because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You really do have to put it on as thin as you can</li>
            <li> This product ran onto the sides of my nails and pooled there while not protecting the center or the tips.  </li>
            <li> One of the many brands I have tried and absolutely the worst.</li>
            <li> I use it as top coat, base coat, over regular polish.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, the fact that I&#x27;m somewhat heavy handed and have poor vision is why I couldn&#x27;t apply it fast enough.</li>
            <li> Also, I use my regular polish, base coat, 2 color coats and 1 top coat.  </li>
            <li> I got the stuff with white cap, that means that it&#x27;s not original OPI product!</li>
            <li> I am addicted and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> is there any chance that i can find you on the web, im looking for a supplier of opi nail polish, opi gelcolor system, and other nail polishes...</li>
            <li> but you only get a small bottle</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other gel product.  </li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries to use this product, but now that I have it down - it is FAB!</li>
            <li> So I took my OPI base, lacquer, and top coat to the salon and had the professionals do it.  </li>
            <li> OPI Gel  base and top coats are all I use with EVERY brand of gel I purchase.</li>
            <li> Had to remove the mess I had on my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed as official OPI confirmed that they have products only with black caps</li>
            <li> It is very thick and drips to the side of your nail and then makes the polish peel later.  </li>
            <li> This product was dried up when I opened it.  </li>
            <li> When I use this over CND gel colors, I can peel off the gel versus soaking it off in harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> When I pulled the applicator out of the bottle, the bristles were missing.  </li>
            <li> Makes my nails hard and the color stays on the longest of all the other top/base coat sets.</li>
            <li> The reason the other hand came off, I put it on to thick and it ran on the side of my nail when I cured it, so</li>
            <li> You need to use as thin coats as possible if you think it&#x27;s too thick wipe some off on the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all, I tried different techniques and didn&#x27;t work,  maybe I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> and this product is expensive enough that I feel ripped off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have small nails</li>
            <li> Just apply your polish as usual</li>
            <li> For 15 years I&#x27;ve had my nails done &amp;#60;acrylic&amp;#62; and for the past 6 months my tech used this.</li>
            <li> I will point out that when i do my nails i only use regular nail on to of the base coat, sometime not</li>
            <li> Even after 2 minutes it was sticky and did not get hard on the surface.</li>
            <li> I found that out the hard way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this at the same time as I ordered OPI&#x27;s Pink Flamenco Gel Laquer and the OPI base coat.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered a lot of polished through Amazon through different companies, but this one was completely disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could give it zero stars, but I had to give it at least one.</li>
            <li> what does that mean?</li>
            <li> Will try to get my money back :(</li>
            <li> I went to gel, because I hated the smell of regular polish</li>
            <li> and I was unable to thinly apply gel.</li>
            <li> Useless to me.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this.</li>
            <li> I may have just ordered the wrong product..</li>
            <li> did not help my dry, brittle nails almost destroyed by artificial nails (never again!!)</li>
            <li> I found that out the hard way bought the base and it never cured at all ..</li>
            <li> Impossible to work with it.</li>
            <li> + weeks when used in conjunction with the OPI Gelcolor base coat.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget your base coat!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Way better than sensational nails kit and the light with that kit works with these. LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best gel top coat I have ever used! When I use this top coat it doesn&#x27;t matter what brand of gel color I use it makes it last for 3 + weeks.</li>
            <li> This product did not last on my nail more than five days.  I swam a lot this summer and this product did not last!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> takes long time to dry I even brought nail lamp gel still would not dry toke over hour and nail color became gunny</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, works with a UV nail light I purchased on Groupon.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all, I tried different techniques and didn&#x27;t work,  maybe I was doing something wrong. ...I don&#x27;t know, but didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own &amp;#34;shellaced&amp;#34; nails for over a year now. I do feel like you get more for your money when buying OPI vs CND. I think both brands equally worked well but I am used to the OPI handle so it is easier for me to apply.</li>
            <li> Peels off after 2-3 days, even with 4 coats on.</li>
            <li> aArrived all chunky and would not go on smooth. Useless to me. Thought about throwing it away. Will try to get my money back :(</li>
            <li> gel has to work with an opi led lamp works great</li>
            <li> Need right curing light</li>
            <li> I used this on Friday morning and today is Monday afternoon and have had my hands in a lot of water, scrubbing dishes, cooking and my nails are still looiking shiney and ready for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in week to ten days and let you know. Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6-9-12: The polish and Top Coat stayed on (left hand) for 2 weeks and remained beautiful and shiney. Normally I prefer clear nails, so I&#x27;m on a hunt for just clear gel polish. The reason the other hand came off, I put it on to thick and it ran on the side of my nail when I cured it, so I tried to file the sides and of course it broke the seal. I watched YouTube and found out all my mistakes I was making. You really do have to put it on as thin as you can and maybe not even get close to the \\&quot;free edge\\&quot;, skin/cuticles. It is so nice to have nail protection for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> great top coat; it adds a lot of shine to gel nailpolish. Opi products work better than gelish or UV gel.</li>
            <li> is there any chance that i can find you on the web, im looking for a supplier of opi nail polish, opi gelcolor system, and other nail polishes... best regards</li>
            <li> This top coat is wonderful. I achieved very professional results and am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;  I thought it was a bit pricey, but I can see it will last quite a while because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> does not stay on a long time, CND is a much better top coat than  OPI products. would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat - I switched from Gelish to OPI and have never looked back.  Will buy more again.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste the time purchasing this product it does not work.  I applied it waited two hours and it never dried.  Had to remove the mess I had on my nails.</li>
            <li> If you do your own shellac manicure, gotta have this!  &#x27;nough said. Can not beat O P I for top quality.</li>
            <li> This product was dried up when I opened it.  I ordered both the top and bottom coat from this seller. The bottom coat was fine but the top coat was not.  Granted, I did not open it for a couple of months, so when I asked to return it, they said I handled it improperly. Even though both bottles were shipped together in bubble wrap and stayed together, the bottom coat was fine.  This is the first time I have had a problem with a return from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this seller again.  Their customer service is a joke. I am not in the habit of stealing 16 dollar bottles of nail polish. I could see if I repeatedly returned items to them but this is my first return.</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT ARRIVE BUT I WAS BILLED!</li>
            <li> While I purchased a UV light the instructions stated to cure for 30 seconds. Even after 2 minutes it was sticky and did not get hard on the surface. I have contacted OPI through the main web site and am waiting for a reply. I would love to have someone tell me if this product is defective or did I do something wrong. I am giving this product 2 stars because I saw other reviewers had good experience with it. I did not however and this product is expensive enough that I feel ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was not part of Prime so it took 8 days for delivery.</li>
            <li> Perfect nail polish. I am addicted and highly recommend. Perfect price and fast shipping. No chip and beautiful glossy fresh look all the time</li>
            <li> Peels off as fast as you put it on. One of the many brands I have tried and absolutely the worst. The foundation, gel lacquer polish and the top coat will not be a product i will purchase again. I guess they will just collect dust till they dry out cause i spent to much money to throw them away....live and learn I guess!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and we received it within three days of purchasing! They even gave a free sticker decal stencil! First class business and can&#x27;t wait for her to use this!</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and it lasts as long as the gel manicures I get from a nail salon. I won&#x27;t use anything but OPI gel for my nails.</li>
            <li> I have used this quite frequently.  I love that it lasts forever.  It is a bit thicker than I like and goes on a bit goopy.  I actually prefer JBD brand for the top/bottom coat as well as the polish colors.</li>
            <li> This item arrived promptly, and was in good quality.  It works really well and goes on nicely.  I love at home gel color.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product at a reasonable price.  I received the product within a couple of days and used it right away.  If you use OPI gel or lacquer, this is a must.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome. I wish I would have thought of it myself. It&#x27;s a smooth application. Not sticky. I love the product. Please invest in a great nail dryer/ curer to compliment the polish. Nothing cheap. The best one I&#x27;ve found is by OPI.</li>
            <li> Very pretty soft pink gel lasts for 3+ weeks.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell. I went to gel, because I hated the smell of regular polish</li>
            <li> came with a messed up brush! Impossible to work with it. Tried everything to make it work and it was the most streaky thing ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products and none of then compare to this one. I put this on as a topcoat alone and my nails are super shinny and makes nails very hard.</li>
            <li> idk but this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this. I go to the salon get my regular acrylics and pedicure ( done with regular nail polish ) and once I get home I apply 2 coats of this and my nails are shiny and sparkly all month long. I Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works Great.  Easy to apply.  This was  exactly what I wanted. Shipped fast.  Would buy again.  Don&#x27;t forget your base coat!!</li>
            <li> karen taylor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never used because the color was so runny  I did not want to use it when all the other nails products would not dry</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! i originally bought the Sally Hansen gel polish kit but you only get a small bottle and i ran out quickly doing my families nails (cuz we loved them so much). So i bought this and wow is all i can say, the gel top coat finish is beautiful, super shiny, it goes on perfect. I will purchase this here on out.  I will point out that when i do my nails i only use regular nail on to of the base coat, sometime not, then i use this gel top coat and my nails always turn out amazing!!!!  OH! i will point out also that i don&#x27;t like the big brush that it comes with, so i use the brush from the sally hansen bottle and it works perfect. I have small nails so the smaller brush is better for me.</li>
            <li> Used this many times. After using the UV light bubbles would form. It would also chip and peel easily.</li>
            <li> Love it. OPI has set the bar for nail polish</li>
            <li> OPI is a great product</li>
            <li> Use this to finish your Gel Nails and leave them super shiny.  Don&#x27;t forget to use the nail spray to wipe off the residue or else your nails will stay sticky.</li>
            <li> Nice gel top!  Will buy again....... Thanks!</li>
            <li> This top coat works well with OPI colors...and perhaps other brands of gel (although I can&#x27;t testify about that).  Cures in 30 seconds with LED light. Leaves a nice shine and prevents chipping if you seal the edges of your nail.</li>
            <li> You need this if your doing GEL polish. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to I&#x27;ve only used OPI GEL but it works well and gives you the 2 weeks of wear.</li>
            <li> What can you say about OPI?  It is widely regarded as the best polish on the market. Everyone loves their great colors and clever names!</li>
            <li> I decided to do my own gelcolor nails and purchased everything on Amazon.  This top coat looks amazing, high shine and lasts a good two weeks.  I have also put the gelcolor top coat over my regular OPI nail polish and it works great.  Just apply your polish as usual let it dry and use the gelcolor top coat put your nails under the lamp for 3 min and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> You have to use the UV light for these Items to work I found that out the hard way bought the base and it never cured at all ..if I could I would summit a photo of my nail after using all the products they look beautiful with out the high price.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!! Get it!!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!  Need to buy 2 or more at this price.  Nails look like you just walk out of the shop.</li>
            <li> I tried a different base/top coat and the manicurist couldn&#x27;t get it to come off.  This works just like it should when it&#x27;s time to come off.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat gel I have tried. When I use this over CND gel colors, I can peel off the gel versus soaking it off in harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Gel Lacquer Top Coat and have a question that hopefully someone can answer for me. When it says LED cured in 30 seconds...what does that mean? Once I have applied the top coat...do I need to hold it under a specific light or what? I have always used OPI products and absolutely love them. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Doris</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!  I am a beginner when it comes to gel manicures.  But I have always loved OPI regular lacquer so I was happy to discover their gel polish.  About a month ago, my nails needs polishing but I didn&#x27;t feel like hassling with the gel manicure myself.  So I took my OPI base, lacquer, and top coat to the salon and had the professionals do it.  Not only did I get a great, long lasting manicure, I got a great neck, arms and hand massage!  Plus $12 off the bill because I brought my own product!  To recap,  yes, I will buy more and yes, I will recommend it to friends.  And all of you!</li>
            <li> OPI really makes a great gel color product! I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other. I tried to cheap out and use the base as the top coat, but didn&#x27;t work - this is a required piece of the process and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Second to a Base coat the top coat is the most important. I have used gels without a top coat but it defiantly looks better and shinny after applying a topcoat (like any polish) But what I love most about this OPI Gel top coat is that it makes it look so shinny and even! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> First time using the OPI GelColor Nail Lacquer Top Coat and I must say it works better than the other brand that I was using!!!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Just what I wanted and ordered.</li>
            <li> For 15 years I&#x27;ve had my nails done &amp;#60;acrylic&amp;#62; and for the past 6 months my tech used this. I always went with a french mani and she used to buff my nails to a shine. Then she switched to this top coat. I loved it because my nails looked like they were just done - every single day. When I did use color - same results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped going because I was paying $40 every 2 weeks. I started looking on Amazon for products that would strengthen my nails and was thrilled to see this!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp at the same time. It took me a couple of tries to use this product, but now that I have it down - it is FAB! You DEFINITELY  need a Lamp to use this product. And you ABSOLUTELY need to wipe your nails with Alcohol after they are done curing. HAVE TO!! If you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll only be wasting your time and money. This will not dry without the ;amp and your nails will be sticky without using the Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;It has been almost 2 weeks since I got this lamp, and the top coat, and my nails look like I just got them done. I am so happy!! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I did not like this top coat.  It is very thick and drips to the side of your nail and then makes the polish peel later.  I will buy a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations at all..I may have just ordered the wrong product..did not help my dry, brittle nails almost destroyed by artificial nails (never again!!)</li>
            <li> This is great as long as your purchase the correct lamp to dry the polish. I found that out the hard way. I use it on top of a regular manicure with regular polish. It keeps my manicures looking fresh until my next visit to the salon.</li>
            <li> wow this stuff is awesome. I use it as top coat, base coat, over regular polish. basically it is an absolute MUST HAVE!!!. Don&#x27;t listen to anyone who tells you that you can&#x27;t use gel over regular polish. The key to doing this is to make sure that your regular polish must be absolutely dry. I have over 30 regular nail polishes and wasn&#x27;t about to just throw them away to have the entire gel system. This works like a charm. spreads evenly and i don&#x27;t even use one of the fancier lamps. bought the lamp from amazon as well for about 40 bucks!</li>
            <li> Love the gel polishes that OPI offers. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with other brands but no problem with these. I use a UV light but may upgrade to an LED.</li>
            <li> This is awesome if you use it correctly.Yes you must you a Led or UV lamp to cure it 30 seconds for the Led or 2 minutes for the UV otherwise it will never dry.You need to use as thin coats as possible if you think it&#x27;s too thick wipe some off on the side of the bottle. Also must wipe off the tacky layer after curing with alcohol or it will never feel dry.Before curing if you get some on your skin clean it off or that will cause it to peel</li>
            <li> I had difficulties spreading it evenly before the brush hardened and I was unable to thinly apply gel. Perhaps, the fact that I&#x27;m somewhat heavy handed and have poor vision is why I couldn&#x27;t apply it fast enough. My brush is ruined so I&#x27;ll have to find a product to clean my brush before attempting to apply this top coat again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> FOund this elsewhere for 35$ not worth it, found it on amazon for 15$  worth it, always try amazon first</li>
            <li> I ordered this at the same time as I ordered OPI&#x27;s Pink Flamenco Gel Laquer and the OPI base coat.  The seller put all three bottles in the same box without bubble wrapping the individual bottles.  The top coat arrived broken and the product was all over the other two bottles and soaked the shipping box as well.  I did contact the seller and they sent out a replacement very promptly and bubble wrapped.  I love this product!!!!  I did my nails for the first time using the OPI gel collection about 9 days ago and my nails look great!</li>
            <li> Arrived as planned and pkg&#x27;d well.  Great product! I ordered my own so that as I travel, I can consistently have my gel product preference with me.  Get the UV gloves also, love them&#x27;</li>
            <li> OPI is a good brand, but this top coat takes a really long time to dry, unless you have one of those salon dryers...</li>
            <li> This looks so good.  It cured so easy and looks great.  Will definitely buy again!  My first time with gel polish and will definitely do more.</li>
            <li> Shiny and protective - I absolutely love the quality of OPI gels.</li>
            <li> OPI Gel  base and top coats are all I use with EVERY brand of gel I purchase. Makes my nails hard and the color stays on the longest of all the other top/base coat sets.</li>
            <li> real opi product.  best stuff out there.</li>
            <li> GREAT!!! I will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> I am almost certain this product was &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; when I received it-- which should have been &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disturbed by this</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered, the only downfall was that the bottle had already been opened and used. There was enough to give myself a manicure I just hope it lasts as what I paid for it to!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised! Nice brand new bottle. Even had extra nail stickers included!</li>
            <li> I am not for sure if I should purchase the other OPI products for gel nails because I use this as a plan clear polish and it peels within two days. I believe it is user error and have to take the time to do further research.</li>
            <li> This top coat leaves my nails SUPER shiny. And it helps my manicures last 2 + weeks when used in conjunction with the OPI Gelcolor base coat. I LOVE &amp;#60;3. Much improved formula from OPI Axxum.</li>
            <li> not a good product will not stay own and I have had professionals to make sure it just was not my doing. do not recommend</li>
            <li> OPI IS THE BEST, SO IF YOU ARE USING THEIR GELCOLORS... YOU NEED THIS TOP COAT FOR THE COLORS TO STAY SHINNY!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love it.  I will never use any other gel product.  When I would get a manicure, no matter what the salon did, I was always allergic to their product.  I have no problem with OPI Gel.  Also, it requires an LED lamp but by mistake I bought a UV light which works fabulously.  So whether it is LED or UV, the polish works great with either lamp.  Also, I use my regular polish, base coat, 2 color coats and 1 top coat.  I let the manicure dry and then I put on OPI Gel Top Coat on and dry in my UV light.  It works great and I can now use all my colors.  Now what I do, is go and get a manicure and pedicure and when I get home, I apply the OPI Gel Top Coat polish, dry in my UV light and I now have a wonderful manicure with only 1 coat of OPI Gel.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the exact.one I have searched for I love the price and how quickly I received it , now I can do a professional job on my nails at home. This is the newest product out.</li>
            <li> Great product... I am a nail technician and I use mannnny brands. I really like OPI top coat it&#x27;s very nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I got the stuff with white cap, that means that it&#x27;s not original OPI product! I&#x27;m very disappointed as official OPI confirmed that they have products only with black caps</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, sent very promptly, good price, I would recommend to others ,I was  very impressed with service</li>
            <li> Daughter in law loves it</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of GELISH top coat in 2011 and then decided to try this OPI top coat in spring 2013, well it is now spring of 2014 and the OPI has yellowed but the GELISH that Iv&#x27;e had since 2011 is still in great condition!</li>
            <li> So far I had this on one nail I tried it out on and its been on for about 2 weeks and shows no signs of peeling or looking like its about to come off. It takes a little long to dry 10-15 mins but this could be my dryer because it is the first gel I tried by myself.  Overall the quality is great.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something I could use with my regular polish to give it the wear of a gel manicure without having to soak my nails to get the color off.  This product ran onto the sides of my nails and pooled there while not protecting the center or the tips.  I will have to look for something else.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great product, affordable and lasts two or more weeks, when you use OPI base coat with it . Thanks happy Colorado man!</li>
            <li> I prefer this product rather than shellac, because it&#x27;s thinner and The bottle is bigger. If The product is not thick along The time, it would be fantastic.....</li>
            <li> This top coat leaves my nails extremely shiny and my gel manicure will usually last about two weeks.  However, I am always changing my color so I normally don’t go a full two weeks.  Great product and can be used with any gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> Take the whole kit to the Spa where I have my nails done.  The spa doesn&#x27;t mind and I can use high quality product :)</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the sephora at-home gel polish kit, and OPI blows the sephora brand out of the water. I use this polish with the LED light from sephora, but this polish stays on longer and offers better protection to my paper-thin nails. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have ordered a lot of polished through Amazon through different companies, but this one was completely disappointing.  When I pulled the applicator out of the bottle, the bristles were missing.  The gel polish was also \\&quot;stringy\\&quot; so I knew that it was most likely a bottle that was sitting around for a long time.  I am unable to use this and am trying to return it for a new fresh bottle.  I&#x27;ll have to make sure I check to see where the polish is coming from on my next orders.  I wish I could give it zero stars, but I had to give it at least one.</li>
