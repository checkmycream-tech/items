    <ol>
            <li>Best for the money, no question.</li>
            <li>At $18 it is a very very good deal.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor</li>
            <li>If you can get a good stone to hone this razor followed by a good stropping, this is the best razor out there for the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an excellent buy, I love</li>
            <li>Something very good, very easy to use , and I would recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that will be a great entry level shaver and are not afraid to hone it yourself, this is the best value on the market.</li>
            <li>this is a good peace of metal for the price.</li>
            <li>Unless you know a good place to get it sharpened or know how to I would suggest staying with a safety razor or going with a shevette.  </li>
            <li>the Gold Dollar 208 is as good as any of them.  </li>
            <li>you will have to put in some time to hone a good edge on the blade.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to; the blade I got didn&#x27;t line up perfectly with the scales, and so would not close smoothly.</li>
            <li>Good PRACTICE razor - will move the lather off your face.</li>
            <li>The blade really does seem like a good quality, all for a great price!</li>
            <li>I find that it keeps an edge nicely</li>
            <li>and when I notice it tugging, I just use the strop for thirty to sixty strokes and that gets it nice and keen</li>
            <li>it also would have been nice to get some sort of tip sheet with the blade as i&#x27;ve never used this type of razor before.</li>
            <li>A week of using this to learn how not to off myself with a straight razor and this problem solved itself and it now glides perfectly into its appointed slot.</li>
            <li>It is nice to hold, the weight is just right for a nice clean downward stroke, and it also looks good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had occasion to acquire 4 more of these that I intended to give away.</li>
            <li>Some are better than others, but all in all, this is an inexpensive razor that has the feel of an inexpensive razor.</li>
            <li>This is a Gold Dollar 208 straight razor and is great for the price.  </li>
            <li>The scales are polycarbonite and are OK.</li>
            <li>Nothing more than a movie prop.  </li>
            <li>This was an outstanding purchase.  </li>
            <li>As others have mentioned- don&#x27;t expect good results right out of the box-</li>
            <li>I already have a very nice Dovo that is shave ready.</li>
            <li>18 2014&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong, glad I got this product.</li>
            <li>This may be an inexpensive straight razor, but it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>my standpoint, this blade is likely much better quality than what your great grandpa used to shave with so to me, it&#x27;s not a practice razor.  </li>
            <li>By far gold dollars are the best $20 straight razors you can buy.</li>
            <li>I would have to take a file, and many hours of my time to flatten  and true it, and</li>
            <li>If they actually make sure the shoulders and sides of the blade are trued, this would be the best value straight razor on the market.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can sharpen this when I feel confident enough to step it up makes this razor perfect for a novice like myself (I am in the process of moving up from a DE safety razor to straight razor).</li>
            <li>, if you are interested in entering the world of straight razors, this product is a great start.</li>
            <li>The razor is of very good quality for the price, scales are firm, solidly assembled, folds smoothly and the blade has very good balance.  </li>
            <li>All 4 of the new razors are not as good a quality as this one I acquired originally.</li>
            <li>scales are cheap but they protect the blade well.</li>
            <li>The shave went fairly smoothly</li>
            <li>I am overall happy with my investment.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Looks nice but not shave ready.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to put it on my face though, but I was able to put a really nice edge on it in about half and hour with a 8000 grit stone and now it shaves great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Good razor but not quite &#x27;shave ready&#x27; needs honing and fine tuning to make it ready for shaving</li>
            <li>Mine did need a significant amount of material removed to be usable.</li>
            <li>but in situations like that, you&#x27;re paying hundreds of dollars because a very talented smith personally labored for hours to hand produce a straight edge from a chunk of steel to your specifications.  </li>
            <li>This razor will never compare to a high end Dovo or Boker blade, but if you are looking for a good introductory blade, you can&#x27;t really beat this for the money.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>straight razor is great but do not forget you will need to sharpen it yourself or get it sharpened by someone unless you simply want to use it for practice.  </li>
            <li>c) survive the morning &#x27;fight with a wildebeast&#x27; with enough blood to want to keep doing it day in and day out and want the same or better quality blade - it really is a good blade - in good scales or lastly</li>
            <li>In situations like that, where you get a one of a kind custom piece, of a very high quality, I completely understand the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Edge will need polishing, but once sharpened it shaves smoothly and holds an edge very well.</li>
            <li>If you really master shaving with a straight razor, you&#x27;ll end up buying something nicer and being glad you did.</li>
            <li>Finally, 30/50 passes on the rough/smooth side of a leather strop to align the blade&#x27;s edge yielded a nice shave.</li>
            <li>I walked away with a good experience, albeit a nick from where I hit a rough patch under my jawline</li>
            <li>The blade sings nicely and has potential if I decide to have it honed.</li>
            <li>It is now extremely sharp and seems to hold a good edge.</li>
            <li>Those people who knock this razor as &amp;#34;not sharp enough&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t give a good shave are not reading the description.</li>
            <li>It comes sharpened so he could shave right away.</li>
            <li>The scales are basic plastic, but fine razors have had celluloid (plastic-like) composition for over 100 years and seem to hold up just fine.</li>
            <li>I have a collection of antique straight razors many of which were professionally honed and</li>
            <li>/&gt;The plastic scales are cheaply made, make sure you close your razor carefully</li>
            <li>first - how to sharpen carbon steel to shave use.  </li>
            <li>If you have to buy everything and start from scratch - it may take you the same or more time than it took me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it across the surface of our sharpening pad/stone, The weight of the tool is more than enough pressure, you just have to make sure its flat on both sides.</li>
            <li>I think this could have been a good razor,  but mine wasn&#x27;t ground properly and therefore couldn&#x27;t be honed enough to shave with.</li>
            <li>I cannot validate this claim, though they have a stellar reputation throughout the Phoenix/Tempe area and carry a large, and take note, pricy range of cutlery and their associated services.</li>
            <li>This was my first straight razor</li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t deserve to be under-rated.</li>
            <li>It stays nice and sharp, and it shaves as well as other razors that cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li>At the end, it&#x27;s about the metal and the metal on this razor is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>After it is sharpened, pretty much all you need is a decent strop unless you injure the edge which requires re-sharpening the blade.</li>
            <li>but at that point you&#x27;re paying for a luxury item in my mind, not so much quality.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve since acquired dozens of vintage straight razors since.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had bought a shave ready and</li>
            <li>The shave ready and</li>
            <li>expect to work for it or buy a shave ready razor.  </li>
            <li>recommended for ppl who want to learn how to put a shaving edge on a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I honed it on my Norton 220/1000/4000/8000 stones and it sharpened up really well.</li>
            <li>DO NOT EXPECT A SHAVE READY RAZOR,</li>
            <li>But for now, it is just what I wanted to practice the art of straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much at this price point</li>
            <li>and I got more than I expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to shave.</li>
            <li>Very cheep but took an edge well.</li>
            <li>something &#x27;shave ready&#x27;.</li>
            <li>you wish, purchase a few sharpening stones and learn to hone your own blade.</li>
            <li>couple of small gripes: The curved heel of the blade could have been ground better where it meets the bottom edge of the blade, but I do have to remember this razor was under $30!</li>
            <li>In the process I&#x27;ve learned enough about the subject to conclude that this is a good razor.</li>
            <li>That Is it, that is all you NORMALLY should have to do to sharpen a straight razor including this one.(Stropping is not considered sharpening, its considered \\&quot;honing\\&quot; or aligning the edge)</li>
            <li>you are flush and can afford it right now; b) you invest your time and energy getting this razor shave ready - and then the time and energy learning how to properly shave with a straight razor;</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the scales are kind of ugly, but you really can&#x27;t knock the blade its good sharp steel and it takes and holds an edge easily.  </li>
            <li>I compared this razor with the shave ready after I took it and had it sharpened by a professional in town.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor on a whim and was not expecting much, so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>If you are new to shaving with a straight razor, you will need to learn to hone your blade periodically, or you will have to pay someone else to do it for you professionally.</li>
            <li>The problem with mine is that the shoulder had a noticeable bump that i could feel by running my fingers over, The shoulders are always suppose to be flat, for the very reasons i describe above, you need that bare minim if you want to be able to sharpen  </li>
            <li>I bought a new Dovo Bismark 2, and I bought honing stones</li>
            <li>When you buy a straight razor you also need to buy a good strop (doesn&#x27;t need to be expensive)</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it okay for me to put a link on here to a youtube video</li>
            <li>It is a full hollow 5/8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Once it is sharpened, your ability to get a DFS (damn fine shave) will be limited only by your shaving</li>
            <li>Okay, took me awhile but finally got my razor SHARP!  </li>
            <li>: Took it to a honemeister who put a sweet, wicked sharp edge on it.</li>
            <li>you want to knock this razor, do so for reasons other than that you cannot read and understand the full description.</li>
            <li>This Razor has the potential to be the best value razor on the market, instead because of whoever was charged with flattening the shoulder decided to leave it far from flat, and the inner edge of the blade was sticking out to far so its Impossible to lay completely flat which means its not possible for 99% of the people attempting to sharpen this blade on their own.</li>
            <li>second - how to shave with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Blade so blunt it would not cut soft butter.  </li>
            <li>Wet shaving, and particular shaving with straight razors, has become a sort of hobby with me.</li>
            <li>the complaints by other people were that it was not sharp enough, I actually thought the shave ready was nice and sharp (cut myself three times while learning).</li>
            <li>Its well worth the price, this razor is a bargain considering how it compares to a lot of the other inexpensive razor type knives.</li>
            <li>Also, the factory edge was pretty rough and not honed very evenly enough across the blade.</li>
            <li>The blade is decent enough to justify the price, but don&#x27;t expect it to become a prized possession.</li>
            <li>It is a decent Chinese made product.</li>
            <li>the blade is good and sharp but the handle is no good</li>
            <li>Once I had it evened up, I cleaned up the opposite side just a little, and then progressed to a DMT Extra Extra Fine 8000 mesh diamond stone to polish the &#x27;new&#x27; edge from both sides of the blade.</li>
            <li>the blade isn&#x27;t sharp enough to shave with coming right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Wow, way above my expectations.</li>
            <li>With minimal honing it was ready to shave with and has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in my opinion still just learning to shave with a straight razor but am finding that getting a straight razor sharp is harder than one might think.  </li>
            <li>(It took a lot of passes to get it right, so I probably should have started with a  few passes on a 1200 grit stone to save some time before going to the 3000.)</li>
            <li>Its sharp but not shave ready, I had to sharpen it up to use it.</li>
            <li>What a huge, fat, clumsy blade!  </li>
            <li>So I had to make some practice and didn&#x27;t wont to practice on an expensive Dovo, so I had to by a cheap razor to practice, so after I&#x27;ve done honing and stropping ( took me an hour or so, well I&#x27;m new in this )</li>

            <li> I cannot validate this claim, though they have a stellar reputation throughout the Phoenix/Tempe area and carry a large, and take note, pricy range of cutlery and their associated services.</li>
            <li> This was my first straight razor</li>
            <li> but it certainly doesn&#x27;t deserve to be under-rated.</li>
            <li> It stays nice and sharp, and it shaves as well as other razors that cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li> At the end, it&#x27;s about the metal and the metal on this razor is very high quality.  </li>
            <li> After it is sharpened, pretty much all you need is a decent strop unless you injure the edge which requires re-sharpening the blade.</li>
            <li> but at that point you&#x27;re paying for a luxury item in my mind, not so much quality.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve since acquired dozens of vintage straight razors since.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had bought a shave ready and</li>
            <li> The shave ready and</li>
            <li> expect to work for it or buy a shave ready razor.  </li>
            <li> recommended for ppl who want to learn how to put a shaving edge on a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I honed it on my Norton 220/1000/4000/8000 stones and it sharpened up really well.</li>
            <li> DO NOT EXPECT A SHAVE READY RAZOR,</li>
            <li> But for now, it is just what I wanted to practice the art of straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much at this price point</li>
            <li> and I got more than I expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to shave.</li>
            <li> Very cheep but took an edge well.</li>
            <li> something &#x27;shave ready&#x27;.</li>
            <li> you wish, purchase a few sharpening stones and learn to hone your own blade.</li>
            <li> couple of small gripes: The curved heel of the blade could have been ground better where it meets the bottom edge of the blade, but I do have to remember this razor was under $30!</li>
            <li> In the process I&#x27;ve learned enough about the subject to conclude that this is a good razor.</li>
            <li> That Is it, that is all you NORMALLY should have to do to sharpen a straight razor including this one.(Stropping is not considered sharpening, its considered \\&quot;honing\\&quot; or aligning the edge)</li>
            <li> you are flush and can afford it right now; b) you invest your time and energy getting this razor shave ready - and then the time and energy learning how to properly shave with a straight razor;</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the scales are kind of ugly, but you really can&#x27;t knock the blade its good sharp steel and it takes and holds an edge easily.  </li>
            <li> I compared this razor with the shave ready after I took it and had it sharpened by a professional in town.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor on a whim and was not expecting much, so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> If you are new to shaving with a straight razor, you will need to learn to hone your blade periodically, or you will have to pay someone else to do it for you professionally.</li>
            <li> The problem with mine is that the shoulder had a noticeable bump that i could feel by running my fingers over, The shoulders are always suppose to be flat, for the very reasons i describe above, you need that bare minim if you want to be able to sharpen  </li>
            <li> I bought a new Dovo Bismark 2, and I bought honing stones</li>
            <li> When you buy a straight razor you also need to buy a good strop (doesn&#x27;t need to be expensive)</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it okay for me to put a link on here to a youtube video</li>
            <li> It is a full hollow 5/8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Once it is sharpened, your ability to get a DFS (damn fine shave) will be limited only by your shaving</li>
            <li> Okay, took me awhile but finally got my razor SHARP!  </li>
            <li> : Took it to a honemeister who put a sweet, wicked sharp edge on it.</li>
            <li> you want to knock this razor, do so for reasons other than that you cannot read and understand the full description.</li>
            <li> This Razor has the potential to be the best value razor on the market, instead because of whoever was charged with flattening the shoulder decided to leave it far from flat, and the inner edge of the blade was sticking out to far so its Impossible to lay completely flat which means its not possible for 99% of the people attempting to sharpen this blade on their own.</li>
            <li> second - how to shave with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Blade so blunt it would not cut soft butter.  </li>
            <li> Wet shaving, and particular shaving with straight razors, has become a sort of hobby with me.</li>
            <li> the complaints by other people were that it was not sharp enough, I actually thought the shave ready was nice and sharp (cut myself three times while learning).</li>
            <li> Its well worth the price, this razor is a bargain considering how it compares to a lot of the other inexpensive razor type knives.</li>
            <li> Also, the factory edge was pretty rough and not honed very evenly enough across the blade.</li>
            <li> The blade is decent enough to justify the price, but don&#x27;t expect it to become a prized possession.</li>
            <li> It is a decent Chinese made product.</li>
            <li> the blade is good and sharp but the handle is no good</li>
            <li> Once I had it evened up, I cleaned up the opposite side just a little, and then progressed to a DMT Extra Extra Fine 8000 mesh diamond stone to polish the &#x27;new&#x27; edge from both sides of the blade.</li>
            <li> the blade isn&#x27;t sharp enough to shave with coming right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Wow, way above my expectations.</li>
            <li> With minimal honing it was ready to shave with and has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my opinion still just learning to shave with a straight razor but am finding that getting a straight razor sharp is harder than one might think.  </li>
            <li> (It took a lot of passes to get it right, so I probably should have started with a  few passes on a 1200 grit stone to save some time before going to the 3000.)</li>
            <li> Its sharp but not shave ready, I had to sharpen it up to use it.</li>
            <li> What a huge, fat, clumsy blade!  </li>
            <li> So I had to make some practice and didn&#x27;t wont to practice on an expensive Dovo, so I had to by a cheap razor to practice, so after I&#x27;ve done honing and stropping ( took me an hour or so, well I&#x27;m new in this )</li>
            <li> One side of the blade&#x27;s edge was honed slightly higher than the other, so I started out with a 3000 grit Japanese whetstone to even it up a little.</li>
            <li> If you want a razor that is shave ready don&#x27;t buy one that says it is &amp;#34;not shave ready.&amp;#34; It also says &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; in the headline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to straight razor shaving and I bought this razor for one thing -- to practice without cutting my throat.</li>
            <li> You will need several varying grits of whetstones that will add some initial expense to your shaving costs, but will save you money in the long term over paying others to sharpen your blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was sticking out causing my blade to not bet truly flat when i was sharpening it,</li>
            <li> If you have honed a chisel by hand properly - it won&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> this razor shaves like any other expensive straight razor, ok I understand that the scale is cheap, but does not look bad at all, and thinking on the price $20.00</li>
            <li> The hollow ground blade has the correct geometry and it is properly pinned in the scales.</li>
            <li> Still a long way to go before it will have a edge you can shave with.</li>
            <li> it is flimsy and it trys to open when it is closed</li>
            <li> I ordered one and it arrived sharp enough to shave hair on my arm.  </li>
            <li> blade is not enough to sharp for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He told me when I brought it in that these were the only Chinese-made blades that they would touch, as others are not worth their time.</li>
            <li> most likely i would just make it worse, much worse.</li>
            <li> As it was a minor wobble, i didn&#x27;t notice the blade wast completely flat and wasted a tone of my time trying to sharpen this thing.</li>
            <li> i tried four different places that said they could sharpen a straight razor and each one failed to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> The scales don&#x27;t line up, they squeak, and blade on some hits the side as the razor is closed.</li>
            <li> Minus one star for having a crack on the edge.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not ready to use it.</li>
            <li> Spent three hours honing.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this razor but for 15$ I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Also, its heavier in your hand than a lot of other razors which I like.  </li>
            <li> He has given it many tries but it is totally worthless.</li>
            <li> I took this paper sharp blade and made it truly razor sharp in less than three hours -</li>
            <li> Other than the bad workmanship i described and the cheap handles.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I really appreciate the workmanship and hours of labor that goes into some handcrafted works-of-art out there</li>
            <li> but once you hone it using a few wet stones, 1,000 grit, 6,000 grit, and 8000-12000 grit, and a leather strop, you wind up with a keen edge that will literally cut the hairs off your face.  </li>
            <li> Also i didn&#x27;t notice another spot were they didn&#x27;t file down the metal</li>
            <li> This is truly a &amp;#34;Practice&amp;#34; razor, you will want a primo razor on down the road if a)</li>
            <li> I just got my shevette and it is sharp!  </li>
            <li> though the handle is a little cheap-y, some honing and</li>
            <li> If you used a chisel edge guide, it will take you a little longer to get the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing.</li>
            <li> Sharpening Straight razors are practically idiot proof now a days, if you just lay the blade completely flat from the shoulder to the edge, then you have your sharpening angle already.</li>
            <li> It was not good item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not happy,  after being honed Tbis razor still shaved like a used disposable  razir.</li>
            <li> Very bad .. does not remove hair never.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!</li>

            <li> This Razor has the potential to be the best value razor on the market, instead because of whoever was charged with flattening the shoulder decided to leave it far from flat, and the inner edge of the blade was sticking out to far so its Impossible to lay completely flat which means its not possible for 99% of the people attempting to sharpen this blade on their own. Sharpening Straight razors are practically idiot proof now a days, if you just lay the blade completely flat from the shoulder to the edge, then you have your sharpening angle already. You just need to (without pressing into it at all) it across the surface of our sharpening pad/stone, The weight of the tool is more than enough pressure, you just have to make sure its flat on both sides. That Is it, that is all you NORMALLY should have to do to sharpen a straight razor including this one.(Stropping is not considered sharpening, its considered \\&quot;honing\\&quot; or aligning the edge) The problem with mine is that the shoulder had a noticeable bump that i could feel by running my fingers over, The shoulders are always suppose to be flat, for the very reasons i describe above, you need that bare minim if you want to be able to sharpen  I would have to take a file, and many hours of my time to flatten  and true it, and most likely i would just make it worse, much worse. Also i didn&#x27;t notice another spot were they didn&#x27;t file down the metal and it was sticking out causing my blade to not bet truly flat when i was sharpening it, As it was a minor wobble, i didn&#x27;t notice the blade wast completely flat and wasted a tone of my time trying to sharpen this thing. Other than the bad workmanship i described and the cheap handles. this is a good peace of metal for the price. If they actually make sure the shoulders and sides of the blade are trued, this would be the best value straight razor on the market.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider this a practice razor.  It&#x27;s a nice, high quality product.  It does not come sharpened but once you hone it using a few wet stones, 1,000 grit, 6,000 grit, and 8000-12000 grit, and a leather strop, you wind up with a keen edge that will literally cut the hairs off your face.  I find that it keeps an edge nicely and when I notice it tugging, I just use the strop for thirty to sixty strokes and that gets it nice and keen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can buy a $300 or $600 blade but at that point you&#x27;re paying for a luxury item in my mind, not so much quality. At the end, it&#x27;s about the metal and the metal on this razor is very high quality.  I do, personally, have issues paying exorbitant amounts of money to pay for essentially the same product produced in the same manner as this razor -- it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me but if it does to you, go for it.  Luxury items are luxury items. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I really appreciate the workmanship and hours of labor that goes into some handcrafted works-of-art out there but in situations like that, you&#x27;re paying hundreds of dollars because a very talented smith personally labored for hours to hand produce a straight edge from a chunk of steel to your specifications.  In situations like that, where you get a one of a kind custom piece, of a very high quality, I completely understand the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my standpoint, this blade is likely much better quality than what your great grandpa used to shave with so to me, it&#x27;s not a practice razor.  Get it. Sharpen it.  Use it with pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scales are cheap but they protect the blade well.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving, and particular shaving with straight razors, has become a sort of hobby with me. This was my first straight razor and I&#x27;ve since acquired dozens of vintage straight razors since. In the process I&#x27;ve learned enough about the subject to conclude that this is a good razor. At $18 it is a very very good deal. You will have to sharpen it which requires a proper hone stone and the skill to use it. After it is sharpened, pretty much all you need is a decent strop unless you injure the edge which requires re-sharpening the blade. The hollow ground blade has the correct geometry and it is properly pinned in the scales. The scales are basic plastic, but fine razors have had celluloid (plastic-like) composition for over 100 years and seem to hold up just fine. The weight and size of the blade make it a pleasure to use. Once it is sharpened, your ability to get a DFS (damn fine shave) will be limited only by your shaving technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It is now 6 months later and I&#x27;ve had occasion to acquire 4 more of these that I intended to give away. All 4 of the new razors are not as good a quality as this one I acquired originally. The scales don&#x27;t line up, they squeak, and blade on some hits the side as the razor is closed. Some are better than others, but all in all, this is an inexpensive razor that has the feel of an inexpensive razor. The blade is decent enough to justify the price, but don&#x27;t expect it to become a prized possession. If you really master shaving with a straight razor, you&#x27;ll end up buying something nicer and being glad you did. Maybe that&#x27;s why some reviewers call this a &amp;#34;beginner&#x27;s razor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> update (4-17-2017)&lt;br /&gt;  Okay, took me awhile but finally got my razor SHARP!  This is a great razor BUT you need to know how to sharpen it.  i tried four different places that said they could sharpen a straight razor and each one failed to finish the job.  When you buy a straight razor you also need to buy a good strop (doesn&#x27;t need to be expensive) if your just starting out don&#x27;t buy an expensive one because I am fairly sure you will end up putting nicks in it while your learning. Also buy a honing paste, believe me, it is needed. Point 25 micron. I am not sure if it okay for me to put a link on here to a youtube video so I will not do so.  I will try to update this with a description of how to do it or ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing below was from 2015 when I bought this razor.&lt;br /&gt;  I am in my opinion still just learning to shave with a straight razor but am finding that getting a straight razor sharp is harder than one might think.  Unless you know a good place to get it sharpened or know how to I would suggest staying with a safety razor or going with a shevette.  I just got my shevette and it is sharp!  My issue is I still have to deal with replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straight razor is great but do not forget you will need to sharpen it yourself or get it sharpened by someone unless you simply want to use it for practice.  This is a Gold Dollar 208 straight razor and is great for the price.  I bought this because I had bought a shave ready and the complaints by other people were that it was not sharp enough, I actually thought the shave ready was nice and sharp (cut myself three times while learning). I compared this razor with the shave ready after I took it and had it sharpened by a professional in town.  The shave ready and this one after it was sharpened (15 dollars) shave about the same.</li>
            <li> the blade isn&#x27;t sharp enough to shave with coming right out of the box. it also would have been nice to get some sort of tip sheet with the blade as i&#x27;ve never used this type of razor before. I had to end up buying a leather strip for the blade.</li>
            <li> this is a DIY razor.  you will need to put an edge on it and you will need to do it proper.  expect to work for it or buy a shave ready razor.  recommended for ppl who want to learn how to put a shaving edge on a straight razor.  (instructions for doing so are not included as that is a matter of preference and equipment)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am giving this item 5 stars because owning it invited me to learn 2 things.  first - how to sharpen carbon steel to shave use.  second - how to shave with a straight razor.  both took time and patience.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this razor but for 15$ I was willing to give it a try.  Out of the box it is a razor shaped chunk of metal.  I honed it on my Norton 220/1000/4000/8000 stones and it sharpened up really well. Mine did need a significant amount of material removed to be usable. Minus one star for having a crack on the edge.  If you are looking for something that will be a great entry level shaver and are not afraid to hone it yourself, this is the best value on the market.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it! It comes sharpened so he could shave right away. It looks sleek while still having a plastic handle. The blade really does seem like a good quality, all for a great price!</li>
            <li> Very bad .. does not remove hair never.</li>
            <li> I ordered one and it arrived sharp enough to shave hair on my arm.  I wasn&#x27;t quite ready to put it on my face though, but I was able to put a really nice edge on it in about half and hour with a 8000 grit stone and now it shaves great.  It stays nice and sharp, and it shaves as well as other razors that cost a lot more.  I have a collection of antique straight razors many of which were professionally honed and the Gold Dollar 208 is as good as any of them.  Also, its heavier in your hand than a lot of other razors which I like.  The only drawback is that the scales are kind of ugly, but you really can&#x27;t knock the blade its good sharp steel and it takes and holds an edge easily.  Its well worth the price, this razor is a bargain considering how it compares to a lot of the other inexpensive razor type knives.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Dovo Bismark 2, and I bought honing stones Norton 220/1000 4000/8000 Naniwa 12000 lapping stone. So I had to make some practice and didn&#x27;t wont to practice on an expensive Dovo, so I had to by a cheap razor to practice, so after I&#x27;ve done honing and stropping ( took me an hour or so, well I&#x27;m new in this ) did a shave test, oh man this razor shaves like any other expensive straight razor, ok I understand that the scale is cheap, but does not look bad at all, and thinking on the price $20.00 let me tell you guys to me it&#x27;s an excellent buy, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 18 2014&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong, glad I got this product.</li>
            <li> Its sharp but not shave ready, I had to sharpen it up to use it.</li>
            <li> It was not good item.&lt;br /&gt;So It did not work.&lt;br /&gt;This blade is not enough to sharp for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor on a whim and was not expecting much, so I was pleasantly surprised. This may be an inexpensive straight razor, but it works surprisingly well. As others have mentioned- don&#x27;t expect good results right out of the box- you will have to put in some time to hone a good edge on the blade. But once you have done this- it works quite well. This razor will never compare to a high end Dovo or Boker blade, but if you are looking for a good introductory blade, you can&#x27;t really beat this for the money. If you are new to shaving with a straight razor, you will need to learn to hone your blade periodically, or you will have to pay someone else to do it for you professionally. You will need several varying grits of whetstones that will add some initial expense to your shaving costs, but will save you money in the long term over paying others to sharpen your blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of small gripes: The curved heel of the blade could have been ground better where it meets the bottom edge of the blade, but I do have to remember this razor was under $30! Also, the factory edge was pretty rough and not honed very evenly enough across the blade. One side of the blade&#x27;s edge was honed slightly higher than the other, so I started out with a 3000 grit Japanese whetstone to even it up a little. (It took a lot of passes to get it right, so I probably should have started with a  few passes on a 1200 grit stone to save some time before going to the 3000.) Once I had it evened up, I cleaned up the opposite side just a little, and then progressed to a DMT Extra Extra Fine 8000 mesh diamond stone to polish the &#x27;new&#x27; edge from both sides of the blade. Finally, 30/50 passes on the rough/smooth side of a leather strop to align the blade&#x27;s edge yielded a nice shave. It is now extremely sharp and seems to hold a good edge.</li>
            <li> Read: PRACTICE RAZOR. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to; the blade I got didn&#x27;t line up perfectly with the scales, and so would not close smoothly. A week of using this to learn how not to off myself with a straight razor and this problem solved itself and it now glides perfectly into its appointed slot. The fact that I can sharpen this when I feel confident enough to step it up makes this razor perfect for a novice like myself (I am in the process of moving up from a DE safety razor to straight razor). DO NOT EXPECT A SHAVE READY RAZOR, AS THIS IS NOT IT&#x27;S INTENDED PURPOSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Took it to a honemeister who put a sweet, wicked sharp edge on it. He told me when I brought it in that these were the only Chinese-made blades that they would touch, as others are not worth their time. I cannot validate this claim, though they have a stellar reputation throughout the Phoenix/Tempe area and carry a large, and take note, pricy range of cutlery and their associated services. The shave went fairly smoothly (perhaps practice does make perfect)and I walked away with a good experience, albeit a nick from where I hit a rough patch under my jawline (still haven&#x27;t mastered that one I guess)so I am overall happy with my investment. Can definitely recommend as a starter blade.</li>
            <li> Those people who knock this razor as &amp;#34;not sharp enough&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t give a good shave are not reading the description. If you want a razor that is shave ready don&#x27;t buy one that says it is &amp;#34;not shave ready.&amp;#34; It also says &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; in the headline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to straight razor shaving and I bought this razor for one thing -- to practice without cutting my throat. It is just what I wanted. The scales are polycarbonite and are OK. The blade sings nicely and has potential if I decide to have it honed. But for now, it is just what I wanted to practice the art of straight razor shaving. It is a decent Chinese made product. I already have a very nice Dovo that is shave ready. But I&#x27;m not ready to use it. Hence this razor will help me prepare to use the Dovo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are interested in entering the world of straight razors, this product is a great start. It is nice to hold, the weight is just right for a nice clean downward stroke, and it also looks good. It is a full hollow 5/8&amp;#34; blade. I didn&#x27;t expect much at this price point and I got more than I expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to knock this razor, do so for reasons other than that you cannot read and understand the full description. I cannot give it 5 stars but it certainly doesn&#x27;t deserve to be under-rated.</li>
            <li> Good razor but not quite &#x27;shave ready&#x27; needs honing and fine tuning to make it ready for shaving</li>
            <li> Nothing more than a movie prop.  Blade so blunt it would not cut soft butter.  Spent three hours honing.  Still a long way to go before it will have a edge you can shave with.</li>
            <li> Wow, way above my expectations. though the handle is a little cheap-y, some honing and it&#x27;s sharper than my disposal razor-blades. By far gold dollars are the best $20 straight razors you can buy.</li>
            <li> the blade is good and sharp but the handle is no good it is flimsy and it trys to open when it is closed</li>
            <li> If you can get a good stone to hone this razor followed by a good stropping, this is the best razor out there for the money. 10 minutes of prep work and you&#x27;re ready to shave. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> This was an outstanding purchase.  The razor is of very good quality for the price, scales are firm, solidly assembled, folds smoothly and the blade has very good balance.  With minimal honing it was ready to shave with and has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;The razor arrived before the estimated shipping date.</li>
            <li> Looks nice but not shave ready. it needs to be sharpened. Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I think this could have been a good razor,  but mine wasn&#x27;t ground properly and therefore couldn&#x27;t be honed enough to shave with.</li>
            <li> What a huge, fat, clumsy blade!  Nowhere on the razor or its packaging does it indicate where it was manufactured.  I&#x27;d guess Pakistan or India.  It has that &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; look to it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing.</li>
            <li> Very cheep but took an edge well.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever! My husband has sharpened it  but it still doesn&#x27;t  work. He  has to go over the same spot many times and it still leaves hair behind! He has given it many tries but it is totally worthless. This was a complete waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Good PRACTICE razor - will move the lather off your face. Then you shave with a safety razor or a metro-sexual mega-blade environmental nightmare or even an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wish, purchase a few sharpening stones and learn to hone your own blade. I took this paper sharp blade and made it truly razor sharp in less than three hours - but then I had to learn the process, I didn&#x27;t start out knowing how to get something &#x27;shave ready&#x27;. If you have honed a chisel by hand properly - it won&#x27;t take long. If you used a chisel edge guide, it will take you a little longer to get the feel of it. If you have to buy everything and start from scratch - it may take you the same or more time than it took me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic scales are cheaply made, make sure you close your razor carefully or you&#x27;ll dig the blade into the plastic time and again. This is truly a &amp;#34;Practice&amp;#34; razor, you will want a primo razor on down the road if a) you are flush and can afford it right now; b) you invest your time and energy getting this razor shave ready - and then the time and energy learning how to properly shave with a straight razor; c) survive the morning &#x27;fight with a wildebeast&#x27; with enough blood to want to keep doing it day in and day out and want the same or better quality blade - it really is a good blade - in good scales or lastly; d) you look online and find how to replace your scales yourself. This can be a quality hand razor if you invest your time!</li>
            <li> Best for the money, no question. Edge will need polishing, but once sharpened it shaves smoothly and holds an edge very well. Plastic handles are sufficiently useable but are still only plastic.</li>
