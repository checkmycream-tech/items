            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>Well it was the BEST hair clip thingy that i ever used!</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ll try to make the best of them.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>The Hair clips are great.</li>
            <li>I am 100% happy with this product</li>
            <li>These are not as great as the Goody combs were, but they&#x27;re as close as you can get.</li>
            <li>and so happy</li>
            <li>The tip of each comb has a good hook to lock and hold.</li>
            <li>Good grip, holds hair well</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>These hair clips are beautiful - and have an innate flexibility that makes them easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love these combs!</li>
            <li>So happy to have found them - they used to be easy to find in the 80&#x27;s but disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I have missed being able to have these since they are no longet in stores.  </li>
            <li>These are much better.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>I have searched for these combs for more than a year</li>
            <li>I use these at night to give my hair more volume, a trick my mom taught me.</li>
            <li>Love them going to order more.</li>
            <li>Since they were located on Amazon and purchased, she has never been so pleased.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE them.  </li>
            <li>Now, considering that sooo long ago I paid $7...the price is very fair buying the 3 pack set!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a caramel or light brown color.</li>
            <li>Plus they are easy on your hair.  </li>
            <li>and I hope that they will continue to be available.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I tried so many others at less cost &amp; they all were cheap imitations that loosened &amp; didn&#x27;t hold!  </li>
            <li>just as described and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The closest I&#x27;ve found to the original soft, flexible comb of the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>These combs are very similar to the Goody&#x27;s combs that were so popular in the 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment - they are worth paying a little more.</li>
            <li>my wife has been searching for large comb like these for months, at stores where we live without success.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast the order arrived.  </li>
            <li>and I use them so much I wear out the interlocking part.  </li>
            <li>very strenous with alot of jumping about.</li>
            <li>I wish they were a tiny bit stronger, the teeth bend pretty quickly</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t know what the original was like, I would give this a 5 in comparison to others currently on the market.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine - and for those of us with fine thin hair - the dilemma is that hair clips just slip out of our hair no matter what we do.  </li>
            <li>the larget ones you can start at the back under your hair bring it up evenly to the crown area and interlock them, gives hair a full, fall appearence.</li>
            <li>The main thing I didn&#x27;t like was the color.</li>
            <li>Not the cheap plastic like all the other ones.</li>
            <li>then but I needed to put my hair back as it was hot..</li>
            <li>The combs fit together and stick somehow and DON&#x27;T pull apart like ALL the Other ones like this do!  </li>
            <li>and I need to replace them frequently.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>They worked like all the old ones I had, way back in the day.</li>
            <li>my hair is fine, thin, and thinning.</li>
            <li>these are the only combs that work for my hair......very thin and fine.  </li>

            <li> I was amazed at how fast the order arrived.  Ordered on Saturday and the box was here on Tuesday!  The Hair clips are great. Shaped just a tiny bit different than Goody&#x27;s made them, but the held my thick hair tight, no slip and my hair was finaly back to one of my fevorite styles, cooler in hot humid weather in Alabama.  The color blended in with my brown hair.  Stayed in place through out my day.  I have missed being able to have these since they are no longet in stores.  My last pair was Goody&#x27;s brand from 2003 and I use them so much I wear out the interlocking part.  The other brand I can no longer find is called Tzers by Newport Beach.      I am 100% happy with this product and I hope that they will continue to be available.  I bought two sets...but I will misplace them or wear them out sooner or later!  I have thick hair that is layered.  I love these combs!</li>
            <li> These combs are very similar to the Goody&#x27;s combs that were so popular in the 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s. The tip of each comb has a good hook to lock and hold. They will hold up thick hair all day, thin hair too. The main thing I didn&#x27;t like was the color. I expected dark brown but it&#x27;s more of a caramel or light brown color. These are not as great as the Goody combs were, but they&#x27;re as close as you can get. I bought identical looking combs by \\&quot;Karina\\&quot;. They would not lock and hold because the tips were only slightly curved. These are much better.</li>
            <li> Fits snug and I have thin hair.  Love them.  Gave one to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Good grip, holds hair well</li>
            <li> Awesome. Exactly what I expected. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have had a pair in 2 sizes for over 30 years. about 6 in long and 3-4 in long. my hair is fine, thin, and thinning. these stay put,I use the smaller ones as holders for a pony tail. hair does not slip,I even forgot and slept in them once,they stayed put. the larget ones you can start at the back under your hair bring it up evenly to the crown area and interlock them, gives hair a full, fall appearence. some ndn men even wear them in their hair to dance at pow wows. very strenous with alot of jumping about.</li>
            <li> Maybe 15 years ago I bought one of these at the International Hair SHow in NJ. It was  $7. then but I needed to put my hair back as it was hot..Well it was the BEST hair clip thingy that i ever used! The combs fit together and stick somehow and DON&#x27;T pull apart like ALL the Other ones like this do!  I have been looking for this name &amp;#34;HAIR RAISER&amp;#34; for years because I had lost one! (Name is imprinted on inside of comb)  I tried so many others at less cost &amp; they all were cheap imitations that loosened &amp; didn&#x27;t hold!  Now, considering that sooo long ago I paid $7...the price is very fair buying the 3 pack set! You WON&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have searched for these combs for more than a year and so happy I found their site. just as described and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The closest I&#x27;ve found to the original soft, flexible comb of the 80&#x27;s.  If I didn&#x27;t know what the original was like, I would give this a 5 in comparison to others currently on the market.  Vendor gets an A+!!!!</li>
            <li> Not the cheap plastic like all the other ones. I use these at night to give my hair more volume, a trick my mom taught me. They worked like all the old ones I had, way back in the day. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for a long time. Love them going to order more.</li>
            <li> my wife has been searching for large comb like these for months, at stores where we live without success. Since they were located on Amazon and purchased, she has never been so pleased. Thank You</li>
            <li> These combs held my hair in place and the stayed put! They did not slide around or slip off! I recommend these.</li>
            <li> Box was opened,when received it.</li>
            <li> I use these to replace the combs on some hairpieces I use...I sew them on.  (Then teeth bend out of shape and need replacement ).  I wish they were a tiny bit stronger, the teeth bend pretty quickly and I need to replace them frequently.</li>
            <li> they were a bit larger than i expected. but i&#x27;ll try to make the best of them. they were a little smaller than the last ones I tried on ebay.</li>
            <li> these are the only combs that work for my hair......very thin and fine.  I&#x27;ve used them for- probably 30 years.  I was so grateful to have found them on your site because they are no longer in stores.  I just LOVE them.  thank you.</li>
            <li> These hair clips are beautiful - and have an innate flexibility that makes them easy to use.  Plus they are easy on your hair.  My hair is very fine - and for those of us with fine thin hair - the dilemma is that hair clips just slip out of our hair no matter what we do.  These work - and my hair stays up for hours.  Other clips I have tried are stiffer....and can be tough on fine hair.  So happy to have found them - they used to be easy to find in the 80&#x27;s but disappeared.  And the brush included is terrific too.  Definitely worth the investment - they are worth paying a little more.</li>
            <li> These are well made out of a flexible plastic.  The teeth don&#x27;t break off like other brands and hold even the finest hair!  Excellent product.</li>
