            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Like soap more than flowers or powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the performance.</li>
            <li>So many deodorants I find have gag-inducing scents.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>:  Works great...very strong (and I recommend using after wiping underarms with rubbing alcohol--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had others give me irritation, and they all have a fairly strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>one is light and woodsy.  </li>
            <li>I may be able to use this twice a week and use my more natural deodorant the rest of the time.</li>
            <li>stopped using clinical for a while after an adverse reaction to another brand, and it was clear how effective these types are.</li>
            <li>This is a great light deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.</li>
            <li>Product works great, but I prefer the other scents over \\&quot;Marathon.\\</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean, but not flowery.</li>
            <li>I workout everyday and this product is great</li>
            <li>Fast and secure shipment.</li>
            <li>I prefer the powder fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers find it more masculine, and for me, that is what makes me buy it.  </li>
            <li>Works very, very well, all day, and through workouts.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>was looking for A DEODORANT that would work tried many others and this is the only one that helped with odor</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll pick it up at the drugstore for sure.</li>
            <li>Amazon price better than local stores, as well</li>
            <li>Beats anything &#x60;iIve ever used and iIve used pretty much every brand.</li>
            <li>Product is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The only deodorant that works for me pretty much</li>
            <li>They only deoderant that keeps me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I opted to try the sport scent just because I wanted something new.....</li>
            <li>This product works better than any other product I have used, and it&#x27;s the only one I buy.</li>
            <li>It smells like men&#x27;s old spice deodorant.</li>
            <li>This one works a little better than the others and the scent is fresh without being cloying or irritating.  </li>
            <li>The hard to turn &#x27;dial&#x27; is already a third of the way up the container when you open it, and you have to turn it up more (halfway up the container now) to get anything out.</li>
            <li>The Sport scent is still my favorite of the Secret scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>always buy some variation of Secret clinical strength because it&#x27;s the only deodorant that actually lasts effectively all day when I&#x27;m sweating.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s icky.</li>
            <li> than the icky smell, it does work well.</li>
            <li> Just because I do sports doesn&#x27;t mean I need to smell like a guy.</li>
            <li> Way to perpetuate a really outdated stereotype, Secret!</li>
            <li> Icky!!    </li>
            <li> Probably one of the worst female deodorant scents I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Sorry, baby powder is not an acceptable scent for a 30-something woman!  </li>
            <li> I feel like i&#x27;m getting ripped off. :(    </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am trying to get away from using aluminum containing deodorant but I was starting to stink sometimes....so, I tried this. Applied in the morning, and the next day in the shower I can still feel that dry effect antiperspirant usually leaves behind until you soap.....but this was after I soaped, three times! Very strong. I may be able to use this twice a week and use my more natural deodorant the rest of the time. Gonna try it anyway.</li>
            <li> The Sport scent is still my favorite of the Secret scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always buy some variation of Secret clinical strength because it&#x27;s the only deodorant that actually lasts effectively all day when I&#x27;m sweating. It will actually last a few days if I&#x27;m not very active. It leaves a &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; to my underarm area which can be felt when I&#x27;m soaping up in the shower, which makes me a bit uneasy - but it&#x27;s still better than stinky pits!</li>
            <li> Product works great, but I prefer the other scents over \\&quot;Marathon.\\&quot; This product is supposed to be for women, but makes you smell like you&#x27;re wearing men&#x27;s cologne. Icky!!    Also, they don&#x27;t put enough product in the container. The hard to turn &#x27;dial&#x27; is already a third of the way up the container when you open it, and you have to turn it up more (halfway up the container now) to get anything out. I feel like i&#x27;m getting ripped off. :(    Pros:  Works great...very strong (and I recommend using after wiping underarms with rubbing alcohol--makes it more effective)    Cons:  Makes you smell like a dude  Not enough product in the container  Dial is hard to turn</li>
            <li> Very good deal for the product!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well, but it seriously made me smell like a self-conscious teenage boy who was trying to mask his insecurities with gallons of Axe Body Spray. I prefer the powder fresh scent. Just because I do sports doesn&#x27;t mean I need to smell like a guy. :/ Way to perpetuate a really outdated stereotype, Secret!</li>

            <li> was looking for A DEODORANT that would work tried many others and this is the only one that helped with odor</li>
            <li> This does not work at all. Not if you have excessive perspiration.   I recommend Maxim.  Try it out. You&#x27;ll thank me.  &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a clinical deodorant for about a year. This one is my favorite. I&#x27;ve had others give me irritation, and they all have a fairly strong fragrance. This one works a little better than the others and the scent is fresh without being cloying or irritating.  Like soap more than flowers or powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using clinical for a while after an adverse reaction to another brand, and it was clear how effective these types are.</li>
            <li> This is a great light deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave a mess. Product is reasonably priced. Fast and secure shipment. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it. I love this deodorant in other scents but this marathon scent is AWFUL! My sweat mixed with the smell was so bad I had to stop using it &amp; go back to the lavender smell. The deodorant might work but the smell....yuck.</li>
            <li> finally found an underarm deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave white marks. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I love the product but the shipping was stupid!! Next time I&#x27;ll pick it up at the drugstore for sure.</li>
            <li> kinda greasy til it dries</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Allergy doctor advised caution with use of some products but this one gets a big heads up. Works very, very well, all day, and through workouts. Beats anything &#x60;iIve ever used and iIve used pretty much every brand. Stopped with this one...a keeper! Amazon price better than local stores, as well</li>
            <li> Good stuff, works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that works for me pretty much</li>
            <li> Try it and you will be hooked</li>
            <li> I had used Secret Clinical strength deodorants in the past and really liked them. I opted to try the sport scent just because I wanted something new.....it&#x27;s icky. Probably one of the worst female deodorant scents I&#x27;ve ever bought. It smells like men&#x27;s old spice deodorant. I&#x27;m embarrassed to use it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the icky smell, it does work well. I would and will buy this brand again, just not this flavor.</li>
            <li> It really last even when I am on duty and beacuse all the work I can take a shoer during the day it never dissapoint me LOL</li>
            <li> They only deoderant that keeps me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> This product works better than any other product I have used, and it&#x27;s the only one I buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that does not contain aluminum and still works well as a long lasting deodorant. This one does the job! I&#x27;m a woman, and disagree with the previous reviewer who said the product smells like a mans deodorant. It smells fresh and clean, but not flowery. If you are looking for something that smells like baby powder or flowers this one is not for you. I love the scent and the performance. I can work out hard and not have to worry about my deodorant failing me.</li>
            <li> So many deodorants I find have gag-inducing scents.  Sorry, baby powder is not an acceptable scent for a 30-something woman!  Overpowering flowers?  No thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is light and woodsy.  Some reviewers find it more masculine, and for me, that is what makes me buy it.  Each to their own, but it is the best smelling ladies&#x27; deodorant I&#x27;ve ever found!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant. I even find myself smelling my own armpits sometimes because it smells so good.</li>
