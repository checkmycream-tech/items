            <li>This soap seems to leave your face softer and moistened after using, though the scent isn&#x27;t the best.</li>

            <li>This neem face wash is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have really liked this wash</li>
            <li>nice but leaked out in package</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and rejuvenated and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>soap dispenses into a very light and not-so-sudsy foam</li>
            <li>In fairness, its also safe to say that most of the fragrances we find in cosmetics aren&#x27;t necessarily good for our skin, so that this one is milder (more natural) is great for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>They try to decieve like so many.</li>
            <li>And I love the fragrance  </li>

            <li>Shipping was pretty good, came in about 5 days after I ordered.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, light lemony scent.</li>
            <li>Works very well but not as good as gel.</li>
            <li>She uses this first and then her FAVORITE PRODUCT &amp;#34;Neem Magic&amp;#34; sold by Passport to Organics!  </li>
            <li>Love this product removes all makeup quickly and easily..</li>

            <li>This is great for cleansing oily skin especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Great product here to have and use daily in a regimen.</li>
            <li>I put together the #3rd product before time, so I can always have it in the fridge ready to be used as my neem toner that I found on a website &amp; it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This truly does clean without feeling like the skin is stripped.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a clean feeling face but ended up with clogged pores instead.</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel clean</li>
            <li>a full list of these ingredients can be found on acne.org.</li>
            <li>Nice face wash, clean smell, and does not dry out your skin when you use it.</li>
            <li>Overall, after one bottle we decided to not get more, but extended use would probably yield better results.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Many of the natural companies still use synthetic fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have always battled with a super oily t-zone, the face wash has helped so much!</li>
            <li>Pleasant smelling foamy facial cleanser that does not dry my skin out, but still leaves me feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Seems a bit watered down but still best facial cleanser on market compared to others.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this Neem Foaming Face Wash and we have completely different skin types.</li>
            <li>Just be aware of what you are putting on your skin and make an educated decision.</li>
            <li>;)</li>

            <li>My face really feels super clean without being overly dry.  </li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, softer and looks much smoother.</li>
            <li>Coastal Scents Neem Oil, 16.90 Fluid Ounce Price: $12.95 Eligible for free shipping with Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It really helped with my son&#x27;s acne.  </li>
            <li>With Neem foaming face wash I have found that my skin is much softer and the scent is heavenly.</li>
            <li>my skin is much smoother and clearer becaus of the Neem in the product.</li>
            <li>however I&#x27;m worried about the main &#x27;inactive&#x27; ingredient which is phenoxyethanol - here is what the website www.chemicaloftheday/squarespace.com</li>
            <li>So, while this is better because it lessens the risk for ethylene oxide contamination, it is still the same chemical structurally, and would pose the same risks.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It states the product has herbs, is pure, natural, blah, blah, blah.</li>
            <li>This product did not make my face overly dry, just clean and refresh.</li>
            <li>If you care about REAL natural products for your body, stay away from this company.  </li>
            <li>this toner above that you made can also be used in your bath water for your body like to get rid of skin infections, body breakouts of any kind like, Eczema, Acne, Rashes, Mosquito/Bug Bites prepare the concoction as mentioned above and add about 100 ml or 3.51 fluid ounces of it into your bathing water).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely safe for everyday use, soap-free (doesn&#x27;t overdry your skin) and non-comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog your pores).</li>
            <li>Neem is alleged to have numerous medicinal qualities and healthy skin is one of them.</li>
            <li>with these two soaps above #1 &amp; #2 I first wash my hands of course</li>
            <li>It appears to be exactly the same as before the use of this product.  </li>
            <li>On the flip side, that light foam meant that one bottle lasted a long time, much longer than expected.</li>
            <li>clear dramatically&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Let me tell you I do a lot of research online about alternative organic natural &amp; healthier treatments for everything &amp; when I found the herb Neem</li>
            <li>below(on #3)and add about 100 ml or 3.51 fluid ounces of it to your bathing water to treat Acne, Rashes, Mosquito/Bug Bites &amp; it really works.</li>
            <li>Also as an alternative for you people that love showers purchase one of those tiny for travel empty spray bottles &amp; pour the solution into it &amp; spray your entire body with it &amp; stay in shower for about 15 minutes without water on you &amp; then after 15 minutes, then wash it off &amp; continue your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also it leaves my face soft and clear.</li>
            <li>If you have been on Accutane this is gentle enough to use during the process and enhances your skin once you have completed.</li>
            <li>note: some companies may claim that their phenoxyethanol is extracted from natural sources.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 years old.</li>
            <li>so much that I have been recommending it to several of my friends</li>
            <li>I liked how thoroughly this face wash removed skin oil without leaving a chemical smell behind.</li>
            <li>So, just because something&#x27;s \\&quot;phlalate-free\\&quot; or \\&quot;paraben-free\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend as I plan to purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>No other product has ever done that.  </li>
            <li>I found this gentle product gets my face much cleaner than anything i have used before, actually pulls the black out of my blackheads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her skin is truly different, soft, clearer, and glowing.  </li>
            <li>This company presents itself falsely just like so many.</li>
            <li>a concoction of A Tablespoon of #3 (Ground Neem Leaf Powder) in a half liter or about 4 cups of Distilled Purified water till the water (that only cost me a dollar or two for a gallon at Walmart) turns green (Which is about 30 minutes, I first brought it to a boil &amp; (all the time I kept stirring), then I immediately turned it down to low heat to simmer for about 30 minutes, then I take it off the stove &amp; let it sit with top still on to steep for about an hour or two until it cools down).</li>

            <li> I noticed very few improvements after faithfully washing daily with this product for over 2 months.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping this will keep the bacteria down, and eliminate the skin infection I seem to get every year.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the skin a little dry sometimes but my complexion has been clearer and I usually put on a little moisturizer after washing my face anyways.</li>

            <li> apply above (#4 Organix, Theraneem Skin Lotion) to your face &amp; then that&#x27;s it, but if my skin is really bad, then I will after I apply this lotion, then I will put my face into my steamer</li>
            <li> And my skin doesn&#x27;t go crazy.</li>
            <li> I mean very bad.</li>

            <li> I use to have very bad skin  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> too drying. ouch. my skin began to peel on the cheeks. I do use moisturizer and facial oil every day and still it stripped off all the oil. my face felt like a mask when i used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for over a month now and have noticed quite a difference in the texture of my skin. My skin is brighter, softer and looks much smoother. The foam is very creamy and has a subtle fragrance. I have always battled with a super oily t-zone, the face wash has helped so much! Remember since this face wash is meant to purify you will see some impurities surface within the first week of use (at least for me). Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> Pine Sol toilet cleaner scent. I guess some people like that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; toilet smell. I can&#x27;t use it, smells awful :(</li>
            <li> This neem foaming face wash cleaned my face thoroughly, removed all my makeup and oils from my face. I love the smell of this, light lemony scent. A little goes a long way with product. This product did not make my face overly dry, just clean and refresh. Would purchase again. Shipping was pretty good, came in about 5 days after I ordered.</li>
            <li> Nice face wash, clean smell, and does not dry out your skin when you use it.</li>
            <li> Neem is alleged to have numerous medicinal qualities and healthy skin is one of them. This soap seems to leave your face softer and moistened after using, though the scent isn&#x27;t the best. In fairness, its also safe to say that most of the fragrances we find in cosmetics aren&#x27;t necessarily good for our skin, so that this one is milder (more natural) is great for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap dispenses into a very light and not-so-sudsy foam so it took some time getting used to washing with it. On the flip side, that light foam meant that one bottle lasted a long time, much longer than expected. Overall, after one bottle we decided to not get more, but extended use would probably yield better results.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you I do a lot of research online about alternative organic natural &amp; healthier treatments for everything &amp; when I found the herb Neem I finally found the holy grail for clearing breakouts of all kinds like to get rid of skin infections on face or for body you need to prepare the concoction that I mentioned below(on #3)and add about 100 ml or 3.51 fluid ounces of it to your bathing water to treat Acne, Rashes, Mosquito/Bug Bites &amp; it really works. But I did not use only it, let me tell you what I did. I purchased here on Amazon 5 Neem products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1.) Neem Foaming Face Wash - 150 ml Price: $12.99 [[ASIN:B003OPE57C Neem Foaming Face Wash - 150 ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2.) Soothing Therape Neem Liquid Soap Organix South 16 oz Liquid Price:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BPMCPC8 Soothing Therape Neem Liquid Soap Organix South 16 oz Liquid]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(So with these two soaps above #1 &amp; #2 I first wash my hands of course &amp; then I keep my palms wet &amp; I squirt 1(Neem Foaming Face Wash) squirt into my wet palm &amp; then I squeeze a little of number #2 (Therape Neem Liquid Soap ) into the same palm &amp; then I mix in my hands &amp; wash my face &amp; after rinsing. I put together the #3rd product before time, so I can always have it in the fridge ready to be used as my neem toner that I found on a website &amp; it works perfectly. Here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3.) Neem Leaf Powder Organic Certified Healthfuze 16 oz Price: $18.97&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CACOPC0 Neem Leaf Powder Organic Certified Healthfuze 16 oz 1lb]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boil a concoction of A Tablespoon of #3 (Ground Neem Leaf Powder) in a half liter or about 4 cups of Distilled Purified water till the water (that only cost me a dollar or two for a gallon at Walmart) turns green (Which is about 30 minutes, I first brought it to a boil &amp; (all the time I kept stirring), then I immediately turned it down to low heat to simmer for about 30 minutes, then I take it off the stove &amp; let it sit with top still on to steep for about an hour or two until it cools down). Then I pour to store it into a glass bottle or two (I used two glass bottles that I repurposed). Use this liquid as a skin toner by just dipping a cotton-ball into it and wiping your face with it every night. Regular usage will help in clearing acne, scars, pigmentation and blackheads. ATTENTION* (Don&#x27;t forget to refridgerate this Neem Toner that you just made. Only take out to use &amp; then put it back to store in the fridge)*.&lt;br /&gt;(Now this toner above that you made can also be used in your bath water for your body like to get rid of skin infections, body breakouts of any kind like, Eczema, Acne, Rashes, Mosquito/Bug Bites prepare the concoction as mentioned above and add about 100 ml or 3.51 fluid ounces of it into your bathing water). Also as an alternative for you people that love showers purchase one of those tiny for travel empty spray bottles &amp; pour the solution into it &amp; spray your entire body with it &amp; stay in shower for about 15 minutes without water on you &amp; then after 15 minutes, then wash it off &amp; continue your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4.) Organix, Theraneem Skin Lotion, 8 Ounce Price: $9.13&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0013KY296 Organix, Theraneem Skin Lotion, 8 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then apply above (#4 Organix, Theraneem Skin Lotion) to your face &amp; then that&#x27;s it, but if my skin is really bad, then I will after I apply this lotion, then I will put my face into my steamer (that I purchased here on Amazon, which is: [[ASIN:B00005A9WP Conair Facial Sauna Systems with Timer]] &amp; Price: $23.69  &amp; steam it in to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5.) Coastal Scents Neem Oil, 16.90 Fluid Ounce Price: $12.95 Eligible for free shipping with Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006Y7U4S6 Coastal Scents Neem Oil, 16.90 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (Now I have not used this at all yet because I have not had to, but if I had to, then I would use this as the last hope &amp; use this in my bath water as that toner &amp; as a toner, but this stuff reeks as in smell &amp; I mean very bad. It is a mix between Peanut butter, Garlic, Cooked Cabbage &amp; maybe onions. It is something that you would have to wash it off after you apply &amp; let it sit on your skin because it smells awful. But I heard that it works also for skin problems also. But my toner I made just smells like tea, so I rather use what I made out of the ground Neem).er, Garlic, Cooked Cabbage &amp; maybe onions.

            <li> This face wash is amazing. I hv been using past 10 yrs. it keep the oil away from u r skin and keep its hydrated. U dont feel the roughness or oilyness once u se it.</li>
            <li> This neem face wash is amazing. I use it every night to clean my face and it does a wonderful job. Also it leaves my face soft and clear. Love it!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this Neem Foaming Face Wash and we have completely different skin types. She&#x27;s a teenager who still suffers the occasional acne outbreak and I&#x27;m 50 with dry skin, never had acne, but will get a dry patch if I don&#x27;t keep my skin moist. How this one product gives us both great results is a mystery, but we both love it.</li>
            <li> I noticed very few improvements after faithfully washing daily with this product for over 2 months.  I have a great deal of &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34; in my cheeks. and, for some reason, I thought this product would reduce this color.  It appears to be exactly the same as before the use of this product.  I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I doubt I will renew my order.</li>
            <li> This product may be a bit pricy but I think it&#x27;s well worth it. It&#x27;s completely safe for everyday use, soap-free (doesn&#x27;t overdry your skin) and non-comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t clog your pores). other cheaper products may claim to be acne treatments but actually contain comedogenic ingredients. a full list of these ingredients can be found on acne.org. i use this as my cleanser twice a day for the regimen and my skin has never been clearer.</li>
            <li> This company presents itself falsely just like so many. It states the product has herbs, is pure, natural, blah, blah, blah. So I get it today and read at the bottom of the bottle in the smallest print possible, &amp;#34;inactive&amp;#34; ingredients, with a list of chemical compounds.  Excuse me but, chemicals are NEVER inactive.  If you care about REAL natural products for your body, stay away from this company.  They try to decieve like so many.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care product. If you have been on Accutane this is gentle enough to use during the process and enhances your skin once you have completed.</li>
            <li> This is great for cleansing oily skin especially in the summer.  I am prone to summer break outs but have not had a one since using the Neem Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> This truly does clean without feeling like the skin is stripped. And I love the fragrance  however I&#x27;m worried about the main &#x27;inactive&#x27; ingredient which is phenoxyethanol - here is what the website www.chemicaloftheday/squarespace.com said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Made out of carcinogenic and toxic compounds, phenoxyethanol is an ingredient that I would suggest avoiding. Oftentimes it&#x27;s found in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products. They&#x27;ll use phenoxyethanol as the preservative and then tout that they&#x27;re \\&quot;paraben-free.\\&quot; In addition it&#x27;s commonly used as a fragrance ingredient. Many of the natural companies still use synthetic fragrance. They&#x27;ll tout that they&#x27;re \\&quot;phthalate-free\\&quot; but still contain phenoxyethanol. So, just because something&#x27;s \\&quot;phlalate-free\\&quot; or \\&quot;paraben-free\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe. Any time you see \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; listed, phenoxyethanol could be present, along with any number of harmful synthetic chemicals. Phenoxyethanol is structurally similar to parabens on a chemical level, so its toxicity to the reproductive system is not surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note: some companies may claim that their phenoxyethanol is extracted from natural sources.  So, while this is better because it lessens the risk for ethylene oxide contamination, it is still the same chemical structurally, and would pose the same risks.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for that reason, I feel I can no longer use this. Just be aware of what you are putting on your skin and make an educated decision.</li>
            <li> This plus the TheraNeem works great together. I use it daily.I am absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister in law and she has seen an improvement in her Rosacea.  She says it has also left her skin wonderfully soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some for myself to use while we&#x27;re in Mexico as I sweat a lot on my face and I&#x27;m hoping this will keep the bacteria down, and eliminate the skin infection I seem to get every year.  I&#x27;ll post an update after trying it out this winter.</li>
            <li> I found this gentle product gets my face much cleaner than anything i have used before, actually pulls the black out of my blackheads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best product at any price!</li>
            <li> It really helped with my son&#x27;s acne.  I would recommend to everyone suffering with acne.  I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!</li>
            <li> My fiance has become a believer in neem and this stuff cleans her face of oil and dirt she says every time.  She uses this first and then her FAVORITE PRODUCT &amp;#34;Neem Magic&amp;#34; sold by Passport to Organics!  Her skin is truly different, soft, clearer, and glowing.  Great product here to have and use daily in a regimen.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer commented that it turned her blackheads white.  Yes, the blackheads on my nose are white and I&#x27;ve only used it twice! No other product has ever done that.  My face really feels super clean without being overly dry.  I&#x27;m 67 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for about 3 months now. I can&#x27;t use a lot of products due to they always have something in them that my skin doesn&#x27;t like. With Neem foaming face wash I have found that my skin is much softer and the scent is heavenly. My face feels soft and rejuvenated and smells awesome. And my skin doesn&#x27;t go crazy. I like Neem so much that I have been recommending it to several of my friends and they have actually switched over to it as well. ;)</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a clean feeling face but ended up with clogged pores instead.</li>
            <li> Love this product removes all makeup quickly and easily..my skin is much smoother and clearer becaus of the Neem in the product.</li>
            <li> Great face wash.  I personally like the scent this product has and the way my face feels when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Great experience with the seller and arrived as scheduled.  Highly recommend as I plan to purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Works well  would buy again</li>
            <li> Love it doesnt irritate my skin, leaves face feeling clean anf smooth. highly recommended. I will purchase again. great product</li>
            <li> I have really liked this wash it makes my face feel clean my complexion has improved greatly I would recommend people using it</li>
            <li> Pleasant smelling foamy facial cleanser that does not dry my skin out, but still leaves me feeling clean.  Switching to the use of more Neem based products.</li>
            <li> nice but leaked out in package</li>
            <li> This is a must have,facial wash  I use to have very bad skin  clear dramatically&lt;br /&gt;I have introduced my African American friends to this and they love must try!</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin a little dry sometimes but my complexion has been clearer and I usually put on a little moisturizer after washing my face anyways.</li>
            <li> I liked how thoroughly this face wash removed skin oil without leaving a chemical smell behind. This is really an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Works very well but not as good as gel. Seems a bit watered down but still best facial cleanser on market compared to others. Works on acne super fast, like 24/48 hours kinda fast. I&#x27;m sticking with this brand but gel form instead of foam.</li>
