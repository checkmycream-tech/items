            <li>I thoroughly enjoy the scent and really love this soap.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great purchase and will buy again when mines is all gone!</li>
            <li>Smell is fine</li>
            <li>And my elbows and heels; can we say smooth.</li>
            <li>an leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Though I am sure I have reviewed this in the past, I love love love this soap!</li>
            <li>I have have had cystic acne since I was a teenager (those yucky under the skin zits), and this soap has lessened them significantly.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with a squeaky clean feeling and again, improves the texture and look of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a better scent and lathers real well.</li>
            <li>AFTER MY SHOWER, I FEEL SUPER CLEAN NO SOAP RESIDUE ON MY SKIN.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>my face is clear and smooth, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Initially I was disappointed because it did not have a tropical smell at all, but it was a pleasant scent that I have to say I am loving more and more (kind of reminds me of laundry detergent smell).</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and not overpowering, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as economical.</li>
            <li>The scent also lasts on my skin well through the night when I shower right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I have always had kind of combo skin I guess, but when I hit my 40&#x27;s my skin started to get very dry.</li>
            <li>At first, I itched from it but as time went on, my skin took to it like a frog to a lily pad, this will forever be a staple in my rotation.</li>
            <li>This soap has faded scars I got when hot fat splashed on my arm whilst cooking.  </li>
            <li>I get a really clean feeling after washing with this soap and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>It also evened out my complexion, and leaves my skin squeaky clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>Did not notice a huge difference at first with my skin, but after a couple of weeks my dry skin corrected and I have not had it since.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve even been using it on some pretty sensitive body parts during shower time</li>
            <li>No worries, the Herbal liquid offers the same results as the Tropical bar, has a gentle clean fragrance, something pleasing to smell on men.</li>
            <li>I do notice some scaring have faded, particularly the darkness under my eyes is not so noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best black soap product I have tried, and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>All natural too!  </li>
            <li>I have to admit; the first use of the first bar was a little touchy</li>
            <li>it worked but it discoloured her face, so she stopped using it and allowed her skin to finish clear up on</li>
            <li>It makes my body incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect it to make my skin feel moist as I have sensitive skin and almost all soap dries out my skin.</li>
            <li>so it has lasted pretty long (about a month).</li>
            <li>i started using it a couple days later to clear up some acne that had started to break out on my face.</li>
            <li>I battled acne in my early teen years and grew out of it once I entered college.</li>
            <li>It is the only soap I can use that does not break me out, and actually goes so far as to prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with acne prone, sensitive skin or especially those who suffer from skin conditions like psoriasis and etc.</li>

            <li> Helps clear up acne, dark spots, and skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> Bought a bottle of liquid black soap at a natural foods store in town and thought of purchasing it again, but then I found these bars</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, and need to moisturize after washing my face or it feels very &#x27;tight&#x27;</li>
            <li> Lasts long too.</li>
            <li> The third bar had a sharp piece of stone in it that cut my hand and shoulder while rubbing it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I would suggest, if you tend to have dry skin, it may not be for you!</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Dudu Osun Black Soap and I can not think of life without it.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with this stuff however,  </li>
            <li> I have learned to lather up my hands, wash my face, leave it on my skin for 30 sec to a minute then rinse</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that the shower will need rinsed out after each use, because of the dark soap left behind.  </li>
            <li> This is a mess once used (brown water all over the place) but I will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and kept the bar on a soap tray on my shower shelf where it would not get wet</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t let the black in the shower panic you.  </li>
            <li> It makes a slight tingle on the skin while washing.</li>
            <li> , I got little scratches all over my hands.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t scrub your face hard or you could leave your skin feeling raw.  </li>
            <li> How can you go wrong!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i bought this product for my niece to treat eczema.  it worked but it discoloured her face, so she stopped using it and allowed her skin to finish clear up on it&#x27;s own. i started using it a couple days later to clear up some acne that had started to break out on my face. no sooner, my face was cleared up. i am truly impressed by this product. what i discovered after using this product for 1 month, is that it has blistered the skin on my face, so i&#x27;ve decided to use it twice per week instead. i will definitely buy again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This soap has helped my psoriasis and also my son&#x27;s acne.  We use it every day...also its a good all-over soap, great smell.</li>
            <li> The soap has a really pleasant smell. The scent also lasts on my skin well through the night when I shower right before I go to bed. Some of the blemishes that I&#x27;ve had on my face have disappeared within one to two uses of the soap. I don&#x27;t use it all the time on my face, but when I do, I can see the difference in my skin. It makes my body incredibly soft. I don&#x27;t expect it to make my skin feel moist as I have sensitive skin and almost all soap dries out my skin. I thoroughly enjoy the scent and really love this soap. My brother has even taken a bar from me after using mine!</li>
            <li> While the title of the review is hyperbolic, this stuff IS amazing! Smells great an leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. I have been using it for about four or five months now and my skin has never been better and my acne is under control. Definitely the best black soap product I have tried, and I have tried quite a few. Love it!</li>
            <li> purchased for my uncle, he has skin that is itching him, and this soap is helping him.  The only draw back is that the shower will need rinsed out after each use, because of the dark soap left behind.  Shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, since no doubt, everyone rinses shower after each use.  So don&#x27;t let the black in the shower panic you.  Smell is fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now and I love how it makes my skin feels. At first, I itched from it but as time went on, my skin took to it like a frog to a lily pad, this will forever be a staple in my rotation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  It has an amazing clean/fresh scent.  I am constantly raving about it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> The third bar had a sharp piece of stone in it that cut my hand and shoulder while rubbing it on my skin. Talk about deep exfoilating? Buyer Beware!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and not overpowering, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural. I first found this soap at a small local shop, but they don&#x27;t sell it in bulk so it&#x27;s not as economical. I&#x27;m so glad I found in on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This soap is great! I use it to wash my face, body, and hair. I gave a bar to my mom and sisters and they all love it as well. Helps clear up acne, dark spots, and skin discoloration. Smells citrusy but if you have any cuts may sting a bit because it has lime juice in it. Other than that, great purchase and will buy again when mines is all gone!</li>
            <li> Im a white girl and I love this stuff.  It has cleared my skin of cystic acne, faded acne scars and reduced discoloration of my skin giving my face a more even toned look.  You need to be careful with this stuff however,  don&#x27;t scrub your face hard or you could leave your skin feeling raw.  I have learned to lather up my hands, wash my face, leave it on my skin for 30 sec to a minute then rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to wash my body too.  It leaves me with a squeaky clean feeling and again, improves the texture and look of my skin.  Really, this stuff IS great.  So glad I found out about it and decided to try it.  I will never use anything else.  All natural too!  How can you go wrong!  LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. It makes a slight tingle on the skin while washing. It leaves your skin feeling great without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Best shape ever.  Love how it smells and how it leaves my skin.  Lasts long too.</li>
            <li> Bought a bottle of liquid black soap at a natural foods store in town and thought of purchasing it again, but then I found these bars and I like these better. It has a better scent and lathers real well. I get a really clean feeling after washing with this soap and it&#x27;s all natural. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Dudu Osun Black Soap and I can not think of life without it. The smell, the lather, EVERYTHING is wonderful. I have to admit; the first use of the first bar was a little touchy, I got little scratches all over my hands. But I used the Shea Butter on them and they went away in a couple of days. I don&#x27;t think it has happened since or it simply has not bothered me since and I&#x27;ve even been using it on some pretty sensitive body parts during shower time, you feel me? I do notice some scaring have faded, particularly the darkness under my eyes is not so noticeable anymore. And my elbows and heels; can we say smooth. I ordered the Liquid soap as well. Even though it said \\&quot;Tropical\\&quot; on the page, when I got the product it said \\&quot;Herbal\\&quot; on the bottle as well as the packing slip. No worries, the Herbal liquid offers the same results as the Tropical bar, has a gentle clean fragrance, something pleasing to smell on men. I plan on giving my son a couple of bottles and keeping a couple for myself. I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have always had kind of combo skin I guess, but when I hit my 40&#x27;s my skin started to get very dry. I tried several products and different soaps but nothing seemed to help. A friend at work told me about this soap and she described it to me as having a tropical smell. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and bought 5 bars. I read the other reviews and kept the bar on a soap tray on my shower shelf where it would not get wet so it has lasted pretty long (about a month). Initially I was disappointed because it did not have a tropical smell at all, but it was a pleasant scent that I have to say I am loving more and more (kind of reminds me of laundry detergent smell). Did not notice a huge difference at first with my skin, but after a couple of weeks my dry skin corrected and I have not had it since. 5 stars for great clean smell and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP!! MY SKIN IS GETTING CLEARER AND AS A RESULT A BIT LIGHTER. AFTER MY SHOWER, I FEEL SUPER CLEAN NO SOAP RESIDUE ON MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> Though I am sure I have reviewed this in the past, I love love love this soap! It is the only soap I can use that does not break me out, and actually goes so far as to prevent breakouts. I have have had cystic acne since I was a teenager (those yucky under the skin zits), and this soap has lessened them significantly. Can&#x27;t say enough good about it. I would suggest, if you tend to have dry skin, it may not be for you! I have normal skin, and need to moisturize after washing my face or it feels very &#x27;tight&#x27; (suppose that is good though!!). I just use Cocoa Butter and it is all good!</li>
            <li> I cannot stress the importance of having a great skin regimen. I swear by this soap now to cleanse my face twice a day. I battled acne in my early teen years and grew out of it once I entered college. With a balanced diet, and working out five times a week my skin has not looked better. This soap cleanses away all the oil, dirt, and grime. I suffer from PCOS and oily skin is the devil! I am so happy I purchased this soap and will continue to use it since it has done wonders for my skin and I am just glowing. I ran out of the five pack and ended up having to stock up on the 12 pack from another vendor. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with acne prone, sensitive skin or especially those who suffer from skin conditions like psoriasis and etc.</li>
            <li> This soap has faded scars I got when hot fat splashed on my arm whilst cooking.  It also evened out my complexion, and leaves my skin squeaky clean but not dry.  Am currently using it to wash my hair as it leaves no residue, just cleans without drying it out.</li>
            <li> The very best soap I ever use highly recommended.......</li>
            <li> This is a mess once used (brown water all over the place) but I will be using this for a long time to come. my face is clear and smooth, and I love the smell.</li>
