            <li> did not see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Friends have asked me if I had work done on my face.  I tell them no - it&#x27;s Dermalogica Extra Firming Booster.  My skin is so much smoother and my lines are less noticable.  Great results.  It&#x27;s a permanent addition to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> I am age 67 and I did not notice any improvement in my skin.  A waste of money as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> I like the brand, and use quite a few of its products especially as I have developed allergies of late. This is no miracle worker, did not really notice substantial firming but I like the gel consistency because I have combination skin and I don&#x27;t like oily skin products. Hopefully it prevents further sagging of the skin.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. One of my must haves</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than great!</li>
            <li> Yes, it works. Excellent product from a great American company. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Tightens skin and lessens fine wrinkles</li>
            <li> my mum uses it for more than a year, it shows good result. great product. Definitely will continue to use it</li>
            <li> did notice an immediate firming, so use it before makeup.  Don&#x27;t think there will be long term effects though.</li>
            <li> Love all Dermalogica Boosters as each one targets specific skin needs. My favorite is the Hydrating Booster as it is all hydralonic acid&lt;br /&gt;acid which attracts water and humidity by 100% to the skin, keeping it moist and supple. I think it was more effective in FL as you are already in a humid environment, but now living in southwest CO where it is dry and arid my skin is struggling more along with the effects continued aging.</li>
            <li> I used this product in the past and love it.  I see a difference in my skin when I use it.</li>
            <li> It didnt do much for me , probably wont order again . Victoria Principal puts out some&lt;br /&gt;firming eye cream that is awesome , will go with it next time.</li>
            <li> This is super good product, luv it!!</li>
            <li> Appears to help with deceasing the appearance of lines in face and light weight so it goes under creams without residue.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I feel my face tightening up as it dries and skins appearance is much improved.</li>
            <li> This is the little extra boost my skin needs.  I use this product everyday and just love the results.  Dermalogica makes a great line of products.</li>
