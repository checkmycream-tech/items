            <li>The smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Probably not the best scent if you are showering before bed, but great for the mornings.  </li>
            <li>It does have a good lather, however!</li>
            <li>Not that good in fragrance and lather !</li>
            <li>is good to go!</li>
            <li>This is a great body wash that smells very good</li>
            <li>I do wish the beautiful smell lingered, though.</li>
            <li>The scent is a wonderful pick me up - in the shower steam in the morning - I love the tingle too!</li>
            <li>The soap is runny and the smell isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>great product, great scent</li>
            <li>Smelled great but consistency will prohibit me from buying again.</li>

            <li>This is a great body wash.  </li>
            <li>Great bodywash if you need something that&#x27;s hypoallergenic and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering perfume smell.</li>
            <li>it smells great and no bizarre/unnecessary</li>
            <li>Decided to try it out, and it&#x27;s actually a very nice body wash.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to this refreshing scent when cleaning off - but don&#x27;t be fooled, it&#x27;s also an excellent soap and is works great after an afternoon of gardening.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of it and the fragrance was pleasant without smelling like something you&#x27;d eat!</li>
            <li>I didnt think i would like this but its amazing!</li>

            <li>If anything, it smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Works beautifully to keep me clean though!!</li>
            <li>As always, Burt&#x27;s Bees has made a good product.</li>
            <li>Good for a morning routine.</li>
            <li>The product is a good cleaner/exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Everything was good except some of it leaked out of the cap (maybe 2 tablespoons) during shipment.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>I am still searching for a good moisturizing family body wash.  </li>
            <li>Smells good , and well priced at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I think they make a fair product but their prices are bit steep.</li>
            <li>The soap is... fair.  </li>
            <li>As one reviewer put it, it might even be a good hand soap for you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good cleanser.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is unobtrusive but not as good as it sounds.  </li>
            <li>It makes a good product even better!</li>
            <li>The scent is great and not overpowering--I absolutely love the scent grapefruit and ginger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for about a year and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant aroma and leaves you feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re satisfied with that!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed Burt&#x27;s Bees products and had no idea that they made body wash!</li>
            <li>If you have allergies and want a good, clean feeling body wash, this will be a great product for you.</li>
            <li>This body wash smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and feel.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d get her a bottle of her own body wash.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice.</li>
            <li>While I like to use product&#x27;s from Burt&#x27;s Bees, this just doesn&#x27;t lather thhe scent is nice.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and the lather is fabulous on your pouf.</li>
            <li>99.3% natural &amp; sulfate-free, what more can I say!!!  </li>
            <li>I like the body wash--doesn&#x27;t take much to work up a good lather and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li>I at first really loved this product because the smell is nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Its ginger and citrus odor is pleasant, not too sweet, maybe a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Origins body wash, and has a really refreshing &amp;#34;wake</li>
            <li>many hand soaps have these days.</li>
            <li>Really refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>so I can buy one that has a better smell.</li>
            <li>Love this smell.</li>
            <li>Much better for your skin than products with sulfates.</li>
            <li>I have kept buying this because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love everything Burt&#x27;s Bees does.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of grapefruit, than this is for you.  </li>
            <li>However, I guess I was in the mood for more of a moisturizing body wash----and</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t really a refreshing or calming smell.</li>
            <li>and it smells refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had more for each shower.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Could not &amp;#34; bee&amp;#34; any better.</li>
            <li>Will &amp;#34;hive&amp;#34; to get more.</li>
            <li>However Ive used their hand wash along with lipglosses and enjoyed the scents</li>
            <li>I do love the smell of ginger so was looking forward to trying this product.  </li>
            <li>This lathers very well &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite body wash.  </li>
            <li>I love this body wash because it is so invigorating and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to confirm, however, that ginger has a benefit when applied to the skin (nor does the product appear to claim any).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not as refreshing as I</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>consistency is too watery and the smell is more like hardwood floor cleaner than anything.</li>
            <li>Citrus &amp; Ginger Root Body Wash has a refreshing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this soap, I buy it often and recommend.</li>
            <li>the smell is a bit interesting.</li>
            <li>There are too many competitive product out there.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Used for years and love the scent, hypoallergenic quality, and environmentally safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>Just okay.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell though.  </li>
            <li>I am in search of something that smells better.</li>
            <li>Your hands smell clean rather than getting too close to your 90 year old great aunt!</li>
            <li>but if you like a really clean clean or live in a humid place in the summer like me-it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good product, and I like that it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees - good company.</li>
            <li>The fresh, refreshing scent helps wake me up!  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, but it is fairly runny and it doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li>Great product which works well for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin soft and nurtured.</li>
            <li>Great &#x27;natural&#x27; product.</li>
            <li>Like with most Burt&#x27;s Bees products this feels genuine.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, but bottle pours out way too much at a time.</li>
            <li>Sure it gets me clean</li>
            <li>It is natural, gentle on the skin, and the smell is wonderful- energizing!</li>
            <li>It literally smells like ginger with a strong hint of grapefruit after you lather it up.</li>
            <li>Makes an adequate amount of bubbles, ingredient list is pretty safe-all in all good</li>
            <li>It smells kind of funny</li>
            <li>and you may well be fine when you use it.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees continues to meet the needs of those seeking stellar products that are safe and free of sodium laurel sulfates and parabens!</li>
            <li>Love the smell--it&#x27;s so crisp &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent of this product.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>gentle yet effective</li>
            <li>I bought it because it is paraben and sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I attach no importance to products&#x27; claims of being &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; but unless some kind of irritation were to develop with continued use, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s much to like here and almost nothing to criticize.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent, not too soapy, love it.</li>
            <li>My new favorite smell!</li>
            <li>It smells great and didn&#x27;t over dry my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li>that being said, I feel clean and smell clean coming out of the shower</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this body wash for anyone who is trying to go natural and who also likes the light smell of ginger and the clean feeling this body wash provides while still being fairly environmentally friendly!</li>
            <li>and this does make my skin soft and smells so refreshing!</li>
            <li>I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but I found this nothing special.</li>
            <li>nothing special but not a bad product..</li>
            <li>I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one I didn&#x27;t like so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this body wash being a bit &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;, which is true.</li>
            <li>Great smell and safer to use on skin than other cleansers which are full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Fast and friendly!</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural, but yet smelling nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>My daughter is highly allergic to many body washes, and this one does not cause problems for her.</li>
            <li>I got this because Burt&#x27;s Bees is supposed to be great for the skin, but this body wash really dried out my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and the fact that it&#x27;s almost completely natural -</li>
            <li>Blah, nothing too exciting.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, too :)</li>
            <li>Fresh and eye opening.</li>
            <li>Refreshing scent, keeps my skin healthy and doesn&#x27;t dry me out!!</li>
            <li>I had been pretty loyal to Origins products, and their body washes are about twice the price as Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>just the right amount of fragrance to wake me up but not leaving me smelling overbearing after my shower in the AM.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, &amp; the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it just doesn&#x27;t really compare.</li>
            <li>Though not especially thick, the liquid is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It is such a relief after experiencing so many phony flavors and scents.  </li>
            <li>I suggest that the seller secures the cap better in the future.</li>
            <li>SO I am pretty bummed about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this and love the way it smells, but there is a small percentage of it that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>The price was pretty economical...very competitive with stores.</li>
            <li>It actually makes it pretty smooth and you absolutely feel clean after.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure the watered-down feeling is completely unrelated to its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective cleanser, putting my old bar soap to shame and showing how little connection there is between cleaning power and &amp;#34;lather.&amp;#34; The product also stimulates the skin and improves the mood.</li>
            <li>Mama&#x27;s angel is still in first place even though I do not care too much for the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend pretty much lives with me</li>
            <li>I break out easily and have been trying different washes</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and no dry or flakiness or cracking.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the way it makes my dry skin feel.</li>
            <li>It takes a large amount of product to get your hair washed.</li>
            <li>I have started to use it as well, and really do like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very uplifting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I adore the scent, but really the lather is underwhelming</li>
            <li>It is a very watery body wash.</li>
            <li>very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product just as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>However, I had to go with 4 stars because the consistency is very thin/runny.</li>
            <li>The soap works very well.</li>
            <li>I only lost maybe a finger&#x27;s worth of soap, but it has a distinct scent and is vsry sticky when not worked with water.</li>
            <li>Looks like they have moved on to other fragrances that are more fruity.</li>
            <li>I have just started using more of Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past year, as I am not crazy about all the parabens and other stuff in most commerical body washes.</li>
            <li>I especially like the dispenser bottle, which makes it easy to get just the amount needed with no waste.</li>
            <li>But, it doesn&#x27;t exactly leave your skin feeling moisturized and soft, so I still had to apply a body butter after cleansing with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of oily, which I think is what causes it to make my skin so soft, but the downside is it means it&#x27;s messier and more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent scent to me</li>
            <li>What I liked about this product is a little went a long ways, the scent, the just right amount of lather, the way the skin feels (used a body scrub sponge), and the price.  </li>
            <li>and I felt the price was too high for what the product was.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees has always been known for their high quality products, so I decided to give the body wash</li>
            <li>tough to get a good lather going.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the smell was nice but because of the aforementioned reason this product lasted way less time than others ive dealt with.</li>
            <li>Crisp fresh scent, not that overwhelming fake floral stink</li>
            <li>But that was totally my fault for not reading more carefully about the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin except on my face (which please don&#x27;t use this on your face!)</li>
            <li>Burts bees try to sell themselves as a clean, natural brand but they are really not.</li>
            <li>, not too strong and not too weak, very spa like!  </li>
            <li>My kids have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>and I prefer to use natural products.</li>
            <li>I actually does not think it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>The downside to this is that you have a harder time pouring it out which means you&#x27;ll probably use more than is necessary, so this 12-ounce bottle won&#x27;t last you</li>
            <li>It totally helps wake you up because the smell is very citrusy.</li>
            <li>I chose Burt&#x27;s Bees, because it is known for natural products,</li>
            <li>if you like the natural factor try it</li>
            <li>I could have effectively made the same thing at home for cheaper with some unscented castile soap and a few drops of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I assumed it would be orange-y like most of the other citrus ginger products I have bought from other companies.</li>
            <li>I definitely get the hints of citrus and ginger, it reminds me of a scent from soaps you would get at high class hotels.</li>
            <li>Great product, only complaint was the packaging - this shipped with several other items, including some shampoos, and while the shampoos were wrapped in plastic baggies, this product was NOT</li>
            <li>The only thing I would note about it is that it is not as thick as most which surprised me.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and have been looking for something that is less agitating to me, and this seems to be the right choice.</li>
            <li>I really want to love it because I&#x27;m obsessed with the smell.</li>
            <li>It is very watery, not very thick like other body wash products I have used.  </li>
            <li>I purchase this for my husband who will use no other body wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 31 year old male.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting something with the same consistency as, let&#x27;s say, Old Spice or Dove Men body wash</li>
            <li>Well, then I noticed that it actually is only 99.3% natural...</li>
            <li>Well, for me 100% is natural and anything below is simply NOT.</li>
            <li>This had a nice fragrance but it dried our skin out to the point where the babies got the small eczemza like bumps.</li>
            <li>I should add that I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin and usually am into trying and discovering new products without much problems.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and a little peppery.</li>
            <li>consistency is not very thick, not very foaming...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Probably not the best scent if you are showering before bed, but great for the mornings.  </li>
            <li> It does have a good lather, however!</li>
            <li> Not that good in fragrance and lather !</li>
            <li> is good to go!</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash that smells very good</li>
            <li> I do wish the beautiful smell lingered, though.</li>
            <li> The scent is a wonderful pick me up - in the shower steam in the morning - I love the tingle too!</li>
            <li> The soap is runny and the smell isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> great product, great scent</li>
            <li> Smelled great but consistency will prohibit me from buying again.</li>
            <li> Great smell.  </li>
            <li> This would be great for people taking a bath.</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash.  </li>
            <li> Great bodywash if you need something that&#x27;s hypoallergenic and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering perfume smell.</li>
            <li> it smells great and no bizarre/unnecessary</li>
            <li> Decided to try it out, and it&#x27;s actually a very nice body wash.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to this refreshing scent when cleaning off - but don&#x27;t be fooled, it&#x27;s also an excellent soap and is works great after an afternoon of gardening.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of it and the fragrance was pleasant without smelling like something you&#x27;d eat!</li>
            <li> I didnt think i would like this but its amazing!</li>
            <li> This was a great product and the citrus has a good scent to it.</li>
            <li> All Burt&#x27;s Bees products are wonderful and I recommend these to everyone. :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, great buy!</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> If anything, it smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Works beautifully to keep me clean though!!</li>
            <li> As always, Burt&#x27;s Bees has made a good product.</li>
            <li> Good for a morning routine.</li>
            <li> The product is a good cleaner/exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Everything was good except some of it leaked out of the cap (maybe 2 tablespoons) during shipment.</li>
            <li> It smells good</li>
            <li> I am still searching for a good moisturizing family body wash.  </li>
            <li> Smells good , and well priced at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think they make a fair product but their prices are bit steep.</li>
            <li> The soap is... fair.  </li>
            <li> As one reviewer put it, it might even be a good hand soap for you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good cleanser.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is unobtrusive but not as good as it sounds.  </li>
            <li> It makes a good product even better!</li>
            <li> The scent is great and not overpowering--I absolutely love the scent grapefruit and ginger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for about a year and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant aroma and leaves you feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re satisfied with that!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed Burt&#x27;s Bees products and had no idea that they made body wash!</li>
            <li> If you have allergies and want a good, clean feeling body wash, this will be a great product for you.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and feel.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d get her a bottle of her own body wash.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice.</li>
            <li> While I like to use product&#x27;s from Burt&#x27;s Bees, this just doesn&#x27;t lather thhe scent is nice.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and the lather is fabulous on your pouf.</li>
            <li> 99.3% natural &amp; sulfate-free, what more can I say!!!  </li>
            <li> I like the body wash--doesn&#x27;t take much to work up a good lather and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li> I at first really loved this product because the smell is nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Its ginger and citrus odor is pleasant, not too sweet, maybe a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Origins body wash, and has a really refreshing &amp;#34;wake</li>
            <li> many hand soaps have these days.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> so I can buy one that has a better smell.</li>
            <li> Love this smell.</li>
            <li> Much better for your skin than products with sulfates.</li>
            <li> I have kept buying this because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love everything Burt&#x27;s Bees does.</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of grapefruit, than this is for you.  </li>
            <li> However, I guess I was in the mood for more of a moisturizing body wash----and</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t really a refreshing or calming smell.</li>
            <li> and it smells refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had more for each shower.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Could not &amp;#34; bee&amp;#34; any better.</li>
            <li> Will &amp;#34;hive&amp;#34; to get more.</li>
            <li> However Ive used their hand wash along with lipglosses and enjoyed the scents</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of ginger so was looking forward to trying this product.  </li>
            <li> This lathers very well &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite body wash.  </li>
            <li> I love this body wash because it is so invigorating and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to confirm, however, that ginger has a benefit when applied to the skin (nor does the product appear to claim any).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not as refreshing as I</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> consistency is too watery and the smell is more like hardwood floor cleaner than anything.</li>
            <li> Citrus &amp; Ginger Root Body Wash has a refreshing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap, I buy it often and recommend.</li>
            <li> the smell is a bit interesting.</li>
            <li> There are too many competitive product out there.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body wash.  </li>
            <li> Used for years and love the scent, hypoallergenic quality, and environmentally safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> Just okay.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell though.  </li>
            <li> I am in search of something that smells better.</li>
            <li> Your hands smell clean rather than getting too close to your 90 year old great aunt!</li>
            <li> but if you like a really clean clean or live in a humid place in the summer like me-it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product, and I like that it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees - good company.</li>
            <li> The fresh, refreshing scent helps wake me up!  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, but it is fairly runny and it doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li> Great product which works well for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin soft and nurtured.</li>
            <li> Great &#x27;natural&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> Like with most Burt&#x27;s Bees products this feels genuine.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, but bottle pours out way too much at a time.</li>
            <li> Sure it gets me clean</li>
            <li> It is natural, gentle on the skin, and the smell is wonderful- energizing!</li>
            <li> It literally smells like ginger with a strong hint of grapefruit after you lather it up.</li>
            <li> Makes an adequate amount of bubbles, ingredient list is pretty safe-all in all good</li>
            <li> It smells kind of funny</li>
            <li> and you may well be fine when you use it.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees continues to meet the needs of those seeking stellar products that are safe and free of sodium laurel sulfates and parabens!</li>
            <li> Love the smell--it&#x27;s so crisp &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent of this product.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> gentle yet effective</li>
            <li> I bought it because it is paraben and sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> I attach no importance to products&#x27; claims of being &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; but unless some kind of irritation were to develop with continued use, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s much to like here and almost nothing to criticize.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, not too soapy, love it.</li>
            <li> My new favorite smell!</li>
            <li> It smells great and didn&#x27;t over dry my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li> that being said, I feel clean and smell clean coming out of the shower</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this body wash for anyone who is trying to go natural and who also likes the light smell of ginger and the clean feeling this body wash provides while still being fairly environmentally friendly!</li>
            <li> and this does make my skin soft and smells so refreshing!</li>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but I found this nothing special.</li>
            <li> nothing special but not a bad product..</li>
            <li> I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one I didn&#x27;t like so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this body wash being a bit &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;, which is true.</li>
            <li> Great smell and safer to use on skin than other cleansers which are full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Fast and friendly!</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural, but yet smelling nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> My daughter is highly allergic to many body washes, and this one does not cause problems for her.</li>
            <li> I got this because Burt&#x27;s Bees is supposed to be great for the skin, but this body wash really dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and the fact that it&#x27;s almost completely natural -</li>
            <li> Blah, nothing too exciting.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, too :)</li>
            <li> Fresh and eye opening.</li>
            <li> Refreshing scent, keeps my skin healthy and doesn&#x27;t dry me out!!</li>
            <li> I had been pretty loyal to Origins products, and their body washes are about twice the price as Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> just the right amount of fragrance to wake me up but not leaving me smelling overbearing after my shower in the AM.  </li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, &amp; the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it just doesn&#x27;t really compare.</li>
            <li> Though not especially thick, the liquid is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It is such a relief after experiencing so many phony flavors and scents.  </li>
            <li> I suggest that the seller secures the cap better in the future.</li>
            <li> SO I am pretty bummed about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this and love the way it smells, but there is a small percentage of it that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> The price was pretty economical...very competitive with stores.</li>
            <li> It actually makes it pretty smooth and you absolutely feel clean after.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure the watered-down feeling is completely unrelated to its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective cleanser, putting my old bar soap to shame and showing how little connection there is between cleaning power and &amp;#34;lather.&amp;#34; The product also stimulates the skin and improves the mood.</li>
            <li> Mama&#x27;s angel is still in first place even though I do not care too much for the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend pretty much lives with me</li>
            <li> I break out easily and have been trying different washes</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and no dry or flakiness or cracking.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the way it makes my dry skin feel.</li>
            <li> It takes a large amount of product to get your hair washed.</li>
            <li> I have started to use it as well, and really do like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very uplifting fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and I adore the scent, but really the lather is underwhelming</li>
            <li> It is a very watery body wash.</li>
            <li> very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product just as described.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> However, I had to go with 4 stars because the consistency is very thin/runny.</li>
            <li> The soap works very well.</li>
            <li> I only lost maybe a finger&#x27;s worth of soap, but it has a distinct scent and is vsry sticky when not worked with water.</li>
            <li> Looks like they have moved on to other fragrances that are more fruity.</li>
            <li> I have just started using more of Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past year, as I am not crazy about all the parabens and other stuff in most commerical body washes.</li>
            <li> I especially like the dispenser bottle, which makes it easy to get just the amount needed with no waste.</li>
            <li> But, it doesn&#x27;t exactly leave your skin feeling moisturized and soft, so I still had to apply a body butter after cleansing with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of oily, which I think is what causes it to make my skin so soft, but the downside is it means it&#x27;s messier and more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent scent to me</li>
            <li> What I liked about this product is a little went a long ways, the scent, the just right amount of lather, the way the skin feels (used a body scrub sponge), and the price.  </li>
            <li> and I felt the price was too high for what the product was.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees has always been known for their high quality products, so I decided to give the body wash</li>
            <li> tough to get a good lather going.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the smell was nice but because of the aforementioned reason this product lasted way less time than others ive dealt with.</li>
            <li> Crisp fresh scent, not that overwhelming fake floral stink</li>
            <li> But that was totally my fault for not reading more carefully about the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin except on my face (which please don&#x27;t use this on your face!)</li>
            <li> Burts bees try to sell themselves as a clean, natural brand but they are really not.</li>
            <li> , not too strong and not too weak, very spa like!  </li>
            <li> My kids have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> and I prefer to use natural products.</li>
            <li> I actually does not think it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> The downside to this is that you have a harder time pouring it out which means you&#x27;ll probably use more than is necessary, so this 12-ounce bottle won&#x27;t last you</li>
            <li> It totally helps wake you up because the smell is very citrusy.</li>
            <li> I chose Burt&#x27;s Bees, because it is known for natural products,</li>
            <li> if you like the natural factor try it</li>
            <li> I could have effectively made the same thing at home for cheaper with some unscented castile soap and a few drops of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I assumed it would be orange-y like most of the other citrus ginger products I have bought from other companies.</li>
            <li> I definitely get the hints of citrus and ginger, it reminds me of a scent from soaps you would get at high class hotels.</li>
            <li> Great product, only complaint was the packaging - this shipped with several other items, including some shampoos, and while the shampoos were wrapped in plastic baggies, this product was NOT</li>
            <li> The only thing I would note about it is that it is not as thick as most which surprised me.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and have been looking for something that is less agitating to me, and this seems to be the right choice.</li>
            <li> I really want to love it because I&#x27;m obsessed with the smell.</li>
            <li> It is very watery, not very thick like other body wash products I have used.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this for my husband who will use no other body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old male.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting something with the same consistency as, let&#x27;s say, Old Spice or Dove Men body wash</li>
            <li> Well, then I noticed that it actually is only 99.3% natural...</li>
            <li> Well, for me 100% is natural and anything below is simply NOT.</li>
            <li> This had a nice fragrance but it dried our skin out to the point where the babies got the small eczemza like bumps.</li>
            <li> I should add that I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin and usually am into trying and discovering new products without much problems.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and a little peppery.</li>
            <li> consistency is not very thick, not very foaming...</li>
            <li> you must order this product, order it completely separate from other items you don&#x27;t want soaked in soap.</li>
            <li> Wasteful, and does not last long.</li>
            <li> It did not last very long</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long and may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry out my skin (like some do) or alternately leave it feeling too oily.  </li>
            <li> I was a little surprised at the scent though.</li>
            <li> Guess, I&#x27;ll be hunting another brand which is too bad as I really liked this.</li>
            <li> soothing and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but cleans well.  </li>
            <li> body wash won&#x27;t leave your skin dry which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> This one did not live up to the Burt&#x27;s Bees reputation.</li>
            <li> However, it smells ucky- not gross but strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The lid was loose and the bottle opening did not have a securing</li>
            <li> However, if you do plan to buy this one and continue to use it, you may have to buy a few as it probably won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It is not too much of a problem if you are using a washcloth (as I do), but I think it may be difficult to use if you were using a different cleaning method.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I really expected.  </li>
            <li> But it is certainly not an OH MY GOODNESS experience.</li>
            <li> This product feels diluted as compared to any other body wash I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT smell &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; like other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Being a BC survivor, I&#x27;m extremely cautious about the products I use.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t notice any difference on my skin and it doesn&#x27;t thicken when rubbed together in my hands like other body washes do.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have been unable to find it any more in our local stores.</li>
            <li> I noticed other reviews saying this caused them to break out</li>
            <li> and so leaked and got all over the other contents.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that you can go through a body rather quickly as it is not very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was weird but it sort of burned, especially if you got near some &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> Was more annoying that problematic, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be as thick and moisturizing as I personally like</li>
            <li> But I soon started to itch everywhere on my body and would wake up in the middle of the night in agony unable to go back to sleep.</li>
            <li> but it does give you a slight kick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My body wash came in a wide, short bottle versus the tall, thin bottle pictured, but that does not matter.</li>
            <li> This product is not at all thick and rich, but my biggest disappointment though is in the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little bit pricey for a body wash</li>
            <li> When you use it be prepared for it to seem a little watery.  </li>
            <li> Not excited about the ingredients in this, or the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste it but can&#x27;t wait until it runs out</li>
            <li> This went on for a few weeks</li>
            <li> but it does not leave you feeling dried out as do some washes.</li>
            <li> Even if I use alot of product there is very little ginger or citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> (i suppose it does even with very little lather)</li>
            <li> Too small of a bottle.</li>
            <li> but the scent is usually what sets one cleaner apart from the others.</li>
            <li> do not love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hype is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s common citrus perfume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another common complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the liquid is very thin, which leads to a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> My one &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; about the product is how thin it is.  </li>
            <li> Despite the thin consistency, it still lathers up quite a bit on my washcloths.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product, Just to slummy for me, unlike the peppermint one.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> your cant go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> This product is very thin in its viscosity.</li>
            <li> ; smell doesn&#x27;t seem to linger too badly, but once it&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Some days I hate it.</li>
            <li> I realize bath gels/soaps all vary in thickness and richness and that is not what I base my &amp;#34;likeability&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I hate the smell .</li>
            <li> The smell is awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> soothing and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
            <li> My second purchase of this one, use it as a bubble bath for my kids. I prefer the mint/rosemary scented one for myself, but I don&#x27;t want the mint to burn their eyes. Makes an adequate amount of bubbles, ingredient list is pretty safe-all in all good product.&lt;br /&gt;With the coupon they have going+ the subscribe and save discount, I&#x27;m very happy with the price.</li>
            <li> I have just started using more of Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past year, as I am not crazy about all the parabens and other stuff in most commerical body washes. I had been pretty loyal to Origins products, and their body washes are about twice the price as Burt&#x27;s Bees. The Citrus &amp; Ginger body wash is really similar in scent to the &amp;#34;Gloom Away&amp;#34; Origins body wash, and has a really refreshing &amp;#34;wake you up&amp;#34; scent. Probably not the best scent if you are showering before bed, but great for the mornings.  I have signed up for the monthly subscription shipments which is perfect, as it&#x27;s not something that I now have to think about replenishing. It makes a good product even better!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent of this product.  It is unlike any body wash I have ever smelled before.  My one &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; about the product is how thin it is.  It is very watery, not very thick like other body wash products I have used.  It is not too much of a problem if you are using a washcloth (as I do), but I think it may be difficult to use if you were using a different cleaning method.  Despite the thin consistency, it still lathers up quite a bit on my washcloths.</li>
            <li> Crisp fresh scent, not that overwhelming fake floral stink many hand soaps have these days. Your hands smell clean rather than getting too close to your 90 year old great aunt!</li>
            <li> As always, Burt&#x27;s Bees has made a good product. Really refreshing smell. My daughter is highly allergic to many body washes, and this one does not cause problems for her. I have started to use it as well, and really do like it.</li>
            <li> I used to be a &amp;#34;Rosemary and Mint&amp;#34; Burt&#x27;s Bees fan, but I tried this scent and I love it! Very fresh and a little peppery. Good for a morning routine.</li>
            <li> Great product which works well for those with sensitive skin. Pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product is a good cleaner/exfoliate. However, it smells ucky- not gross but strong and unpleasant. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one I didn&#x27;t like so much. The soap is runny and the smell isn&#x27;t that great. I have been using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste it but can&#x27;t wait until it runs out so I can buy one that has a better smell. It does have a good lather, however!</li>
            <li> Love this smell. Gonna purchase again next time!</li>
            <li> The smell is awful.  I did return it.  I will say that the Burts Bees Peppermint and Rosemary body wash is VERY delightful</li>
            <li> Love it! Much better for your skin than products with sulfates. Smells and cleans great!</li>
            <li> great product, great scent</li>
            <li> the consistency of it is like water, not like a gel or shampoo. Smelled great but consistency will prohibit me from buying again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful body wash for all ages!!  Great smell and safer to use on skin than other cleansers which are full of chemicals.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product feels diluted as compared to any other body wash I have ever tried.  I love the fragrance and the fact that it&#x27;s almost completely natural - but I&#x27;m sure the watered-down feeling is completely unrelated to its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very uplifting fragrance.  I enjoy this product.  It is such a relief after experiencing so many phony flavors and scents.  Has a pungent stimulating radiance.</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Cleans well.</li>
            <li> I have kept buying this because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and I adore the scent, but really the lather is underwhelming and it dries out my skin a bit.  I think I&#x27;ll keep looking for another body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did dilute it and put it in a foaming soap dispenser and we&#x27;re satisfied with that!</li>
            <li> Not that good in fragrance and lather !</li>
            <li> The scent is a wonderful pick me up - in the shower steam in the morning - I love the tingle too!</li>
            <li> Blah, nothing too exciting. won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the body wash--doesn&#x27;t take much to work up a good lather and leaves my skin feeling good. I was a little surprised at the scent though. The citrus is grapefruit, and if I had read the label I would have known that. But I assumed it would be orange-y like most of the other citrus ginger products I have bought from other companies. But that was totally my fault for not reading more carefully about the product. So if you are looking for an orange scent, this is not it. I don&#x27;t like the grapefruit scent at all.</li>
            <li> What I liked about this product is a little went a long ways, the scent, the just right amount of lather, the way the skin feels (used a body scrub sponge), and the price.  What others may not like about it is the opposite, the product is a bit watery and tends to be not as heavy/thick, not as fragrant on the citrus notes, the low lather level, is not an exfoliate type product.  It does do a wonderful job AND it is natural/cruelty-free!</li>
            <li> I at first really loved this product because the smell is nice and refreshing. But I soon started to itch everywhere on my body and would wake up in the middle of the night in agony unable to go back to sleep. This went on for a few weeks and I was really uncomfortable for most of my waking hours. I didn&#x27;t put two and two together and didn&#x27;t think it was the body wash for quite some time. Then my boyfriend with whom I share bathroom supplies with also mentioned he&#x27;d been breaking out. We stopped using this product and all my problems immediately went away. I should add that I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin and usually am into trying and discovering new products without much problems. I&#x27;d never encountered skin irritation/allergy as severe as I had with this body wash. I know it&#x27;s just two data points and you may well be fine when you use it. But if you do encounter problems like us I hope you&#x27;ll realize it sooner that it may be this body wash.</li>
            <li> Everything was good except some of it leaked out of the cap (maybe 2 tablespoons) during shipment. I suggest that the seller secures the cap better in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, but it is fairly runny and it doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li> My kids have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. It smells good and I prefer to use natural products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great and didn&#x27;t over dry my skin whatsoever. I love everything Burt&#x27;s Bees does.</li>
            <li> This was a great product and the citrus has a good scent to it. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I really expected.  If you love the smell of grapefruit, than this is for you.  However, I guess I was in the mood for more of a moisturizing body wash----and this wasn&#x27;t it.  This would be great for people taking a bath.</li>
            <li> It is a very watery body wash. I also can&#x27;t decide if I like the smell. Some days I hate it. I don&#x27;t think that is their fault but it isn&#x27;t really a refreshing or calming smell.</li>
            <li> gentle yet effective and it smells refreshing.  I wish I had more for each shower.  You should suds up and try it.</li>
            <li> I got this because Burt&#x27;s Bees is supposed to be great for the skin, but this body wash really dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Been using it for years.  The fresh, refreshing scent helps wake me up!  It lathers nicely, &amp; the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I would give this body wash 5 stars but because it watery I can&#x27;t. I go through alot of them.  I have to say that its the only shower soap I have used in several years.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but cleans well.  I have oily skin &amp; this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t cause me to have breakouts. The scent is nice without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Too small of a bottle.</li>
            <li> Bottle had leaked all over package contents.  The lid was loose and the bottle opening did not have a securing seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you must order this product, order it completely separate from other items you don&#x27;t want soaked in soap.</li>
            <li> I look forward to this refreshing scent when cleaning off - but don&#x27;t be fooled, it&#x27;s also an excellent soap and is works great after an afternoon of gardening.</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash.  I bought it because it is paraben and sulfate free.  I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for a good moisturizing family body wash.  Mama&#x27;s angel is still in first place even though I do not care too much for the fragrance.  This had a nice fragrance but it dried our skin out to the point where the babies got the small eczemza like bumps.</li>
            <li> Refreshing scent, keeps my skin healthy and doesn&#x27;t dry me out!! I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s common citrus perfume. but It&#x27;s not stay after shower.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and feel.  But too watery for me.  Wasteful, and does not last long.</li>
            <li> Smells good , and well priced at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is very thin in its viscosity. It takes a large amount of product to get your hair washed. It did not last very long and I felt the price was too high for what the product was.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees. Could not &amp;#34; bee&amp;#34; any better. Will &amp;#34;hive&amp;#34; to get more.</li>
            <li> Have had mixed feelings about Burt&#x27;s Bees- I think they make a fair product but their prices are bit steep. However Ive used their hand wash along with lipglosses and enjoyed the scents so I thought I would give this a try as an Amazon add-on.  I do love the smell of ginger so was looking forward to trying this product.  I realize bath gels/soaps all vary in thickness and richness and that is not what I base my &amp;#34;likeability&amp;#34; on- it is the scent and/or skin softening ability. This product is not at all thick and rich, but my biggest disappointment though is in the scent. Even if I use alot of product there is very little ginger or citrus scent.  Sure it gets me clean (i suppose it does even with very little lather) but the scent is usually what sets one cleaner apart from the others. This one did not live up to the Burt&#x27;s Bees reputation.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product, Just to slummy for me, unlike the peppermint one.</li>
            <li> This lathers very well &amp; smells great. Not moisturizing but if you like a really clean clean or live in a humid place in the summer like me-it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite body wash.  It smells kind of funny and you need a lot to make it work.  I actually does not think it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old male. My girlfriend pretty much lives with me so I thought I&#x27;d get her a bottle of her own body wash. The reason I went with Burt&#x27;s Bees is because theirs products are known for being 99%+ natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this body wash being a bit &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;, which is true. If you&#x27;re expecting something with the same consistency as, let&#x27;s say, Old Spice or Dove Men body wash then you&#x27;ll be disappointed. It&#x27;s almost as &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; as baby oil, maybe a tad thicker. The downside to this is that you have a harder time pouring it out which means you&#x27;ll probably use more than is necessary, so this 12-ounce bottle won&#x27;t last you very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another common complaint is the smell. It does NOT smell &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; like other reviews have mentioned. It literally smells like ginger with a strong hint of grapefruit after you lather it up. If anything, it smells pleasant. It totally helps wake you up because the smell is very citrusy. It doesn&#x27;t have the same effect as smelling salt but it does give you a slight kick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body wash won&#x27;t leave your skin dry which is a plus. It actually makes it pretty smooth and you absolutely feel clean after. If you don&#x27;t mind the runny consistency and citrusy scent, go ahead and give this a try.</li>
            <li> yummy great price here on amazon!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of skin allergies, and I found this product listed on the EWG SkinDeep database.  Decided to try it out, and it&#x27;s actually a very nice body wash.  Didn&#x27;t dry out my skin (like some do) or alternately leave it feeling too oily.  But, it doesn&#x27;t exactly leave your skin feeling moisturized and soft, so I still had to apply a body butter after cleansing with it.  The scent is great and not overpowering--I absolutely love the scent grapefruit and ginger. I have perfume allergies, but didn&#x27;t have a reaction (headache, nasal pressure, etc) to this. If you have allergies and want a good, clean feeling body wash, this will be a great product for you.</li>
            <li> Great bodywash if you need something that&#x27;s hypoallergenic and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering perfume smell. a a a a a</li>
            <li> I love this body wash because it is so invigorating and refreshing. It smells so good and the lather is fabulous on your pouf. All Burt&#x27;s Bees products are wonderful and I recommend these to everyone. :)</li>
            <li> The soap is... fair.  I find it to be similar to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s oil soap in consistency and lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance leaves something to be desired in my opinion.  It smells like citronella insect repellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap works.  There is nothing wrong with it.  But it is certainly not an OH MY GOODNESS experience.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective cleanser, putting my old bar soap to shame and showing how little connection there is between cleaning power and &amp;#34;lather.&amp;#34; The product also stimulates the skin and improves the mood. Its ginger and citrus odor is pleasant, not too sweet, maybe a bit strong. I especially like the dispenser bottle, which makes it easy to get just the amount needed with no waste. Though not especially thick, the liquid is easy to apply.  I attach no importance to products&#x27; claims of being &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; but unless some kind of irritation were to develop with continued use, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s much to like here and almost nothing to criticize. I haven&#x27;t been able to confirm, however, that ginger has a benefit when applied to the skin (nor does the product appear to claim any).</li>
            <li> I break out easily and have been trying different washes I think I finally found the one for me. Leaves my skin smooth and no dry or flakiness or cracking.</li>
            <li> Wonderfrul smell, body wash or body bath your cant go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural, but yet smelling nice and fresh. I chose Burt&#x27;s Bees, because it is known for natural products, right? Well, then I noticed that it actually is only 99.3% natural... Well, for me 100% is natural and anything below is simply NOT. SO I am pretty bummed about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not as refreshing as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is not very thick, not very foaming...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this and love the way it smells, but there is a small percentage of it that I don&#x27;t like. The synthetic fragrance has to go! I used to purchase this regularly, but I stopped when I noticed.</li>
            <li> My body wash came in a wide, short bottle versus the tall, thin bottle pictured, but that does not matter. It is incredible! I have always enjoyed Burt&#x27;s Bees products and had no idea that they made body wash! So, when I made this discovery, I immediately made the purchase. I love this product. It is natural, gentle on the skin, and the smell is wonderful- energizing! I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I got this as an alternative to my Bath &amp;  Body Works Orange Ginger Body Wash (which I loved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is too watery and the smell is more like hardwood floor cleaner than anything. I could have effectively made the same thing at home for cheaper with some unscented castile soap and a few drops of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it because it does the job and the &amp;#34;Orange Glo&amp;#34; smell doesn&#x27;t seem to linger too badly, but once it&#x27;s gone I won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees continues to meet the needs of those seeking stellar products that are safe and free of sodium laurel sulfates and parabens! Being a BC survivor, I&#x27;m extremely cautious about the products I use. Citrus &amp; Ginger Root Body Wash has a refreshing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering. I have dry skin and it helps to alleviate the dryness. I follow up with Burt&#x27;s Bees Body Lotion, Cocoa and Cupuacu Butters and my skin is good to go! This is another &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; product for me!</li>
            <li> 99.3% natural &amp; sulfate-free, what more can I say!!!  This is a great body wash that smells very good, not too strong and not too weak, very spa like!  The only complaint I have is that you can go through a body rather quickly as it is not very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this body wash for anyone who is trying to go natural and who also likes the light smell of ginger and the clean feeling this body wash provides while still being fairly environmentally friendly!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product just as described.</li>
            <li> Yummmmm. My new favorite smell! Leaves skin soft, too :)</li>
            <li> Fast and friendly! Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this body wash.  Cheaper here than at the local health food store.  Love the scent and the way it makes my dry skin feel.</li>
            <li> Like a dish soap.  I hate the smell .</li>
            <li> Another wonderful product from Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for about a year and am very satisfied with it. It smells great and leaves my skin soft and nurtured.</li>
            <li> 2 stars for scent, but that&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin except on my face (which please don&#x27;t use this on your face!) but it actually was too acidic for my skin. It was weird but it sort of burned, especially if you got near some &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, great buy!</li>
            <li> It smells like ginger (no citrus) to me and it doesn&#x27;t lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any difference on my skin and it doesn&#x27;t thicken when rubbed together in my hands like other body washes do. It literally runs off onto the ground as soon as I squirt it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the burts bee&#x27;s product line but this one will not be purchased again. It&#x27;s not bad, it just doesn&#x27;t really compare.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be giving reviews for body wash but here it goes! Burt&#x27;s Bees has always been known for their high quality products, so I decided to give the body wash a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent scent to me but it doesn&#x27;t last very long and may not be for everyone. I definitely get the hints of citrus and ginger, it reminds me of a scent from soaps you would get at high class hotels. The consistency of this body wash is a bit soupy and because of that, you will end up using quite a bit of it each time. The product also almost has no lather whatsoever. As one reviewer put it, it might even be a good hand soap for you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I feel clean and smell clean coming out of the shower so it seems to be doing its&#x27; job! However, if you do plan to buy this one and continue to use it, you may have to buy a few as it probably won&#x27;t last very long. It&#x27;s also a little bit pricey for a body wash but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, not too soapy, love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap, I buy it often and recommend. Great &#x27;natural&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to body wash. I liked the feel of it and the fragrance was pleasant without smelling like something you&#x27;d eat! Sadly, I have been unable to find it any more in our local stores. A search of the Burt&#x27;s Bees website doesn&#x27;t even show this. Looks like they have moved on to other fragrances that are more fruity. Guess, I&#x27;ll be hunting another brand which is too bad as I really liked this. I&#x27;ve stocked up on these from Amazon, but don&#x27;t expect them to continue carrying them. So get them while you can!</li>
            <li> This body wash smells AMAZING. I really want to love it because I&#x27;m obsessed with the smell. However, I had to go with 4 stars because the consistency is very thin/runny. I feel like I waste so much of it because the product will slide out of my hands before I have a chance to lather it on my body. It&#x27;s kind of oily, which I think is what causes it to make my skin so soft, but the downside is it means it&#x27;s messier and more difficult to apply. I noticed other reviews saying this caused them to break out and I can see how that would happen with the oiliness of the product. Personally I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that and this does make my skin soft and smells so refreshing!</li>
            <li> This was a stocking stuffer for my husband.  He loves Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  The price was pretty economical...very competitive with stores.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice. While I like to use product&#x27;s from Burt&#x27;s Bees, this just doesn&#x27;t lather thhe scent is nice. I won&#x27;t buy it again for this reason.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the fragrance.  No one in the family would use.  Threw it out.</li>
            <li> nothing special but not a bad product..the smell is a bit interesting. There are too many competitive product out there. if you like the natural factor try it</li>
            <li> Like with most Burt&#x27;s Bees products this feels genuine.  It smells like grapefruit and ginger and my skin loves it.  I can&#x27;t wait to get in the shower!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body wash.  The only thing I would note about it is that it is not as thick as most which surprised me.  When you use it be prepared for it to seem a little watery.  Works beautifully to keep me clean though!!</li>
            <li> This body wash is wonderful- it smells great and no bizarre/unnecessary ingredients- can recognize everything listed!</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hype is. Burts bees try to sell themselves as a clean, natural brand but they are really not. Not excited about the ingredients in this, or the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, only complaint was the packaging - this shipped with several other items, including some shampoos, and while the shampoos were wrapped in plastic baggies, this product was NOT and so leaked and got all over the other contents. I only lost maybe a finger&#x27;s worth of soap, but it has a distinct scent and is vsry sticky when not worked with water. Was more annoying that problematic, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have been looking for something that is less agitating to me, and this seems to be the right choice.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.  Good cleanser.</li>
            <li> tough to get a good lather going. the smell was nice but because of the aforementioned reason this product lasted way less time than others ive dealt with.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t do well without a sponge or a loofah. It won&#x27;t make suds otherwise. Smells good, but bottle pours out way too much at a time. Overall, gotta pass on this one next time.</li>
            <li> Used for years and love the scent, hypoallergenic quality, and environmentally safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> Just okay.  The fragrance is unobtrusive but not as good as it sounds.  The consistency of the liquid is very thin, which leads to a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> The soap works very well. It is a bit runny so you have to be carful when you apply it to what ever you are using to wash with. It has a very pleasant aroma and leaves you feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of fragrance to wake me up but not leaving me smelling overbearing after my shower in the AM.  Fresh and eye opening. Love it.</li>
            <li> I didnt think i would like this but its amazing! I do wish the beautiful smell lingered, though. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my husband who will use no other body wash. The smell is very pleasant. I don&#x27;t find it to be as thick and moisturizing as I personally like but it does not leave you feeling dried out as do some washes.</li>
            <li> Love the smell--it&#x27;s so crisp &amp; refreshing. It cleans well and is gentle on my sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but I found this nothing special.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good product, and I like that it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees - good company. I don&#x27;t love the smell though.  I am in search of something that smells better.</li>
