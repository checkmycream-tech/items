            <li>Carry in your purse for a great &#x27;</li>
            <li>The compact also have a nice size mirror for the perfect application.  </li>
            <li>E.L.F is a great brand.</li>
            <li>This is a great product I will always use.</li>
            <li>Great prize</li>
            <li>love e.l.f&#x27;s brushe&#x27;s and eye shades but not this product!!</li>
            <li>The case is very nice, and the colors what I needed.</li>
            <li>the colors pigmentation wasn&#x27;t great, they feel good on the skin but don&#x27;t do muchh</li>
            <li>However this product would be great if u have a fair complexion.</li>
            <li>and you are good</li>
            <li>Does a fair job of covering up.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t conceal as well as others and I have to wear a good primer underneath.</li>
            <li>But I just don&#x27;t find that this concealer is that good.</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about this product an the others I bought</li>
            <li>I thought the E.L.F. product was fair in price and there seems to be a fair amount of product in the case</li>
            <li>The style of the case and how it&#x27;s presented is very lovely, but the concealers leaves my face feeling and looking &amp;#34;cakie&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased that something so inexpensive works so well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I totally love this make up palate!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>As an over 40 exmodel, I love this!</li>
            <li>But it is an amazing product</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Was kind of oily and waxy.</li>
            <li>The colors are perfect but the product is powdery and doesn&#x27;t apply or blend very well.  </li>
            <li>This covers and color corrects nicely but no matter what I tried it disappears within a couple hours.</li>
            <li>and it does that job perfectly, the green covers up redness wonderfully</li>
            <li>It kind of sits on the skin and doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s works effectively all day.</li>
            <li>and I honestly do recommend this concealer.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, it didn&#x27;t work for me, but I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>&amp; they work great as a combination for full coverage corrective concealer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice soft, creamy consistency, works perfect on my skin tone!</li>
            <li>Each color has its own purpose, goes on easily.</li>
            <li>the delivery was super fast and the product is great quality!</li>
            <li>If you can figure out a way to make it work for you, to make it blend better, let me know.</li>
            <li>Are you kidding 10 score love</li>
            <li>it love it packaged</li>
            <li>This worked just as well, includes more colors, and has much better ingredients.</li>
            <li>I guess this corrective concealer is an okay product</li>
            <li>I have to mix it with concealer to make it a better consistency.</li>
            <li>It makes me more confidant in my appearance.</li>
            <li>Love the product..got it yesterdayafter watching some youtube videos and it WORKS.</li>
            <li>I got the product 2 days earlier than what was expected...which is great!</li>
            <li>Thank you for checking out my review.   :)</li>
            <li>I love corrective concealers.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim after looking through some make-up sites, and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and it seems to brighten up my face :).  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of this but don&#x27;t like the formula.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Then I put my light concealer on top.</li>
            <li>Perfect pink tone for under eyes and under foundation.</li>
            <li>I kept it anyway because those were most important to me and I can use those shades of beige, but it is misleading.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do me any good or use.</li>
            <li>Just a basic concealer good for the price too!</li>
            <li>Easy to blend and lasts all day with no caking.</li>
            <li>All colors blend easily on the skin and did not cause any irritation for me</li>
            <li>Creamy smooth easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Colors are fine but it doesn&#x27;t seem to set, even with powder.</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>They go on smooth and cover well.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth and does not crease or cake up .</li>
            <li>The green hue worked perfect at covering up the redness I get.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have had a great experience with this.</li>
            <li>and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them below</li>
            <li>Goes on very well and blends nicely.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it feels smooth to me</li>
            <li>The green is perfect for redness.</li>
            <li>Made sure I used the right color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very intriguing with all the colors</li>
            <li>The texture is very smooth, and the coverage is good as long as you pat the product on and then dab concealer over it with a sponge.  </li>
            <li>This is quick and easy to use with the included brush.  </li>
            <li>The yellow, for under eye circles is amazing!</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this product.</li>
            <li>the little applicator brush is nice, too, though a proper concealer brush would be best for this product.</li>
            <li>The pink is great for brightening your eyes .</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is the price.</li>
            <li>The product itself is even better, I really reccomend this.</li>
            <li>But for the price its not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>is not the best but is ok, it helps a little bit, too soft, but better than nothing, Next time will look for a better quality</li>
            <li>However, if you can splurge on a higher end concealer palette, I strongly suggest you do so.</li>
            <li>The quality is great (as I&#x27;ve found with all other e.l.f. products).</li>
            <li>Great coverage and the color is light, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have many issues with my face as I am getting older.  </li>
            <li>It becomes chalky if I don&#x27;t smear it quickly.</li>
            <li>Now, I am a huge e.l.f. fan, and an avid user of their eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li>Great coverage for dark spot.</li>
            <li>As a result, it seems to disappear as the day goes on, but it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to the yellow the most too!</li>
            <li>Who would of thought these colors can do so much!!</li>
            <li>Great little compact for color correcting.</li>
            <li>The green is great for covering up and counteracting any redness you may have on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well on blemishes which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Sooner then i expected which was good.</li>
            <li>So far I love these.</li>
            <li>If you find my review useful please let me know</li>
            <li>Once I put the yellow concealer on, I use my own flesh colored concealer (Cover Girl) over it.  </li>
            <li>It came in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li>This one went right into the trash</li>
            <li>the price is right.  </li>
            <li>So it isworth the investment if you have the right skin type.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the concealer before and recognize right away what I received is not at all</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty light and do not provide much coverage.  </li>
            <li>well sized shampoo clean place as stated improves really happens in 1 day by 3 to 5 almost cleared up or gone.  </li>
            <li>Got here super fast</li>
            <li>The yellow works really great to neutralize my blue under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Works better on just red spots, etc.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I love ELF products and I was looking for a variety of concealer colors for various issues.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t get the colors depicted in the picture.</li>
            <li>Blue for under the eye is the one I use the most.</li>
            <li>Covers exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>It is decent but it dries so quick</li>
            <li>I bought this concealer compact initially just to even my skin tone, and it was okay for that.</li>
            <li>very creamy and pigmented!</li>
            <li>I ordered this recently and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work....</li>
            <li>but it really does!</li>
            <li>I love that there are multiple uses in one compact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this little palette.</li>
            <li>This works just fine, when mixed with a bit of lotion to make it blend more to my personal liking.</li>
            <li>Great for dark under eye circles &amp; red blotchy patches.</li>
            <li>Very nice to have various colors to work with for the dark circle under the eyes.</li>
            <li>maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m using too much too fast.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t soft or useful in applying the product.</li>
            <li>I am still testing, but the concealer is really creamy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent 20 minutes trying to cover a spot with the concealer and no matter how many coats I added, nothing got covered.</li>
            <li>and I was really looking forward to this,</li>
            <li>The two beige colors are very creamy, but I didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t need beige concealers.</li>
            <li>off, the packaging is very flimsy and cheap-looking.</li>
            <li>ELF cosmetics at target are MUCH cheaper than here.  </li>
            <li>This set works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very thankful for this kit (I have 2), because I have some redness on my cheeks that needs covered.</li>
            <li>This concealer is very oily, and doesn&#x27;t really set (in my experience).  </li>
            <li>I got it very soon</li>
            <li>It comes on very smooth, however the coverage seems average to me.</li>
            <li>Nothing seems to really work; any way I try it, it either disappears and leaves flakes, or it is super obvious.</li>
            <li>first I was surprised that these concealers existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference between this product and a normal colored concealer.</li>
            <li>I love this product it works covers dark circles blemishes and hilites.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll usually use the same pat-method when putting liquid or cream foundation over it, and then set with a gentle application of powder; just make sure to smooth out any that&#x27;s fallen into the creases between applying &amp; setting with the powder, and then it wears all day.</li>
            <li>I still use it from time-to-time, and I think it is actually a decent product for its price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s alright for what it is, i can definitely recommend it for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>I was having high hopes that this product will blend well, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product; the correction creams could be a little softer in consistency.  </li>
            <li>directions said to apply it before foundation, but I generally apply foundation first and then try to get a bit lighter on the concealer.</li>
            <li>spot or line your face and blend it out with some normal concealer and add your foundation</li>
            <li>That is fine and dandy, but it just seems it can&#x27;t cover up my dark circles or the redness around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are not creamy they don&#x27;t smooth on well and just make your lines more exaggerated.</li>
            <li>Use the pink shade to brighten the inner and putter corner of the eyes for a more awakened look.</li>
            <li>Next I tried using the concealer first and then applying foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just doesn&#x27;t last long as there really isn&#x27;t much in there at all.</li>
            <li>far I have bought 4 different yellow tube concealers from other brands and thankfully they are like magic!</li>
            <li>Love the blue to hid my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I apply this before foundation and it greatly minimizes the hyperpigmentation scars (green) and the dark circles under my eyes( yellow).</li>
            <li>This corrector offers little coverage and sits on top of my skin, looking really obvious.</li>
            <li>It all came in one piece and on the box it provided clear instructions on what colors are for what.</li>
            <li>so I think I&#x27;m in the clear).</li>
            <li>did and everyone was surprised at how well is covered up her</li>
            <li>- this is the second &#x27;slickest&#x27; and didn&#x27;t really do much for</li>
            <li>and WOW what a mistake</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really flimsy to open</li>
            <li>The coverage it offers is abysmal.</li>
            <li>The red hue works really well at concealing the darkness around my eye area.  </li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am so pleasantly surprised by how well this corrective concealer set works.  </li>
            <li>I found the E.L.F. product to not be heavy, it&#x27;s creamy in texture and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is not as thick as you would think it is.</li>
            <li>This is the 1st concealer I ever purchased and mainly for the yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The main problem I came across is the actual product.</li>
            <li>The yellow is just to cover normal sark circles, the pink is to brighten your eye, the green is good if you have red, irritated looking skin, and the blue gives you even complexion.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest and say that so far, I have only used the yellow and the pink concealer but not the blue or green.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any type of yellow or pink concealer before, so I have no other product to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Usually I find their packaging very neat and efficient but this just looked really crappy.</li>
            <li>, I received different colors completely.</li>
            <li>I love this product when I do not want to look so tired.</li>
            <li>The yellow covers dark eye circles fabulously and the green covers red spots really well.</li>
            <li>However, If you are looking for more of a heavy coverage, I recommend you use a heavy colored creamed foundation, or eye</li>
            <li>Especially for the price, I would definitely recommend this, especially to someone with either really uneven skin tones, or super fair-skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t do anything to minimize dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Pay extra and get a not dry version of this</li>
            <li>It really does help to make my eyes look a little bigger</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the colors pigmentation wasn&#x27;t great, they feel good on the skin but don&#x27;t do muchh</li>
            <li> However this product would be great if u have a fair complexion.</li>
            <li> and you are good</li>
            <li> Does a fair job of covering up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t conceal as well as others and I have to wear a good primer underneath.</li>
            <li> But I just don&#x27;t find that this concealer is that good.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this product an the others I bought</li>
            <li> I thought the E.L.F. product was fair in price and there seems to be a fair amount of product in the case</li>
            <li> The style of the case and how it&#x27;s presented is very lovely, but the concealers leaves my face feeling and looking &amp;#34;cakie&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased that something so inexpensive works so well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I totally love this make up palate!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> As an over 40 exmodel, I love this!</li>
            <li> But it is an amazing product</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Was kind of oily and waxy.</li>
            <li> The colors are perfect but the product is powdery and doesn&#x27;t apply or blend very well.  </li>
            <li> This covers and color corrects nicely but no matter what I tried it disappears within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> and it does that job perfectly, the green covers up redness wonderfully</li>
            <li> It kind of sits on the skin and doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s works effectively all day.</li>
            <li> and I honestly do recommend this concealer.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, it didn&#x27;t work for me, but I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> &amp; they work great as a combination for full coverage corrective concealer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice soft, creamy consistency, works perfect on my skin tone!</li>
            <li> Each color has its own purpose, goes on easily.</li>
            <li> the delivery was super fast and the product is great quality!</li>
            <li> If you can figure out a way to make it work for you, to make it blend better, let me know.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding 10 score love</li>
            <li> it love it packaged</li>
            <li> This worked just as well, includes more colors, and has much better ingredients.</li>
            <li> I guess this corrective concealer is an okay product</li>
            <li> I have to mix it with concealer to make it a better consistency.</li>
            <li> It makes me more confidant in my appearance.</li>
            <li> Love the product..got it yesterdayafter watching some youtube videos and it WORKS.</li>
            <li> I got the product 2 days earlier than what was expected...which is great!</li>
            <li> Thank you for checking out my review.   :)</li>
            <li> I love corrective concealers.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after looking through some make-up sites, and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and it seems to brighten up my face :).  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of this but don&#x27;t like the formula.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> Then I put my light concealer on top.</li>
            <li> Perfect pink tone for under eyes and under foundation.</li>
            <li> I kept it anyway because those were most important to me and I can use those shades of beige, but it is misleading.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do me any good or use.</li>
            <li> Just a basic concealer good for the price too!</li>
            <li> Easy to blend and lasts all day with no caking.</li>
            <li> All colors blend easily on the skin and did not cause any irritation for me</li>
            <li> Creamy smooth easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Colors are fine but it doesn&#x27;t seem to set, even with powder.</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li> They go on smooth and cover well.</li>
            <li> It goes on silky smooth and does not crease or cake up .</li>
            <li> The green hue worked perfect at covering up the redness I get.  </li>
            <li> Overall I have had a great experience with this.</li>
            <li> and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them below</li>
            <li> Goes on very well and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it feels smooth to me</li>
            <li> The green is perfect for redness.</li>
            <li> Made sure I used the right color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very intriguing with all the colors</li>
            <li> The texture is very smooth, and the coverage is good as long as you pat the product on and then dab concealer over it with a sponge.  </li>
            <li> This is quick and easy to use with the included brush.  </li>
            <li> The yellow, for under eye circles is amazing!</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product.</li>
            <li> the little applicator brush is nice, too, though a proper concealer brush would be best for this product.</li>
            <li> The pink is great for brightening your eyes .</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is the price.</li>
            <li> The product itself is even better, I really reccomend this.</li>
            <li> But for the price its not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> is not the best but is ok, it helps a little bit, too soft, but better than nothing, Next time will look for a better quality</li>
            <li> However, if you can splurge on a higher end concealer palette, I strongly suggest you do so.</li>
            <li> The quality is great (as I&#x27;ve found with all other e.l.f. products).</li>
            <li> Great coverage and the color is light, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have many issues with my face as I am getting older.  </li>
            <li> It becomes chalky if I don&#x27;t smear it quickly.</li>
            <li> Now, I am a huge e.l.f. fan, and an avid user of their eyeshadow palettes.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for dark spot.</li>
            <li> As a result, it seems to disappear as the day goes on, but it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the yellow the most too!</li>
            <li> Who would of thought these colors can do so much!!</li>
            <li> Great little compact for color correcting.</li>
            <li> The green is great for covering up and counteracting any redness you may have on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well on blemishes which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Sooner then i expected which was good.</li>
            <li> So far I love these.</li>
            <li> If you find my review useful please let me know</li>
            <li> Once I put the yellow concealer on, I use my own flesh colored concealer (Cover Girl) over it.  </li>
            <li> It came in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li> This one went right into the trash</li>
            <li> the price is right.  </li>
            <li> So it isworth the investment if you have the right skin type.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the concealer before and recognize right away what I received is not at all</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty light and do not provide much coverage.  </li>
            <li> well sized shampoo clean place as stated improves really happens in 1 day by 3 to 5 almost cleared up or gone.  </li>
            <li> Got here super fast</li>
            <li> The yellow works really great to neutralize my blue under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Works better on just red spots, etc.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I love ELF products and I was looking for a variety of concealer colors for various issues.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t get the colors depicted in the picture.</li>
            <li> Blue for under the eye is the one I use the most.</li>
            <li> Covers exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> It is decent but it dries so quick</li>
            <li> I bought this concealer compact initially just to even my skin tone, and it was okay for that.</li>
            <li> very creamy and pigmented!</li>
            <li> I ordered this recently and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work....</li>
            <li> but it really does!</li>
            <li> I love that there are multiple uses in one compact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this little palette.</li>
            <li> This works just fine, when mixed with a bit of lotion to make it blend more to my personal liking.</li>
            <li> Great for dark under eye circles &amp; red blotchy patches.</li>
            <li> Very nice to have various colors to work with for the dark circle under the eyes.</li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m using too much too fast.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t soft or useful in applying the product.</li>
            <li> I am still testing, but the concealer is really creamy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 20 minutes trying to cover a spot with the concealer and no matter how many coats I added, nothing got covered.</li>
            <li> and I was really looking forward to this,</li>
            <li> The two beige colors are very creamy, but I didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t need beige concealers.</li>
            <li> off, the packaging is very flimsy and cheap-looking.</li>
            <li> ELF cosmetics at target are MUCH cheaper than here.  </li>
            <li> This set works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very thankful for this kit (I have 2), because I have some redness on my cheeks that needs covered.</li>
            <li> This concealer is very oily, and doesn&#x27;t really set (in my experience).  </li>
            <li> I got it very soon</li>
            <li> It comes on very smooth, however the coverage seems average to me.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to really work; any way I try it, it either disappears and leaves flakes, or it is super obvious.</li>
            <li> first I was surprised that these concealers existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference between this product and a normal colored concealer.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works covers dark circles blemishes and hilites.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll usually use the same pat-method when putting liquid or cream foundation over it, and then set with a gentle application of powder; just make sure to smooth out any that&#x27;s fallen into the creases between applying &amp; setting with the powder, and then it wears all day.</li>
            <li> I still use it from time-to-time, and I think it is actually a decent product for its price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alright for what it is, i can definitely recommend it for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> I was having high hopes that this product will blend well, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product; the correction creams could be a little softer in consistency.  </li>
            <li> directions said to apply it before foundation, but I generally apply foundation first and then try to get a bit lighter on the concealer.</li>
            <li> spot or line your face and blend it out with some normal concealer and add your foundation</li>
            <li> That is fine and dandy, but it just seems it can&#x27;t cover up my dark circles or the redness around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are not creamy they don&#x27;t smooth on well and just make your lines more exaggerated.</li>
            <li> Use the pink shade to brighten the inner and putter corner of the eyes for a more awakened look.</li>
            <li> Next I tried using the concealer first and then applying foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just doesn&#x27;t last long as there really isn&#x27;t much in there at all.</li>
            <li> far I have bought 4 different yellow tube concealers from other brands and thankfully they are like magic!</li>
            <li> Love the blue to hid my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I apply this before foundation and it greatly minimizes the hyperpigmentation scars (green) and the dark circles under my eyes( yellow).</li>
            <li> This corrector offers little coverage and sits on top of my skin, looking really obvious.</li>
            <li> It all came in one piece and on the box it provided clear instructions on what colors are for what.</li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;m in the clear).</li>
            <li> did and everyone was surprised at how well is covered up her</li>
            <li> - this is the second &#x27;slickest&#x27; and didn&#x27;t really do much for</li>
            <li> and WOW what a mistake</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really flimsy to open</li>
            <li> The coverage it offers is abysmal.</li>
            <li> The red hue works really well at concealing the darkness around my eye area.  </li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also have incredibly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised by how well this corrective concealer set works.  </li>
            <li> I found the E.L.F. product to not be heavy, it&#x27;s creamy in texture and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is not as thick as you would think it is.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st concealer I ever purchased and mainly for the yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The main problem I came across is the actual product.</li>
            <li> The yellow is just to cover normal sark circles, the pink is to brighten your eye, the green is good if you have red, irritated looking skin, and the blue gives you even complexion.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say that so far, I have only used the yellow and the pink concealer but not the blue or green.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any type of yellow or pink concealer before, so I have no other product to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Usually I find their packaging very neat and efficient but this just looked really crappy.</li>
            <li> , I received different colors completely.</li>
            <li> I love this product when I do not want to look so tired.</li>
            <li> The yellow covers dark eye circles fabulously and the green covers red spots really well.</li>
            <li> However, If you are looking for more of a heavy coverage, I recommend you use a heavy colored creamed foundation, or eye</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, I would definitely recommend this, especially to someone with either really uneven skin tones, or super fair-skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything to minimize dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Pay extra and get a not dry version of this</li>
            <li> It really does help to make my eyes look a little bigger</li>
            <li> Blends very well over a primer; I use this for my eyes primarily, yellow for the dark circles and pink for any blue areas which does well to highlight.</li>
            <li> I use the yellow and pink the most, and sometimes the blue or green, so I run out of the yellow and pink and have the blue &amp; green with plenty left.  </li>
            <li> Then I dab a little bit of the pink E.L.F. concealer  (just a little bit) at the outer edges of my eyes and smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the yellow and green shade works wonders!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product due to the reviews, and was kind of disappointed when I received it and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li> The green works so well on the redness around my nose, and the yellow really neutralizes my deep, dark undereye circles.  </li>
            <li> so I get red patches sometimes) and the blue and pink are supposed to be for brightening.</li>
            <li> This will last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> : Use the yellow shade to conceal dark circles or bruises that are purple or blue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a yellow or a pink.</li>
            <li> I only use the pink for that purpose but it feels and looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pink is to be used for places such as the outer corners of the eyes to help brighten up your face.  </li>
            <li> I will probably go with something a little bit different the next time I look for a corrective concealer.</li>
            <li> Let it dry then apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of complaints about how the product was not very pigmented and instead of yellow and pink, it came in 2 shades of tan.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots, so I use the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;, then apply regular concealer, then powder.</li>
            <li> I use the yellow to help conceal dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> According to package instructions, the yellow concealer is to hide dark circles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I find that the yellow accentuates the nooks and crannies under my eyes instead of covering my dark circles</li>
            <li> I have purchased the concealer with yellow, blue, green and pink and that wasn&#x27;t i received</li>
            <li> Let me first off say that I am not a woman who wears make-up; however, I am slowly making my way into wearing a little bit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it, but the texture was just incredibly strange to me, a huge turn-off, and it attributed to my further disappointed as I found it hard to apply and blend onto my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I basically have only used the yellow and the green, but it works rather well!  </li>
            <li> Nothing flashy or bold, just fresh-faced.</li>
            <li> I got green and pink, but the other two are regular beige concealer colors, not corrective shades like yellow or purple.</li>
            <li> The orange (which looks pink in the picture) is extremely thin and very light in color and doesn&#x27;t cover the veins or bags under my eyes because its so thin.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again and that&#x27;s to bad since I love the elf line</li>
            <li> The concealer was not really creamy or opaque.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but the concealer that I had so carefully applied &amp; blended all but disappeared.</li>
            <li> Only correct color was green.</li>
            <li> I am looking to invest into some actual green corrective concealer.</li>
            <li> The green is unfortunatrly, incredibly sheer.</li>
            <li> The pink color can be used to brighten the eye</li>
            <li> And the pink to hid the blemishes.</li>
            <li> Use the green to neutralize and cover red spots like pimples, scars or rosacea.</li>
            <li> The green neutralizes my red nose/cheek area as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got two beige colors - definitely not yellow, a pink and a green.</li>
            <li> It only came with the pink and the green, with two beige colors.</li>
            <li> Does the job somewhat but not pigmented enough for my extreme scarring (green).</li>
            <li> Just putting that out there just in case you were curious of other corrective concealers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply the green to the reddish areas and the yellow to the dark brownish/purplish areas.</li>
            <li> , I just have some dark melasma that is pretty much impossible to cover and look natural.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say &#x27;oily&#x27; but it is easier than the other colors to apply and blend.&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li> I usually use mabellene white concealer.  </li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t have access to a target, buy it for sure and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is alright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned so contouring can be a wee bit tricky.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try the other two colors, but I am already convinced of the quality and price worthiness of this product.</li>
            <li> I like other elf products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other e.l.f. products</li>
            <li> It does make the area where you apply it a little dry.</li>
            <li> The green is very thick and covers redness very well.</li>
            <li> Other than that it offers some coverage and the yellow is not overly exaggerated like some concealers.</li>
            <li> Except now I had what looked like dried flakes of blue on my nose and cheeks (where the green concealer was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The green I have is very dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yellow corrects dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li> dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it works wonderfully on my dark circles and bags.</li>
            <li> It helps with dark circles.</li>
            <li> Tried it for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to take care of those bothersome dark circles that like to creep up under my eyes as well as the redness I sometimes get with psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> It did cover dark circles and even out skin tone.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I ordered in April 2014</li>
            <li> If you are looking to conceal small minor blemishes, this product would work for you.</li>
            <li> I could never find anything to cover my dark circles under my eyes or my redness.</li>
            <li> Lots of people were wondering about the odd colors in this set.</li>
            <li> This was not true in my product.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I am on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is the brush it comes with, not great and mine broke after one use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little oily, set it with powder</li>
            <li> With a little foundation over these concealers I had the look</li>
            <li> This product is a creamy consistency and comes with a little application brush.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t interfered with how the foundation goes on or with its staying power even though it is a cream, and maybe a little bit greasy.</li>
            <li> These are very dry and are not creamy at all so its hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Felts like an unnecessary extra step that did not help.</li>
            <li> I do like the yellow pigment, but again, it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I woudn&#x27;t waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I still have no idea how to use the green.</li>
            <li> I now use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and the green is all gone</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are hard to cover.  </li>
            <li> well directions small brush</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> Regardless of that I still kept it, it&#x27;s not like it was so expensive, I still thought I&#x27;d get some use, but totally not buying ever again.</li>
            <li> There is hardly any pigment unless you glob it on, and I don&#x27;t like to use a ton of concealer.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the consistency of the concealers--the fact that, well, they weren&#x27;t consistent at all, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Waste of money even though it wasn&#x27;t that expensive and its now gonna just take up space at home</li>
            <li> Its very thick and very very hard to blend!&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li> Smelt like paint and wasn&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li> Its like wearing chapstick, greasy and its too thin</li>
            <li> but it is certainly not great.</li>
            <li> and I just hate how the packaging looks, but that&#x27;s a minor problem.</li>
            <li> Bad product and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It was a bit difficult to apply with this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> For the price &amp; selection...?...you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> However, when I finally tried it out I realized the formula of this product was horrible.</li>
            <li> It covers well and isn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> It then proceeds to crease really badly.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product one star, but for the price it isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> will not say I was completely disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed</li>
            <li> I switched to this product because I found my found out that the concealers I had been using contained all sorts of nasty chemicals that shouldn&#x27;t be on ones&#x27; face.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smooth and creamy.  A little goes a long way.  Easy to blend and lasts all day with no caking.</li>
            <li> I was having high hopes that this product will blend well, but it doesn&#x27;t. The style of the case and how it&#x27;s presented is very lovely, but the concealers leaves my face feeling and looking &amp;#34;cakie&amp;#34;.  If you can figure out a way to make it work for you, to make it blend better, let me know.</li>
            <li> this product arrived on time. Sooner then i expected which was good. However, when i tried it i didn&#x27;t work at all for me. You literally have to apply like 1,000 coats of this stuff for it to work. I don&#x27;t like it at all. Bad product and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It came in the mail super fast! And works amazing!!!!! I am diffently buy this again! They even gave a hand written note how great is that!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well on bruises. Works better on just red spots, etc.</li>
            <li> The concealer was not really creamy or opaque. Felts like an unnecessary extra step that did not help. Was kind of oily and waxy. Did not like this product.</li>
            <li> the colors pigmentation wasn&#x27;t great, they feel good on the skin but don&#x27;t do muchh</li>
            <li> Are you kidding 10 score love it love it packaged well directions small brush well sized shampoo clean place as stated improves really happens in 1 day by 3 to 5 almost cleared up or gone.  Creamy smooth easy to apply.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s not bad, just doesn&#x27;t last long as there really isn&#x27;t much in there at all. I Don&#x27;t like the application brush at all, so maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m using too much too fast.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product because I found my found out that the concealers I had been using contained all sorts of nasty chemicals that shouldn&#x27;t be on ones&#x27; face. :/  This worked just as well, includes more colors, and has much better ingredients.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I just wish I could get the colors in individual pots...I use the yellow and pink the most, and sometimes the blue or green, so I run out of the yellow and pink and have the blue &amp; green with plenty left.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I guess this corrective concealer is an okay product but I took off stars for the ease of application and how it lacked a creaminess. It was a bit difficult to apply with this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this product when I do not want to look so tired. Great buy! I use yellow, by the way. Let it dry then apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> Got here super fast but it&#x27;s a little oily, set it with powder and you should be fine. Does its job.</li>
            <li> Let me first off say that I am not a woman who wears make-up; however, I am slowly making my way into wearing a little bit. Nothing flashy or bold, just fresh-faced. I&#x27;ve been wearing flesh-colored concealer and powder foundation. That is fine and dandy, but it just seems it can&#x27;t cover up my dark circles or the redness around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was told about this product.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was surprised that these concealers existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There I began to research what each color did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yellow corrects dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;Blue corrects tanning issues.&lt;br /&gt;Green corrects redness and even covers up pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Pink gives the eyes brightness and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is Lavender concealer that is for yellowness on the skin that isn&#x27;t in this product. Just putting that out there just in case you were curious of other corrective concealers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I received my package today and decided to try it out and I have to say that it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Just spot or line your face and blend it out with some normal concealer and add your foundation and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell, my family were so impressed that even my Aunt wanted to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;She did and everyone was surprised at how well is covered up her dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, my Aunt and Grandmother are thinking about stealing this from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a great product, please give it a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product; the correction creams could be a little softer in consistency.  Does a fair job of covering up.</li>
            <li> The colors are perfect but the product is powdery and doesn&#x27;t apply or blend very well.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> This product works great with the e.l.f. concealer.  The only prodblems are it doesn&#x27;t have 2 applicators and no instructions as to what each color does.  The yellow is not yellow either.  But it works wonderfully on my dark circles and bags.</li>
            <li> I have bluish under-eye circles and red on my nose &amp; cheeks, and sometimes I also get monthly blemishes. My skin tone is almost olive. I tried this concealer and have some thoughts on each color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yellow - this is the &#x27;slickest&#x27; of all the colors. I won&#x27;t say &#x27;oily&#x27; but it is easier than the other colors to apply and blend.&lt;br /&gt;Blue - this color is drying to my skin&lt;br /&gt;Green - this color is drying to my skin&lt;br /&gt;Pink - this is the second &#x27;slickest&#x27; and didn&#x27;t really do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions said to apply it before foundation, but I generally apply foundation first and then try to get a bit lighter on the concealer. So I did foundation and then concealer and WOW what a mistake - it was very obvious that I was using concealer over my Sephora 10-hour foundation. Next I tried using the concealer first and then applying foundation. Maybe it&#x27;s me, but the concealer that I had so carefully applied &amp; blended all but disappeared. My circles were as blue as they were out of the shower, and my cheeks as red. Except now I had what looked like dried flakes of blue on my nose and cheeks (where the green concealer was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong? I&#x27;d applied the concealer with the brush and have tried blending it with A) the brush, B) my fingers C) a triangle sponge. Nothing seems to really work; any way I try it, it either disappears and leaves flakes, or it is super obvious.</li>
            <li> I usually use mabellene white concealer.  I thought a bit of tone might work well.  I couldn&#x27;t reall tell any difference in any of these colors or the white when applied to my face.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the yellow and green shade works wonders! Just a basic concealer good for the price too!</li>
            <li> This is a great pallet to concele hickeys😂😂. Lol</li>
            <li> This is the 1st concealer I ever purchased and mainly for the yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like this product at all! Its very thick and very very hard to blend!&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I have bought 4 different yellow tube concealers from other brands and thankfully they are like magic! Im still searching for the best one, but I do not recommend this at all, and you get what you pay for because its cheap!&lt;br /&gt;I love e.l.f&#x27;s brushe&#x27;s and eye shades but not this product!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I love ELF products and I was looking for a variety of concealer colors for various issues.  So far I love these. They go on smooth and cover well. the only thing I would change is the applicator. It wasn&#x27;t soft or useful in applying the product.</li>
            <li> These are very dry and are not creamy at all so its hard to apply. becayse they are not creamy they don&#x27;t smooth on well and just make your lines more exaggerated. I have to mix it with concealer to make it a better consistency. Pay extra and get a not dry version of this</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice soft, creamy consistency, works perfect on my skin tone! the little applicator brush is nice, too, though a proper concealer brush would be best for this product. definitely gonna buy again when i run out!</li>
            <li> I am still testing, but the concealer is really creamy. I have dark spots, so I use the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;, then apply regular concealer, then powder. It works for what i need it for.</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t get the colors depicted in the picture. I&#x27;ve got two beige colors - definitely not yellow, a pink and a green. Secondly, the concealer doesn&#x27;t cover - at all! I&#x27;ve spent 20 minutes trying to cover a spot with the concealer and no matter how many coats I added, nothing got covered. It&#x27;s very intriguing with all the colors and I was really looking forward to this, but it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of complaints about how the product was not very pigmented and instead of yellow and pink, it came in 2 shades of tan. This was not true in my product. It looked just like the photo online. It comes on very smooth, however the coverage seems average to me. I didn&#x27;t see much difference between this product and a normal colored concealer. Overall, it&#x27;s price is equal to the product.</li>
            <li> This is quick and easy to use with the included brush.  I have many issues with my face as I am getting older.  Blue for under the eye is the one I use the most.</li>
            <li> I totally love this make up palate! The yellow covers dark eye circles fabulously and the green covers red spots really well. It goes on silky smooth and does not crease or cake up . LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I did not get the colors shown in the picture. I don&#x27;t have a yellow or a pink. The green I have is very dry. The two beige colors are very creamy, but I didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t need beige concealers.</li>
            <li> These were not the colors I received!  Only correct color was green. Very very disappointed</li>
            <li> Does the job somewhat but not pigmented enough for my extreme scarring (green). I do like the yellow pigment, but again, it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!!!! The case is very nice, and the colors what I needed. This will last a long time!!!</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is the price. Its like wearing chapstick, greasy and its too thin so you dont get any color. Dont buy this product</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! Mine didn&#x27;t come with the 4 colors. Instead it has 2 brown shades for the yellow and blue... I was looking forward to the yellow the most too!</li>
            <li> This is not what I recieved. It only came with the pink and the green, with two beige colors. Don&#x27;t order this online.</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome and I will definitely buy this item again. It helps with dark circles. Thank you !</li>
            <li> Colors are fine but it doesn&#x27;t seem to set, even with powder. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I had been looking for corrective concealers at a low price. I only really need the green color as the only problem I have is redness from my KP. I had high hopes for this product due to the reviews, and was kind of disappointed when I received it and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the packaging is very flimsy and cheap-looking. Now, I am a huge e.l.f. fan, and an avid user of their eyeshadow palettes. Usually I find their packaging very neat and efficient but this just looked really crappy. It&#x27;s really flimsy to open and I just hate how the packaging looks, but that&#x27;s a minor problem. The main problem I came across is the actual product. I was very disappointed with the consistency of the concealers--the fact that, well, they weren&#x27;t consistent at all, if you know what I mean. I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it, but the texture was just incredibly strange to me, a huge turn-off, and it attributed to my further disappointed as I found it hard to apply and blend onto my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will not say I was completely disappointed with it. I still use it from time-to-time, and I think it is actually a decent product for its price. I would not purchase it again but I am not throwing it away either. I am looking to invest into some actual green corrective concealer.</li>
            <li> This covers and color corrects nicely but no matter what I tried it disappears within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the same, I received different colors completely. And when I check the labeling it even stated the colors on this description. Regardless of that I still kept it, it&#x27;s not like it was so expensive, I still thought I&#x27;d get some use, but totally not buying ever again. The coverage it offers is abysmal.</li>
            <li> It does make the area where you apply it a little dry. Other than that it offers some coverage and the yellow is not overly exaggerated like some concealers.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything to minimize dark circles under my eyes. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time.  However this product would be great if u have a fair complexion. It made my  skin very white and did not cover at all. I would not buy again and that&#x27;s to bad since I love the elf line</li>
            <li> For its price range, works well enough but it is certainly not great. The green is unfortunatrly, incredibly sheer. Even with primers and setters, this cakes and flakes. I bought it because I am on a tight budget. However, if you can splurge on a higher end concealer palette, I strongly suggest you do so.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for dark spot.</li>
            <li> Nah this didn&#x27;t help me</li>
            <li> Tried it for dark circles. I tried it under makeup, over makeup, with moisturizer, without moisturizer. Made sure I used the right color and it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Eww, the consistency of this stuff -- I&#x27;d never put it on my face.  This one went right into the trash</li>
            <li> The item I received is not the same as the item pictured. I have purchased the concealer with yellow, blue, green and pink and that wasn&#x27;t i received</li>
            <li> works as i would expect it to</li>
            <li> I like how each color is used for different problem areas on the face. Great coverage and the color is light, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Great product BUT I found it cheaper.....at target. I paid a dollar for this same thing. ELF cosmetics at target are MUCH cheaper than here.  But it is an amazing product and if you don&#x27;t have access to a target, buy it for sure and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Makes my eyes pop and covers the capillaries around my nose and cheeks.  Carry in your purse for a great &#x27;all in one&#x27; cover up......perfect for sleep over or a mini road trip. It has tons of uses and seems to last forever!!!  Who would of thought these colors can do so much!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to take care of those bothersome dark circles that like to creep up under my eyes as well as the redness I sometimes get with psoriasis.  The red hue works really well at concealing the darkness around my eye area.  The texture is very smooth, and the coverage is good as long as you pat the product on and then dab concealer over it with a sponge.  The green hue worked perfect at covering up the redness I get.  I was very pleased with how well it worked.  With a little foundation over these concealers I had the look I was after.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this little palette.</li>
            <li> Covers exactly as it says. Great for dark under eye circles &amp; red blotchy patches. It makes me more confidant in my appearance.</li>
            <li> Lots of people were wondering about the odd colors in this set. The yellow is just to cover normal sark circles, the pink is to brighten your eye, the green is good if you have red, irritated looking skin, and the blue gives you even complexion.</li>
            <li> It is decent but it dries so quick so I have to rush to blend it. It becomes chalky if I don&#x27;t smear it quickly. Other than that it is alright.</li>
            <li> Love the product..got it yesterdayafter watching some youtube videos and it WORKS.</li>
            <li> Overall I have had a great experience with this. I got the product 2 days earlier than what was expected...which is great! It all came in one piece and on the box it provided clear instructions on what colors are for what. The product itself is even better, I really reccomend this.</li>
            <li> This product has four different colors to tackle all your complexion problems.  I use the yellow to help conceal dark circles under the eyes.  It does a pretty good job but I always need something extra no matter what product I use.  My dark circles are hard to cover.  The green is great for covering up and counteracting any redness you may have on your skin.  The pink color can be used to brighten the eye are and the blue is used for evening out brown spots or tan lines.  This product is a creamy consistency and comes with a little application brush.  All colors blend easily on the skin and did not cause any irritation for me and I have sensitive skin.  The compact also have a nice size mirror for the perfect application.  If you find my review useful please let me know and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them below and I will answer them as quickly as possible.   Thank you for checking out my review.   :)</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use this item yet so I don&#x27;t know how it applies but as soon as I do use it I will let you know how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> The yellow, for under eye circles is amazing! It actually makes mine disappear. The pink is great for brightening your eyes . This product actually does what it says it will do. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It covers well and isn&#x27;t very expensive. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love corrective concealers. Being a makeup artist you want a product you can trust on your clients. I always buy different brands because one clients skin is not the same as the next. E.L.F is a great brand. This set works very well. It absolutley  does what it says. I always read the reviews on a product before I order it esp when ordering online. This product is to be used with the corrective color coding if you don&#x27;t use it the way it was meant it does not give you the effect you want. It did cover dark circles and even out skin tone. It worked well on redness.It worked very well on blemishes which is a huge plus. I love that it is not as thick as you would think it is. Goes on very well and blends nicely. I sooooo recommend the product.</li>
            <li> i like this make up&lt;br /&gt;I like it allot&lt;br /&gt;i have used it&lt;br /&gt;It works well&lt;br /&gt;it feels smooth to me</li>
            <li> I basically have only used the yellow and the green, but it works rather well!  I&#x27;d probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This corrector offers little coverage and sits on top of my skin, looking really obvious. It then proceeds to crease really badly. Overall just does not work.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after looking through some make-up sites, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The yellow is for covering up thing like under-eye circles and maybe bruises and it does that job perfectly, the green covers up redness wonderfully (I have sensitive skin so I get red patches sometimes) and the blue and pink are supposed to be for brightening. I only use the pink for that purpose but it feels and looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always put this concealer on before foundation because it is colored and it hasn&#x27;t interfered with how the foundation goes on or with its staying power even though it is a cream, and maybe a little bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned so contouring can be a wee bit tricky. I bought this concealer compact initially just to even my skin tone, and it was okay for that. Once I looked into some contouring this ended up being priceless. I also have incredibly sensitive skin and this has yet to irritate it(I&#x27;ve been using it for months, so I think I&#x27;m in the clear). Especially for the price, I would definitely recommend this, especially to someone with either really uneven skin tones, or super fair-skin like mine.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Helps to even out complexion</li>
            <li> Only comes with one brush for 4 different type concealers</li>
            <li> the delivery was super fast and the product is great quality! very creamy and pigmented! love it!</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is that it&#x27;s not quite as creamy as I&#x27;d like. But beside that, it does the job. I&#x27;m very thankful for this kit (I have 2), because I have some redness on my cheeks that needs covered. This works just fine, when mixed with a bit of lotion to make it blend more to my personal liking.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles under my eyes. This helps a lot. I apply the green to the reddish areas and the yellow to the dark brownish/purplish areas. Then I put my light concealer on top.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Doesn&#x27;t conceal as well as others and I have to wear a good primer underneath. Im satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice to have various colors to work with for the dark circle under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised by how well this corrective concealer set works.  The green works so well on the redness around my nose, and the yellow really neutralizes my deep, dark undereye circles.  I have yet to try the other two colors, but I am already convinced of the quality and price worthiness of this product.</li>
            <li> I woudn&#x27;t waste my money on this product. I thought I&#x27;d start with a cheaper corrective concealer quad because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on something I&#x27;d never use. But I just don&#x27;t find that this concealer is that good. It kind of sits on the skin and doesn&#x27;t blend well. I like other elf products, just not this one.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff. As an over 40 exmodel, I love this! Perfect pink tone for under eyes and under foundation. I still have no idea how to use the green. For the price &amp; selection...?...you can&#x27;t go wrong here. Arrived promptly. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product one star, but for the price it isn&#x27;t that bad.  There is hardly any pigment unless you glob it on, and I don&#x27;t like to use a ton of concealer.  I use a primer, foundation, then this product, then regular concealer, then powder to set.  When I skip this step, my makeup lasts no problem.  This concealer is very oily, and doesn&#x27;t really set (in my experience).  As a result, it seems to disappear as the day goes on, but it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> For the money, this delivers.  Wish it could just erase my flaws though - not the product&#x27;s fault, I just have some dark melasma that is pretty much impossible to cover and look natural.</li>
            <li> This was the best &amp;#34;not sure&amp;#34; product purchase. I now use it everyday. The quality is great (as I&#x27;ve found with all other e.l.f. products). Each color has its own purpose, goes on easily. And it&#x27;s works effectively all day. This is a great product I will always use.</li>
            <li> Great little compact for color correcting. I apply this before foundation and it greatly minimizes the hyperpigmentation scars (green) and the dark circles under my eyes( yellow).</li>
            <li> Very great to cover imperfections. WE ALL HAVE THOSE IMPERFECTIONS WE NEED TO COVER. Great prize and I honestly do recommend this concealer.</li>
            <li> The green is very thick and covers redness very well. The orange (which looks pink in the picture) is extremely thin and very light in color and doesn&#x27;t cover the veins or bags under my eyes because its so thin. I will probably go with something a little bit different the next time I look for a corrective concealer. But for the price its not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works covers dark circles blemishes and hilites.  Am a big fan of elf make up and the price is right.  I have nothing but good things to say about this product an the others I bought</li>
            <li> The green is perfect for redness. My only complaint is that I ordered in April 2014 its now May 2014 and the green is all gone and I don&#x27;t even use it everyday. But it definitely does the job of concealing and erasing redness.</li>
            <li> Love the blue to hid my dark circles.  And the pink to hid the blemishes. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This product works, but not in the way you think it does. If you are looking to conceal small minor blemishes, this product would work for you. However, If you are looking for more of a heavy coverage, I recommend you use a heavy colored creamed foundation, or eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun Fact: Use the yellow shade to conceal dark circles or bruises that are purple or blue. Use the blue shade to erase orange hues, like lines from tanning. Use the green to neutralize and cover red spots like pimples, scars or rosacea. Use the pink shade to brighten the inner and putter corner of the eyes for a more awakened look.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like the way the product sits after its been applied. it&#x27;s alright for what it is, i can definitely recommend it for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> I ordered this recently and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work....but it really does! The yellow works really great to neutralize my blue under eye circles. The green neutralizes my red nose/cheek area as well. I&#x27;m very pleased that something so inexpensive works so well. I&#x27;ve used other e.l.f. products and I&#x27;m very pleased. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you ... it works.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  I have to be honest and say that so far, I have only used the yellow and the pink concealer but not the blue or green.  According to package instructions, the yellow concealer is to hide dark circles around the eyes.  The pink is to be used for places such as the outer corners of the eyes to help brighten up your face.  Once I put the yellow concealer on, I use my own flesh colored concealer (Cover Girl) over it.  I found the E.L.F. product to not be heavy, it&#x27;s creamy in texture and it goes on smoothly.  Then I dab a little bit of the pink E.L.F. concealer  (just a little bit) at the outer edges of my eyes and smooth it out. It really does help to make my eyes look a little bigger and it seems to brighten up my face :).  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any type of yellow or pink concealer before, so I have no other product to compare it to. I thought the E.L.F. product was fair in price and there seems to be a fair amount of product in the case so I expect it to last me for a while.</li>
            <li> Great for all types of color correction!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I could never find anything to cover my dark circles under my eyes or my redness. I love that there are multiple uses in one compact. Awesome, awesome buy!</li>
            <li> Nice product, it didn&#x27;t work for me, but I have oily skin. So it isworth the investment if you have the right skin type.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and I am very pleased with it! It&#x27;s smaller than I thought but that&#x27;s no big deal to me. I like the packaging it comes in and the texture of the makeup itself. I got it very soon and I can&#x27;t wait to actually use it.</li>
            <li> The item I received is not the same as the item pictured.  I have purchased the concealer before and recognize right away what I received is not at all what I thought I would be getting.</li>
            <li> Colors aren&#x27;t as shown. I got green and pink, but the other two are regular beige concealer colors, not corrective shades like yellow or purple. I kept it anyway because those were most important to me and I can use those shades of beige, but it is misleading.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product. However, when I finally tried it out I realized the formula of this product was horrible. It&#x27;s not creamy, it doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin well at all! I love the idea of this but don&#x27;t like the formula. When I worked the concealer under my eyes it was greasy and creased! Don&#x27;t get it because I regret it.</li>
            <li> is not the best but is ok, it helps a little bit, too soft, but better than nothing, Next time will look for a better quality</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the reviews and I am very happy with my purchase. This concealer has great coverage! The only down fall is the brush it comes with, not great and mine broke after one use.</li>
            <li> Smelt like paint and wasn&#x27;t very thick. Didn&#x27;t really do me any good or use. Waste of money even though it wasn&#x27;t that expensive and its now gonna just take up space at home</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty light and do not provide much coverage.  I find that the yellow accentuates the nooks and crannies under my eyes instead of covering my dark circles</li>
            <li> Blends very well over a primer; I use this for my eyes primarily, yellow for the dark circles and pink for any blue areas which does well to highlight. Then I go over it with e.l.f. regular skin-colored cream concealer &amp; blend them together &amp; they work great as a combination for full coverage corrective concealer. I&#x27;ve found it works best patted on with a finger and then set with a powder. I&#x27;ll usually use the same pat-method when putting liquid or cream foundation over it, and then set with a gentle application of powder; just make sure to smooth out any that&#x27;s fallen into the creases between applying &amp; setting with the powder, and then it wears all day. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> A color for everything! I wish it had a purple.</li>
            <li> The quality is according to the price, no instructions at all.</li>
