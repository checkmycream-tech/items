            <li>The Lot of 4 was a great price and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It is nice and light feeling and absorbs into skin quickly, without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it tightened the skin in my ab area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to order this on Amazon and to receive it more quickly and for less money than through Avon.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced but have seen more improvement in my face and neck than many more expensive creams.</li>

            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Smells good,gives your skin a nice firm feeling while making it glow</li>
            <li>like I said I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that permanent, but it does work, especially if put on between uses of other firming, tightening or wrinkle removing creams, I definitely recommend this, works great on your body</li>
            <li>90 years old and not a wrinkle on my face.</li>
            <li>Ok, the results from this stuff aren&#x27;t to permanent, but I DO NOT use it as a face cream, for that I have something else, with this dramatic firming cream I put it on my whole body and problem areas</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over twenty years, no need for expensive creams, but you have to start when you&#x27;re young for it to work.</li>
            <li> Not sure it does what they claim, wont be ordering anymore</li>

            <li> I use this cream all the time. It is nice and light feeling and absorbs into skin quickly, without feeling greasy. It&#x27;s nice to be able to order this on Amazon and to receive it more quickly and for less money than through Avon.</li>
            <li> some nice results on throat for firming... but like all creams be reasonable about expectations. no cream is surgery. still happy with it.</li>

            <li> My favorite and the price is better than anything in drug stores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is authentic.  They don&#x27;t come sealed like Avon sends them. I Planned on returning them but never got around to it.  Each jar I open smells looks and feels a little different.  I fear this is a rip off.</li>
            <li> Ok, the results from this stuff aren&#x27;t to permanent, but I DO NOT use it as a face cream, for that I have something else, with this dramatic firming cream I put it on my whole body and problem areas then let it dry before I workout, to help effects and I use it before I have company over for a quick pick me up, shhhh lol, like I said I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that permanent, but it does work, especially if put on between uses of other firming, tightening or wrinkle removing creams, I definitely recommend this, works great on your body cause you get so much in a jar</li>
            <li> Great product for aging skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this cream. It is reasonably priced but have seen more improvement in my face and neck than many more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> For some this might be a wonderful product for me&lt;br /&gt;Not so much&lt;br /&gt;For the price give it a try</li>

            <li> i really like the product.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I hope to continue buying it on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product: I use it every morning and every night to prevent sagging on my neck and face.</li>
            <li> Love ❤ Love ❤ Love ❤ This Cream Just Received My Second Order.</li>
            <li> Product works as promised. I hope this product continues to be produced. If you&#x27;re looking to firm your skin, this is the product for you. Use daily and you&#x27;ll notice a different in about 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is good cream, I&#x27;ve been buying for years.  The Lot of 4 was a great price and delivery was fast.</li>

            <li> Pretty sure it tightened the skin in my ab area. Used for a week with diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over twenty years, no need for expensive creams, but you have to start when you&#x27;re young for it to work. Only God performs miracles if you wait until wrinkles start.</li>
