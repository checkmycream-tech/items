            <li>Always good to have a spare</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone looking for a good body brush.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, has a nice grip and the handle can be removed for closer use.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST body brush I&#x27;ve used!!!  </li>
            <li>I received this body brush very quickly!</li>
            <li>and I love how you can separate the handle from the brush.</li>
            <li>but I really do love this.</li>
            <li>Perfect to get areas on back that you can&#x27;t reach with hands.</li>
            <li>I also love that the handle detaches and has the hand strap.</li>
            <li>I love the detachable handle on this brush that makes it versatile to use.</li>
            <li>More continued to come out when I touched the brush.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can take the handle off when I don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li>and I love the way the bristles feel when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>Love the brush we use them every day.</li>
            <li>I love this brush,  except the brush falls off the handle sometimes</li>
            <li>Being 8 months pregnant this brush has been really nice to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily hang it in the shower and the rubber handle is well</li>
            <li>It does feel good to brush with it, but to tell you the truth a natural loofah is probably better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the detachable brush, it holds quite firm but is easy to remove when needed.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this brush and would recommend it a hundred times over.</li>
            <li>Great quality we like the hand strap and long</li>
            <li>not usually a five star kind of guy,</li>
            <li>The medium weight bristles are perfect to actually give your skin a good brushing while not being so tough as to hurt or scratch you.  </li>
            <li>It is a fantastic brush and does exactly what it is meant to.</li>
            <li>The brush arrived very quickly and was secured very well.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, thanks to the rubber grip on the handle, and I love that the handle can come off if you wish to use the head individually!</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever bought after my friend recommended buying one.</li>
            <li>but it turned out to be soft and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It really does help with cellulite!</li>
            <li>Plus I love that it&#x27;s all natural as I like to do organic and natural in every aspect of my life as much as I can.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>recommend this to everyone who is looking to make their skin look fresh and young!</li>
            <li>This brush has worked great for both wet and dry use.</li>
            <li>It would always itch and bother me when lying in bed, but I really haven&#x27;t been feeling that annoyance</li>
            <li>I was very nervous that the bristles would feel prickly</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Quality is fantastic, and built to last.</li>
            <li>I really like this body brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right, not too course and not too soft.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t usually spoil myself with things like this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>have a super itchy back all the time</li>
            <li>and I have seen some significant improvement in the dry skin under my arms.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who liked to do dry body brushing, or even using it while wet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product the past several weeks and enjoy the almost massage-like bristles that make my skin feel renewed and fresh.</li>
            <li>so when the bristles start falling out, you have the next new one.</li>
            <li>and it really worked to scratch my body and remove all the dry skin cells which cause the itching.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but still firm enough to deep clean.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the removable long handle for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy-duty enough, yet quite soft on the skin.  </li>

            <li> I received this body brush very quickly! Works great and I love how you can separate the handle from the brush. I can easily hang it in the shower and the rubber handle is well gripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone who is looking to make their skin look fresh and young!</li>

            <li> This brush was given to me by a friend as a gift and it has been great.  I don&#x27;t know how to put it delicately, but I definitely fill out my extra large shirts.  The long handle on this brush makes it so I can actually reach spots on my back that need the attention.  The medium weight bristles are perfect to actually give your skin a good brushing while not being so tough as to hurt or scratch you.  Because of the bristle strength, the brush has become my best friend for for my back.&lt;br /&gt;Taking the handle off is also a great convenience with this.  I have had really dry skin under my arms, on my chest.  With a long handle it is a little awkward to get to since it is so close to my arms.  Just take the handle off and strap into the the cloth strap that is attached and you can vigorously get to the areas needed.  I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about three weeks and I have seen some significant improvement in the dry skin under my arms.  It would always itch and bother me when lying in bed, but I really haven&#x27;t been feeling that annoyance lately.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the value was in the removable handle and in the ability to actually make my skin look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not usually a five star kind of guy, but I really do love this.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever bought after my friend recommended buying one.

            <li> As described. Perfect to get areas on back that you can&#x27;t reach with hands.</li>
            <li> I use my TerraCherie brush for dry brushing. The bristles are just right, not too course and not too soft. I also love that the handle detaches and has the hand strap. Would definitely recommend to others. A great product!</li>
