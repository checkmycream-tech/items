            <li>The case is well made and provides good protection for gunnars (or eye glasses), but I still wonder why they aren&#x27;t included with a gunnars purchase.</li>

            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Keep them safe!</li>
            <li>Good protection, better than the silky pouch that came with the glasses.</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy case for for any Gunnar glasses.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice looking case though.</li>
            <li>nice feel and look to it.</li>
            <li>Nice stitching, detailed, great for the price.</li>
            <li>nice design but not to travel around with.</li>
            <li>Nice size for purse or backpack.  </li>
            <li>This case is quite sturdy and nicely fits my Gunnar Optiks Phenom Computer glasses (ST002-C001).</li>
            <li>Showed on time and is decent quality very pleased with this item for holding my classes i got previously very good.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong &amp;#34;rubber / glue like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love the glasses (I own 2 pairs)</li>
            <li>the leather is perfect, very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Very nice looking case, strong and light weight.</li>
            <li>This case is perfect for the MLG glasses which I have, and offers better protection for the glasses when transporting it than the cloth pouch.</li>
            <li>i love how they do not have a snap hing like most cases and just has a really strong magnet that holds it closed(that works amazing)</li>
            <li>The case was over all a buy, it holds my MLG Gunnars fine and is a nice coated leather.</li>
            <li>She said it was perfect and was definitely well packed.  </li>
            <li>They could have done a better job.</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>but its hinge is kind of cheaply built..</li>
            <li>3-4/5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>What more can I ask from a leather case.</li>
            <li>This is an authentic case that has the Gunnar logo on it.</li>
            <li>Also, it comes with a silk-like cloth to wipe your glasses safely, without leaving any scratches or streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel safe putting my glasses in this case and then throwing them into my backpack for travel.</li>
            <li>its very comfortable and the material is very soft, protect my eyewear very good, and that is important :) g</li>
            <li>high quality, great build and stylish.</li>
            <li>The leather case is good look as exactly as the image.</li>
            <li>G0005-C011 SheaDog Full Rim Ergonomic glasses perfectly and is durable enough to stay in my bag most of the time when I am not getting my glasses out.</li>
            <li>these will fit most sizes they are roomy.</li>
            <li>safe and scratch free.</li>
            <li>Really fast and good product</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel worried the case itself is going to break easily.</li>
            <li>The encasement feels rubbery, and it utilizes magnets to keep the lid close, making it easy to get your glasses whenever you need them.</li>
            <li>Clasp is strong and holds tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still holding strong.</li>
            <li>The product is fine</li>
            <li>It holds the gunnar glasses I have just fine and doesn&#x27;t seem too flimsy.</li>
            <li>The quality seems very good; they&#x27;re made with something like a hard leatherette, so it gives it a nice feel.  </li>
            <li>The product looks great but the actual hinges are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>they are worth more than the price a must get.</li>
            <li>free with my gunnar purchase, so I have nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li>Just feels cheaply built...</li>
            <li>Gunnar Desmo wont fit inside</li>
            <li>Problem is, the glasses don&#x27;t quite fit the case.</li>
            <li>these glasses won&#x27;t fit without force to close.</li>
            <li>My SheaDog pair inside its microfiber case will fit inside this case.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t place them &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34;, they don&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li>It is a bit clunky and the shades never quite fit in it.</li>
            <li>I like the magnetic lock in it and how light it feel even with the glasses inside.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li>Fits them perfectly and is a heavy duty case to protect them in my laptop bag.</li>
            <li>Good for fixed location - desk or home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good case for the price feels kind of cheap though since the hinges are kind of weak</li>
            <li>Super strong case.</li>
            <li>The case looks fine, it seems good quality I bought to protect a pair of intercept glasses model INT-00101 and after playing around like a tetris to fit the glasses inside the case doesn&#x27;t close properly.</li>
            <li>The leather is nice though soft and susceptible to blemishing easily.</li>
            <li>Sturdy case, super light too.</li>
            <li>added more clarity to screen they were a good purchase and they arrived on time would recommend to other gamers</li>
            <li>i feel like it&#x27;s special</li>
            <li>This is a good solid case.</li>
            <li>A very big case surprisingly</li>
            <li>The leather is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It seems nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Good, solid case.</li>
            <li>The magnets hold the case good and they don&#x27;t let it open</li>
            <li>Its Not a bad case</li>
            <li>Most cases have very low quality hinges that twist and break quickly - but so far this one seems great.</li>
            <li>Easy flip open case with a nice snap close motion.</li>
            <li>however most of the regular models don&#x27;t come with the protective case, so why not spend a little more to get what is the ideal case.  </li>
            <li>Been wanting something like this for quite a while, since my Gunnar PPKs are ridiculously fragile (as I&#x27;m sure most are...love them to death but the frame is just so meh).</li>
            <li>decent case to keep your Gunnars safe.</li>
            <li>feel confident that this case will keep my glasses safe, especially since I use them a lot at work.</li>
            <li>The case has a suitably rigid feel to it despite the soft leather.</li>
            <li>Great little magnetic case for my Gunnar computer glasses.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth its price</li>
            <li>I can carry my glasses in my backpack with the rest of my schoolwork and laptop without having to worry about them being crushed, The quality on this case seems good</li>
            <li>Good protection for your glasses, but not really needed...</li>
            <li>This case was the right price and the Gunnar brand, so i knew it was made for my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>bought the case to keep my glass in good shape and it doesn&#x27;t fit way to small what a joke</li>
            <li>Due to the shape of the glasses this is the best bet in terms of making sure they are protected in a hard case.  </li>
            <li>The inner surface of the box is soft and good protection glasses.</li>
            <li>There is a funny smell, probably just from the manufacturing process and materials used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks elegant enough to put some work glasses in though.</li>
            <li>I just got my first pair fo Gunnars.</li>
            <li>I love them, but as they&#x27;re fragile i wanted something to protect them.</li>
            <li>The case has held up pretty well inside my bag.</li>
            <li>Cool case just doest fit the big gunnar models</li>
            <li>.the glass that I bought doesn&#x27;t really fit right into the case and that you need to place them in a way for you to secure that the case is closed</li>
            <li>Other then that, it looks like a nice sturdy case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found i could get them to fit easily by putting the frames in upside down.</li>
            <li>They are large glasses and it may be possible that some of their smaller products would fit better</li>
            <li>Allows me to transport them back and forth between work and home easily.</li>
            <li>The magnet is plenty strong and the case is rock solid.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, the gunner glasses don&#x27;t fit in this case without being smushed!!</li>
            <li>I did not particularly like the stitching along the edges of the case, but that is more aesthetic than functions.</li>
            <li>but honestly it&#x27;s not enough to dock any stars since the magnet holding the case together does so just fine without the help of a hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine</li>
            <li>The case is very compact and smart.</li>
            <li>They are good and pretty, only complaint is the case open very easily.</li>
            <li>It goes very well with the gunnars and does its job at protecting them.</li>
            <li>although very aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>Looks like real leather.</li>
            <li>Closes very well and keeps it closed, thanks to that you can be sure</li>
            <li>Very sturdy design.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering buying another pair of Gunnars and if I do, I am absolutely buying another one of these with them.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to review on a case, but I must say this case does the trick when it comes to protecting your Gunnar glasses.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable throwing the case in my backpack without worrying about flipping open and damaging the glasses.</li>
            <li>It is also very sturdy</li>
            <li>Very nice tough case for glasses.</li>
            <li>great for playing high graphics game ...</li>
            <li>Okay, now available, there is no problem, that is a little crooked off the glasses into them</li>
            <li>Put them in the silk coccon first then put them in the case for complete protection.  </li>
            <li>These are decent cases, but know that they do not have any sort of molding to hold the glasses.</li>
            <li>The only issue that I would say it has, is that it is kind of flimsy when opening, however the magnets hold when the case is closed.</li>
            <li>first thing to note is the case is a bit on the small side compared to my Oakley case, but its definitely more robust than a normal eyeglass</li>
            <li>Durable and high quality</li>
            <li>Really high quality product</li>
            <li>The glasses are a bit expensive and this case is a great way to protect them.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be cheap and get a generic case because you&#x27;ll only be kicking yourself in the end.</li>
            <li>The open / close functionality of this case is quite unique and I commend Gunnar for making such a well-designed esthetic case.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t normally wear glasses outside of computer glasses, I really can&#x27;t comment on durability and whatnot, but I think I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that I could put my desmos in and throw in my backpack for travel without destroying them, just wish they would of fit.</li>
            <li>No issues with this item so far.</li>
            <li>Any Gunnar&#x27;s glasses are a natural fit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely meets my expectations.</li>
            <li>Works very well with the Gunnars and necessary for carrying in a book bag while going to school and traveling.</li>
            <li>It only seems to fit normal sized less curved designed glasses.</li>
            <li>Although is bulky as other people said the intercept model won&#x27;t fit properly in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, hard case with room for pretty much any shaped glasses.</li>
            <li>The case is really nice and sturdy, the magnets are a bit weak, and it&#x27;s actually a bit too bulky.</li>
            <li>I have not had any major issues with the case.  </li>
            <li>Gunnar Intercepts barely fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soft case that ships with the glasses does not provide enough protection</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>* Too small for many other glasses</li>
            <li>While that may sound like it&#x27;s weak, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Showed on time and is decent quality very pleased with this item for holding my classes i got previously very good.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong &amp;#34;rubber / glue like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the glasses (I own 2 pairs)</li>
            <li> the leather is perfect, very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking case, strong and light weight.</li>
            <li> This case is perfect for the MLG glasses which I have, and offers better protection for the glasses when transporting it than the cloth pouch.</li>
            <li> i love how they do not have a snap hing like most cases and just has a really strong magnet that holds it closed(that works amazing)</li>
            <li> The case was over all a buy, it holds my MLG Gunnars fine and is a nice coated leather.</li>
            <li> She said it was perfect and was definitely well packed.  </li>
            <li> They could have done a better job.</li>
            <li> I love this case.</li>
            <li> but its hinge is kind of cheaply built..</li>
            <li> 3-4/5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> What more can I ask from a leather case.</li>
            <li> This is an authentic case that has the Gunnar logo on it.</li>
            <li> Also, it comes with a silk-like cloth to wipe your glasses safely, without leaving any scratches or streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel safe putting my glasses in this case and then throwing them into my backpack for travel.</li>
            <li> its very comfortable and the material is very soft, protect my eyewear very good, and that is important :) g</li>
            <li> high quality, great build and stylish.</li>
            <li> The leather case is good look as exactly as the image.</li>
            <li> G0005-C011 SheaDog Full Rim Ergonomic glasses perfectly and is durable enough to stay in my bag most of the time when I am not getting my glasses out.</li>
            <li> these will fit most sizes they are roomy.</li>
            <li> safe and scratch free.</li>
            <li> Really fast and good product</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel worried the case itself is going to break easily.</li>
            <li> The encasement feels rubbery, and it utilizes magnets to keep the lid close, making it easy to get your glasses whenever you need them.</li>
            <li> Clasp is strong and holds tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still holding strong.</li>
            <li> The product is fine</li>
            <li> It holds the gunnar glasses I have just fine and doesn&#x27;t seem too flimsy.</li>
            <li> The quality seems very good; they&#x27;re made with something like a hard leatherette, so it gives it a nice feel.  </li>
            <li> The product looks great but the actual hinges are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> they are worth more than the price a must get.</li>
            <li> free with my gunnar purchase, so I have nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> Just feels cheaply built...</li>
            <li> Gunnar Desmo wont fit inside</li>
            <li> Problem is, the glasses don&#x27;t quite fit the case.</li>
            <li> these glasses won&#x27;t fit without force to close.</li>
            <li> My SheaDog pair inside its microfiber case will fit inside this case.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t place them &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34;, they don&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li> It is a bit clunky and the shades never quite fit in it.</li>
            <li> I like the magnetic lock in it and how light it feel even with the glasses inside.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit all.</li>
            <li> Fits them perfectly and is a heavy duty case to protect them in my laptop bag.</li>
            <li> Good for fixed location - desk or home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good case for the price feels kind of cheap though since the hinges are kind of weak</li>
            <li> Super strong case.</li>
            <li> The case looks fine, it seems good quality I bought to protect a pair of intercept glasses model INT-00101 and after playing around like a tetris to fit the glasses inside the case doesn&#x27;t close properly.</li>
            <li> The leather is nice though soft and susceptible to blemishing easily.</li>
            <li> Sturdy case, super light too.</li>
            <li> added more clarity to screen they were a good purchase and they arrived on time would recommend to other gamers</li>
            <li> i feel like it&#x27;s special</li>
            <li> This is a good solid case.</li>
            <li> A very big case surprisingly</li>
            <li> The leather is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> It seems nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Good, solid case.</li>
            <li> The magnets hold the case good and they don&#x27;t let it open</li>
            <li> Its Not a bad case</li>
            <li> Most cases have very low quality hinges that twist and break quickly - but so far this one seems great.</li>
            <li> Easy flip open case with a nice snap close motion.</li>
            <li> however most of the regular models don&#x27;t come with the protective case, so why not spend a little more to get what is the ideal case.  </li>
            <li> Been wanting something like this for quite a while, since my Gunnar PPKs are ridiculously fragile (as I&#x27;m sure most are...love them to death but the frame is just so meh).</li>
            <li> decent case to keep your Gunnars safe.</li>
            <li> feel confident that this case will keep my glasses safe, especially since I use them a lot at work.</li>
            <li> The case has a suitably rigid feel to it despite the soft leather.</li>
            <li> Great little magnetic case for my Gunnar computer glasses.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth its price</li>
            <li> I can carry my glasses in my backpack with the rest of my schoolwork and laptop without having to worry about them being crushed, The quality on this case seems good</li>
            <li> Good protection for your glasses, but not really needed...</li>
            <li> This case was the right price and the Gunnar brand, so i knew it was made for my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> bought the case to keep my glass in good shape and it doesn&#x27;t fit way to small what a joke</li>
            <li> Due to the shape of the glasses this is the best bet in terms of making sure they are protected in a hard case.  </li>
            <li> The inner surface of the box is soft and good protection glasses.</li>
            <li> There is a funny smell, probably just from the manufacturing process and materials used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks elegant enough to put some work glasses in though.</li>
            <li> I just got my first pair fo Gunnars.</li>
            <li> I love them, but as they&#x27;re fragile i wanted something to protect them.</li>
            <li> The case has held up pretty well inside my bag.</li>
            <li> Cool case just doest fit the big gunnar models</li>
            <li> .the glass that I bought doesn&#x27;t really fit right into the case and that you need to place them in a way for you to secure that the case is closed</li>
            <li> Other then that, it looks like a nice sturdy case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found i could get them to fit easily by putting the frames in upside down.</li>
            <li> They are large glasses and it may be possible that some of their smaller products would fit better</li>
            <li> Allows me to transport them back and forth between work and home easily.</li>
            <li> The magnet is plenty strong and the case is rock solid.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, the gunner glasses don&#x27;t fit in this case without being smushed!!</li>
            <li> I did not particularly like the stitching along the edges of the case, but that is more aesthetic than functions.</li>
            <li> but honestly it&#x27;s not enough to dock any stars since the magnet holding the case together does so just fine without the help of a hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine</li>
            <li> The case is very compact and smart.</li>
            <li> They are good and pretty, only complaint is the case open very easily.</li>
            <li> It goes very well with the gunnars and does its job at protecting them.</li>
            <li> although very aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> Looks like real leather.</li>
            <li> Closes very well and keeps it closed, thanks to that you can be sure</li>
            <li> Very sturdy design.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering buying another pair of Gunnars and if I do, I am absolutely buying another one of these with them.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to review on a case, but I must say this case does the trick when it comes to protecting your Gunnar glasses.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable throwing the case in my backpack without worrying about flipping open and damaging the glasses.</li>
            <li> It is also very sturdy</li>
            <li> Very nice tough case for glasses.</li>
            <li> great for playing high graphics game ...</li>
            <li> Okay, now available, there is no problem, that is a little crooked off the glasses into them</li>
            <li> Put them in the silk coccon first then put them in the case for complete protection.  </li>
            <li> These are decent cases, but know that they do not have any sort of molding to hold the glasses.</li>
            <li> The only issue that I would say it has, is that it is kind of flimsy when opening, however the magnets hold when the case is closed.</li>
            <li> first thing to note is the case is a bit on the small side compared to my Oakley case, but its definitely more robust than a normal eyeglass</li>
            <li> Durable and high quality</li>
            <li> Really high quality product</li>
            <li> The glasses are a bit expensive and this case is a great way to protect them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be cheap and get a generic case because you&#x27;ll only be kicking yourself in the end.</li>
            <li> The open / close functionality of this case is quite unique and I commend Gunnar for making such a well-designed esthetic case.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t normally wear glasses outside of computer glasses, I really can&#x27;t comment on durability and whatnot, but I think I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that I could put my desmos in and throw in my backpack for travel without destroying them, just wish they would of fit.</li>
            <li> No issues with this item so far.</li>
            <li> Any Gunnar&#x27;s glasses are a natural fit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the Gunnars and necessary for carrying in a book bag while going to school and traveling.</li>
            <li> It only seems to fit normal sized less curved designed glasses.</li>
            <li> Although is bulky as other people said the intercept model won&#x27;t fit properly in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight, hard case with room for pretty much any shaped glasses.</li>
            <li> The case is really nice and sturdy, the magnets are a bit weak, and it&#x27;s actually a bit too bulky.</li>
            <li> I have not had any major issues with the case.  </li>
            <li> Gunnar Intercepts barely fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soft case that ships with the glasses does not provide enough protection</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> * Too small for many other glasses</li>
            <li> While that may sound like it&#x27;s weak, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Recently I have started to get headaches and my eyes start to hurt if I look at a monitor for to long; as soon as I put these on, my eyes feel instant relief and the headaches have gone away.</li>
            <li> and they do not fit particularly well.</li>
            <li> does not fit all Gunnar Optiks - the full frame intercept&#x27;s do not fit.</li>
            <li> I bought some Gunnars not too long ago for a total of 3 pairs (home computer, work, and a gift for someone else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only minor ding would be the hinge</li>
            <li> case do not suitable for certain types of gunnar glass.  </li>
            <li> The case doesn&#x27;t stay open, but that could be a blessing if you drop them and the case closed rather than staying open and</li>
            <li> recommend this case highly for your Gunnars, or any small profile pair of glasses.</li>
            <li> i would suggest these to anyone that wants a hard case for their gunnars to replace using the bag.</li>
            <li> The hinge is the most disappointing part of the case.</li>
            <li> Stays closed magnetically and is visually pleasing.  </li>
            <li> But I hAve to make it long enought to post this.</li>
            <li> because my last pair of Gunnars got crushed in the bag.</li>
            <li> The only gripe I do have is that it is a little big, but that&#x27;s what gives your glasses room in the case.</li>
            <li> others have said, the hinge is a bit feeble, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pair (different designs) from Gunnar over the past 2 years..</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bigger</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger..</li>
            <li> Could be a little larger for the glasses though.  </li>
            <li> I worry that, with use, it will rapidly lose effectiveness in keeping the case closed.</li>
            <li> What this is, is a magnet along the openings that hold the case closed.</li>
            <li> Just a warning, this case does not fit the bigger styles of frames like the Intercept.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using them, but the case does not stay closed all the way.</li>
            <li> but obviously it isn&#x27;t since my Desmo Series do not fit.</li>
            <li> but this seems to keep it closed despite being knocked around a lot.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment to protect expensive eye wear</li>
            <li> /&gt;This might not fit some of the bigger gunnar glasses like the DESMO ones I have.</li>
            <li> I ordered some generic eyeglass case from Amazon and my Gunnar MLG Phantoms did not fit in them in the slightest.  </li>
            <li> Regular cases will not fit Gunnar glasses.</li>
            <li> If you spent all that money on your gunnars, why wouldn&#x27;t you buy this?</li>
            <li> The magnets are not particularly strong, so if something gets in the way, such as a cleaning cloth, it does not hold closed well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s closed with a magnet and it&#x27;s not very powerful</li>
            <li> Also the magnetic locking/closing mechanism  is not very strong, so even though it will close around the Intercepts it will not really stay closed.</li>
            <li> (i do not have any of their other glasses to test this with).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this would have been possible while still being &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; to the Gunnar glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great protection for your Gunnar glasses or other glasses&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Will probably pick up another one for my other set of glasses.</li>
            <li> There is no satisfying tactile sensation to opening the case; instead it rather flops open as if the lid may fall off at any moment.</li>
            <li> They give my glasses the protection I need as I carry them with a lot of other things that could damage them.</li>
            <li> I am using it for putting my other glasses in.</li>
            <li> (shined a flashlight down but can&#x27;t find any).</li>
            <li> scartch everywhere, just like a case made by hard paper and paint leather paint on it, and I think I can break it with a finger because of its poor quality, weird sound when open or close it</li>
            <li> A little bit bulky and the spring to keep them closed is a little weak.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re coming with the expectation that this is going to be one of those typical eyeglass cases--it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t close tight.</li>
            <li> Not leather at all, super bad smell,</li>
            <li> A few people were commenting on the strength of the hinge.</li>
            <li> does not fit all gunnar glasses.</li>
            <li> my Gunnar intercepts did not fit.</li>
            <li> My Gunnar desmos did not fit.</li>
            <li> If you are buying a pair of Gunnar&#x27;s these are a small price to pay to protect your investment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can use this case for longbas</li>
            <li> It met my expectations, not real happy about the price of the case or the glasses that went inside</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a hard shell almost, but not super tough.</li>
            <li> The case is definitely hard and durable, giving ample protection from falls and pressure.  </li>
            <li> the glasses, the case is hard.</li>
            <li> but the case stinks big time.</li>
            <li> I bought this case with my Gunnar Optiks PHA-05601 MLG Phantom but did not fit, i&#x27;m very disappointed, be aware.</li>
            <li> not good ：</li>
            <li> Not flimsy or weak.  </li>
            <li> your thin metal Gunnars go flying all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a thin piece of crimped metal between two equally thin layers of leather.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t appreciate the false advertisement</li>
            <li> feel sad when I cant put my desmo into it.</li>
            <li> Crazy.  </li>
            <li> I will have to return this case as the Gunnars that i bought together with these are very uncomfortable with my A40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> But nothing else bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> smell which started making my glasses smell bad.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not leather at all, super bad smell, scartch everywhere, just like a case made by hard paper and paint leather paint on it, and I think I can break it with a finger because of its poor quality, weird sound when open or close it, I rather spend $5 to get a case in Chinatown than keep this one</li>
            <li> I used for my glasses, and it works perfetct! Received in time!</li>
            <li> i use these for my gunnars and couldn&#x27;t be happier. these will fit most sizes they are roomy. i love how they do not have a snap hing like most cases and just has a really strong magnet that holds it closed(that works amazing) the leather is perfect, very smooth and soft. i would suggest these to anyone that wants a hard case for their gunnars to replace using the bag. they are worth more than the price a must get.</li>
            <li> the 2 pieces of the case seem fairly sturdy though the hinge that holds them together is not quite as sturdy. I bought this alone with a pair of the Gunnar Intercept glasses and they do not fit particularly well. They are large glasses and it may be possible that some of their smaller products would fit better (i do not have any of their other glasses to test this with). Also the magnetic locking/closing mechanism  is not very strong, so even though it will close around the Intercepts it will not really stay closed.</li>
            <li> Durable and high quality</li>
            <li> These are decent cases, but know that they do not have any sort of molding to hold the glasses. I&#x27;m not sure that this would have been possible while still being &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; to the Gunnar glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern with these is the rather flimsy latching mechanism. I worry that, with use, it will rapidly lose effectiveness in keeping the case closed.</li>
            <li> Great addition to the glasses.  Not flimsy or weak.  A must if you plan to keep your gunnars in great condition.</li>
            <li> Great case with tons of room. A few people were commenting on the strength of the hinge. If you&#x27;re coming with the expectation that this is going to be one of those typical eyeglass cases--it isn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t even think there is any metal in the hinge at all (shined a flashlight down but can&#x27;t find any). What this is, is a magnet along the openings that hold the case closed. While that may sound like it&#x27;s weak, it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s very lightweight, hard case with room for pretty much any shaped glasses. Only thing I would change is a bit thicker lining on the inside.</li>
            <li> Recently I have started to get headaches and my eyes start to hurt if I look at a monitor for to long; as soon as I put these on, my eyes feel instant relief and the headaches have gone away. Great product.</li>
            <li> Good protection, better than the silky pouch that came with the glasses. Put them in the silk coccon first then put them in the case for complete protection.  I&#x27;d advise that you getsome I-Amp cleaner as well.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy case for for any Gunnar glasses.  Easy flip open case with a nice snap close motion.A must buy for any pair of Gunnar glasses...protect your investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gunnar Intercepts barely fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found i could get them to fit easily by putting the frames in upside down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to house my Gunnar lenses. The case is definitely hard and durable, giving ample protection from falls and pressure.  I did not particularly like the stitching along the edges of the case, but that is more aesthetic than functions.</li>
            <li> Just a warning, this case does not fit the bigger styles of frames like the Intercept. I&#x27;m still using them, but the case does not stay closed all the way. There is no strap or clamp to lock it either. It is a nice looking case though.</li>
            <li> If you are buying a pair of Gunnar&#x27;s these are a small price to pay to protect your investment.  They close relatively well and the case looks and feels like a quality product -- especially for about $12.</li>
            <li> Since it was gift, had to wait until daughter opened.  She said it was perfect and was definitely well packed.  Definitely worth its price</li>
            <li> Okay, now available, there is no problem, that is a little crooked off the glasses into them just good, quite good</li>
            <li> The product looks great but the actual hinges are cheaply made. They could have done a better job. I will have to return this case as the Gunnars that i bought together with these are very uncomfortable with my A40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is a good solid case. nice feel and look to it. I wish it was a little bigger so I could have the glasses in it and the lense cleaner at the same time. But nothing else bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Nice stitching, detailed, great for the price. A bit oversized, but since I will be carrying my glasses in my backpack, I need them to be well protected.</li>
            <li> bought the case to keep my glass in good shape and it doesn&#x27;t fit way to small what a joke</li>
            <li> does not fit all gunnar glasses.</li>
            <li> Great product and works like a charm..</li>
            <li> Case is perfect for the Gunnar&#x27;s that I got. A very big case surprisingly but it works to protect them.</li>
            <li> Super strong case. Clasp is strong and holds tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came free with my gunnar purchase, so I have nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> I bought this case several months ago and like another reviewer said, the case &amp;#34;smells bad&amp;#34;.  It has a very strong &amp;#34;rubber / glue like&amp;#34; smell which started making my glasses smell bad.  I put the case in my garage for 3 months and it STILL has the smell.  Crazy.  I love the glasses (I own 2 pairs) but the case stinks big time.</li>
            <li> I bought this case with my Gunnar Optiks PHA-05601 MLG Phantom but did not fit, i&#x27;m very disappointed, be aware.</li>
            <li> Good product. Use them daily for programming and staring at three monitors all day.. Also helps with overhead halogen lightning that causes eye strain and sometimes headaches. This is my 2nd pair (different designs) from Gunnar over the past 2 years.. Love them!</li>
            <li> You have to get the glasses in there perfectly for the case to close all of the way.</li>
            <li> This cover is supposed to be for all gunnar optiks glasses but obviously it isn&#x27;t since my Desmo Series do not fit. Even though the framing is made by SteelSeries, the glasses are still sold on Gunnar Optiks&#x27;s website and they should be covered.</li>
            <li> I love this case. It goes very well with the gunnars and does its job at protecting them. The only reason why I knocked off a star is because the materials that they used to make it feels rather plasticy.</li>
            <li> It does the job and looks good too... but its hinge is kind of cheaply built.. 3-4/5 stars for sure. Its definitely good though! Just feels cheaply built... although very aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> The case looks fine, it seems good quality I bought to protect a pair of intercept glasses model INT-00101 and after playing around like a tetris to fit the glasses inside the case doesn&#x27;t close properly. Although is bulky as other people said the intercept model won&#x27;t fit properly in it. I am returning this.</li>
            <li> The case is really nice and sturdy, the magnets are a bit weak, and it&#x27;s actually a bit too bulky. Despite it&#x27;s size and design my Gunnar intercepts did not fit.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to keep my glasses safe. I can carry my glasses in my backpack with the rest of my schoolwork and laptop without having to worry about them being crushed, The quality on this case seems good and I don&#x27;t feel worried the case itself is going to break easily. Has a magnetic closure but this seems to keep it closed despite being knocked around a lot. There is a funny smell, probably just from the manufacturing process and materials used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great protection for your Gunnar glasses or other glasses&lt;br /&gt;Good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li> does not fit all Gunnar Optiks - the full frame intercept&#x27;s do not fit. I don&#x27;t appreciate the false advertisement</li>
            <li> The glasses are a bit expensive and this case is a great way to protect them.  It is well made, fits perfectly and feels good to the touch.</li>
            <li> The case is to to be placed inside the pocket .the glass that I bought doesn&#x27;t really fit right into the case and that you need to place them in a way for you to secure that the case is closed</li>
            <li> very good case. Looks like real leather.Closes very well and keeps it closed, thanks to that you can be sure that it won&#x60;t open accidentally. Really high quality product</li>
            <li> A great way to protect your glasses.great shipping</li>
            <li> My Gunnar desmos did not fit. Other then that, it looks like a nice sturdy case. I wanted something that I could put my desmos in and throw in my backpack for travel without destroying them, just wish they would of fit.</li>
            <li> Holds my glasses, gets the job done.  Solid desgin and fashionable.  Will probably pick up another one for my other set of glasses.</li>
            <li> Needed if you buy the glasses. Keep them safe!</li>
            <li> Bought this case for my Gunnar WiFive glass.  It is a little bigger.. but with a micro cloth.  it fits perfectly.. no problem, no issue.. I am happy</li>
            <li> Very sturdy design.  Stays closed magnetically and is visually pleasing.  I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a great case for their glasses.</li>
            <li> No issues with this item so far. Seems to be durable and is doing a great job of taking care of my gaming glasses. Worth the investment to protect expensive eye wear</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t close tight. That&#x27;s all I have to say. But I hAve to make it long enought to post this.</li>
            <li> Works as intended, but may have a tendency to shift after closing, causing the case to close at an angle.</li>
            <li> added more clarity to screen they were a good purchase and they arrived on time would recommend to other gamers</li>
            <li> Very handy pouch for glasses. Qualitatively made, looks beautiful. The inner surface of the box is soft and good protection glasses. Bought for his wife, who enjoys the company Gunnar glasses.</li>
            <li> its very comfortable and the material is very soft, protect my eyewear very good, and that is important :) g</li>
            <li> Yeah..because my last pair of Gunnars got crushed in the bag.</li>
            <li> I bought some Gunnars not too long ago for a total of 3 pairs (home computer, work, and a gift for someone else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might not fit some of the bigger gunnar glasses like the DESMO ones I have. It only seems to fit normal sized less curved designed glasses. Looks elegant enough to put some work glasses in though.</li>
            <li> I just got my first pair fo Gunnars. I love them, but as they&#x27;re fragile i wanted something to protect them. This case was the right price and the Gunnar brand, so i knew it was made for my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to note is the case is a bit on the small side compared to my Oakley case, but its definitely more robust than a normal eyeglass case.&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, the hinge is a bit feeble, but it&#x27;s not bad. The case doesn&#x27;t stay open, but that could be a blessing if you drop them and the case closed rather than staying open and your thin metal Gunnars go flying all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this case highly for your Gunnars, or any small profile pair of glasses.</li>
            <li> They are good and pretty, only complaint is the case open very easily. It&#x27;s closed with a magnet and it&#x27;s not very powerful</li>
            <li> The case was over all a buy, it holds my MLG Gunnars fine and is a nice coated leather. The only issue that I would say it has, is that it is kind of flimsy when opening, however the magnets hold when the case is closed.</li>
            <li> great for playing high graphics game ...i use this while using my computer or watching tv and especially playing starcraft 2 and i havent had a headache since i got it and started using it great product for gamers.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Sturdy and overall nice&lt;br /&gt;* Any Gunnar&#x27;s glasses are a natural fit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* No locking system whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;* Too small for many other glasses</li>
            <li> I like this case.  I use it to transport the my glasses around.  I have a pair for reading and I have a pair for working on computers.  I have not had any major issues with the case.  The leather is nice and soft.  For the price I feel this is a really good purchase.</li>
            <li> Its Not a bad case but It uses a magnet to close and hold together. If you want to leave it open, well forget about it.</li>
            <li> Great little magnetic case for my Gunnar computer glasses.</li>
            <li> What more can I ask from a leather case. It is sturdy and not too bulky. Keeps My Computer glasses safe and scratch free.</li>
            <li> This case is great, fits my Gunnar RPGs perfectly and the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;I like the accented white stitching.</li>
            <li> Gunnar Desmo wont fit inside</li>
            <li> I ordered some generic eyeglass case from Amazon and my Gunnar MLG Phantoms did not fit in them in the slightest.  Didn&#x27;t even know Gunnar made an accompanying case, but I&#x27;m very happy I stumbled upon these.  The quality seems very good; they&#x27;re made with something like a hard leatherette, so it gives it a nice feel.  Plenty of room inside and I don&#x27;t feel like my glasses are squished.  I&#x27;m considering buying another pair of Gunnars and if I do, I am absolutely buying another one of these with them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this case, along with the Gunnar INT-00101&#x27;s. This case came recommended on amazon as a &amp;#34;purchase together&amp;#34; option. Problem is, the glasses don&#x27;t quite fit the case. I&#x27;m not sure I can use this case for longbas these glasses won&#x27;t fit without force to close.</li>
            <li> The leather case is good look as exactly as the image. it closes and opens well. i feel like it&#x27;s special, the price is good. At gunnars.com, there doesn&#x27;t have the case on a item separately. Some glasses with case are always.  Well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Shipment and Good deal price!!</li>
            <li> The leather is nice though soft and susceptible to blemishing easily. The case has a suitably rigid feel to it despite the soft leather. The magnets are not particularly strong, so if something gets in the way, such as a cleaning cloth, it does not hold closed well. The hinge is the most disappointing part of the case. It is a thin piece of crimped metal between two equally thin layers of leather. There is no satisfying tactile sensation to opening the case; instead it rather flops open as if the lid may fall off at any moment. That said, with a sturdier hinge this would be an exceptional case.</li>
            <li> It fits my Gunnars well and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it. Durable and fashionable. It also has a magnetic clasp that keeps the case shut.</li>
            <li> Ergonomic case of good design and good looks, lightweight, simulated leather. protect perfectly my glasses. I recommend them. also arrive on time.</li>
            <li> Great purchase to protect the gaming glasses. Good quality product.</li>
            <li> It looks like a second hand...got some scratch on this leather case...&lt;br /&gt;condition not good ：（</li>
            <li> I bought this care for the husband and he loves it.  It is very sturdy and will last a very long time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very nice tough case for glasses. It regularly survives travel in my carry-on luggage and the abuses thereof. I use it for both my Gunnar glasses and Ray-Ban sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I bought my Gunnars at Best Buy and they were worth EVERY PENNY... however most of the regular models don&#x27;t come with the protective case, so why not spend a little more to get what is the ideal case.  Due to the shape of the glasses this is the best bet in terms of making sure they are protected in a hard case.  Great investment.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say about a eye glass case? It met my expectations, not real happy about the price of the case or the glasses that went inside but it was a Bday present for my son.</li>
            <li> My SheaDog pair inside its microfiber case will fit inside this case. Since I don&#x27;t normally wear glasses outside of computer glasses, I really can&#x27;t comment on durability and whatnot, but I think I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Completely meets my expectations.It seems nice and soft. Good quality. Good protection. And also good addition to the Gunnar eyeglasses.</li>
            <li> Been wanting something like this for quite a while, since my Gunnar PPKs are ridiculously fragile (as I&#x27;m sure most are...love them to death but the frame is just so meh). Allows me to transport them back and forth between work and home easily. The magnet is plenty strong and the case is rock solid. Only minor ding would be the hinge but honestly it&#x27;s not enough to dock any stars since the magnet holding the case together does so just fine without the help of a hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine and functional product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Really fast and good product</li>
            <li> Nice looking a good quality. A little bit bulky and the spring to keep them closed is a little weak.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice design but not to travel around with. Good for fixed location - desk or home.</li>
            <li> This case is necessary to protect your investment. The soft case that ships with the glasses does not provide enough protection</li>
            <li> Good, solid case. I&#x27;ve had mine for quite a while now and it&#x27;s still holding strong.</li>
            <li> The product is fine but when I received the item, the box was already opened and was not in good condition.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the Gunnars and necessary for carrying in a book bag while going to school and traveling.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly my GUNNAR Gaming Eyewear - PPK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, the case is light and protect really good the glasses, the case is hard. The magnets hold the case good and they don&#x27;t let it open easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This case is necessary to protect your investment. I recommend it if you buy/have Gunnar glasses.</li>
            <li> Great case, perfect build quality, the magnet works fine.</li>
            <li> Nice size for purse or backpack.  Sturdy.  Could be a little larger for the glasses though.  If you don&#x27;t place them &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34;, they don&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li> Great quality case that snaps shut with a magnet. Plenty of room for standard glasses. Lots of headroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interior Cavity Measures 6&amp;#34; x 3&amp;#34; by  1-3/4&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna buy another one.</li>
            <li> The case is well made and provides good protection for gunnars (or eye glasses), but I still wonder why they aren&#x27;t included with a gunnars purchase. Anyway just rating the case it&#x27;s a solid 4/5 because it does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Bought these to protect my Gunnar glasses. It is a bit clunky and the shades never quite fit in it. Even still, tit provides an added layer of protection to something that I depend on daily to prevent eye strain, my Gunnar glasses.</li>
            <li> Not for gunnar intercept.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the case and it&#x27;s sturdier than it seems. My friends who have glasses keep asking me where I bought it since they like how it looks too. I recommend it for glasses owners (even if not Gunnar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because when I dropped it once, the case opened up and let my glasses out. My glasses didn&#x27;t get scratched since it was close to the ground, but I think the opening/closing mechanism needs to be checked.</li>
            <li> Well..... it&#x27;s a glasses case. It holds the gunnar glasses I have just fine and doesn&#x27;t seem too flimsy. Great looking and feeling case.</li>
            <li> Sturdy case, super light too. They give my glasses the protection I need as I carry them with a lot of other things that could damage them.</li>
            <li> I put my RPG Gunnars in this case the moment I got them. Took them out and already had a scratch.</li>
            <li> case do not suitable for certain types of gunnar glass.  retailer did not mention it .  feel sad when I cant put my desmo into it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good case for the price feels kind of cheap though since the hinges are kind of weak but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Regular cases will not fit Gunnar glasses. This case is perfect for the MLG glasses which I have, and offers better protection for the glasses when transporting it than the cloth pouch.</li>
            <li> Good protection for your glasses, but not really needed...</li>
            <li> decent case to keep your Gunnars safe. Not a big fan of the hinge.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to review on a case, but I must say this case does the trick when it comes to protecting your Gunnar glasses. The encasement feels rubbery, and it utilizes magnets to keep the lid close, making it easy to get your glasses whenever you need them. This is an authentic case that has the Gunnar logo on it. It&#x27;s like a hard shell almost, but not super tough. Also, it comes with a silk-like cloth to wipe your glasses safely, without leaving any scratches or streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel confident that this case will keep my glasses safe, especially since I use them a lot at work. Don&#x27;t be cheap and get a generic case because you&#x27;ll only be kicking yourself in the end. The only gripe I do have is that it is a little big, but that&#x27;s what gives your glasses room in the case. GET THIS CASE!!!</li>
            <li> after two months, doesn&#x27;t stay shut.</li>
            <li> Rip off should&#x27;ve came with the purchase of the glass.</li>
            <li> essential to purchase if you have a pair of Gunnars. high quality, great build and stylish. NOTE* the glasses alone only come with a cloth case not one of these!!</li>
            <li> Very nice looking case, strong and light weight. I like the magnetic lock in it and how light it feel even with the glasses inside. I feel comfortable throwing the case in my backpack without worrying about flipping open and damaging the glasses.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, the gunner glasses don&#x27;t fit in this case without being smushed!!</li>
            <li> This case is quite sturdy and nicely fits my Gunnar Optiks Phenom Computer glasses (ST002-C001). I feel safe putting my glasses in this case and then throwing them into my backpack for travel.</li>
            <li> Showed on time and is decent quality very pleased with this item for holding my classes i got previously very good.</li>
            <li> The case has held up pretty well inside my bag. Most cases have very low quality hinges that twist and break quickly - but so far this one seems great. The case looks great and is very strong.</li>
            <li> The case is very compact and smart. I am using it for putting my other glasses in. It is also very sturdy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great case, fits my glasses perfectly!</li>
            <li> The case fits my Gunnar Optiks G0005-C011 SheaDog Full Rim Ergonomic glasses perfectly and is durable enough to stay in my bag most of the time when I am not getting my glasses out. The open / close functionality of this case is quite unique and I commend Gunnar for making such a well-designed esthetic case.</li>
            <li> my gunnars fit perfectly in this case.  If you spent all that money on your gunnars, why wouldn&#x27;t you buy this?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit all. I have the intercept and order the case when I bought glasses. Cool case just doest fit the big gunnar models</li>
            <li> Bought these with my Wi-Five Gunnar Glasses. Fits them perfectly and is a heavy duty case to protect them in my laptop bag.</li>
