            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a special shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have to say, all the creamy pantenes really are NOT horrible, waxy, etc like people say.</li>
            <li>For the right hair, this might be a 5-star shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel soft and look shiny - not an easy task with gray hair.</li>
            <li>The product was good but half of it leaked all over shipping box.</li>

            <li>If the coupon every comes back I will surely repurchase.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes your hair smell and feel wonderful, but it can be a big on the pricey side, for me at least.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out, and I don&#x27;t get it cut very often.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as always, Would recommend.</li>
            <li>As much as I do like Pantene I would probably would not use this line again.</li>
            <li>Most of the things I order comes within a few days, I really like the Pantene shampoo</li>

            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t have a problem but this shipment the bottle was opened and leaked out into the bag it was shipped in.</li>
            <li>With either pantene or H&amp;S, you get thick, effective conditioning.</li>
            <li>and my hair is soft and manageable EVERY day!</li>
            <li>I  have been using this Shampoo on my fine hair for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This made my hair really soft and shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>Like the conditioner I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people who have a lot of split ends, maybe if you have little to moderate amount it would be fine to use.</li>
            <li>This is a little mild for my hair.</li>
            <li>I had tried other moisturizing shampoos and UltraSwim which is supposed to help remove impurities such as chlorine, but nothing seemed to really help.</li>
            <li>It typically breaks off and does not grow very well.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> HARD TO BELIEVE BUT SAW A DIFFERENCE IN ONE APPLICATION</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my hair smooth and in good shape</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel soft and look shiny - not an easy task with gray hair.</li>
            <li> Felt like it completely stripped all the good stuff off my hair.  I am sorry I purchased Pantene but I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for am honest and unbiased review, it is a pleasure to use, I didn&#x27;t find much difference in my hair having used just one bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pentene products yearly. It works well for me always. Below is the size comparison with another Pentene product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE Pantene Shampoo.  This leaves my hair so soft and manageable.  Thanks Pantene for another wonderful product</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t have a problem but this shipment the bottle was opened and leaked out into the bag it was shipped in. It did not leak out of the bag and onto the other products. But silly me put it on my dresser to deal with later and the the shampoo leaked out of the bag and all over my dresser. Lesson learned not to put off cleaning up messy shipment.</li>
            <li> Like the conditioner I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people who have a lot of split ends, maybe if you have little to moderate amount it would be fine to use. I have thick long coarse hair. I have highlights and split ends and my hair is dry. I used this for a little bit but realized it wasn&#x27;t working well enough.</li>
            <li> Lost about a 1/4 of the product b/c the lid was open.  What a mess.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are the best! They make my hair feel very silky and soft. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out, and I don&#x27;t get it cut very often. So I have some split ends, and after one use,I could feel a big difference. Use it every day, I&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Love pantene, usually only buy it when there is coupons and that&#x27;s the reason I bought it here on amazon. If the coupon every comes back I will surely repurchase. This shampoo makes your hair smell and feel wonderful, but it can be a big on the pricey side, for me at least.</li>
            <li> Excellent price. Fast shipping as always, Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my hair feel good</li>
            <li> For the right hair, this might be a 5-star shampoo. My hair tends not to be dry and needs daily washing. I probably need a stronger shampoo. This is a little mild for my hair. It is a good shampoo, but I have liked some of their other shampoos better.</li>
            <li> I cannot say i have seen a drastic different in the quality of my hair using this product. I  have been using this Shampoo on my fine hair for a few weeks. As much as I do like Pantene I would probably would not use this line again.</li>
            <li> I love to be able to order online because of cancer I am housebound. Most of the things I order comes within a few days, I really like the Pantene shampoo but I think if it was plastic sealed half of the product would not spill all over the other product I ordered and packaging.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it works well on my hair even without the conditioner. However, I use it in combination with the Conditioner &amp;  the Serum and my hair is soft and manageable EVERY day!</li>
            <li> This made my hair really soft and shiny and manageable. Years of colortreating has left my hair dull and brittle.  This brought some shine back and softness. My employee asked me what I used to make my hair so shiny!</li>
            <li> I think this is an excellent repair shampoo.  It did a very good job on my hair.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a special shampoo.</li>
            <li> Shampoo, works fine. not a lot to say about it?</li>
            <li> My 6 year old&#x27;s fine blonde hair had become very dry, brittle and nasty over the matter of a few weeks from swimming almost every day in lakes and pools.  I had tried other moisturizing shampoos and UltraSwim which is supposed to help remove impurities such as chlorine, but nothing seemed to really help. I decided to give Pantene&#x27;s Repair &amp; Protect shampoo and conditioner a try and was amazed - within 2 days her hair was restored to it&#x27;s full shine and silkiness, it was wonderful!  Very happy with this product, and it was a great price for the amount of product that comes in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Started using pantene despite all the hate from salons. Have this, the classic, the anti-break and fortifying, plus H&amp;S condish. My hair is soft, tangle-free and my skin is soft too, not like that dried out feeling some shampoo creates. I have to say, all the creamy pantenes really are NOT horrible, waxy, etc like people say. I stopped using suave because it wasn&#x27;t cleaning well anymore and the condish was too runny. With either pantene or H&amp;S, you get thick, effective conditioning. Try it! :)</li>
            <li> The product was good but half of it leaked all over shipping box.</li>
            <li> Grabbed it at a great price while it lasted! Works great on my hair and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have always had thin dry hair. It typically breaks off and does not grow very well. Since using this shampoo and conditioner my hair is now fuller and well conditioned. Also my hair has started to grow!! I use it daily and I also use the Suave heat protectant spay to avoid further damage to my hair. If you have thin dry damaged hair definitely give this shampoo and conditioner a shot.</li>
