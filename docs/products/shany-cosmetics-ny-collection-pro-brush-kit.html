            <li>formula, and this is the reason why this set of brushes would be perfect for certain people, and make up artists.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked for there to be duplicates of some of them like the angled brush</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect a better quality for what you&#x27;re a paying but its actually good to practice when you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t own this set</li>
            <li>All the brushes do pick up product nicely.</li>

            <li>I love this brush set, you get a great variety of brushes and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>soon as I opened the box I was hit with a very strong plastic smell.</li>
            <li>I would love to get more of their brushes!</li>
            <li>but somewhere 85-95%.&lt;br /&gt;Different types of brushes gives possibility to make up any kind of faces: :)</li>

            <li>AND I LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite brush rolls.</li>
            <li>I also use the M.A.C blending brush (love this brush)&lt;br</li>

            <li>I really love these brushes.</li>

            <li>I should have known better...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems as if some people have had a better experience</li>
            <li>The roll up case makes it that much better.</li>
            <li>I ordered these brushes for my grand daughter who has just started to experience with some make-up.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how many of them for the price.</li>
            <li>The case is kind of cheap</li>

            <li>Overall a really great deal!</li>
            <li>I have had these brushes for a while now and totally love them.</li>
            <li>: Some brushes shed a bit, (mostly the fan brush and powder brush)</li>
            <li>These Brushes are amazing and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Either way it earned me some points for being thoughtful and giving her something she actually liked.</li>
            <li>So yeah I am sure you&#x27;ll like this.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I will figure it out.</li>
            <li>These brushes are okay.</li>
            <li>I ordered Bellus brushes before and found those are better quality.</li>
            <li>plus now I&#x27;m more into the vegan set brushes</li>
            <li>Love these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got them in the mail today and cannot wait to use them more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love that a spooly comes in the kit</li>
            <li>I Love how SHANY includes the name of each brush and their functions inside.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes in this kit.</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>but Im sure by the quality of them</li>
            <li>The bag has a bit of a smell, but it looks cute.</li>
            <li>The blending brushes are great and really get the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went out on a limb and got them.</li>
            <li>Very nice, high quality brushes!</li>
            <li>These had decent reviews, and all the brushes I wanted, plus a great price.</li>
            <li>I was quite excited to see a fairly nice looking set of brushes for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>this set will do its job and help you to bulk up your brush set if you are doing multiple faces at a time.... and great gift for the every day girl that just needs better brushes than the ones that come in her compact!</li>
            <li>They are pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>Not hard to wash and works great with all shadows and pigments.</li>
            <li>I love this brushes, they are vera soft and have great quality.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth much more than the price I paid!</li>
            <li>When I purchased these brushes I was looking for a large set of brushes for a good price.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s make-up looked good onstage and the variety/quantity of brushes got the large cast done on time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had free brushes you get in makeup compacts hold up better than these ...</li>
            <li>Also very Stylish and Pretty.  </li>
            <li>GOOD QUALITY BRUSHES.THE BRISTLES AND VERY DENSE AND HOLD UP WELL.IM</li>
            <li>The case it comes in isn&#x27;t really her taste, but it does hold all the brushes and it is made of good quality resources.</li>
            <li>This even came with a paper explaining what brushes are used for what and are very descriptive which I loved.</li>
            <li>great quality,  i use em like crazy... perfect for a girl that is a makeup junkie :) really cute case as well</li>
            <li>They are soft, and apply makeup very nicely.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this set is perfect!</li>
            <li>/&gt; First off, packaging is lovely!</li>
            <li>Also because I wanted the cool fan brush!</li>
            <li>She gave them a trial run and could not believe I was able to get this type of quality for such a great price.</li>
            <li>The handles come off easily.</li>
            <li>I received these brushes, there was a very mild smell, nothing to complain about though.</li>
            <li>Fits in your purse or make up bag easily.</li>
            <li>i strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Pros: Good packaging, soft bristles, cute snake skin</li>
            <li>There was a plastic smell when I opened the bag, but it was not too strong and it should go away after airing the bag and washing the brushes.</li>
            <li>The case is pretty and all the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>I had tried the Sephora brushes, which were fine but pricey.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>first hand what brushes I would use more or need to be more precise with on my makeup.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and great quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are great quality and are super soft.</li>
            <li>I love the ruby red/purple case, really pretty!</li>
            <li>it is such a great case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- light weight&lt;</li>
            <li>Not only are the brushes great</li>
            <li>I use the brushes on the daily and they work great.</li>
            <li>Its was sort of cheap-</li>
            <li>A few brushes that I am impressed with is the foundation brush, blush brush, and powder brush.</li>
            <li>idk if these are vegan (meaning no animal hair, cruelty free.)</li>
            <li>And the also sent me a free gift.</li>
            <li>Im a professional makeup artist and the reason I purchased these brushes was because I heard lots of good things about Shany Cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li>I wanted so much to like these brushes!!!</li>
            <li>However, the brushes work well, feel great, clean up easily enough.</li>
            <li>The brushes may need at trim here or there and a good wash when you get it home, but I find that true for most mid end brush sets.....</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get them.  </li>
            <li>just worth mentioning!</li>
            <li>They are beautiful, soft, and high quality.</li>
            <li>but I did use a anti-bacterial brush cleanser over them before I used them to be clean.</li>
            <li>Either way my wife loved it and the presentation is much better than I even expected.</li>
            <li>The case is beautiful and actually well designed with an extra pocket and a nice schematic insert that describes the function of each brush.</li>
            <li>lol I think her favorite part is getting them out and setting them all down right before she does her makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>I would most certainly be ordering AGAIN from Shany Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Good brushes soft and clean lets see how they hold up when I do the first wash.</li>
            <li>What a great first impression!&lt;br /&gt;Annoyed, I moved on to the next brushes.</li>
            <li>I always need moremoremore brushes and so when I had to upgrade from a basic set, I turned to Shany for the good price/good quality combo.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM SO MUCH</li>
            <li>but it just went away after a week, didn&#x27;t wash it or anything it kind of just adapted with the natural smells in my room.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really speak for a more experience makeup user.</li>
            <li>However, that was about the only good thing about these brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes all seem to be a good quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s very usable and probably better suited for beginner makeup users or people who want a variety of brushes at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY neatly packed and I just couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty, clean, well made.  </li>
            <li>The foundation brush can be compared to a few high end brands that I own and is of great quality.</li>
            <li>Other than that a great deal.  </li>
            <li>This brush collection arrived so quickly, I didn&#x27;t have time to even blink it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I bought these and have actually been recommending them to friends that are looking for a similar product.</li>
            <li>the case is very pretty.</li>
            <li>I love how you have so many brushes that are soft in such a stylish case.</li>
            <li>These brushes shed so much, every time I try to apply my makeup my face is full of hair fibers from these cheap quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I love how this rolls up into a neat little clutch that is just adorable!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li>While this set is not small, I am able to utilize every brush.</li>
            <li>Will definitely get more of these when the time comes!</li>
            <li>Every single brush is SUPER soft, which many artists know is not always a good thing.</li>
            <li>The small detail brushes in this kit are excellent as well and are very useful, you also get quite a few which is nice.</li>
            <li>Great kit for beginners and pros can find a few useful brushes as well.</li>
            <li>But it was worth what I paid, but I now have a case and</li>
            <li>Totaly worth the $</li>
            <li>I love that there is a mix of synthetic and natural hair brushes.</li>
            <li>However, the variation of face and eye brushes allows you to gain experience with them which is useful for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Defenetly worth the money.</li>
            <li>face brushes are useful</li>
            <li>For the amount of brushes you receive for the amount you pay is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and have many bristles.</li>
            <li>the price was really reasonable and look very proffesional, i love the case, it comes with a pamphlet that shows you what each brush does.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to see a few more brushes with firmer bristles.</li>
            <li>This price was suspiciously low, but the reviews for this set and many of the other ones from this company were great.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend you get these its well worth the price!</li>
            <li>The case of these brushes grabbed my eyes right away.</li>
            <li>this is this right way to go.</li>
            <li>However, if you have a little more to spend go ahead and splurge on a better set.</li>
            <li>Soft texture and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great so far, a lot of repeat brushes though which is not really a problem for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this for a little over 2 years I can say they&#x27;ve done a good job.</li>
            <li>Several of my students have purchased this set and they love these brushes.</li>
            <li>When I got the set my first reaction was omg</li>
            <li>The case is so pretty too.</li>
            <li>Overall, ok brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>Bought this set about a year ago, and at first there was maybe like 3 hairs on my face every time I used the brushes.  </li>
            <li>It got here really fast!</li>
            <li>The pretty case is just an added bonus.</li>
            <li>This is not the first product I have tried from Shany Cosmetics, and everything I try from them always amazes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this for a month, hairs did fall out here in there when I first started to use them</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to unroll the brushes and all looked pretty</li>
            <li>nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to take out the first brush from the holder (gently) and the handle fell off!</li>
            <li>Most of the handles are wobbly or crooked.</li>
            <li>but I still think it is so shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can get better ones for around the same $$.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I actually like these better than the Sephora brand brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but if you have $20-40 extra to spend from this price ($25) - DO IT and buy something better quality.</li>
            <li>They will last you longer and make your makeup look better even after a couple years of use.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes, per se, but I would say go for it if you are really interested in them.</li>
            <li>Pretty color says it&#x27;s purple  </li>
            <li>If you consider a 3-4 piece brush set at Ulta is at least 20$, its a great deal.  </li>
            <li>The hairs of the brushes started falling on the first use.</li>
            <li>it has every brush she could want, all are very soft, and comes in a great little carrying case as well.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive these since they are my first \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; set of brushes.</li>
            <li>They wash really nicely and dry right back to their original shape.</li>
            <li>The brushes are good quality and the hairs are attached very well - little to no fall-out during the washing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I returned them and would NOT recommend purchasing them unless it is for a young teen that is not really doing much with the make up application but would love to show they have a brush set!!!</li>
            <li>how many different brushes it comes with and they all seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li>These brushes are good for anyone who&#x27;s on a budget and needs multiple brushes for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>I was VERY surprised at the quality of the brushes and how quickly they arrived.  </li>
            <li>This brush set can easily be recommended for those that want to purchase one for the first time or for those who would like to improve their current set.</li>
            <li>This brush set can easily be recommended for those that want to purchase one for the first time or for those who would like to improve their current set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important since Im starting my new makeup collection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re willing to buy a few specialty eye brushes to go along with it, this is a nice beginner set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes themselves look professional with matte black, are quite soft, shaped nicely, have sturdy handles and are light weight.</li>
            <li>and I get the nice little case included.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>The foundation brush fell apart fast and the powder brush will NOT stop shedding.</li>
            <li>the price is a plus because the brushes come out not costing much</li>
            <li>REALLY USEFULL.</li>
            <li>I dont really have a prob with this product</li>
            <li>and I can absolutely see myself using them for a while.</li>
            <li>I have always been afraid of contouring and blending in the fear of looking like a clown, but these are incredible for those purposes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping them since I really needed a set</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this brush kit.  </li>
            <li>and you really have to work to get the color on your lid.</li>
            <li>She loves them so much.  </li>
            <li>The package was wrapped very well and came in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>bristles are not glued in straight (some of them,mainly the eye brishes, the bristles looked sideways or cut</li>
            <li>(my eco tools brushes are MUCH softer)&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to spend much</li>
            <li>I also use an eye shadow primer to enhance the color of my shadows and still I&#x27;m not getting as much product on there as I would like using these brushes.</li>
            <li>They look very professional.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Better quality face brushes than I expected.</li>
            <li>the brushes were way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>if the brushes were labeled then it would really be easier to use instead of me having to read the paper manual each time I use them.</li>
            <li>this sent come with mixed brush materials like natural and synthetic because that gives me the chance to try both out and find out which I may like better.</li>
            <li>The eye brushes were evidently given less attention as they are not shaped as nicely and are not as soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly have the money to throw at a new set of brushes every couple of months.</li>
            <li>Very soft, I really like them!</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I love to be creative with my makeup and the small brush set my mother bought me a couple of christmas&#x27;s ago was holding me back (sephora 5pc set).</li>
            <li>After 2 years it has served it&#x27;s original low purchase price</li>
            <li>I use them pretty much everyday and they are soft and feel nice on your skin</li>
            <li>The price is undeniably budget friendly given you could purchase one high end brush for the price of the entire set.</li>
            <li>The price is undeniably budget friendly given you could purchase one high end brush for the price of the entire set.</li>
            <li>The case is more of a burgundy than the dark purple in colour.</li>
            <li>I do love that tthe bristles don&#x27;t fall out and stick to my face like the other brush set I have!</li>
            <li>The case has a bad smell, but other than that, its WONDERFUL and elegant.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just decent.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the blush and concealer brushes from this set.</li>
            <li>I will post more when I, an ACTUAL CUSTOMER, who has NO AFFILIATION TO SHANY, actually receive this  </li>
            <li>I recieved 22 brushes for the price of 1 high end brush (about 25 bucks).</li>
            <li>I bought this after hearing my wife talking about the high prices for kits like these.</li>
            <li>At first the problem only existed for the larger face brushes but all of the shadow brushes have started significantly shedding as well.  </li>
            <li>I thought the whole time they were natural fibers.</li>
            <li>I used an antibacterial dish soap and olive oil to clean them, let them dry.</li>
            <li>Also, the case means that the brushes will last a long time! :)</li>
            <li>I am by no means a makeup artist and am rarely new to brushes, so I really cannot tell if they are professional quality or not.  </li>
            <li>Would strongly advise this brand compared to much more expensive competition.</li>
            <li>but I would have gone back and spent a little more money if I had more to spend at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The small brushes are decent and ok quality.</li>
            <li>I ordered these brushes under the impression that they were new.</li>
            <li>I was new to wearing make up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to find a new foundation brush.</li>
            <li>The Brushes are very Soft and The Faux Crocodile Case?</li>
            <li>also the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>meaning soft and the handles are stirdy!</li>
            <li>The natural bristles are goat hair!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s several different brands out there that are of similar price and of much better quality.</li>
            <li>Wash all your brushes before using it since it has a scent when you first open it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are okay, but they do shed excessively.</li>
            <li>More of a dark red then purple.</li>
            <li>My old sephora brush kit was getting old and decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li>they are soft and the matte black handles and light weight and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes just to have a back up pair for my main brushes !</li>
            <li>The brushes are very secured, the handle of the brushes were covered in plastic bag pouches and the more bigger bushes had a hard plastic covering the hairs of the brush.</li>
            <li>THEY FEEL.THESE BRUSHES ARE BIG,BEAUTIFUL,AND THE BRISTLES ARE EXTREMELY SOFT.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed, even when cleaned and SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>pickup color well and soft ebutUpon using I had hair all over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yr old niece is experimenting with makeup</li>
            <li>She said it has every brush that would ever be needed, whether for the every day person or a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>Shany Cosmetics NY Collection Pro Brush Kit, 13 Ounce (22 Piece Mix Natural or Synthetic with Purple Faux Crocodile Case)]]</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone looking for professional brushes.  </li>
            <li>case the brushes come in is sewn well, shiny and soft albeit plastic not leather.</li>
            <li>The magnetic buttons for the case are noticeably flimsy and they may tear after frequent opening and closing.</li>
            <li>I like the variety, they are soft, and they work well.  </li>
            <li>Planning on contacting the company directly as well to express my dissatisfaction with the product.</li>
            <li>cheap enough to allow me the ability of purchasing multiple bushes while still have enough quality to not discourage me from trying all of them.  </li>
            <li>Really soft brushes.</li>
            <li>uneven)&lt;br /&gt;- not as soft as I hoped</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to get a set of professional makeup brushes for a while and came across this one.</li>
            <li>The bristles are baby soft and these do not shed at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cetisfied with this brush set, It&#x27;s the same what you see in photos.</li>
            <li>All brushes are soft</li>
            <li>It applies makeup well and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>I did, however, pull on the hairs and looked at the brushes; the hairs did not come off and the brushes were soft.</li>
            <li>B0061JQY40 SHANY Cosmetics NY Collection Pro Brush Kit, 13 Ounce (22 Piece Mix Natural or Synthetic with Purple Faux Crocodile Case)]]</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft, no shedding (yet).</li>
            <li>They do shed just a bit but they are soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>After a few days in the open the odor diminished considerably, more so after washing.</li>
            <li>And I think you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth, since this amount would only get you about two higher-end brushes.</li>
            <li>MAC brushes are just way too expensive for my taste, I don&#x27;t care how good they may be.</li>
            <li>The first night I got the brushes I washed them in warm water and baby shampoo, there was not grime or discoloration in the water and very few (1-2) bristles came out when I washed them, this is less than my brushes from Sephora!</li>
            <li>I mean I love</li>
            <li>highly recommend this set, even at the regular Amazon price of $29.95.</li>
            <li>I spent about an hour cleaning them, and I just used them for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Minimal shedding during washing, and a couple bristles on my first use.</li>
            <li>The more fluffier and bigger brushes still do here and there but hardly ever.</li>
            <li>Although the silver colour font is a nice touch it could be difficult to see the listing clearly if you needed to reference it</li>
            <li>and I did test them out before going to purchase them in the near future.</li>
            <li>Yes there is a slight smell when you first get them</li>
            <li>They were either too stiff, had too few brushes or too many I wouldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>I was very hesistant to buy them, due to some mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li>The case is soft and protective and the brushes seem to be a high quality (I will update in a few months after we have used them for awhile).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I sprayed them with a regular spray on conditioner for hair, swirled them around in my palm and let them dry just to keep them soft.</li>
            <li>I gave them a quick wash and dry before putting them back into their neat little case!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand what the little zipper product is for though.</li>
            <li>The main down fall is that there is nothing to tell you what each brush is for.  </li>

            <li> The bag is a nice maroon color, it was a hit!</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly in the case and the case looks like a stylish clutch.</li>
            <li> Very nice and good brush collection.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t pleasant but it didn&#x27;t make me upset.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She uses most of the brushes, but these things are very good quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good brushes for a beginner or someone who doesn&#x27;t put on makeup a lot.</li>
            <li> It may be a good idea to reinforce them with glue as a preventative measure.</li>
            <li> I thought this set would be great to kind of experiment</li>
            <li> I wanted to start her on good brushes.  </li>
            <li> Good for beginners.</li>
            <li> fairly dense&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, good buy.</li>
            <li> This 22 piece brush set is truly gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is good for the novice application but not for the pros.</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes.</li>
            <li> Loved the case.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price, I want to get a set for myself.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a while for a good brush set that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> The face brushes are full and the perfect stiffness / softness combo for picking up powder</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any shedding, was able to get rid of the plastic smell and they blend beautifully.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for a good product</li>
            <li> These are great, so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good beginner set and convenient to pack when I&#x27;m traveling which is nice.</li>

            <li> I love this set!</li>
            <li> Love this case and brush set!</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought more sets!</li>
            <li> and so many brushes!</li>
            <li> The case is super handy :) Very, very happy!</li>
            <li> formula, and this is the reason why this set of brushes would be perfect for certain people, and make up artists.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked for there to be duplicates of some of them like the angled brush</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect a better quality for what you&#x27;re a paying but its actually good to practice when you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t own this set</li>
            <li> All the brushes do pick up product nicely.</li>
            <li> All the brushes do pick up product nicely.</li>

            <li> The brushes are nice</li>
            <li> The case is nice and compact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at this whole make-up application thing, so I wanted a variety of brushes to figure out what would work best for me.</li>
            <li> and we share it...very nice.</li>
            <li> Nice touch the Crocodile Case.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have a separate kit that I could take along instead of  raiding my own beauty implements.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really nice.</li>
            <li> These are easy to clean, and the case is perfect for travel as well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice.</li>
            <li> and they come in this stylish Purple Faux Croc Case that fits in your bag so easily!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m somewhat new to using makeup brushes and thought this would be an awesome set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this brush set, you get a great variety of brushes and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> soon as I opened the box I was hit with a very strong plastic smell.</li>
            <li> I would love to get more of their brushes!</li>
            <li> but somewhere 85-95%.&lt;br /&gt;Different types of brushes gives possibility to make up any kind of faces: :)</li>
            <li> I looked for nearly a week trying to find the perfect brush set.</li>
            <li> I tried them out right away and decided I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Shany really did a good job on this one!</li>
            <li> Fine set of brushes by Shany!</li>
            <li> The case is very handy and pretty.</li>
            <li> Price is right, shipping was fast, packaging was good and case is beautiful just what I was looking for......</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brush rolls.</li>
            <li> I also use the M.A.C blending brush (love this brush)&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I looked some more</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought these for her</li>
            <li> I have been using them daily for about two weeks now and they are holding up great, with no bristle shedding!</li>
            <li> and it even comes in a stylish carrying case.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these</li>
            <li> and I love having a lot of shadow brushes</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my selection.</li>
            <li> and I have discovered that it is a more than acceptable set for those who are beginners or novices at makeup</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this product, if you are thinking about getting make up brushes</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Works great and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I should have known better...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems as if some people have had a better experience</li>
            <li> The roll up case makes it that much better.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes for my grand daughter who has just started to experience with some make-up.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how many of them for the price.</li>
            <li> The case is kind of cheap</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I found that these brushed seemed to be the best bang for your buck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the variety of brushes which is why I purchased these brushes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set to any woman! :)</li>
            <li> Overall a really great deal!</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for a while now and totally love them.</li>
            <li> : Some brushes shed a bit, (mostly the fan brush and powder brush)</li>
            <li> These Brushes are amazing and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Either way it earned me some points for being thoughtful and giving her something she actually liked.</li>
            <li> So yeah I am sure you&#x27;ll like this.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I will figure it out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay.</li>
            <li> I ordered Bellus brushes before and found those are better quality.</li>
            <li> plus now I&#x27;m more into the vegan set brushes</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got them in the mail today and cannot wait to use them more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love that a spooly comes in the kit</li>
            <li> I Love how SHANY includes the name of each brush and their functions inside.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes in this kit.</li>
            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> but Im sure by the quality of them</li>
            <li> The bag has a bit of a smell, but it looks cute.</li>
            <li> The blending brushes are great and really get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went out on a limb and got them.</li>
            <li> Very nice, high quality brushes!</li>
            <li> These had decent reviews, and all the brushes I wanted, plus a great price.</li>
            <li> I was quite excited to see a fairly nice looking set of brushes for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> this set will do its job and help you to bulk up your brush set if you are doing multiple faces at a time.... and great gift for the every day girl that just needs better brushes than the ones that come in her compact!</li>
            <li> They are pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> Not hard to wash and works great with all shadows and pigments.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes, they are vera soft and have great quality.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth much more than the price I paid!</li>
            <li> When I purchased these brushes I was looking for a large set of brushes for a good price.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s make-up looked good onstage and the variety/quantity of brushes got the large cast done on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had free brushes you get in makeup compacts hold up better than these ...</li>
            <li> Also very Stylish and Pretty.  </li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY BRUSHES.THE BRISTLES AND VERY DENSE AND HOLD UP WELL.IM</li>
            <li> The case it comes in isn&#x27;t really her taste, but it does hold all the brushes and it is made of good quality resources.</li>
            <li> This even came with a paper explaining what brushes are used for what and are very descriptive which I loved.</li>
            <li> great quality,  i use em like crazy... perfect for a girl that is a makeup junkie :) really cute case as well</li>
            <li> They are soft, and apply makeup very nicely.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this set is perfect!</li>
            <li> /&gt; First off, packaging is lovely!</li>
            <li> Also because I wanted the cool fan brush!</li>
            <li> She gave them a trial run and could not believe I was able to get this type of quality for such a great price.</li>
            <li> The handles come off easily.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes, there was a very mild smell, nothing to complain about though.</li>
            <li> Fits in your purse or make up bag easily.</li>
            <li> i strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pros: Good packaging, soft bristles, cute snake skin</li>
            <li> There was a plastic smell when I opened the bag, but it was not too strong and it should go away after airing the bag and washing the brushes.</li>
            <li> The case is pretty and all the brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> I had tried the Sephora brushes, which were fine but pricey.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> first hand what brushes I would use more or need to be more precise with on my makeup.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are great quality and are super soft.</li>
            <li> I love the ruby red/purple case, really pretty!</li>
            <li> it is such a great case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- light weight&lt;</li>
            <li> Not only are the brushes great</li>
            <li> I use the brushes on the daily and they work great.</li>
            <li> Its was sort of cheap-</li>
            <li> A few brushes that I am impressed with is the foundation brush, blush brush, and powder brush.</li>
            <li> idk if these are vegan (meaning no animal hair, cruelty free.)</li>
            <li> And the also sent me a free gift.</li>
            <li> Im a professional makeup artist and the reason I purchased these brushes was because I heard lots of good things about Shany Cosmetic brushes.</li>
            <li> I wanted so much to like these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> However, the brushes work well, feel great, clean up easily enough.</li>
            <li> The brushes may need at trim here or there and a good wash when you get it home, but I find that true for most mid end brush sets.....</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get them.  </li>
            <li> just worth mentioning!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful, soft, and high quality.</li>
            <li> but I did use a anti-bacterial brush cleanser over them before I used them to be clean.</li>
            <li> Either way my wife loved it and the presentation is much better than I even expected.</li>
            <li> The case is beautiful and actually well designed with an extra pocket and a nice schematic insert that describes the function of each brush.</li>
            <li> lol I think her favorite part is getting them out and setting them all down right before she does her makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> I would most certainly be ordering AGAIN from Shany Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Good brushes soft and clean lets see how they hold up when I do the first wash.</li>
            <li> What a great first impression!&lt;br /&gt;Annoyed, I moved on to the next brushes.</li>
            <li> I always need moremoremore brushes and so when I had to upgrade from a basic set, I turned to Shany for the good price/good quality combo.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM SO MUCH</li>
            <li> but it just went away after a week, didn&#x27;t wash it or anything it kind of just adapted with the natural smells in my room.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really speak for a more experience makeup user.</li>
            <li> However, that was about the only good thing about these brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes all seem to be a good quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s very usable and probably better suited for beginner makeup users or people who want a variety of brushes at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY neatly packed and I just couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, clean, well made.  </li>
            <li> The foundation brush can be compared to a few high end brands that I own and is of great quality.</li>
            <li> Other than that a great deal.  </li>
            <li> This brush collection arrived so quickly, I didn&#x27;t have time to even blink it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I bought these and have actually been recommending them to friends that are looking for a similar product.</li>
            <li> the case is very pretty.</li>
            <li> I love how you have so many brushes that are soft in such a stylish case.</li>
            <li> These brushes shed so much, every time I try to apply my makeup my face is full of hair fibers from these cheap quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I love how this rolls up into a neat little clutch that is just adorable!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li> While this set is not small, I am able to utilize every brush.</li>
            <li> Will definitely get more of these when the time comes!</li>
            <li> Every single brush is SUPER soft, which many artists know is not always a good thing.</li>
            <li> The small detail brushes in this kit are excellent as well and are very useful, you also get quite a few which is nice.</li>
            <li> Great kit for beginners and pros can find a few useful brushes as well.</li>
            <li> But it was worth what I paid, but I now have a case and</li>
            <li> Totaly worth the $</li>
            <li> I love that there is a mix of synthetic and natural hair brushes.</li>
            <li> However, the variation of face and eye brushes allows you to gain experience with them which is useful for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Defenetly worth the money.</li>
            <li> face brushes are useful</li>
            <li> For the amount of brushes you receive for the amount you pay is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and have many bristles.</li>
            <li> the price was really reasonable and look very proffesional, i love the case, it comes with a pamphlet that shows you what each brush does.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to see a few more brushes with firmer bristles.</li>
            <li> This price was suspiciously low, but the reviews for this set and many of the other ones from this company were great.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend you get these its well worth the price!</li>
            <li> The case of these brushes grabbed my eyes right away.</li>
            <li> this is this right way to go.</li>
            <li> However, if you have a little more to spend go ahead and splurge on a better set.</li>
            <li> Soft texture and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great so far, a lot of repeat brushes though which is not really a problem for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for a little over 2 years I can say they&#x27;ve done a good job.</li>
            <li> Several of my students have purchased this set and they love these brushes.</li>
            <li> When I got the set my first reaction was omg</li>
            <li> The case is so pretty too.</li>
            <li> Overall, ok brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this set about a year ago, and at first there was maybe like 3 hairs on my face every time I used the brushes.  </li>
            <li> It got here really fast!</li>
            <li> The pretty case is just an added bonus.</li>
            <li> This is not the first product I have tried from Shany Cosmetics, and everything I try from them always amazes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this for a month, hairs did fall out here in there when I first started to use them</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to unroll the brushes and all looked pretty</li>
            <li> nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to take out the first brush from the holder (gently) and the handle fell off!</li>
            <li> Most of the handles are wobbly or crooked.</li>
            <li> but I still think it is so shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get better ones for around the same $$.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually like these better than the Sephora brand brushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but if you have $20-40 extra to spend from this price ($25) - DO IT and buy something better quality.</li>
            <li> They will last you longer and make your makeup look better even after a couple years of use.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes, per se, but I would say go for it if you are really interested in them.</li>
            <li> Pretty color says it&#x27;s purple  </li>
            <li> If you consider a 3-4 piece brush set at Ulta is at least 20$, its a great deal.  </li>
            <li> The hairs of the brushes started falling on the first use.</li>
            <li> it has every brush she could want, all are very soft, and comes in a great little carrying case as well.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these since they are my first \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; set of brushes.</li>
            <li> They wash really nicely and dry right back to their original shape.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality and the hairs are attached very well - little to no fall-out during the washing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I returned them and would NOT recommend purchasing them unless it is for a young teen that is not really doing much with the make up application but would love to show they have a brush set!!!</li>
            <li> how many different brushes it comes with and they all seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li> These brushes are good for anyone who&#x27;s on a budget and needs multiple brushes for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I was VERY surprised at the quality of the brushes and how quickly they arrived.  </li>
            <li> This brush set can easily be recommended for those that want to purchase one for the first time or for those who would like to improve their current set.</li>
            <li> This brush set can easily be recommended for those that want to purchase one for the first time or for those who would like to improve their current set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important since Im starting my new makeup collection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re willing to buy a few specialty eye brushes to go along with it, this is a nice beginner set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes themselves look professional with matte black, are quite soft, shaped nicely, have sturdy handles and are light weight.</li>
            <li> and I get the nice little case included.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> The foundation brush fell apart fast and the powder brush will NOT stop shedding.</li>
            <li> the price is a plus because the brushes come out not costing much</li>
            <li> REALLY USEFULL.</li>
            <li> I dont really have a prob with this product</li>
            <li> and I can absolutely see myself using them for a while.</li>
            <li> I have always been afraid of contouring and blending in the fear of looking like a clown, but these are incredible for those purposes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping them since I really needed a set</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this brush kit.  </li>
            <li> and you really have to work to get the color on your lid.</li>
            <li> She loves them so much.  </li>
            <li> The package was wrapped very well and came in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> bristles are not glued in straight (some of them,mainly the eye brishes, the bristles looked sideways or cut</li>
            <li> (my eco tools brushes are MUCH softer)&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend much</li>
            <li> I also use an eye shadow primer to enhance the color of my shadows and still I&#x27;m not getting as much product on there as I would like using these brushes.</li>
            <li> They look very professional.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Better quality face brushes than I expected.</li>
            <li> the brushes were way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> if the brushes were labeled then it would really be easier to use instead of me having to read the paper manual each time I use them.</li>
            <li> this sent come with mixed brush materials like natural and synthetic because that gives me the chance to try both out and find out which I may like better.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes were evidently given less attention as they are not shaped as nicely and are not as soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly have the money to throw at a new set of brushes every couple of months.</li>
            <li> Very soft, I really like them!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I love to be creative with my makeup and the small brush set my mother bought me a couple of christmas&#x27;s ago was holding me back (sephora 5pc set).</li>
            <li> After 2 years it has served it&#x27;s original low purchase price</li>
            <li> I use them pretty much everyday and they are soft and feel nice on your skin</li>
            <li> The price is undeniably budget friendly given you could purchase one high end brush for the price of the entire set.</li>
            <li> The price is undeniably budget friendly given you could purchase one high end brush for the price of the entire set.</li>
            <li> The case is more of a burgundy than the dark purple in colour.</li>
            <li> I do love that tthe bristles don&#x27;t fall out and stick to my face like the other brush set I have!</li>
            <li> The case has a bad smell, but other than that, its WONDERFUL and elegant.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just decent.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the blush and concealer brushes from this set.</li>
            <li> I will post more when I, an ACTUAL CUSTOMER, who has NO AFFILIATION TO SHANY, actually receive this  </li>
            <li> I recieved 22 brushes for the price of 1 high end brush (about 25 bucks).</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing my wife talking about the high prices for kits like these.</li>
            <li> At first the problem only existed for the larger face brushes but all of the shadow brushes have started significantly shedding as well.  </li>
            <li> I thought the whole time they were natural fibers.</li>
            <li> I used an antibacterial dish soap and olive oil to clean them, let them dry.</li>
            <li> Also, the case means that the brushes will last a long time! :)</li>
            <li> I am by no means a makeup artist and am rarely new to brushes, so I really cannot tell if they are professional quality or not.  </li>
            <li> Would strongly advise this brand compared to much more expensive competition.</li>
            <li> but I would have gone back and spent a little more money if I had more to spend at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small brushes are decent and ok quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes under the impression that they were new.</li>
            <li> I was new to wearing make up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to find a new foundation brush.</li>
            <li> The Brushes are very Soft and The Faux Crocodile Case?</li>
            <li> also the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> meaning soft and the handles are stirdy!</li>
            <li> The natural bristles are goat hair!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s several different brands out there that are of similar price and of much better quality.</li>
            <li> Wash all your brushes before using it since it has a scent when you first open it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are okay, but they do shed excessively.</li>
            <li> More of a dark red then purple.</li>
            <li> My old sephora brush kit was getting old and decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li> they are soft and the matte black handles and light weight and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes just to have a back up pair for my main brushes !</li>
            <li> The brushes are very secured, the handle of the brushes were covered in plastic bag pouches and the more bigger bushes had a hard plastic covering the hairs of the brush.</li>
            <li> THEY FEEL.THESE BRUSHES ARE BIG,BEAUTIFUL,AND THE BRISTLES ARE EXTREMELY SOFT.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed, even when cleaned and SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> pickup color well and soft ebutUpon using I had hair all over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yr old niece is experimenting with makeup</li>
            <li> She said it has every brush that would ever be needed, whether for the every day person or a professional makeup artist.</li>

            <li> I would recommend them to anyone looking for professional brushes.  </li>
            <li> case the brushes come in is sewn well, shiny and soft albeit plastic not leather.</li>
            <li> The magnetic buttons for the case are noticeably flimsy and they may tear after frequent opening and closing.</li>
            <li> I like the variety, they are soft, and they work well.  </li>
            <li> Planning on contacting the company directly as well to express my dissatisfaction with the product.</li>
            <li> cheap enough to allow me the ability of purchasing multiple bushes while still have enough quality to not discourage me from trying all of them.  </li>
            <li> Really soft brushes.</li>
            <li> uneven)&lt;br /&gt;- not as soft as I hoped</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get a set of professional makeup brushes for a while and came across this one.</li>
            <li> The bristles are baby soft and these do not shed at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cetisfied with this brush set, It&#x27;s the same what you see in photos.</li>
            <li> All brushes are soft</li>
            <li> It applies makeup well and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> I did, however, pull on the hairs and looked at the brushes; the hairs did not come off and the brushes were soft.</li>
            <li> B0061JQY40 SHANY Cosmetics NY Collection Pro Brush Kit, 13 Ounce (22 Piece Mix Natural or Synthetic with Purple Faux Crocodile Case)]]</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft, no shedding (yet).</li>
            <li> They do shed just a bit but they are soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> After a few days in the open the odor diminished considerably, more so after washing.</li>
            <li> And I think you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth, since this amount would only get you about two higher-end brushes.</li>
            <li> MAC brushes are just way too expensive for my taste, I don&#x27;t care how good they may be.</li>
            <li> The first night I got the brushes I washed them in warm water and baby shampoo, there was not grime or discoloration in the water and very few (1-2) bristles came out when I washed them, this is less than my brushes from Sephora!</li>
            <li> I mean I love</li>
            <li> highly recommend this set, even at the regular Amazon price of $29.95.</li>
            <li> I spent about an hour cleaning them, and I just used them for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding during washing, and a couple bristles on my first use.</li>
            <li> The more fluffier and bigger brushes still do here and there but hardly ever.</li>
            <li> Although the silver colour font is a nice touch it could be difficult to see the listing clearly if you needed to reference it</li>
            <li> and I did test them out before going to purchase them in the near future.</li>
            <li> Yes there is a slight smell when you first get them</li>
            <li> They were either too stiff, had too few brushes or too many I wouldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I was very hesistant to buy them, due to some mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li> The case is soft and protective and the brushes seem to be a high quality (I will update in a few months after we have used them for awhile).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I sprayed them with a regular spray on conditioner for hair, swirled them around in my palm and let them dry just to keep them soft.</li>
            <li> I gave them a quick wash and dry before putting them back into their neat little case!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand what the little zipper product is for though.</li>
            <li> The main down fall is that there is nothing to tell you what each brush is for.  </li>
            <li> I did notice the eye brushes had very very few hairs come out the first couple of times I used them</li>
            <li> But seriously, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist there are a few brushes that this doesn&#x27;t have that I use a lot, in particular the pencil brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not TOO bad, \\&quot;Febrez\\&quot; the bag, wash the brushes (very little sheding, like 1-3 strands here and there) and your good to go!  </li>
            <li> These brushes came to me speedy, as usual, thanks to Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> However the small downside is that they don&#x27;t deposit or hold as much product as I would like them to.</li>
            <li> if u keep the pack open for too long your head hurts from the smell</li>
            <li> I have also washed them multiple times and layed them out to dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I will love it if they would of label for what was each brush, The 1st four big brushes are not good they don&#x27;t pick up the make up and its just hard to try to put some makeup on with those.</li>
            <li> However ... they shed like crazy (as in there are usually 6 or more hairs that fall out or stick to my face every time I use them).  </li>
            <li> I received this Shany brush set in the mail earlier than expected and unscathed from shipping.</li>
            <li> I shopped around for a long time and read review after review.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I also like the mix of soft and firm hairs in the brushes.</li>
            <li> very very soft brushes but just because there soft doesn&#x27;t mean that they cant intensify your face!</li>
            <li> If this works I will be back on here to change my review and bump it up to 4 stars b/c other than the shedding</li>
            <li> but I pulled on the brissels to get any loose hair out.</li>
            <li> The face that it looks like a little clutch means I could totally get away with taking my brushes with me every where.</li>
            <li> I can just lightly touch the #3 &amp; the hairs come out like crazy.</li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t wear make up everyday and probably only used the brushes twice a week and one time on the weekend</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which is partially true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I washed all the brushes and there was minimal fallout of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Not much variation in the eye brushes</li>
            <li> no not really</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind any other brush in this set.</li>
            <li> So stop looking at other sets</li>
            <li> Way before the expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> Like the fact they don&#x27;t shed like other brands.</li>
            <li> They were delivered before expected!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews where people said it had a plastic or chemical like scent, there was a bit of a plastic sent on the case but not over bearing where it was an issue.</li>
            <li> it was expected that there would be a slight plastic odor.</li>
            <li> When I got the brushes I did notice a slight plastic smell from the pouch however, I was looking (or smelling) for it due to the other reviews that had mentioned it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any odd smell</li>
            <li> The smell on the brushes is a little chemically if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> The eye brushes pick up and apply product well with little to no fall out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a little worried now what this product is gonna be like.  </li>
            <li> The largest powder brush shed a little bit.</li>
            <li> took another reviewers advise and washed them in gentle shampoo, the water was dirty  and there was shedding</li>
            <li> I had hoped they would eventually get over the shedding problem but they have only gotten worse.</li>
            <li> i bought this brush set few weeks ago ,</li>
            <li> They do the trick for everyday makeup though.</li>
            <li> While a few shed it wasn&#x27;t too much to get mad over.</li>
            <li> box set comes with a small brochure that describes each brush and their function; however there are a few errors.</li>
            <li> You definitely feel some bristles poking at your face when you use some of the brushes, but it isn&#x27;t so annoying that you&#x27;d want to throw your brushes away in complete frustration.</li>
            <li> The selection of brushes is great; however, the larger brushes, when used, leave behind stray bristles on my face which is extremely annoying and itchy; plus it looks stupid if I miss cleaning them off.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t that soft and they shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what some of them are for...</li>
            <li> I never checked but hopefully they are :/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> if your on a tight buget like me!!  </li>
            <li> but now theres hardly any that fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a few days now, and the shedding is still slightly frustrating.</li>
            <li> My only bad thing to say about the set is that the powder brush does shed, that&#x27;s why i gave this product 4 stars and not 5, but the slight shedding should not discourage one from buying this product!</li>
            <li> They are just poor quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get toooo annoyed when hairs fall out</li>
            <li> but I do get annoyed when they fall out every time I use it which doesn&#x27;t happen with this product.</li>
            <li> But if you get annoyed by shedding brushes, then don&#x27;t go with these.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re not incredibly experienced, you may not know what all of the brushes are used for - there&#x27;s no listing enclosed.</li>
            <li> Silly me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, will not recommend to other friends.</li>
            <li> They smell realllllllly bad and i&#x27;ve washed them like 4 times already and can not get that weird smell out.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s so bad.</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t used bad.</li>
            <li> so maybe I just received a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but omg the smell really bad</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t BAD brushes.</li>
            <li> They DO have a plastic smell but it isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> The bristles falls off when you are washing them too &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed these brushes aren&#x27;t the MIRICLE brushes I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> it shed  on my face, its really annoying.</li>
            <li> #1 &amp;3 shed really bad!</li>
            <li> Just terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The price is amazing for the quality of the product, and the case is a great find! I don&#x27;t really understand what the little zipper product is for though. haha But seriously, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for the money.  As a makeup artist there are a few brushes that this doesn&#x27;t have that I use a lot, in particular the pencil brush.  Other than that a great deal.  Several of my students have purchased this set and they love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Very nice and good brush collection.Quality is not 100% but somewhere 85-95%.&lt;br /&gt;Different types of brushes gives possibility to make up any kind of faces: :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good brushes for a beginner or someone who doesn&#x27;t put on makeup a lot.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush fell apart fast and the powder brush will NOT stop shedding. I don&#x27;t mind any other brush in this set. But it was worth what I paid, but I now have a case and some brushes I use all the time.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THESE BRUSHES AND I LOVE THE WAY THEY FEEL.THESE BRUSHES ARE BIG,BEAUTIFUL,AND THE BRISTLES ARE EXTREMELY SOFT.  GOOD QUALITY BRUSHES.THE BRISTLES AND VERY DENSE AND HOLD UP WELL.IM THINKING ABOUT BUYING MY FRIEND THESE BRUSHES FOR HER BIRTHDAY.</li>
            <li> I looked for nearly a week trying to find the perfect brush set. I wanted a set that came with a brush for everything I put on my face. This set has it all. When I got the set my first reaction was omg they are so big. The case is so pretty too. This set is a really good deal the brushes don&#x27;t shed and are great. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase. So stop looking at other sets this is the one you want</li>
            <li> Overall, ok brushes for the price. Came with almost every type of brush you need for a starter kit. The small brushes are decent and ok quality. The big brushes are not all that. They smell realllllllly bad and i&#x27;ve washed them like 4 times already and can not get that weird smell out. The bristles falls off when you are washing them too &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Me pareció una buena compra; el estuche un rojo oscuro elegante, sin olores a plástico. Las brochas tienen todas una textura muy suave, buen peso y largas. Pocos pelos se cayeron. Para mi que soy Beginner estuvo perfecto.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brush rolls. The price is unbeatable and the quality is great. Plus there is every brush in this set that you can think of. They don&#x27;t shed, even when cleaned and SO SOFT. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Good brushes soft and clean lets see how they hold up when I do the first wash.</li>
            <li> The case of these brushes grabbed my eyes right away. The face that it looks like a little clutch means I could totally get away with taking my brushes with me every where. I like that this sent come with mixed brush materials like natural and synthetic because that gives me the chance to try both out and find out which I may like better. the price is a plus because the brushes come out not costing much and I get the nice little case included.</li>
            <li> REALLY USEFULL. EXCELLENT QUALITY</li>
            <li> I wanted so much to like these brushes!!! Price is right, shipping was fast, packaging was good and case is beautiful just what I was looking for......BUT DAMB those shedding brissels!! I must say they are dense, pickup color well and soft ebutUpon using I had hair all over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my makeup, face, and makeup pallet. I have to use the fan brush to whippe off. thats a big prob for me b/c thats an issue I never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took another reviewers advise and washed them in gentle shampoo, the water was dirty  and there was shedding but I pulled on the brissels to get any loose hair out. If this works I will be back on here to change my review and bump it up to 4 stars b/c other than the shedding I dont really have a prob with this product *UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*8/6/1313&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use this set. They are just poor quality. I use elf brushes that i purchase at Target,they are sold separately and affordable ($1 a piece). The best part is i buy the ones i need. I also use the M.A.C blending brush (love this brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get what you pay for.my 10 yr old niece is experimenting with makeup so i will give this set to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I searched for a couple of weeks for makeup brushes on a budget!  My 1st choice was out of stock.  So I looked some more and I came across these.  I was very hesistant to buy them, due to some mixed reviews.  So out on a limb I go! I was excited to get them.  They are very pretty, clean, well made.  The bag is very cute!! I love it.  There is a smell to it all!  It&#x27;s not TOO bad, \\&quot;Febrez\\&quot; the bag, wash the brushes (very little sheding, like 1-3 strands here and there) and your good to go!  The smell on the brushes is a little chemically if that makes sense.  Oh yeah and I got them like in 3 days.  Way before the expected delivery date! Awsome buy. Totaly worth the $ if your on a tight buget like me!!  Hope you like them...</li>
            <li> How cute are these?! I love that there is a mix of synthetic and natural hair brushes. I love the variety and how this has every brush I will ever need! I love how this rolls up into a neat little clutch that is just adorable! Overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my best friend for her birthday, (last year I bought her shany eyeshadow palettes) and she won&#x27;t stop thanking me for them. It&#x27;s almost like she rubs it in my face lol I think her favorite part is getting them out and setting them all down right before she does her makeup in the morning. I&#x27;m so glad I bought these for her, I was nervous cause it&#x27;s purple and she likes blue, but to her it didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> When I purchased these brushes I was looking for a large set of brushes for a good price. I was VERY surprised at the quality of the brushes and how quickly they arrived.  The brushes arrived within two days, WAY before their estimated arrival date, and they were of really great quality.  When I got the brushes I did notice a slight plastic smell from the pouch however, I was looking (or smelling) for it due to the other reviews that had mentioned it. If I wasn&#x27;t looking for it I don&#x27;t think I would have noticed it, and after one night of airing out I didn&#x27;t smell anything. The first night I got the brushes I washed them in warm water and baby shampoo, there was not grime or discoloration in the water and very few (1-2) bristles came out when I washed them, this is less than my brushes from Sephora! I have been using them daily for about two weeks now and they are holding up great, with no bristle shedding! I am very happy with these brushes, they are good quality and I can absolutely see myself using them for a while. The only issue I have with the set is that while there are lots of eye brushed and a lot of duplicates there are not duplicates for the facial brushes. I would have liked for there to be duplicates of some of them like the angled brush so I could have one for bronzers and one for regular blushed. Other than that, this set is perfect!</li>
            <li> My wife saw this while it was a &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34; and couldn&#x27;t resist. She said it has every brush that would ever be needed, whether for the every day person or a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> This brush set contains everything you would need to start building up your make up collection and it even comes in a stylish carrying case.</li>
            <li> This is the brush set every Starter to Pro needs!! Application of makeup is such a breeze and your given every brush you could ever need!! Very good quality and they come in this stylish Purple Faux Croc Case that fits in your bag so easily!! So dont wait get yours before they are gone!![[ASIN:B0061JQY40 Shany Cosmetics NY Collection Pro Brush Kit, 13 Ounce (22 Piece Mix Natural or Synthetic with Purple Faux Crocodile Case)]]</li>
            <li> I will love it if they would of label for what was each brush, The 1st four big brushes are not good they don&#x27;t pick up the make up and its just hard to try to put some makeup on with those. You can&#x27;t expect a better quality for what you&#x27;re a paying but its actually good to practice when you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li> Bought this set about a year ago, and at first there was maybe like 3 hairs on my face every time I used the brushes.  Now it&#x27;s so bad. #1 &amp;3 shed really bad! I can just lightly touch the #3 &amp; the hairs come out like crazy. ( I don&#x27;t wear make up everyday and probably only used the brushes twice a week and one time on the weekend so they aren&#x27;t used bad. So think about that) Also  Not going to purchase again</li>
            <li> Purchased these brushes almost a year ago and I swear they are the BEST brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have washed them twice and there has been almost NO shedding. I have always been afraid of contouring and blending in the fear of looking like a clown, but these are incredible for those purposes! With these brushes I have now self taught myself contouring and how to do a great smoky eye. Absolutely love these and I recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t own this set but my friend owns them and I did test them out before going to purchase them in the near future. I have to say they are Great meaning soft and the handles are stirdy!</li>
            <li> I always need moremoremore brushes and so when I had to upgrade from a basic set, I turned to Shany for the good price/good quality combo.  This set has everything I need and I love having a lot of shadow brushes so I don&#x27;t have to constantly clean/wipe off when playing with looks.</li>
            <li> great quality,  i use em like crazy... perfect for a girl that is a makeup junkie :) really cute case as well</li>
            <li> Very nice, high quality brushes! I would recommend them to anyone looking for professional brushes.  They are sift and durable.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It got here really fast! The case is pretty and all the brushes are nice. I tried them out right away and decided I was happy with my purchase. Recommended! Amazing price for a good product</li>
            <li> I looked at dozens of brush sets. They were either too stiff, had too few brushes or too many I wouldn&#x27;t use. While this set is not small, I am able to utilize every brush. My daughter&#x27;s a cosmetologist. She gave them a trial run and could not believe I was able to get this type of quality for such a great price. The pretty case is just an added bonus. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my selection. They would make a great gift too.</li>
            <li> I received this Shany brush set in the mail earlier than expected and unscathed from shipping. I bought this product as a Christmas present for a family member and I have discovered that it is a more than acceptable set for those who are beginners or novices at makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that this product is manufactured in China it was expected that there would be a slight plastic odor. After a few days in the open the odor diminished considerably, more so after washing. In terms of shedding, the fan brush was the only one that did, all the others did not and this was after multiple pull tests. There was however a setting powder on all the brushes but after washing and drying, it was no longer present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case the brushes come in is sewn well, shiny and soft albeit plastic not leather. The case is more of a burgundy than the dark purple in colour. The magnetic buttons for the case are noticeably flimsy and they may tear after frequent opening and closing. It may be a good idea to reinforce them with glue as a preventative measure. Alternatively, the zipper on the inside for extra product is sewn in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves look professional with matte black, are quite soft, shaped nicely, have sturdy handles and are light weight. All the face brushes are relatively dense and maintain their shape with use. The eye brushes were evidently given less attention as they are not shaped as nicely and are not as soft to the touch. However, the variation of face and eye brushes allows you to gain experience with them which is useful for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box set comes with a small brochure that describes each brush and their function; however there are a few errors. The blush brush and angled contour brush are reversed in the listing as well as the blender brush and the concealer brush. Although the silver colour font is a nice touch it could be difficult to see the listing clearly if you needed to reference it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros outweigh the cons for this product. All the brushes do pick up product nicely. The set is a favourable size for travelling. The price is undeniably budget friendly given you could purchase one high end brush for the price of the entire set. This brush set can easily be recommended for those that want to purchase one for the first time or for those who would like to improve their current set. All in all it is a great product./&gt;The pros outweigh the cons for this product. All the brushes do pick up product nicely. The set is a favourable size for travelling.

            <li> I really love these brushes. They are beautiful, soft, and high quality. This is not the first product I have tried from Shany Cosmetics, and everything I try from them always amazes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for my two star rating is for the vendor/distributor.. My brush case wasn&#x27;t in a shany box it was just in a mailing package which wasn&#x27;t that big of deal but when I looked at my brush case it had a rip in it and then when I opened the case my brushes looked and felt like they had been used and there was still product on it, especially the foundation brush.. On top of that, the brush case near the brush bristles was dirty with what looked like someone&#x27;s left over powders. I am soooo unimpressed. I ordered these brushes under the impression that they were new. I would say the brushes are great but if you order them go through a different vendor!</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. Soft texture and easy to use. I love this brush set! I think it&#x27;s worth much more than the price I paid!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful but they&#x27;re not vegan! The natural bristles are goat hair! I thought the whole time they were natural fibers. Silly me.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these since they are my first \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; set of brushes. I like the variety, they are soft, and they work well.  However ... they shed like crazy (as in there are usually 6 or more hairs that fall out or stick to my face every time I use them).  I&#x27;m keeping them since I really needed a set but I definitely won&#x27;t purchase from this brand again.  If I still wore contacts, these would be a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: (1/30/14)&lt;br /&gt;Throwing these in the trash. I had hoped they would eventually get over the shedding problem but they have only gotten worse. At first the problem only existed for the larger face brushes but all of the shadow brushes have started significantly shedding as well.  Any time you might save by using these to apply makeup is nullified when you have to pick all the hairs off of your face after. I&#x27;ve had free brushes you get in makeup compacts hold up better than these ... Planning on contacting the company directly as well to express my dissatisfaction with the product. I don&#x27;t exactly have the money to throw at a new set of brushes every couple of months.</li>
            <li> Very good brushes some hairs fall out but definitly a great purchase for someone who doesnt wanna spend a lot of money but still recieves good quality brushes!!</li>
            <li> manufacturer concerned with client satisfaction. I had a problem but they gave me their undivided attention to resolve the matter.</li>
            <li> When I bought this set I was new to wearing make up.  I gave it 4 stars because it was perfect for me.  cheap enough to allow me the ability of purchasing multiple bushes while still have enough quality to not discourage me from trying all of them.  The main down fall is that there is nothing to tell you what each brush is for.  That would have pushed it to 5 stars for a beginner set.  I through the bag away as it just got in the way.</li>
            <li> Such great quality, my makeup looks the best it has ever looked! The brushes are a great price for the quantity and quality!</li>
            <li> I love this product, if you are thinking about getting make up brushes this is this right way to go. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH AND IT LOOKES JUST LIKE THE PHOTO SO YOU KNOW THIS IS A GREAT DEAL FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> Ive had these brushes for over a year and now is whn they have started to shed. And only the big powder brushes. Not hard to wash and works great with all shadows and pigments. From wetnwild to nars. Love them. Staple in my collection.</li>
            <li> Works great and shipping was fast. Would strongly advise this brand compared to much more expensive competition. Carrying case was a nice added bonus</li>
            <li> Great variety, well made, one for every purpose under the cosmetic sun!  Glad that she will know how to use them all!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that this isn&#x27;t the best brush kit on earth. You definitely feel some bristles poking at your face when you use some of the brushes, but it isn&#x27;t so annoying that you&#x27;d want to throw your brushes away in complete frustration. The hair also sometimes falls out, but this has only happened to me while I was cleaning my brushes, and not when I was applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it definitely works as a starter set, something you would buy when you want to test different types of brushes out and know what each one does. And I think you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth, since this amount would only get you about two higher-end brushes.</li>
            <li> The handles come off easily. I&#x27;m not impressed. I&#x27;m going to have to find a new foundation brush. I do like that they number and tell you what each brush is for.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this brush kit.  She uses most of the brushes, but these things are very good quality.  The case it comes in isn&#x27;t really her taste, but it does hold all the brushes and it is made of good quality resources.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I love to be creative with my makeup and the small brush set my mother bought me a couple of christmas&#x27;s ago was holding me back (sephora 5pc set). I thought this set would be great to kind of experiment first hand what brushes I would use more or need to be more precise with on my makeup. I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $50 just for 6, 7, 8 + brushes. The packaging had a smell to it but it wasn&#x27;t something to puke over. The crocodile pouch is fax leather so I knew of course it&#x27;s going to have a smell to it but it just went away after a week, didn&#x27;t wash it or anything it kind of just adapted with the natural smells in my room. The brushes are very secured, the handle of the brushes were covered in plastic bag pouches and the more bigger bushes had a hard plastic covering the hairs of the brush. After using this for a month, hairs did fall out here in there when I first started to use them but now theres hardly any that fall out. My sephora blush brush still has hairs falling out every time I use it. I don&#x27;t get toooo annoyed when hairs fall out and I see them on my face but I do get annoyed when they fall out every time I use it which doesn&#x27;t happen with this product. I did notice the eye brushes had very very few hairs come out the first couple of times I used them but now nothing. The more fluffier and bigger brushes still do here and there but hardly ever. This even came with a paper explaining what brushes are used for what and are very descriptive which I loved. I recommend this for beginners since I am a beginner myself. Can&#x27;t really speak for a more experience makeup user.</li>
            <li> These brushes came to me speedy, as usual, thanks to Amazon Prime. However, that was about the only good thing about these brushes. I was quite excited to see a fairly nice looking set of brushes for a pretty good price. I should have known better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened the box I was hit with a very strong plastic smell. This wasn&#x27;t pleasant but it didn&#x27;t make me upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to unroll the brushes and all looked pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to take out the first brush from the holder (gently) and the handle fell off! What a great first impression!&lt;br /&gt;Annoyed, I moved on to the next brushes. They&#x27;re just decent. Most of the handles are wobbly or crooked. The bristles aren&#x27;t that soft and they shed like crazy. I&#x27;m talking several strands with each use. The eyeshadow brushes do not pick up pigment well at all and you really have to work to get the color on your lid. I can&#x27;t bring myself to even use these because they&#x27;re just so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried to contact the owner of the brand to try to resolve the issue but they ignored me.&lt;br /&gt;It seems as if some people have had a better experience so maybe I just received a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these brushes at all. There&#x27;s several different brands out there that are of similar price and of much better quality.</li>
            <li> Great buy and budgetfriendly!! Excellent product and convenient case when traveling along with an excellent variety of brushes. Great for a gift.</li>
            <li> For getting twenty-two pieces at this price, its perfect if you&#x27;re on a budget like many of us. The roll up case makes it that much better.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes they are great but omg the smell really bad if u keep the pack open for too long your head hurts from the smell</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes for my grand daughter who has just started to experience with some make-up. She loves them so much.  I wanted to start her on good brushes.  The package was wrapped very well and came in a hurry.  Thanks</li>
            <li> it is such a great case. very very soft brushes but just because there soft doesn&#x27;t mean that they cant intensify your face!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful brushes. I was amazed at how many of them for the price. the case is beautiful! Defenetly worth the money. Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas. She is a vegan and also a fashionista. This fits the bill-- it has every brush she could want, all are very soft, and comes in a great little carrying case as well. Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes. Good for beginners. The brushes sorta seem to be the same style but you definitely can work with them. The big brushes may shed a bit but its manageable.</li>
            <li> The brushes all seem to be a good quality especially for the price. I mean I love how many different brushes it comes with and they all seem very sturdy. The case is kind of cheap but I still think it is so shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li> I havent got to use them yet but the softness and quality was spot on. Yes there is a slight smell when you first get them but it does go away.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I found that these brushed seemed to be the best bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;Which is partially true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m somewhat new to using makeup brushes and thought this would be an awesome set.&lt;br /&gt; First off, packaging is lovely! The case has a bad smell, but other than that, its WONDERFUL and elegant. But let&#x27;s get on to the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- fairly dense&lt;br /&gt;- sturdy handles&lt;br /&gt;- light weight&lt;br /&gt;- face brushes are useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- shed a lot&lt;br /&gt;- bristles are not glued in straight (some of them,mainly the eye brishes, the bristles looked sideways or cut uneven)&lt;br /&gt;- not as soft as I hoped (my eco tools brushes are MUCH softer)&lt;br /&gt;- not enough variety of eye brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT:&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I can&#x27;t really complain. I recieved 22 brushes for the price of 1 high end brush (about 25 bucks). I&#x27;m disappointed these brushes aren&#x27;t the MIRICLE brushes I was hoping for. I MIGHT return these and purchase the coastal scents brushes instead.&lt;br /&gt;all in all, you get what you pay for. They aren&#x27;t BAD brushes. But I do believe&lt;br /&gt;You can get better ones for around the same $$.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will recommend these, but I will probably keep them and find a use for them.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get a set of professional makeup brushes for a while and came across this one. This price was suspiciously low, but the reviews for this set and many of the other ones from this company were great. I had tried the Sephora brushes, which were fine but pricey.&lt;br /&gt;When I received these brushes, there was a very mild smell, nothing to complain about though. I washed all the brushes and there was minimal fallout of the bristles. The brushes are supersoft and apply makeup very nicely. I actually like these better than the Sephora brand brushes.</li>
            <li> liked it! my girl friend would surely like this :D reached my place on time before i was about to leave.</li>
            <li> These brushes are good for anyone who&#x27;s on a budget and needs multiple brushes for multiple uses. For the amount of brushes you receive for the amount you pay is definitely worth it. But if you get annoyed by shedding brushes, then don&#x27;t go with these. Otherwise, good buy.</li>
            <li> This 22 piece brush set is truly gorgeous. Its like a clutch for your brushes which holds them neatly and in place. The purple crocodile case is beautiful and the brushes are great for creating the perfect look. The brushes are soft and have many bristles. You get a variety of brushes which come in use for different purposes. While a few shed it wasn&#x27;t too much to get mad over. Wash all your brushes before using it since it has a scent when you first open it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are of incredible quality. The bristles are baby soft and these do not shed at all. The case is excellent for travel to...just worth mentioning!</li>
            <li> These brushes a well designed and their value is much more than its price! Not only are the brushes great but the case is well thought out too, it has a zippered pouch which is convienient for carry extra brushes or make up. Shany really did a good job on this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cetisfied with this brush set, It&#x27;s the same what you see in photos. very nice and elegant. I think it&#x27;s a very nice gift for every woman. so boys buy it for your girls, and girls - buy it for you.</li>
            <li> I Love these brushes! They work great and the presentation was great for the price that I paid! They arrived on time and they were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these for my school drama club. The make-up crew said they worked great. Everyone&#x27;s make-up looked good onstage and the variety/quantity of brushes got the large cast done on time.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice but if you&#x27;re not incredibly experienced, you may not know what all of the brushes are used for - there&#x27;s no listing enclosed. However, the brushes work well, feel great, clean up easily enough. The case is nice and compact.</li>
            <li> Like the fact they don&#x27;t shed like other brands. I think these are great! Great value also! They were delivered before expected! Thanks! Will definitely get more of these when the time comes!</li>
            <li> I shopped around for a long time and read review after review.&lt;br /&gt;My brushes came yesterday and i am INLOVE they are soft and the matte black handles and light weight and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at this whole make-up application thing, so I wanted a variety of brushes to figure out what would work best for me. The selection of brushes is great; however, the larger brushes, when used, leave behind stray bristles on my face which is extremely annoying and itchy; plus it looks stupid if I miss cleaning them off. It&#x27;s a good beginner set and convenient to pack when I&#x27;m traveling which is nice. I&#x27;d say this is good for the novice application but not for the pros.</li>
            <li> My old sephora brush kit was getting old and decided to get a new one. Didn&#x27;t want to spend much so I got this one. Arrived in 2 days which made me very happy. I didn&#x27;t notice any odd smell but I did use a anti-bacterial brush cleanser over them before I used them to be clean. I love the variety of brushes which is why I purchased these brushes. However the small downside is that they don&#x27;t deposit or hold as much product as I would like them to. I also use an eye shadow primer to enhance the color of my shadows and still I&#x27;m not getting as much product on there as I would like using these brushes. Overall, it&#x27;s very usable and probably better suited for beginner makeup users or people who want a variety of brushes at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****EDIT*****&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a little over 2 years I can say they&#x27;ve done a good job. However, if you have a little more to spend go ahead and splurge on a better set. After 2 years it has served it&#x27;s original low purchase price but I would have gone back and spent a little more money if I had more to spend at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great to use because you get a lot of brushes to experiment with. They do shed a lot. The downside from that is that the amount of synthetic hair in the brushes doesn&#x27;t help makeup blend as well as over time. Newbie lesson learned. Like I said great buy for the amount of money but if you have $20-40 extra to spend from this price ($25) - DO IT and buy something better quality. They will last you longer and make your makeup look better even after a couple years of use.</li>
            <li> This is the best set we&#x27;ve ever purchased:  no shedding, no weird smell like some brushes. The case is beautiful and actually well designed with an extra pocket and a nice schematic insert that describes the function of each brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 11 and has dance recitals so this was perfect for her to do her make up and we share it...very nice.</li>
            <li> I actually found this Shany cosmetics pro brush kit on Wanelo and was astonished to find out it was only $22! I use the brushes on the daily and they work great. I would recommend this set to any woman! :)</li>
            <li> Very soft, I really like them! the price was really reasonable and look very proffesional, i love the case, it comes with a pamphlet that shows you what each brush does. i strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes, they are vera soft and have great quality. The case is very handy and pretty. Overall a really great deal!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Loved the brushes. Great quality. Loved the case. More of a dark red then purple. But Color is as pictured.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- They look very professional.&lt;br /&gt;- The face brushes are full and the perfect stiffness / softness combo for picking up powder&lt;br /&gt;- All brushes are soft&lt;br /&gt;- The case is convenient&lt;br /&gt;- The eye brushes pick up and apply product well with little to no fall out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve had them for a few days now, and the shedding is still slightly frustrating. Three or four strands out of each face brush every time I use them, even after washing. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll stop soon.&lt;br /&gt;- Not much variation in the eye brushes - it seems like there are five or six of the same brush in maybe a slightly different size, and another five or six the same in another style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re willing to buy a few specialty eye brushes to go along with it, this is a nice beginner set. Better quality face brushes than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for a while now and totally love them. I use them pretty much everyday and they are soft and feel nice on your skin and they also hold onto the product well. I have also washed them multiple times and layed them out to dry overnight. They wash really nicely and dry right back to their original shape. These are a must have for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg for makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Pros: Good packaging, soft bristles, cute snake skin case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Some brushes shed a bit, (mostly the fan brush and powder brush) BUT it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> These Brushes are amazing and the price is fantastic. I recomend a lot!!! I am in love with the case too!!!</li>
            <li> i bought this brush set few weeks ago , all im gonna say is the brush shed alot ,everytime  i do my make up it shed  on my face, its really annoying.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing my wife talking about the high prices for kits like these. I was checking out the Amazon deals one day and boom there it was. Its was sort of cheap- I forget the price at the time. Either way my wife loved it and the presentation is much better than I even expected. Either way it earned me some points for being thoughtful and giving her something she actually liked. So yeah I am sure you&#x27;ll like this.</li>
            <li> Im a professional makeup artist and the reason I purchased these brushes was because I heard lots of good things about Shany Cosmetic brushes. I would have liked to see a few more brushes with firmer bristles. Every single brush is SUPER soft, which many artists know is not always a good thing. Don&#x27;t even bother trying to pick up a cream product with these brushes because it just won&#x27;t work. A few brushes that I am impressed with is the foundation brush, blush brush, and powder brush. The foundation brush can be compared to a few high end brands that I own and is of great quality. The small detail brushes in this kit are excellent as well and are very useful, you also get quite a few which is nice. Great kit for beginners and pros can find a few useful brushes as well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes, per se, but I would say go for it if you are really interested in them.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit!  I love this set! I also like the mix of soft and firm hairs in the brushes. Pretty color says it&#x27;s purple  but it looks burgunday to me. Nice touch the Crocodile Case.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t have these brushes, I was impressed by the image and description of the brushes.  Different brush sets, in makeup, work for different people.  In makeup, when it comes to accessories, there is no such thing as a \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; formula, and this is the reason why this set of brushes would be perfect for certain people, and make up artists.  Also, the case means that the brushes will last a long time! :)</li>
            <li> I love how you have so many brushes that are soft in such a stylish case. Fits in your purse or make up bag easily.</li>
            <li> These are great, so glad I bought it. They are super soft and great quality. The case is super handy :) Very, very happy!</li>
            <li> I love this brush set, you get a great variety of brushes and the price is fantastic. I read other reviews where people said it had a plastic or chemical like scent, there was a bit of a plastic sent on the case but not over bearing where it was an issue. It applies makeup well and the bristles are soft. My only bad thing to say about the set is that the powder brush does shed, that&#x27;s why i gave this product 4 stars and not 5, but the slight shedding should not discourage one from buying this product! Bottom line for the quality and variety you get for the price, you should definitely purchase!!</li>
            <li> Love this case and brush set! I&#x27;m not sure what some of them are for...but I&#x27;m sure I will figure it out. I do love that tthe bristles don&#x27;t fall out and stick to my face like the other brush set I have!</li>
            <li> Brushes are great and the roll up that it comes with is bomb! They DO have a plastic smell but it isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> This brush collection arrived so quickly, I didn&#x27;t have time to even blink it seems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I am occasionally called to do makeup for photo shoots, events, etc. I wanted to have a separate kit that I could take along instead of  raiding my own beauty implements. Also because I wanted the cool fan brush! Everything I need, plus some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything came neatly packaged and there was no damage whatsoever. All the brushes are wonderful! I gave them a quick wash and dry before putting them back into their neat little case! I sprayed them with a regular spray on conditioner for hair, swirled them around in my palm and let them dry just to keep them soft. The brushes are good quality and the hairs are attached very well - little to no fall-out during the washing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this set to any traveling make-up artist or makeup enthusiast!</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay. I mainly use the blush and concealer brushes from this set. I ordered Bellus brushes before and found those are better quality. The fan brush in this set sheds a lot!</li>
            <li> My teen daughter convinced me to buy this set when it was a flash sale for $22.46. I wish I had bought more sets! If you consider a 3-4 piece brush set at Ulta is at least 20$, its a great deal.  I am thinking of hiding it in my room hoping she will forget we ordered it. The case is soft and protective and the brushes seem to be a high quality (I will update in a few months after we have used them for awhile).&lt;br /&gt;The case is not purple, as stated.  It is burgundy, not that it matters much.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this set, even at the regular Amazon price of $29.95.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem very good for the price. There was a plastic smell when I opened the bag, but it was not too strong and it should go away after airing the bag and washing the brushes. I bought this item as a gift, so I cannot give it five stars since I am not using it. I did, however, pull on the hairs and looked at the brushes; the hairs did not come off and the brushes were soft. Good quality for the price, I want to get a set for myself. The bag is a nice maroon color, it was a hit!</li>
            <li> The hairs of the brushes started falling on the first use. Very disappointed, will not recommend to other friends. Smh</li>
            <li> these brushes are good! like that they are mixed. and so many brushes! and the case is very nice and colors are great! I would really recommend you get these its well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes just to have a back up pair for my main brushes ! I use my brushes a lot on clients and what I did notice about these brushes was that it bristles tend to shed and get left on my clients face!! Same problem as I&#x27;m washing them. I wasn&#x27;t to happy about that but like I said their just my back set.&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend them ?? Uuumm no not really plus now I&#x27;m more into the vegan set brushes idk if these are vegan (meaning no animal hair, cruelty free.) I never checked but hopefully they are :/</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got them in the mail today and cannot wait to use them more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are great quality and are super soft. My shadows glided on with the medium eye shadow brush. Love that a spooly comes in the kit too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for pro quality brushes at discount prices: this is the kit for you!</li>
            <li> So I received my package today, ON MY BIRTHDAY. I Love how SHANY includes the name of each brush and their functions inside. It&#x27;s very important since Im starting my new makeup collection. The Brushes are very Soft and The Faux Crocodile Case? To Die For! Also very Stylish and Pretty.  Cant Wait To put them to Use! Thank You SHANY COSMETICS!</li>
            <li> I love the brushes in this kit. They are perfect for what I needed and recommend them to others who like to experiment with their makeup.</li>
            <li> Smelled and the brushes were not of the standard they should have been...I returned them and would NOT recommend purchasing them unless it is for a young teen that is not really doing much with the make up application but would love to show they have a brush set!!!</li>
            <li> The brush set arrived right on time, all brushes were perfectly in place! it was amazing! the brushes work well and feel really great on the skin!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! These brushes shed so much, every time I try to apply my makeup my face is full of hair fibers from these cheap quality brushes. Just terrible!</li>
            <li> So I just received my brush set and I love it...the brushes were way better than I expected. VERY neatly packed and I just couldnt ask for more. I have yet to wash the brushes but Im sure by the quality of them now they would remind the same. And the also sent me a free gift. I would most certainly be ordering AGAIN from Shany Cosmetics. [[ASIN:B0061JQY40 SHANY Cosmetics NY Collection Pro Brush Kit, 13 Ounce (22 Piece Mix Natural or Synthetic with Purple Faux Crocodile Case)]]</li>
            <li> Great so far, a lot of repeat brushes though which is not really a problem for me. Brushes are soft, no shedding (yet).</li>
            <li> I was searching for a while for a good brush set that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. MAC brushes are just way too expensive for my taste, I don&#x27;t care how good they may be. These had decent reviews, and all the brushes I wanted, plus a great price. I ordered on a Thursday, and I received them on the following Monday. And that was with standard shipping. The bag has a bit of a smell, but it looks cute. The brushes themselves don&#x27;t smell for me. I spent about an hour cleaning them, and I just used them for the first time today. They&#x27;re really nice. Minimal shedding during washing, and a couple bristles on my first use. They are soft, and apply makeup very nicely. I&#x27;m very happy that I bought these and have actually been recommending them to friends that are looking for a similar product.</li>
            <li> these brushes are great! if the brushes were labeled then it would really be easier to use instead of me having to read the paper manual each time I use them. I would buy this set again!</li>
            <li> Great value for the set. The brushes may need at trim here or there and a good wash when you get it home, but I find that true for most mid end brush sets..... this set will do its job and help you to bulk up your brush set if you are doing multiple faces at a time.... and great gift for the every day girl that just needs better brushes than the ones that come in her compact!</li>
            <li> The brushes are okay, but they do shed excessively.</li>
            <li> It comes with 22 different brush and a purple crocodile case. the case is very pretty. also the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> Fine set of brushes by Shany! I love the ruby red/purple case, really pretty! I would love to get more of their brushes!</li>
            <li> are reviews from people who have only reviewed Shany products.  I am a little worried now what this product is gonna be like.  I will post more when I, an ACTUAL CUSTOMER, who has NO AFFILIATION TO SHANY, actually receive this  product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I received my brushes and am rather happy with them.  They do shed just a bit but they are soft to the touch.  I am by no means a makeup artist and am rarely new to brushes, so I really cannot tell if they are professional quality or not.  They do the trick for everyday makeup though.</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent. The largest powder brush shed a little bit. I used an antibacterial dish soap and olive oil to clean them, let them dry. There was no shedding after that at all. The blending brushes are great and really get the job done. I would definitely recommend these brushes to my friends.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy these brushes because of all the mixed reviews. I&#x27;m glad I went out on a limb and got them. They are pretty good for the price. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding, was able to get rid of the plastic smell and they blend beautifully. Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup brush set for daily use.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the handles separating.  These are easy to clean, and the case is perfect for travel as well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice. Fits perfectly in the case and the case looks like a stylish clutch. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
