            <li>She gets a kit from me in her Christmas stocking every year and is very happy for it.</li>
            <li>It worked beautifully on my chin, but my bikini line and legs are patchy in the areas I waxed.</li>

            <li>This great is great</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>

            <li>and this is honestly one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the size of the tub is great.</li>
            <li>Very effective-</li>
            <li>This is a very effective hair removal system.</li>
            <li>But this works amazingly well to remove unwanted hair and does not irritate my skin!</li>
            <li>you want to successfully get this area don&#x27;t please follow my advice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never using skin burning heated or warm waxes ever again!</li>
            <li>Works well on my arms but didn&#x27;t do a good job on my legs.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I am used to it yet because I am not having a good result</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to heat it, which is good.</li>
            <li>The best part about it was how clean it was to use.</li>
            <li>Rinsed off the applicator sticks with warm water - also good as</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>1) Does not require heating, although you can put the container in a tub of warm water to make it softer.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not having to heat the wax up.</li>
            <li>so I suggest having some kind of soothing gel.</li>
            <li>It comes with a lot of muslin strips which is nice</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best wax that exists.</li>
            <li>Just 10 seconds in the microwave, and you have the perfect wax, and 8 or so strips will be enough for a good bikini wax.</li>
            <li>very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;go</li>
            <li>The plus side was that it was very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is water soluble and this really is great for clean up.  </li>
            <li>- it does spread a bit better if it is at a warm room temperature - I&#x27;m sure in the winter you&#x27;d want to warm it up a bit.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, it is not the strongest salon kind of wax</li>
            <li>I have never waxed at home before and this was so easy and effective.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite wax.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Even better when you microwave it for about 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have been waxed many times in many places (in both senses of the word).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the attitude that a lot of these waxing professionals seem to have when you are getting your eyebrows done</li>
            <li>- so I love that I&#x27;m not throwing more stuff in the trash.</li>
            <li>I need to experiment more on legs</li>
            <li>I love how water soluble it is.</li>
            <li>it is much better.</li>
            <li>And I love that it can be washed off with water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I got rid of a lot more hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with time I&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li>Soo glad</li>
            <li>It is a great price and works very well.</li>
            <li>I love that it is water</li>
            <li>I also love that it does not require a heater appliance.</li>
            <li>I am open to suggestions on how and when this is best to use</li>
            <li>Ok, so I tried DIY sugar wax recipes at home, none of them worked.</li>
            <li>It helped me to save many $ in beauty shop.</li>
            <li>I have used many types and nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li>washes off like magic.</li>
            <li>I will update if I learn more.</li>
            <li>I feel its more for thinner hairs.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;ll work better then.</li>
            <li>but I always required my husbands assistance to get the most hair off.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I am glad this product is.</li>
            <li>I would purchase it again and probably will buy it again when I need some more.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product very much.</li>
            <li>Got the job done, but I did not notice any difference pain wise compared to hot wax.</li>
            <li>(as far as ripping your hair out goes lol).</li>
            <li>just warm it up in the microwave and test it on your hand to make sure it&#x27;s not too hot.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I find it easy apply and to wash or wipe off.</li>
            <li>no sticking on hands- easily removed with baby wipes.</li>
            <li>and it easily washes off with water.</li>
            <li>If wax accidentally gets onto any surface, it can be easily wiped away.</li>
            <li>wax applies easily and gets all the hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>When I first got the wax it was warm from being on the delivery truck so no need to nuke it.</li>
            <li>I have bought this same product many, many times and am always impressed by the quality and efficiency it offers!</li>
            <li>washes right off with warm water, easy to clean your strips (just soak for a minute in warm/hot water, wax comes off so easy.  </li>
            <li>and they were good as new.</li>
            <li>Mine has been sitting in a cupboard for two years and still works fine.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how important easy cleanup would be</li>
            <li>my skin is super smooth!</li>
            <li>A quick wipe with a damp cloth and it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>cheap comparing to salons....</li>
            <li>it really is easy  clean up.</li>
            <li>and it came out lukewarm and really smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the purchase, I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I liked it because you could just wipe it or rinse it off , however I always had issues with really stubborn hairs under the arms.</li>
            <li>important part</li>
            <li>Smooth on some wax, press a strip onto it, pull and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sugar wax is good for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Love that it rinses right off.  </li>
            <li>and I can safely say that it is pretty easy to work with, although I but mine in a bath of hot water for about 10 minutes before using it to get it more runny.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off (water soluble) and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>The wax is completely water soluble and so comes off the wax strips and your skin easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a cinch.</li>
            <li>I actually was able to wax my own underarms really quickly.</li>
            <li>I put it on, applied the included strips, and it came right off with NO PAIN!</li>
            <li>, the price is right!</li>
            <li>I go into a full fledged panic and start tensing up and perspiring at the thought of fully exposing myself to the wax-wielding stranger.</li>
            <li>used the wax for the bikini area, and it overall did a good</li>
            <li>I really like this product but would like to get more strips.</li>
            <li>So yeah, consider how hooked you are on eliminating hair in the location you wax, because there&#x27;s a fair change it won&#x27;t grow back.</li>
            <li>: it really removed my leg hair fabulously!</li>
            <li>It is safe on sensitive areas and is very effective for removal of coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, very easy to clean, and not nearly as painful as some other products.</li>
            <li>It was fine at first but then....</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions in the pamphlet (which are not at all helpful) and the instructions of some reviewers who seemed to figure things out for themselves (which were super helpful), but I still had no</li>
            <li>The product came quickly, well packaged, and when it was suppose to.</li>
            <li>ridiculously easy and gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>I felt it was easy to use and did not hurt as much as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I was also impressed with the cloth strips as they are re-usable after simply washing the wax off with water and letting them dry off.</li>
            <li>so if you grow more fine hair you may only need to do this once.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, safe to use cold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, painless and very efficient!</li>
            <li>I reuse the waxing strips because they also rinse right off</li>
            <li>Rinse under hot/warm water and wax rinses right off-</li>
            <li>rinses off easily (unlike the wax at the salon which seems very resistant and requires much scrubbing).</li>
            <li>I though maybe his back hair was too course, so I also tried it on my legs where my hair is very fine, but it didn&#x27;t remove all the hair from there either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it get the job done, but it is incredibly easy to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li>First of all, the wax lasts me forever.</li>
            <li>and it was really smooth, even for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using this product</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good replacement for the messy hot wax you need to put in the microwave.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever tried waxing.  </li>
            <li>I believe it was related but can&#x27;t say for sure.  </li>
            <li>it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>It is a little sticky, but I love the fact that you can easily wash it off with water.</li>
            <li>The wax really does come right off of your skin and the strips with water.</li>
            <li>but that is  due to my own issue.</li>
            <li>You may or may not get convinced to wax one or more of these other areas, which quickly can add up at $5-10 a pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those who are trying to rid of the short thick hairs, this might not be the best choice.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin - so much so that I buy special lotions, shampoo, sunscreen, etc</li>
            <li>But they pretty much stopped there with the genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and my skin is really sensitive now.</li>
            <li>I usually use a roller wax, but there are certain areas that need more precise application, so I decided to try this wax.</li>
            <li>And unless you are waxing SUPER-thick hair, over a large surface area, it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so large</li>
            <li>However, it certainly was not the case.  </li>
            <li>I soaked the strips I used overnight in a large plastic cup</li>
            <li>This does the job fine but doesn&#x27;t take anything to the next level.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using for face, you are going to go through much</li>
            <li>a favor: go to a pro, pluck, or use REAL wax.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m not microwaving the whole jar over and over.</li>
            <li>fast...</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t really break out.  </li>
            <li>but it really just takes time to learn.</li>
            <li>So this doesn&#x27;t really help me at all.</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;ve had to do was microwave for 20 seconds and it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to avoid that....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much experience with wax and wanted to try something besides shaving.</li>
            <li>fast</li>
            <li>This wax is affordable, and works really well.</li>
            <li>It really does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li>I must not be the target audience for this wax, or I&#x27;m just really untalented at waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wax worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>This did not work on my face, it didn&#x27;t remove much hair</li>
            <li>but this one did not leave them AS much...</li>
            <li>Someone posted a review saying its better if you have a thick layer, I found that if your using strips it is best when the layer is thin.</li>
            <li>It was messy and it didn&#x27;t do the job effectively.</li>
            <li>I am fairly experienced with waxing, but have really only used hot wax and hard wax (without strips).  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better to try other products.</li>
            <li>I checked Amazon (of course) and the reviews were more or less positive</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need to be heated and it more gentle and less painful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The strips are also re-usable, since the wax can be washed off with water, you just have to rinse them under warm water and let them dry before your next use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I like having a landing strip, because I have zero hair in the inch to the left and right of the strip (all the other hair grows back, which looks bizarre).</li>
            <li>It is seriously the best waxing product and I highly suggest it over any other.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to pay the full $10-20 for a 10 second, 1-strip job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the videos I watched was with a professional sugar waxer and she said specifically that the biggest mistake people make in using sugar wax is that they do not apply it in the opposite direction of the hair, it kind of bothered me that the directions included said to apply in the direction not opposite direction.</li>
            <li>I can tell it is going to last me quite a while even if I do full leg</li>
            <li>but after my third try and making it sure i follow the step by step instruction, still i get the same issues.</li>
            <li>It did a decent job</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different at-home waxes, and this one is my favorite for a few reasons: It is easy to apply and to clean up, it doesn&#x27;t have to be heated, and it really works!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>After a bit more practice waxing some less sensitive areas, I will probably try to wax my bikini line</li>
            <li>It is a bit sticky, but I use it right beore the shower so it really isn&#x27;t a big issue.  </li>
            <li>unlike those other reviews I didn&#x27;t saw any huge difference....</li>
            <li>the lady totally butchered my eyebrows, completely ruining the natural shape and leaving an obvious bare spot on each brow which took about 2 months to fill back in (and this was at a nice spa where you would expect a higher skill level)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male with course thick hair and this product does a good job at removing it.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with red bumps like hot wax does.</li>
            <li>this was the second area I tried (first was my armpits).</li>
            <li>I have fine, nearly black hair</li>
            <li>Parissa worked fairly well, but it was so messy it was not worth the results.  </li>
            <li>This cold wax is great for travel and when having hot wax is not possible.  </li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t get it spreadable enough for large areas.</li>
            <li>Regular wax works fine, it&#x27;s just so messy and hard to get off, so I was hoping it would be a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>I think a hard wax might be better.</li>
            <li>this wax just completely wrecked my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but because they was so much wax it didn&#x27;t pull enough to get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>after the first time with waxing the area there was only a few hairs that didn&#x27;t get pulled the first time, really I can just tweeze them there is no need to wax again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was looking for a soft wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my face and underarms so far.</li>
            <li>but I think that was either the fault of my technique or just because I was using a soft wax in tricky areas.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than a prior product I used for years.</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t grown back much hair in 6 weeks</li>
            <li>I soak the used strips in hot water so the wax and hair falls off, then dry them overnight.</li>
            <li>soluble- any sticky spots clean up with just a little bit of water.</li>
            <li>no mess-</li>
            <li>you can relate to any of the above situations, give this a try since it only costs about as much as one professional eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li>However, Persian Cold Wax is water-soluble, so clean up is easy.  </li>
            <li>It does the job, but takes a few more tries.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I do have some red bumps, but they&#x27;re going away</li>
            <li>the extra wax comes RIGHT OFF with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing my face for a very long time now, and tend to break out once the hair starts to grow back; or my skin gets irritated if I use hot wax.</li>
            <li>Less sting than a professional hot wax.</li>
            <li>The strips are nice and thick and they do not rip off unlike some other products on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fairness, DIY waxing is difficult to do well, and the fact that this product is water-soluble and easy to get to the right temperature are big points in its favor.  </li>
            <li>I have the most difficult time waxing my legs and have tried MANY times with hard wax and sugar wax.</li>
            <li>It barely hurts, I reuse the strips, etc.</li>
            <li>I have tried various types of hair removal wax including Sally Hansen and Parissa as well as professional waxing.  </li>
            <li>Although professional waxing is probably always the most efficient means, Persian Cold Wax is so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that it often takes more than one pass to get all the hair; I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the grabbing power of the wax itself or my technique.</li>
            <li>So it might last a long time on you or it might last the normal amount of time.</li>
            <li>Take a few Tylenol about 20 minutes before waxing, it will help with pain an inflammation (a trick I learned when I used to use hot wax).</li>
            <li>It took me over an hour trying to using it on different spots and not a single one got finished.</li>
            <li>(mine was a very thick syrup consistency) and warmed up, and both ways removed only fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I would take just a little bit on wax on the tip of the small applicator and first spread it down in the direction of hair growth, up in the opposite, down, and the up again before putting the wax strip on top.</li>

            <li> She gets a kit from me in her Christmas stocking every year and is very happy for it.</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully on my chin, but my bikini line and legs are patchy in the areas I waxed.</li>
            <li> SO HAPPY IT&#x27;S ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li> This great is great</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Well, I literally just finished waxing my legs, and seriously - I&#x27;m SO HAPPY.</li>
            <li> and this is honestly one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the size of the tub is great.</li>
            <li> Very effective-</li>
            <li> This is a very effective hair removal system.</li>
            <li> But this works amazingly well to remove unwanted hair and does not irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> you want to successfully get this area don&#x27;t please follow my advice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never using skin burning heated or warm waxes ever again!</li>
            <li> Works well on my arms but didn&#x27;t do a good job on my legs.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I am used to it yet because I am not having a good result</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to heat it, which is good.</li>
            <li> The best part about it was how clean it was to use.</li>
            <li> Rinsed off the applicator sticks with warm water - also good as</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> 1) Does not require heating, although you can put the container in a tub of warm water to make it softer.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not having to heat the wax up.</li>
            <li> so I suggest having some kind of soothing gel.</li>
            <li> It comes with a lot of muslin strips which is nice</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best wax that exists.</li>
            <li> Just 10 seconds in the microwave, and you have the perfect wax, and 8 or so strips will be enough for a good bikini wax.</li>
            <li> very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;go</li>
            <li> The plus side was that it was very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is water soluble and this really is great for clean up.  </li>
            <li> - it does spread a bit better if it is at a warm room temperature - I&#x27;m sure in the winter you&#x27;d want to warm it up a bit.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, it is not the strongest salon kind of wax</li>
            <li> I have never waxed at home before and this was so easy and effective.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite wax.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Even better when you microwave it for about 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have been waxed many times in many places (in both senses of the word).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the attitude that a lot of these waxing professionals seem to have when you are getting your eyebrows done</li>
            <li> - so I love that I&#x27;m not throwing more stuff in the trash.</li>
            <li> I need to experiment more on legs</li>
            <li> I love how water soluble it is.</li>
            <li> it is much better.</li>
            <li> And I love that it can be washed off with water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I got rid of a lot more hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with time I&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li> Soo glad</li>
            <li> It is a great price and works very well.</li>
            <li> I love that it is water</li>
            <li> I also love that it does not require a heater appliance.</li>
            <li> I am open to suggestions on how and when this is best to use</li>
            <li> Ok, so I tried DIY sugar wax recipes at home, none of them worked.</li>
            <li> It helped me to save many $ in beauty shop.</li>
            <li> I have used many types and nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li> washes off like magic.</li>
            <li> I will update if I learn more.</li>
            <li> I feel its more for thinner hairs.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;ll work better then.</li>
            <li> but I always required my husbands assistance to get the most hair off.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but I am glad this product is.</li>
            <li> I would purchase it again and probably will buy it again when I need some more.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product very much.</li>
            <li> Got the job done, but I did not notice any difference pain wise compared to hot wax.</li>
            <li> (as far as ripping your hair out goes lol).</li>
            <li> just warm it up in the microwave and test it on your hand to make sure it&#x27;s not too hot.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I find it easy apply and to wash or wipe off.</li>
            <li> no sticking on hands- easily removed with baby wipes.</li>
            <li> and it easily washes off with water.</li>
            <li> If wax accidentally gets onto any surface, it can be easily wiped away.</li>
            <li> wax applies easily and gets all the hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> When I first got the wax it was warm from being on the delivery truck so no need to nuke it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this same product many, many times and am always impressed by the quality and efficiency it offers!</li>
            <li> washes right off with warm water, easy to clean your strips (just soak for a minute in warm/hot water, wax comes off so easy.  </li>
            <li> and they were good as new.</li>
            <li> Mine has been sitting in a cupboard for two years and still works fine.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how important easy cleanup would be</li>
            <li> my skin is super smooth!</li>
            <li> A quick wipe with a damp cloth and it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> cheap comparing to salons....</li>
            <li> it really is easy  clean up.</li>
            <li> and it came out lukewarm and really smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the purchase, I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I liked it because you could just wipe it or rinse it off , however I always had issues with really stubborn hairs under the arms.</li>
            <li> important part</li>
            <li> Smooth on some wax, press a strip onto it, pull and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sugar wax is good for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Love that it rinses right off.  </li>
            <li> and I can safely say that it is pretty easy to work with, although I but mine in a bath of hot water for about 10 minutes before using it to get it more runny.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash off (water soluble) and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> The wax is completely water soluble and so comes off the wax strips and your skin easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a cinch.</li>
            <li> I actually was able to wax my own underarms really quickly.</li>
            <li> I put it on, applied the included strips, and it came right off with NO PAIN!</li>
            <li> , the price is right!</li>
            <li> I go into a full fledged panic and start tensing up and perspiring at the thought of fully exposing myself to the wax-wielding stranger.</li>
            <li> used the wax for the bikini area, and it overall did a good</li>
            <li> I really like this product but would like to get more strips.</li>
            <li> So yeah, consider how hooked you are on eliminating hair in the location you wax, because there&#x27;s a fair change it won&#x27;t grow back.</li>
            <li> : it really removed my leg hair fabulously!</li>
            <li> It is safe on sensitive areas and is very effective for removal of coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, very easy to clean, and not nearly as painful as some other products.</li>
            <li> It was fine at first but then....</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions in the pamphlet (which are not at all helpful) and the instructions of some reviewers who seemed to figure things out for themselves (which were super helpful), but I still had no</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, well packaged, and when it was suppose to.</li>
            <li> ridiculously easy and gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> I felt it was easy to use and did not hurt as much as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I was also impressed with the cloth strips as they are re-usable after simply washing the wax off with water and letting them dry off.</li>
            <li> so if you grow more fine hair you may only need to do this once.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, safe to use cold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, painless and very efficient!</li>
            <li> I reuse the waxing strips because they also rinse right off</li>
            <li> Rinse under hot/warm water and wax rinses right off-</li>
            <li> rinses off easily (unlike the wax at the salon which seems very resistant and requires much scrubbing).</li>
            <li> I though maybe his back hair was too course, so I also tried it on my legs where my hair is very fine, but it didn&#x27;t remove all the hair from there either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it get the job done, but it is incredibly easy to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li> First of all, the wax lasts me forever.</li>
            <li> and it was really smooth, even for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this product</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good replacement for the messy hot wax you need to put in the microwave.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever tried waxing.  </li>
            <li> I believe it was related but can&#x27;t say for sure.  </li>
            <li> it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky, but I love the fact that you can easily wash it off with water.</li>
            <li> The wax really does come right off of your skin and the strips with water.</li>
            <li> but that is  due to my own issue.</li>
            <li> You may or may not get convinced to wax one or more of these other areas, which quickly can add up at $5-10 a pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those who are trying to rid of the short thick hairs, this might not be the best choice.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin - so much so that I buy special lotions, shampoo, sunscreen, etc</li>
            <li> But they pretty much stopped there with the genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and my skin is really sensitive now.</li>
            <li> I usually use a roller wax, but there are certain areas that need more precise application, so I decided to try this wax.</li>
            <li> And unless you are waxing SUPER-thick hair, over a large surface area, it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so large</li>
            <li> However, it certainly was not the case.  </li>
            <li> I soaked the strips I used overnight in a large plastic cup</li>
            <li> This does the job fine but doesn&#x27;t take anything to the next level.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using for face, you are going to go through much</li>
            <li> a favor: go to a pro, pluck, or use REAL wax.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not microwaving the whole jar over and over.</li>
            <li> fast...</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t really break out.  </li>
            <li> but it really just takes time to learn.</li>
            <li> So this doesn&#x27;t really help me at all.</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;ve had to do was microwave for 20 seconds and it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to avoid that....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much experience with wax and wanted to try something besides shaving.</li>
            <li> fast</li>
            <li> This wax is affordable, and works really well.</li>
            <li> It really does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> I must not be the target audience for this wax, or I&#x27;m just really untalented at waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wax worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> This did not work on my face, it didn&#x27;t remove much hair</li>
            <li> but this one did not leave them AS much...</li>
            <li> Someone posted a review saying its better if you have a thick layer, I found that if your using strips it is best when the layer is thin.</li>
            <li> It was messy and it didn&#x27;t do the job effectively.</li>
            <li> I am fairly experienced with waxing, but have really only used hot wax and hard wax (without strips).  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better to try other products.</li>
            <li> I checked Amazon (of course) and the reviews were more or less positive</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need to be heated and it more gentle and less painful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The strips are also re-usable, since the wax can be washed off with water, you just have to rinse them under warm water and let them dry before your next use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I like having a landing strip, because I have zero hair in the inch to the left and right of the strip (all the other hair grows back, which looks bizarre).</li>
            <li> It is seriously the best waxing product and I highly suggest it over any other.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to pay the full $10-20 for a 10 second, 1-strip job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the videos I watched was with a professional sugar waxer and she said specifically that the biggest mistake people make in using sugar wax is that they do not apply it in the opposite direction of the hair, it kind of bothered me that the directions included said to apply in the direction not opposite direction.</li>
            <li> I can tell it is going to last me quite a while even if I do full leg</li>
            <li> but after my third try and making it sure i follow the step by step instruction, still i get the same issues.</li>
            <li> It did a decent job</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different at-home waxes, and this one is my favorite for a few reasons: It is easy to apply and to clean up, it doesn&#x27;t have to be heated, and it really works!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> After a bit more practice waxing some less sensitive areas, I will probably try to wax my bikini line</li>
            <li> It is a bit sticky, but I use it right beore the shower so it really isn&#x27;t a big issue.  </li>
            <li> unlike those other reviews I didn&#x27;t saw any huge difference....</li>
            <li> the lady totally butchered my eyebrows, completely ruining the natural shape and leaving an obvious bare spot on each brow which took about 2 months to fill back in (and this was at a nice spa where you would expect a higher skill level)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with course thick hair and this product does a good job at removing it.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with red bumps like hot wax does.</li>
            <li> this was the second area I tried (first was my armpits).</li>
            <li> I have fine, nearly black hair</li>
            <li> Parissa worked fairly well, but it was so messy it was not worth the results.  </li>
            <li> This cold wax is great for travel and when having hot wax is not possible.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get it spreadable enough for large areas.</li>
            <li> Regular wax works fine, it&#x27;s just so messy and hard to get off, so I was hoping it would be a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> I think a hard wax might be better.</li>
            <li> this wax just completely wrecked my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but because they was so much wax it didn&#x27;t pull enough to get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> after the first time with waxing the area there was only a few hairs that didn&#x27;t get pulled the first time, really I can just tweeze them there is no need to wax again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soft wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my face and underarms so far.</li>
            <li> but I think that was either the fault of my technique or just because I was using a soft wax in tricky areas.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than a prior product I used for years.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t grown back much hair in 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I soak the used strips in hot water so the wax and hair falls off, then dry them overnight.</li>
            <li> soluble- any sticky spots clean up with just a little bit of water.</li>
            <li> no mess-</li>
            <li> you can relate to any of the above situations, give this a try since it only costs about as much as one professional eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li> However, Persian Cold Wax is water-soluble, so clean up is easy.  </li>
            <li> It does the job, but takes a few more tries.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I do have some red bumps, but they&#x27;re going away</li>
            <li> the extra wax comes RIGHT OFF with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my face for a very long time now, and tend to break out once the hair starts to grow back; or my skin gets irritated if I use hot wax.</li>
            <li> Less sting than a professional hot wax.</li>
            <li> The strips are nice and thick and they do not rip off unlike some other products on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fairness, DIY waxing is difficult to do well, and the fact that this product is water-soluble and easy to get to the right temperature are big points in its favor.  </li>
            <li> I have the most difficult time waxing my legs and have tried MANY times with hard wax and sugar wax.</li>
            <li> It barely hurts, I reuse the strips, etc.</li>
            <li> I have tried various types of hair removal wax including Sally Hansen and Parissa as well as professional waxing.  </li>
            <li> Although professional waxing is probably always the most efficient means, Persian Cold Wax is so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that it often takes more than one pass to get all the hair; I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the grabbing power of the wax itself or my technique.</li>
            <li> So it might last a long time on you or it might last the normal amount of time.</li>
            <li> Take a few Tylenol about 20 minutes before waxing, it will help with pain an inflammation (a trick I learned when I used to use hot wax).</li>
            <li> It took me over an hour trying to using it on different spots and not a single one got finished.</li>
            <li> (mine was a very thick syrup consistency) and warmed up, and both ways removed only fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I would take just a little bit on wax on the tip of the small applicator and first spread it down in the direction of hair growth, up in the opposite, down, and the up again before putting the wax strip on top.</li>
            <li> Hard to melt to right consistency</li>
            <li> people here complain about the mess, but really, if you are a smart person with common sense, this won&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially on my face, so I was looking for a wax that won&#x27;t be too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> This will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Over all and all I really like this product but next time I&#x27;m going to try a hard wax and check out the difference.</li>
            <li> Worked well as far as ease of use but had a problem with blemish breakout on face a few days after use.  </li>
            <li> but still, not completely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My friend has super sensitive skin and usually breaks out pretty badly after waxing or even when threading, but she took well to this wax.  </li>
            <li> Only one issue: half the hair did not grow back.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s lots of excess hair, doesn&#x27;t even.seem to het a single one from root.</li>
            <li> I usually have really clear skin and</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no more issues with skin irritation than I&#x27;ve had from salon waxings.</li>
            <li> I probably go at least 6 months without having to even think about getting a new jar.</li>
            <li> dry the strips and reuse!</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m now afraid of a full eyebrow waxing/shaping, I would only want to get the in-between spot waxed</li>
            <li> However, it only pulled off half the amount of hair that I had put wax on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly less frustrating than the hard wax I had been using, but I wish the results had been better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve fought with hard to remove waxes that leave you feeling stick and uncomfortable afterwards, then you are going to love the ease and comfort of this</li>
            <li> and I returned the favor for her with harder to reach areas...</li>
            <li> its really not.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of time.</li>
            <li> I spent quiet a while trying to do a small area and there was unwanted hair still visible.</li>
            <li> , they get a little too long for my liking.</li>
            <li> Although I do have to pop it in the microwave for a few seconds throughout the process to keep it thin, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being uncomfortably hot like other waxes can be.</li>
            <li> Then you need to make sure you press the strip against the wax and hold your skin below the waxy area so it pulls easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t too big like the usual ones...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hair must be too thick, it didn&#x27;t take off anything except the really fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Her skin was a bit pink afterwards, but that lasted less than an hour</li>
            <li> and they start commenting rudely on basically every other area of a face that could possibly be waxed and implying you are an unsightly, hairy beast.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had a really bad experience where she was burned on her top lip with hot wax in a salon and for years had a slight scar, so obviously a cold wax appealed to me.  </li>
            <li> It is hard for me to get into the proper positioning to see  what needs to be seen..</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m only giving this product 4 stars is because its hard to master the technique...I was going to give it 3</li>
            <li> Just pressed it down and pulled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to spread it smoothly since it is a cold wax.</li>
            <li> and I typically wax my sideburns</li>
            <li> I had seen this Persian Cold Wax at a Middle Eastern store near my house and it was $15</li>
            <li> This was the least painful of all of the products and most cost-effective.  </li>
            <li> I like it to be slightly warmer than you&#x27;re supposed to use it at.</li>
            <li> Wayyyyyy less pain as well.</li>
            <li> I think that perhaps since it grabs so well, that when you pull the paper off, there is no hesitation of any tugging at any of the hairs thus it hurts less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, no more painful than any other waxing I&#x27;ve had, and there&#x27;s no judgement!</li>
            <li> My skin, which is not sensitive to waxing or threading at all, broke out and didn&#x27;t heal for at least a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> Worked well but hair has to be at least a quarter of an inch long.</li>
            <li> down.&lt;br /&gt;No impossible-to-clean sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I have used GiGi hard wax in the past and compared to that regular wax</li>
            <li> AND do the WORLD a favor, by not supporting a product that pretends to offer to a lazy solution.</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy, but what do you expect with a wax product.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I did wrong or if this is normal.  </li>
            <li> Quite the waste of time and mullah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can wash and reuse the applicators and even though it seems messy...</li>
            <li> There were a few times when it stuck to my skin and didn&#x27;t pull the hair out</li>
            <li> Thanks to the random lady at Sally&#x27;s for the tip and suggestion!</li>
            <li> I have thick dark brown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to pluck out a few stray hairs, but very very few.</li>
            <li> This item is so lazy.</li>
            <li> i usually scoop some out into another bowl and heat it up that way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they are making that claim b/c  ripping hair out from the root &amp; taking a layer of skin off</li>
            <li> would definitely not recommend this product and I am highly skeptical that it was created by a Persian.  </li>
            <li> I like it for small areas like my face/chin.</li>
            <li> I was not sure because this says &amp;#34;cold wax&amp;#34; if it needed to be heated, the answer is yet it does.</li>
            <li> it it was very messy to use and did not stay in the area you needed it to.  </li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s painful, but for me the emotional trauma is worse than the physical.</li>
            <li> Very messy and a bit hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> Usually normal wax gives me awful red itchy spots everywhere on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a really hard time mastering the &amp;#34;flicking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I tried putting a thick layer and hurt myself because it pulled the hair</li>
            <li> I get thick hair</li>
            <li> I mean, the wax responds to water, regardless of the temperature;</li>
            <li> Seriously - TRY IT.</li>
            <li> A bit messy and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> worst part is that it doesn&#x27;t even remove much hair.  </li>
            <li> Suppose to be less painful...</li>
            <li> /&gt;4) I&#x27;ve had bikini waxes a few times and absolutely hate the experience.</li>
            <li> Thought maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong</li>
            <li> and so i tried on my friends and failed on them to..</li>
            <li> But cold wax is cold wax, not a miracle.  </li>
            <li> but DON&#x27;T USE COLD.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m afraid of something like this</li>
            <li> I tried it both cold</li>
            <li> Cold wax is the s</li>
            <li> Cold water removes the wax easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it is spilled, it is nearly impossible to get out of carpet or off of tiling.  </li>
            <li> (I know I know, terrible idea!).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item is so lazy. Quite the waste of time and mullah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say 1/4&amp;#34; hair length for optimal results. Maybe &amp;#34;better wax for optimal results.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll save you some time here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this for hairy leg, it&#x27;s probably optimal. If you&#x27;re using for face, you are going to go through much frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people here complain about the mess, but really, if you are a smart person with common sense, this won&#x27;t be an issue. I mean, the wax responds to water, regardless of the temperature; genius! But they pretty much stopped there with the genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t work. And unless you are waxing SUPER-thick hair, over a large surface area, it won&#x27;t work. So... what&#x27;s the point of the product? I&#x27;ve gotta grow it out, to wax it? Again, GENIUS. This time it would be in Sarcasm font, had it been invented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for my eyebrows. I&#x27;m not trying to shape them, as I am a man. I simply purchased this in order to prevent uno-brow. I know, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately you get TWO tries on sensitive skin like that of your FACE. After two applications your skin goes devil-hue and begins to get irritated. I can&#x27;t believe I let my brow grow to the 1/4&amp;#34; for this BS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor: go to a pro, pluck, or use REAL wax. AND do the WORLD a favor, by not supporting a product that pretends to offer to a lazy solution.</li>
            <li> In fairness, DIY waxing is difficult to do well, and the fact that this product is water-soluble and easy to get to the right temperature are big points in its favor.  But cold wax is cold wax, not a miracle.  This does the job fine but doesn&#x27;t take anything to the next level.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite wax. Works well on my arms but didn&#x27;t do a good job on my legs. I think a hard wax might be better.</li>
            <li> the only wax i&#x27;ve used for years. SO HAPPY IT&#x27;S ON AMAZON. washes right off with warm water, easy to clean your strips (just soak for a minute in warm/hot water, wax comes off so easy.  then just rinse to get the hair off). ridiculously easy and gentle on the skin (as far as ripping your hair out goes lol). but DON&#x27;T USE COLD. it says you can but no. noooooo no no. just warm it up in the microwave and test it on your hand to make sure it&#x27;s not too hot. i usually scoop some out into another bowl and heat it up that way so i&#x27;m not microwaving the whole jar over and over.</li>
            <li> I had to start waxing my lip.  A friend of mine had a really bad experience where she was burned on her top lip with hot wax in a salon and for years had a slight scar, so obviously a cold wax appealed to me.  The directions state to heat in the micro for about 20 seconds, it makes the wax a honey like consistancy.  I found it works quite well, once I got the hang of it.  It is a bit sticky, but I use it right beore the shower so it really isn&#x27;t a big issue.  I like the fact that the wax washes off with water so I may reuse the cloths again and again.  I would certanily purchase this product again (but it&#x27;s so large I can not see needing to for quite some time).</li>
            <li> Love it!  Easy to use. Easy to clean. Best product for waxing.  Works great!  This will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it for several years now. First of all, the wax lasts me forever. I probably go at least 6 months without having to even think about getting a new jar. I have tried a few different at-home waxes, and this one is my favorite for a few reasons: It is easy to apply and to clean up, it doesn&#x27;t have to be heated, and it really works! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, safe to use cold. They give a lot of paper which you can cut smaller, wash and reuse.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s lots of excess hair, doesn&#x27;t even.seem to het a single one from root.</li>
            <li> I was a newbie to waxing, and this works great! Even better when you microwave it for about 20 seconds. Mine has been sitting in a cupboard for two years and still works fine. I use it on my underarms, so I can&#x27;t speak of how it would work on legs, where the hair is rougher. I find it easy apply and to wash or wipe off. I soak the used strips in hot water so the wax and hair falls off, then dry them overnight. I&#x27;ve reused the same strips maybe 40 times now. Box comes with a bunch of strips and applicators.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have been waxed many times in many places (in both senses of the word). I&#x27;ve been wanting to have a means of waxing at home for a while now for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Last time I got my eyebrows shaped/waxed the lady totally butchered my eyebrows, completely ruining the natural shape and leaving an obvious bare spot on each brow which took about 2 months to fill back in (and this was at a nice spa where you would expect a higher skill level) so I&#x27;m afraid of something like this happening again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I don&#x27;t love the attitude that a lot of these waxing professionals seem to have when you are getting your eyebrows done and they start commenting rudely on basically every other area of a face that could possibly be waxed and implying you are an unsightly, hairy beast. You may or may not get convinced to wax one or more of these other areas, which quickly can add up at $5-10 a pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Because I&#x27;m now afraid of a full eyebrow waxing/shaping, I would only want to get the in-between spot waxed and I don&#x27;t want to pay the full $10-20 for a 10 second, 1-strip job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I&#x27;ve had bikini waxes a few times and absolutely hate the experience. Yes it&#x27;s painful, but for me the emotional trauma is worse than the physical. I go into a full fledged panic and start tensing up and perspiring at the thought of fully exposing myself to the wax-wielding stranger. After a bit more practice waxing some less sensitive areas, I will probably try to wax my bikini line and then I can avoid the nauseating salon bikini wax forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can relate to any of the above situations, give this a try since it only costs about as much as one professional eyebrow waxing. It&#x27;s easy to use, no more painful than any other waxing I&#x27;ve had, and there&#x27;s no judgement! Since it&#x27;s water soluble, you can wash and reuse the strips and any excess that stays on your skin rinses off easily (unlike the wax at the salon which seems very resistant and requires much scrubbing). I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no more issues with skin irritation than I&#x27;ve had from salon waxings. The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that it often takes more than one pass to get all the hair; I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to the grabbing power of the wax itself or my technique. I would definitely recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> Very effective- no mess- no sticking on hands- easily removed with baby wipes. I am hooked on this  product for life. Best wax ever!</li>
            <li> 1) Does not require heating, although you can put the container in a tub of warm water to make it softer.&lt;br /&gt;2) Does not hurt, sticky enough unlike Sally Hansen that peels off the skin!!&lt;br /&gt;3) Water based --- Washes off, no chemicals needed. Take a shower it comes off.&lt;br /&gt;4) Leaves your skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;5) The strips are nice and thick and they do not rip off unlike some other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommend it.</li>
            <li> best waxing product ever.....fast...cheap comparing to salons....very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;go for it with no doubt</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not having to heat the wax up. Got the job done, but I did not notice any difference pain wise compared to hot wax. Suppose to be less painful... I&#x27;m not sure why they are making that claim b/c  ripping hair out from the root &amp; taking a layer of skin off isn&#x27;t going to  feel any differently from wax to wax.</li>
            <li> I am fairly experienced with waxing, but have really only used hot wax and hard wax (without strips).  My friend and I decided to use it on our faces (I know I know, terrible idea!).  My friend has super sensitive skin and usually breaks out pretty badly after waxing or even when threading, but she took well to this wax.  Her skin was a bit pink afterwards, but that lasted less than an hour and she didn&#x27;t really break out.  My skin, which is not sensitive to waxing or threading at all, broke out and didn&#x27;t heal for at least a week and a half.  I usually have really clear skin and this wax just completely wrecked my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that it doesn&#x27;t even remove much hair.  I followed the instructions in the pamphlet (which are not at all helpful) and the instructions of some reviewers who seemed to figure things out for themselves (which were super helpful), but I still had no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not recommend this product and I am highly skeptical that it was created by a Persian.  We are hairy peoples and there&#x27;s no way this stuff would get Persian-approved!</li>
            <li> This works great!  Love that it rinses right off.  I wax, then jump in the shower - it&#x27;s perfect. I reuse the waxing strips because they also rinse right off - so I love that I&#x27;m not throwing more stuff in the trash. Also I like the no heating feature - it does spread a bit better if it is at a warm room temperature - I&#x27;m sure in the winter you&#x27;d want to warm it up a bit.  Don&#x27;t let water get into the container - since it is water soluble this would ruin the wax.</li>
            <li> Very messy and a bit hard to get used to. I like that you can use the provided strips  over by  simply washing....it really is easy  clean up. I can&#x27;t say that I am used to it yet because I am not having a good result but that is  due to my own issue. It is hard for me to get into the proper positioning to see  what needs to be seen..by the time I do  I am already cleaned up. Not a problem wit the product though. I don&#x27;t seem to be getting it all off in one or two  pulls...I need to experiment more on legs</li>
            <li> This great is great it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with red bumps like hot wax does. Don&#x27;t throw away the strips after using! Rinse under hot/warm water and wax rinses right off- dry the strips and reuse!</li>
            <li> Best home waxing product ever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands back as an alternative to shaving all the time and I can safely say that it is pretty easy to work with, although I but mine in a bath of hot water for about 10 minutes before using it to get it more runny. It didn&#x27;t take all the hair off though. I though maybe his back hair was too course, so I also tried it on my legs where my hair is very fine, but it didn&#x27;t remove all the hair from there either. I love how water soluble it is. The wax really does come right off of your skin and the strips with water.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m only giving this product 4 stars is because its hard to master the technique...I was going to give it 3 but it really just takes time to learn. It does come with some strips to use but I used all of them just trying to learn how to use the wax. It took me over an hour trying to using it on different spots and not a single one got finished. I have thick dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;Why I got this Sugar Wax&lt;br /&gt;Sugar wax is good for sensitive skin like mine. It doesn&#x27;t need to be heated and it more gentle and less painful.&lt;br /&gt;I tried making sugar wax at home and every time I tried it just didn&#x27;t turn out. I have used GiGi hard wax in the past and compared to that regular wax it is much better. And I love that it can be washed off with water.&lt;br /&gt;I watched a lot of videos and read reviews on sugaring. One of the videos I watched was with a professional sugar waxer and she said specifically that the biggest mistake people make in using sugar wax is that they do not apply it in the opposite direction of the hair, it kind of bothered me that the directions included said to apply in the direction not opposite direction. In the video she also said that you should need to grow out your hair because the sugar will wrap around the follicle&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t shaved my armpits and the hair is about 1/8 of an inch and it isn&#x27;t working with the wax yet. My legs however....I shaved last night and the wax did grasp my hair, I felt it. I&#x27;m having a really hard time mastering the &amp;#34;flicking&amp;#34; technique where  you don&#x27;t use strips. I ran out within 45 minutes so I attempted the &amp;#34;flicking&amp;#34; on my leg. Someone posted a review saying its better if you have a thick layer, I found that if your using strips it is best when the layer is thin. The same review also said that its easier if you apply the wax to the strip before hand and that did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini Area!&lt;br /&gt;So this was the second area I tried (first was my armpits). I did grow out my hair the about 1/4 inch in the front pelvic area and an 1/8 on the sides by my thighs. I tried putting wax on the strips then applying on this area and it didn&#x27;t even like pull at the hair. I tried putting a thick layer and hurt myself because it pulled the hair but because they was so much wax it didn&#x27;t pull enough to get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to successfully get this area don&#x27;t please follow my advice. Take a few Tylenol about 20 minutes before waxing, it will help with pain an inflammation (a trick I learned when I used to use hot wax). I did all of my bikini area through once. I get thick hair so if you grow more fine hair you may only need to do this once. I would take just a little bit on wax on the tip of the small applicator and first spread it down in the direction of hair growth, up in the opposite, down, and the up again before putting the wax strip on top. Then you need to make sure you press the strip against the wax and hold your skin below the waxy area so it pulls easier and less painful. And viola! You may have some wax here and there but water take it off or just use the strip again. I had a close, close friend help me and I returned the favor for her with harder to reach areas...after the first time with waxing the area there was only a few hairs that didn&#x27;t get pulled the first time, really I can just tweeze them there is no need to wax again.&lt;br /&gt;I had aloe gel on hand to put on after waxing, it helps to block irritation so I suggest having some kind of soothing gel. You can wash and reuse the applicators and even though it seems messy...its really not. Once you master the flicking technique you can use the same glob of wax multiple times.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soft wax. I am pregnant and my skin is really sensitive now. I tried this want and it was really smooth, even for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this product and i didn&#x27;t like my experience. It was messy and it didn&#x27;t do the job effectively. Thought maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong but after my third try and making it sure i follow the step by step instruction, still i get the same issues. It was a total waste of time. Pulling hair one by one is faster than using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and I typically wax my sideburns, they get a little too long for my liking. And I&#x27;ll wax my arms. Regular wax works fine, it&#x27;s just so messy and hard to get off, so I was hoping it would be a nice alternative. Unfortunately my hair must be too thick, it didn&#x27;t take off anything except the really fine hairs. I tried it both cold (mine was a very thick syrup consistency) and warmed up, and both ways removed only fine hairs. So this doesn&#x27;t really help me at all. The plus side was that it was very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> A bit messy and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it on my face and underarms so far. All I&#x27;ve had to do was microwave for 20 seconds and it&#x27;s ready. I also use a numbing spray. But this works amazingly well to remove unwanted hair and does not irritate my skin! It comes with a lot of muslin strips which is nice and it easily washes off with water. Definitely a must have</li>
            <li> It barely hurts, I reuse the strips, etc. I have the most difficult time waxing my legs and have tried MANY times with hard wax and sugar wax. I changed my technique a bit (put wax on against the hair and pull with) and I got rid of a lot more hair. That being said I still had to shave over it the next day to get the rest. I&#x27;m sure with time I&#x27;ll get better.</li>
            <li> Cold wax is the s***!!!! I&#x27;m never using skin burning heated or warm waxes ever again! Soo glad I came across this. Thanks to the random lady at Sally&#x27;s for the tip and suggestion!</li>
            <li> I usually use a roller wax, but there are certain areas that need more precise application, so I decided to try this wax. It is a great price and works very well. I love that it is water soluble- any sticky spots clean up with just a little bit of water. I also love that it does not require a heater appliance. Although I do have to pop it in the microwave for a few seconds throughout the process to keep it thin, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it being uncomfortably hot like other waxes can be. The kit came with plenty of strips and you can soak/rinse and re-use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the wax for the bikini area, and it overall did a good job- my skin is super smooth! There were a few times when it stuck to my skin and didn&#x27;t pull the hair out but I think that was either the fault of my technique or just because I was using a soft wax in tricky areas. This jar is going to last me a while but I will definitely keep using this wax!</li>
            <li> I am open to suggestions on how and when this is best to use but I&#x27;ve tried twice and it seems not to remove my hair well as all. I&#x27;ve had to go back to the salon. I was really hoping to avoid that....</li>
            <li> Worked well but hair has to be at least a quarter of an inch long.</li>
            <li> I loved this product very much. The best part about it was how clean it was to use. If wax accidentally gets onto any surface, it can be easily wiped away. I was also impressed with the cloth strips as they are re-usable after simply washing the wax off with water and letting them dry off.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I tried DIY sugar wax recipes at home, none of them worked. I had seen this Persian Cold Wax at a Middle Eastern store near my house and it was $15 so I wanted to wait until I read reviews. I checked Amazon (of course) and the reviews were more or less positive so I decided, &#x27;hey why not?&#x27; Well, I literally just finished waxing my legs, and seriously - I&#x27;m SO HAPPY. I threw it in the microwave for 10 seconds, then another 5 and it came out lukewarm and really smooth. I put it on, applied the included strips, and it came right off with NO PAIN! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;m so happy with the purchase, I will definitely continue to use it. I&#x27;ve had to pluck out a few stray hairs, but very very few. I have very sensitive skin, so I do have some red bumps, but they&#x27;re going away (it&#x27;s been about 20-30 minutes) and the extra wax comes RIGHT OFF with a wet washcloth. Seriously - TRY IT. It&#x27;s great!!!!</li>
            <li> This wax is so great! I have been using different waxes for two years now for my bikini zone and this is honestly one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s quick, painless and very efficient! It is a little sticky, but I love the fact that you can easily wash it off with water. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much experience with wax and wanted to try something besides shaving. I tried this on my legs and arm pits. I had my husband help me and we got one arm pit done. I went to a salon the next day and had my waxing done. The next week I ordered an epilator off of amazon and I haven&#x27;t looked back. Waxing may be for you. Give it a try. The product came quickly, well packaged, and when it was suppose to.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, it is not the strongest salon kind of wax but it does its job for home use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but would like to get more strips. It helped me to save many $ in beauty shop. I don&#x27;t have allergy with this wax.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best wax that exists. I have used many types and nothing compares to this one. Easy to wash off (water soluble) and heats up quickly. also comes with two wooden sticks and waxing strips.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective hair removal system. Just 10 seconds in the microwave, and you have the perfect wax, and 8 or so strips will be enough for a good bikini wax. Only one issue: half the hair did not grow back. I&#x27;m glad I like having a landing strip, because I have zero hair in the inch to the left and right of the strip (all the other hair grows back, which looks bizarre). So yeah, consider how hooked you are on eliminating hair in the location you wax, because there&#x27;s a fair change it won&#x27;t grow back.</li>
            <li> I like it because the wax don&#x27;t have to heated beforehand&lt;br /&gt;Ship fast</li>
            <li> Perhaps the best purchase I have ever made in the history of my Amazon orders. Very easy to use, very easy to clean, and not nearly as painful as some other products. I have fine, nearly black hair and this is a godsend.</li>
            <li> I have tried various types of hair removal wax including Sally Hansen and Parissa as well as professional waxing.  This was the least painful of all of the products and most cost-effective.  Although professional waxing is probably always the most efficient means, Persian Cold Wax is so much cheaper.  Parissa worked fairly well, but it was so messy it was not worth the results.  If it is spilled, it is nearly impossible to get out of carpet or off of tiling.  However, Persian Cold Wax is water-soluble, so clean up is easy.  It also doesn&#x27;t need to be heated, so it doesn&#x27;t require the purchase of a heating pan.  The strips are also re-usable, since the wax can be washed off with water, you just have to rinse them under warm water and let them dry before your next use.  It is safe on sensitive areas and is very effective for removal of coarse hair.  It is seriously the best waxing product and I highly suggest it over any other.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially on my face, so I was looking for a wax that won&#x27;t be too harsh on my skin. I&#x27;ve been waxing my face for a very long time now, and tend to break out once the hair starts to grow back; or my skin gets irritated if I use hot wax. This wax is affordable, and works really well. The cloths that come with it are washable so you can reuse them over and over again. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this wax but it&#x27;s not a big deal is how it spreads. It&#x27;s a bit hard to spread it smoothly since it is a cold wax. But the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I can get over that.</li>
            <li> Hard to melt to right consistency (I don&#x27;t have a microwave so I used a blowdryer) but it works GREAT! I like it for small areas like my face/chin. It works well on my legs too but I couldn&#x27;t get it spreadable enough for large areas. washes off like magic.</li>
            <li> It didnt work on me and so i tried on my friends and failed on them to..</li>
            <li> It was fine at first but then....unlike those other reviews I didn&#x27;t saw any huge difference....if there was maybe its not that obvious....I think it&#x27;s better to try other products.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to heat it, which is good. (I just put it in the microwave for about 6-10 seconds to keep it @ consistancy)&lt;br /&gt;Easy clean-up and if you over-spread, just soap &amp; water.&lt;br /&gt;But...it doesn&#x27;t get all (my anyway) facial hair.  Works well on legs et, al-though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;No running back and forth between the microwave or rushing to use the wax before it cools down.&lt;br /&gt;No impossible-to-clean sticky mess. Cold water removes the wax easy.&lt;br /&gt;The wax applies easily and gets all the hair. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Reusable strips (just wash with water and let them air dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with course thick hair and this product does a good job at removing it.  It can be a little messy, but what do you expect with a wax product.  Clean up is a cinch.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this product. Much easier to use than a prior product I used for years. Happy I made the switch!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good replacement for the messy hot wax you need to put in the microwave.  However, it certainly was not the case.  Yes, it still needed to go into the microwave, but it it was very messy to use and did not stay in the area you needed it to.  We winded up going to the salon for our waxings.</li>
            <li> My sister is quite hairy and uses this regularly.  She gets a kit from me in her Christmas stocking every year and is very happy for it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever tried waxing.  I felt it was easy to use and did not hurt as much as I was expecting.  However, it only pulled off half the amount of hair that I had put wax on.  Not sure what I did wrong or if this is normal.  I spent quiet a while trying to do a small area and there was unwanted hair still visible.</li>
            <li> Worked well as far as ease of use but had a problem with blemish breakout on face a few days after use.  I believe it was related but can&#x27;t say for sure.  I will update if I learn more.</li>
            <li> This cold wax is great for travel and when having hot wax is not possible.  It does the job, but takes a few more tries.</li>
            <li> For those who are trying to rid of the short thick hairs, this might not be the best choice. I feel its more for thinner hairs.</li>
            <li> I was not sure because this says &amp;#34;cold wax&amp;#34; if it needed to be heated, the answer is yet it does. Either in the microwave or in a wax warmer. I like it to be slightly warmer than you&#x27;re supposed to use it at. It really does not hurt at all. It comes with some strips and a wax spreader. I used two strips on my boyfriends legs that have never been waxed, shaved, or trimmed. He hasn&#x27;t grown back much hair in 6 weeks but I need to wax again. So it might last a long time on you or it might last the normal amount of time. Over all and all I really like this product but next time I&#x27;m going to try a hard wax and check out the difference.</li>
            <li> I must not be the target audience for this wax, or I&#x27;m just really untalented at waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it on my bikini line, legs, and chin. It worked beautifully on my chin, but my bikini line and legs are patchy in the areas I waxed. I&#x27;ve tried different amounts of wax with the same results. It might just be me, so I&#x27;m giving the wax a middle rating. It&#x27;s certainly less frustrating than the hard wax I had been using, but I wish the results had been better. Perhaps I&#x27;ll ask my fiance for help to hold my skin as taut as I can. Maybe it&#x27;ll work better then.</li>
            <li> This wax worked really well for me. I was recommended it by a friend who has been using it as her wax of choice for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it get the job done, but it is incredibly easy to clean up afterwards. The wax is completely water soluble and so comes off the wax strips and your skin easily with warm water. If you&#x27;ve fought with hard to remove waxes that leave you feeling stick and uncomfortable afterwards, then you are going to love the ease and comfort of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I heat mine up in the microwave for 20 seconds, rather than heating it under a bulb.)</li>
            <li> Used to use the Sally Hansen Sugar wax for years.....I liked it because you could just wipe it or rinse it off , however I always had issues with really stubborn hairs under the arms. It did a decent job but I always required my husbands assistance to get the most hair off. Hurt like a bugger too! This stuff holds on to the hair and does not let go! I actually was able to wax my own underarms really quickly. Wayyyyyy less pain as well. I think that perhaps since it grabs so well, that when you pull the paper off, there is no hesitation of any tugging at any of the hairs thus it hurts less. Will definitely buy again and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have never waxed at home before and this was so easy and effective. Didn&#x27;t realize how important easy cleanup would be but I am glad this product is. (I got some on my clothes, skin, and counter). A quick wipe with a damp cloth and it&#x27;s gone! I soaked the strips I used overnight in a large plastic cup and they were good as new. Just rinsed them a bit. Rinsed off the applicator sticks with warm water - also good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important part: it really removed my leg hair fabulously! Less sting than a professional hot wax. I have very sensitive skin - so much so that I buy special lotions, shampoo, sunscreen, etc and this didn&#x27;t irritate AT ALL. When I first got the wax it was warm from being on the delivery truck so no need to nuke it. Later in the day it had cooled off so I nuked it for 10 seconds. Smooth on some wax, press a strip onto it, pull and voil&amp;agrave;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price is right! (way way way cheaper than going to a salon!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the size of the tub is great. I can tell it is going to last me quite a while even if I do full leg waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Quick tip, I put on the wax somewhat thick which can be messy but also allowed me to reuse the waxy strip without adding more wax to my skin. Just pressed it down and pulled.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have arm hair. This is why. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you run out the muslin strips, newspaper works too.</li>
            <li> This did not work on my face, it didn&#x27;t remove much hair (I have PCOS so I have a lot to remove and they aren&#x27;t short). Usually normal wax gives me awful red itchy spots everywhere on my face but this one did not leave them AS much... like 2-5 and they weren&#x27;t too big like the usual ones... but still, not completely sensitive skin proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For bikini line it worked pretty well. Also used a bit on my legs and it also worked well.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is water soluble and this really is great for clean up.  I would purchase it again and probably will buy it again when I need some more.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have bought this same product many, many times and am always impressed by the quality and efficiency it offers!</li>
