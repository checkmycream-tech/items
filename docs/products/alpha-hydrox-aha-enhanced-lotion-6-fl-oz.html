            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that my bikini line looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>bright, beautiful</li>
            <li>This is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>

            <li>This stuff is awesome, my skin has been feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li>You make me feel beautiful again! :)</li>
            <li>In fact, Consumer Reports just rated a dozen or so and the best one was the $20 Neutrogena wrinkle remover, which received a better rating than LancÃ´me and others costing $65.</li>
            <li>there, too, it&#x27;s done a remarkable job of reducing the amount of time my spots stick around, reducing redness, and reducing size.    </li>
            <li>I have tried many hydroxyl products over the years and this lotion is the best of them all in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I always had awesome skin, felt confident and got compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li>Nice price also!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any remarkable changes in my skin from this product but, 1)</li>
            <li>or i just have good genes, lol.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy :^)</li>
            <li>It is pleasant to use</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and still use it because it works, it is well priced and is pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>lotion has a pleasant texture and it doesn&#x27;t feel too drying on the skin.</li>
            <li>Even more effective than the night cream!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but I also exfoliate once a week which makes my skin even more glowing and flawless.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just not as good as the Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12%.</li>
            <li>At this point I stop applying it and use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Now with each week my skin feels smooth and looks great!</li>
            <li>Great price and effective.</li>
            <li>This works good.</li>
            <li>It is a good face moisturizer</li>
            <li>Good AHA lotions (10%</li>
            <li>Its also good for preventing ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>It also does a really good job at hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li>I did a search on Amazon and stumbled upon the Alpha Hydrox which had some good reviews</li>
            <li>But u will need a good sunblock as well with continued usage.</li>
            <li>Good price for it as well</li>
            <li>I began getting an abnormal amount of wrinkles for my age, so I began reading all the anti-aging info I could find and invested in Nuskin products which I really loved.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my body instead, almost finished a bottle in 2 month, the result is good, helped my acne a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a bit over three weeks and results are so good.  </li>
            <li>I already knew that it is good.</li>
            <li>all was good.</li>
            <li>It is a good quality product and has a descent amount of AHA acid.</li>
            <li>i hope good reviews would encourge others to try this product so they wont take it off the market.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is not that good</li>
            <li>Basically, a good product that delivers all it says.  </li>
            <li>i feel it is good as moisturizer</li>
            <li>Works best when up apply a light oil (i.e. olive/almond oil mix) or lotion after you apply the glycolic AHA.</li>
            <li>Based on all the good reviews, I figured there was no risk in trying this product.</li>
            <li>This is a good proudct,packed well and delivered on time ...</li>
            <li>this way ou will know if it is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s just life, but still would like to find a good anti wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>This is a good exfoliating lotion.</li>
            <li>although it felt good on my body, it runs out faster like that</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>and that lasted for a good 10 yrs.</li>
            <li>This is a Cleopatra recipe... who was reputed to have had gorgeous skin.</li>
            <li>All good.</li>
            <li>I taught Its a good bargain when its on sale.....</li>

            <li>LOVED it.</li>

            <li>and I loved the results</li>
            <li>this is as good as Walgreens AHA cream.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as good as another brand of glycolic acid product I use and</li>
            <li>Non greasy, feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>Good for AHA exfoliation</li>

            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>I purchased this about 6 months ago &amp; my face hasn&#x27;t looked better!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Best product I have ever used and my first product review.</li>
            <li>But the most pleasant side effect was that my skin looked a lot plumper and more youthful!</li>
            <li>I was able to build up my tolerance fairly quickly, after a week of using it every night the redness and burning sensation I experienced was greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing</li>
            <li>Specifically it is great for tackling acne primarily caused by keratinization issues.</li>
            <li>I bought this about 2 weeks ago along with the face wash and souffle and the difference these products have made is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing lotion.</li>
            <li>so I tried the lotion because of all the amazing reviews</li>
            <li>and they have an AHA lotion along with acne care and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>This is a light lotion that works great.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>But after I discovered this amazing lotion, my face is so even toned and no pimples!Not even one!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I look in the mirror, I honestly can&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never submitted an online review before,  but because this product was so effective, I am compelled to write one now.</li>
            <li>All in all this product really does what it says it will do, and that&#x27;s something great !</li>
            <li>It was $30 and a fraction of the amount of this stuff but it works nicely on my face.</li>
            <li>Love it, good moisturizer for my face</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled.</li>
            <li>It evens out complexion and also leaves skin with a nice warm youthful glow.</li>
            <li>My mother uses it for wrinkles and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice price .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the whole body.</li>
            <li>Especially useful for men as it slows the formation of creases in the neck and around the ears.</li>
            <li>I bought this item before and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Thank you for fast order and great price!</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>Nice amount for the price.  </li>
            <li>I was looking forward to an inexpensive, effective way to reduce the lines in my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice, not greasy.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way my skin looked this morning.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended Alpha Hydroxy lotion, taking her own bottle out of her purse to show me.  </li>
            <li>Alos gives me a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I don&#x27;t remember having any complaints towards shipping, so it was probably good and not late.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>This lotion has a nice texture, no scent and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and works well as a lotion, but it has yet to get rid of my &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; as a lot of users said it would.</li>
            <li>Good luck with yours:)</li>
            <li>Fast service and excellent communication.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, than this might work nicely for you.</li>
            <li>Very effective for maintaining a smooth skin</li>
            <li>The immediate results were great, so I&#x27;m excited to see what happens after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>This is my new best product for my head.  </li>
            <li>but im always searching for that *new* product that is going to do all these wonderful things!</li>
            <li>My forehead looks a lot more smooth and youthful and I&#x27;m happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have the awesome forehead wrinkle-and I don&#x27;t notice much improvement, but that&#x27;s probably because I keep raising my eyebrows :)</li>
            <li>This is great Alpha Hydroxy lotion ~ non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, I discovered that if I used this lotion in conjunction with another brand of lotion I had from wal-mart it began to have a VERY strong ammonia scent.</li>
            <li>I love this day cream and am pleased that I ordered it with the night cream, what a deal!  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good for the keratitis, scars and blown spots!</li>
            <li>Out of all the products i have used to treat my acne marks, this is by far the best and the price is a bonus!</li>
            <li>I will update my review if this is no longer a good fit for my skin.  </li>
            <li>More effective with a loofah.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a scrub/lotion from KP and tend skin, but this is more effective for me.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly see the difference myself - even, healthy, younger-looking skin.</li>
            <li>At this % of glycolic acid, it&#x27;s also nice to not have to worry about neutralizing it afterwards and being able to just leave it on.</li>
            <li>The prince is really good and it works on my skin fantastic.</li>
            <li>I cannot imagine a product being any more effective than this one.    </li>
            <li>Now my skin turned smooth and good.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion (10% Glycolic AHA)is one of the most effective beauty lotions (or creams) that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My skin is near perfect with use of this, it is defitnetly a cure all.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I read all the good reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>This is the cheapest best kept secret to perfect skin.</li>
            <li>, I just apply a bit (more doesn&#x27;t means more effective)</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s priced nicely and why stop a good thing, right.</li>
            <li>Great for first time GA users like myself.</li>
            <li>The best treatment for blackheads, as well as general skin care.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve experienced much fewer breakouts!</li>
            <li>It is not expensive but works great.</li>
            <li>This product is very straightforward and highly effective as an anti-aging preventative and combatant when used in the morning: apply after cleansing, toning and serum (if you use one), and be SURE TO USE AN SPF as your grand finale.</li>
            <li>whatever that means--they&#x27;re not so fine to me!).</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get rid of fine lines as well, but this has had no effect on wrinkles!</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and I like the feel</li>
            <li>The lotion is very light</li>
            <li>After cleansing, toning and using the Hydroxy product my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>Use sunblock, very important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how quickly it works!</li>
            <li>I had beautiful skin in high school, then broke out in college.</li>
            <li>As always, Alpha Hydrox is my favorite skin product.  </li>
            <li>lOVE</li>
            <li>But most of all, I feel that my skin is glowing and its almost like its added lost volume to my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks more supple and glowing and has evened out a lot.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It works better than the designer products at triple the price.</li>
            <li>I think I pulled out more than 100 hairs over time....</li>
            <li>If you have a more darker complexion then you might want to have someone else find the ingrown hairs for you.</li>
            <li>More and more of my favorite products are going this way.  </li>
            <li>Probably to make way for the, \\&quot;latest thing\\&quot; products.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of lotion and moisturizers, and Alpha Hydrox works best for me.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this because it goes on smoother and lighter</li>
            <li>The results are noticeably better/ more even toned with the souffle</li>
            <li>This product works better than ANY of my Rx acne treatments, and Proactive and Clinique acne regimens.    </li>
            <li>Compared to tretinoin creams, benzol peroxide cream, a sulfur cleanser, and solodyn pill, this lotion works better than all of those.</li>
            <li>Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>You can pay 4 to 5 times more on products that don&#x27;t hold a candle to this.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a better product for the price.</li>
            <li>better than retin A</li>
            <li>Biggest fear is that it will be discontinued  Excellent value  Alternate using it at nite with a night cream.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 10 years or more</li>
            <li>Love this lotion-</li>
            <li>and I am able to tolerate using this lotion every day.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>My complection has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I gave it one star because for more than 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this product</li>
            <li>This lotion has done what nothing else has ever been able to -- reduce the huge, gaping pores on my nose!  </li>
            <li>The side effects of petrolatum include: finding this product in breast tumors, suffocation of the skin, premature aging, aggravated acne and much more.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a scent which I greatly appreciate.Â Â  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels, too.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for more than this.</li>
            <li>and if anything changes for the better, I&#x27;ll adjust my review.</li>
            <li>and help prevent more from forming.    </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the results of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love Alpha Hydrox lotion.</li>
            <li>I can put sun screens or foundation (w/ SPF) on top of the Alpha Hydrox</li>
            <li>It is such an excellent deal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this to so many of my friends and family members, and they all love it too.</li>
            <li>I have done many chemical peels.</li>
            <li>love all the Alpha Hydrox products.  </li>
            <li>This product is just OK for me.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve got better stuff for that already).</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s ok to put a moisturizer over it because I feel like I need</li>
            <li>:  Just needed to use more of it for it to be moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be purchasing again and am on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it every day.</li>
            <li>Please try this, as I have friends that love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>(There is a warning:))</li>
            <li>so I preferred cocoa butter more cheaper</li>
            <li>Within two weeks I was acne free!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe something so effective is so cheap.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that there are not too many chemicals that are harmful in this product compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also make sure to use sunblock/sunscreen when using this lotion.</li>
            <li>Did a test patch to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase anything stronger than 10%.</li>
            <li>But, be sure to heed the warnings about avoiding your lips</li>
            <li>Love this product I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I have people come up to me and ask me many times on what product I am using on my face.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find it at this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure heredity plays a part in that, as does sleeping each night hanging from the closet pole by my knees, but the Alpha Hydroxy hasn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>I would have gladly paid a lot more for this product, but please do not tell the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok for some people</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it once or twice a day and always exfoliate while showering.</li>
            <li>love this 2 products!&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I love how it tingles.</li>
            <li>was then able to obtain my Hormone Cream again(Bio Identicals).</li>
            <li>up on how it plays into Skin Health &amp; so much more.  </li>
            <li>I love Alpha Hydrox</li>
            <li>if the sent would had been a lil better..</li>
            <li>and I am quite pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>I look forward to more results after a week, two weeks, a month, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; acne treatments, and even prescriptions.</li>
            <li>I figured, it&#x27;s cheap, what do I have to lose?!</li>
            <li>I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products because they work and they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>At night, I will apply the product slightly more generously.  </li>
            <li>At night, I will apply the product slightly more generously.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product at night in conjunction with my vitamin c cream in the morning my skin is looking so much better.</li>
            <li>It is so nice and light.</li>
            <li>This has made my acne much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I already have more wrinkles than I want and was looking for something to help with that problem.  </li>
            <li>I just want to prevent any more from growing.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone seeking a safer way of renewing their skin for a better looking you.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t magic but it is close to it.    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still a favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it seems to stimulate blood flow, as ought to be the case if you&#x27;re scraping the top layers of your skin off, whether mechanically or chemically, and it has improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 bottles as I thought I would need certainly more than 1-2...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and won&#x27;t go without it agian</li>
            <li>There are better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>love it ....</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many cremes, lotions, scents, etc., but I can use this and have none of those problems.  </li>
            <li>most people think I\\&quot;m 35.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on this before I ordered it as I do with most things I order from Amazon, and was overall impressed.  </li>
            <li>and I believe my skin is in better condition because of it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>If you plan on using it during the day, please make sure to apply sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s magic in a bottle, it&#x27;s this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do want to add that I use lots of beauty products, mostly the department store brands like shiseido, clinique, estee lauder, lancome, bobby brown, etc.  </li>
            <li>That being said if you have, then this is a really good peeler that leaves your skin smooth and oil free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all sorts of pricey face lotions and this is not only affordable but one of the best.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wash it off fingernails, all those acidy lotions tend to weaken them.</li>
            <li>Will be a life-long user :-)</li>
            <li>love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you are exfoliating your skin by washing.  </li>
            <li>I like this product and have purchased it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I heard the excitement about Alpha Hydroxy from my favorite entertainment/health info show of Dr. Oz.</li>
            <li>This bottle was the best value I could find after moderate searching on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So glad I ended up purchasing this.</li>
            <li>LOVE this lotion.  </li>
            <li>but when I started using this product my skin cleared up and has a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Besides working to eradicate/mitigate the bumps, it also helps my skin have a healthy, even tone.</li>
            <li>There are waaayy better products, like Bliss</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what this lotion would do but wanted to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion - i use it on my body and face.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is better without tax and handling charges.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice too many differences</li>
            <li>I will probably order this product again when I run out, but that won&#x27;t be for quite a while :).</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not creamy but more like a gel-like substance like the face wash.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already worked 200% better than this.</li>
            <li>I hope my review is helpful to you:)</li>
            <li>And even better, it works for taking away these embarrassing bumps.</li>
            <li>A year ago I lost the top layer of the skin on my neck from glacial burn and it sometimes gets blotchy.</li>
            <li>Likewise, I make sure to wash my hands after applying the lotion</li>
            <li>I love AHA Lotion.</li>
            <li>This is 10% AHA in it which is the most percentage I&#x27;ve been able to find in a face lotion.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love how this product feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use in conjuction with the face wash for better results.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly as a spot treatment for my scars, for now, since I&#x27;m still fixing my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>Oh well I am sure it will work anyway.</li>
            <li>overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I used to use Kiss My Face&#x27;s Peaches &amp; Cream Moisturizer (no longer sold), and was glad to find Alpha Hydrox.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s OK to use a moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li>and I found something better instead.</li>
            <li>Glycolic acid is safe to use during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome under makeup and sunscreen, and alone or mixed with a body lotion (I use Ambi).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product and very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a year</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>But somehow I&#x27;m still quite confident that it will work.</li>
            <li>lotion hydrates therefore helps you smooth out your skin!</li>
            <li>I used many moisturizers, peels, creams, lotions, retinoids etc..</li>
            <li>but then after that it was way better.  </li>
            <li>or more for.</li>
            <li>I even use it all over my body for the same awesome results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  glad that I rediscovered this product.</li>
            <li>I  have been using this product for a year, I can see the difference, and I will purchase more when I need to.</li>
            <li>BUT, like most beauty products, it has dimethicone, which is an acne irritant.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the product</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and really works great.</li>
            <li>On a whim I tried to shave once more</li>
            <li>and I have never had better results with any product I have tried</li>
            <li>It was much more even in texture and color.</li>
            <li>I love this n</li>
            <li>it does everything they say it does couldn&#x27;t be more please with this product</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It has the most glycolic aha that I can find.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite lotion</li>
            <li>I started using the Acne.org regimen many years ago, and found that to be sufficient for the most part.</li>
            <li>I totally LOVE this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A+ :)</li>
            <li>I used it one night and in the morning had more breakouts</li>
            <li>I love this, and would sell my soul to have this at all times.</li>
            <li>and I think the 10% is doing a better job.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know which one of the products is doing a better job Avene or Alpha Hydrox or both working together.</li>
            <li>I have been using this one for many years.  </li>
            <li>I originally tried using this on its own as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>I originally got this for use on my face and didn&#x27;t see the kind of results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I think that this would go great for most people, except of course, somebody with a high sensitivity to glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent mild action.</li>
            <li>The side states that tingling, etc. is normal, but I experienced nothing.</li>
            <li>It is the best product I have ever used for keeping my face younger looking and free of most acne flareups.</li>
            <li>I give this product the top rating... and the price is right!!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the best wrinkly type cream I;ve used but for the price, pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>I break out easily and this lotion helps me not to :-)</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me for cracked dry skin and worked wonderfully,</li>
            <li>Gives my skin a nice mild shine and is virtually scentless.</li>
            <li>Lemons are incredible for brightening my complexion, but it appears that this AHA lotion has the same effect; yay! :)</li>
            <li>weeks three and four it doesn&#x27;t really sting now and the flakiness is better , my skin looks good and my family has noticed and commented on it.</li>
            <li>But, if you know your skin, you&#x27;ll be fine:)</li>
            <li>It is the perfect way to reveal and maintain the beautiful skin one might have hidden below the old top layer.</li>
            <li>It burned alittle (tingled is probably more accurate).</li>
            <li>I started using it in my 20&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the reason why time has kind of stood still for my skin.</li>
            <li>This product for me is probably most important--</li>
            <li>Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne.</li>
            <li>and its doing great at fading some old scars.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell the Oil Free 10% formula is on my skin, which is one of my favorite things about the product, I was just hoping to add in some moisturizing effects as well</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox Lotions I find is one of the better lotions available.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks more glowy and smooth now.</li>
            <li>Its so smooth I keep touching my face throughout the day, even though i know i shouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Great lotion, has helped clear up sebum in my pores around my T-zone and freshened up my face.</li>
            <li>In the morning I exfoliate with a light scrub and my skin always looks better than it did the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great and leaves face so soft when you wake up in the morning after putting it on at night.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my healthier diet didn&#x27;t contribute, but I&#x27;ve had a very stressful life and amconfident that I wouldn&#x27;t look this good without the Alpha Hydrox.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much real success with these department store brands in terms of improving skin quality.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt do much for deeper wrinkles or scaring, but over all a good product.</li>
            <li>It really does help the wrinkle thing and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion really feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very nice texture and soft.</li>
            <li>I will come back after we have been using for a while and will provide an update, hopefully a good one!</li>
            <li>i could easily see the hairs under my skin once the sunlight hit em.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it is easy to apply, it don&#x27;t irritate my skin and the smell is not noticeable.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox Lotion is easy to apply and I like the way the bottle dispenses the product.Â  </li>
            <li>It has no detectable odor or smell, is not greasy and washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a very mild smell.    </li>
            <li>It was easy to find a cleanser and lotion made by Alpha Hydrox on Amazon, so I figured I would try it.</li>
            <li>I have been following this regimen for 2 months and my skin looks and feels wonderful and fresh</li>
            <li>It goes on light and smooth and I wake up with much better looking skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see an improvement on my face, except that it gets very irritated and sensitive, don&#x27;t recommend if you have acne prone skin, is best to use beta hydroxy acid.</li>
            <li>and if I do get a spot it clears up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>So, listen up, I believe that AHA is a strong contributor to my skin looking as well as it does.  </li>
            <li>but it is not too strong.</li>
            <li>I recommend to take a break of 2 days if you feel it too strong for your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also strongly suggest doing the recommended spot patch test.</li>
            <li>After the first week I noticed amazing results.</li>
            <li>People always compliment me on my beautiful skin and they think I am 45-48, when I am actually 58.  </li>
            <li>I have consistently bought products regardless of price and find these to be as effective as any of the others that I have used</li>
            <li>my skin was so beautiful; all my friends wanted me to teach them how to have the same results.      </li>
            <li>Use in the morning for a beautiful glow under makeup or alone (but with sunscreen) and at night before going to sleep and you&#x27;ll see a big difference in your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes your skin kind of sting and itch when you first use it and that is because of the exfoliation, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s doing something which others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try because it seemed to have some good active ingredients at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Best treatment for keratosis Pilaris hands down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for dry skin which I have.  </li>
            <li>But I have definitely learned enough (esp from the doc) to know that not all the best and most effective products have to break the bank.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I still use and love use their face wash (sometimes you get special promos where the face-wash is free after buying the cream).</li>
            <li>I think it helps diminish fine lines and evens skin tone to some degree.</li>
            <li>Fine lines seem to be disappearing.</li>
            <li>I started noticing fine lines in my forehead</li>
            <li>I have also noticed a visible reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to be making my fine lines fade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that the fine lines on my forehead seem to be decreasing....</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t seemed to change my fine lines in anyway</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that this will decrease the fine lines and wrinkles that are coming in as I age.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THIS TO HELP WITH SOME FINE LINES ON MY FOREHEAD AND MY ACNE</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine by me, however, because I&#x27;d rather avoid getting wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has reduced the fine lines on my face, but it does have a moisturizing effect that gives my skin a dewy look.  </li>
            <li>Loyal customer from now on!</li>
            <li>If you have super stubborn skin &amp; cystic acne, you may need something more.</li>
            <li>With the additional glow he was wondering if I was pregnant!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only $10, it lasts a good while, and it may have an incredible effect on your acne situation and your face&#x27;s glow in general.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very economical, the lotion formula is easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores.</li>
            <li>The best &amp; most reasonable I have ever used, I live in Florida  and have sum baked skin , really helped .</li>
            <li>I love alpha hydroxy &amp; it&#x27;s getting hard to find - best one I ever used was taken out of production so I&#x27;ll be comparing closely with this one</li>
            <li>but I see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>I didnt suffer from the HUGE type of razor bumps....</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t use it that much because I feel the serum does a great job.</li>
            <li>I have oily acne prone skin, but the combination of the two products has made a huge difference in my life.</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels nice and light.</li>
            <li>After having used the product for about 3 weeks, i see huge improvements on skin color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of AHA products and I&#x27;ve used a variety of them.</li>
            <li>I have acne all over my face, blackheads and huge cysts.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and seems to reduce lines.  </li>
            <li>Wish this came as an oil free product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using different strengths of AHA&#x27;s for years and have great looking skin.</li>
            <li>mine were puss filled pimple sized razor bumps; but I had a bunch of em&#x27;.   </li>
            <li>And like I stated before Im light brown, so</li>
            <li>and i am already seeing great improvements in the texture, tone and the overall health of my face.</li>
            <li>amazing line of products; inexpensive and very efficient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d avoid using it on the face, but as a therapeutic body lotion it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>But honestly, I don&#x27;t care that much.  </li>
            <li>AHA products are an important part of skin care.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how great this moisturizer is, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I use this every night after I wash my face, and my skin looks fantastic (if i do say so...)</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin smooth and unlined.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic lotion.</li>
            <li>Functions as light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Skin is now smooth and shimmers in the light,,lol.  </li>
            <li>I started using this again at night and the oil free in the day.</li>
            <li>I like it a great deal and have noticed a difference in my skin since I have been using it for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy this product along with the Night Replenishing CrÃ¨me.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was lightly scented as I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li>Light weight lotion with glycolic acid..</li>
            <li>, after using this product daily for about two months, my skin looks great:</li>
            <li>Overall a great product</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moist and free from spots.</li>
            <li>Use it for smooth arms and...</li>
            <li>this product seems to cause break outs and just seems cheap..</li>
            <li>The aha lotion is whats important, its like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve teamed this up with Stridex in the Red Box, Vanicream Cleansing Bar, Vanicream Lite Moisturizer, and Aquaphor with great results.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it says it is odor free on the bottle</li>
            <li>use it every day and it appears to smooth my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>used this product before having bought it in a retail drugstore but then could not find it till I saw it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Happy it&#x60;s available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed each time I notice how smooth my arms are, now.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use it primarily on my body...</li>
            <li>so it is light and does not break me out.</li>
            <li>Cheap and it works!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Makes my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>cheap, if not i go here.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after using this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin is incredibly smooth to touch and</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth both on my face as well as bumpy parts of my body.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin on face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li>it is so cheap</li>
            <li>And my acne has cleared up!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>However I received it and started using it as a night time facial lotion, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>My face feels ridiculously smooth too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, but not too sensitive</li>
            <li>This lotion is good too as a first AHA lotion, if you want to go on to a stronger AHA product higher than a 10% solution.  </li>
            <li>With religious use it is good at smoothing the skin, but don&#x27;t look to it for a magical acne treatment as some have suggested.</li>
            <li>Buy it for boyfriend, and he says it smells good and natural.</li>
            <li>It is too  early for me to fairly rate the performance of the product.  </li>
            <li>I also got free face wash with every bottle of aha lotion I purchased - their face wash is nice too, but really any ph balanced one will do.</li>
            <li>Good for mature skin to fight wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Great product works better than expected  </li>
            <li>So Far so good.</li>
            <li>For people with sensitive skin it may not be too good.</li>
            <li>the best which really showed a big improvement on my skin</li>
            <li>This brand is a good choice because it is cost effective (also usually available at local pharmacy) and the right pH balance in order for the glycolic acid to maintain efficacy.</li>
            <li>Yep, that&#x27;s right, about 20 years, maybe more.  </li>
            <li>I have used other brands of Alpha Hydroxy Lotions and this one is very good and does what it is supposed too.  </li>
            <li>She will repurchase - something she very rarely does - Unbeatable</li>
            <li>The lotion is smooth going on, and it&#x27;s tingly, light weight, not pasty, and feels clean.  </li>
            <li>Very important, ESP at higher altitudes.</li>
            <li>My face looks so clean &amp; feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>My new favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended on a popular TV show and after using it for months, I agree.  </li>
            <li>This one is very reasonably priced and a much better deal on Amazon.Â Â  </li>
            <li>It is very reasonably priced and works better than skin products triple the price.</li>
            <li>Good product but not quite strong enough.</li>
            <li>hence I was able to notice my skin tone changing within the first 2 months.   </li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy it after reading all these rave reviews.</li>
            <li>i was familiar with the product before I ordered it.</li>
            <li>It smooths and exfoliates with a higher glycolic content than most over the counter alpha hydrox products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Overall I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li>Smooths, lightens mild hyper-pigmentation, reduces the appearance of fine lines, and brightens.</li>
            <li>It is so worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed with the lotion alone, however.   </li>
            <li>Definately worth the money!</li>
            <li>helped to make skin texture more consistent.  </li>
            <li>but no where else but so worth it!</li>
            <li>Also, I know it is a small thing, but the popover lid is perfect!</li>
            <li>I love how it feels when I first put it on because I can feel tingling</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>my skin feels so much better, and I prefer the higher percentage of AHA.  </li>
            <li>I did notice some &amp;#34;expelling&amp;#34; when I first started (more acne)</li>
            <li>I originally wrote this review, I was using this morning and night.</li>
            <li>It is VERY important to stay out of the sun, as your face is much more sensitive to the sun&#x27;s rays when using the Alpha Hydrox lotion.</li>
            <li>I went searching online for more ideas, and to my surprise, found this on Acne.org&#x27;s website with pretty unanimous acclaim (which is impressive since acne &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; seem to be very hit-and-miss).</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and absorbs fairly quick into the skin.Â  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and applied the lotion to a clean face, morning and night.</li>
            <li>I use this every night after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li>apply at night (you must wait atleast 30 mins after showering to apply, or else it will sting) with a clean t-shirt on.</li>
            <li>And because it is a lotion and not containing tiny granules that would scratch the skin, it is more effective.</li>
            <li>Proof - my boyfriend who already thinks I have amazing skin actually commented that it was looking even better.</li>
            <li>I quickly found that it was important to follow instructions when using this product, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re looking for a deep moisturizer and to calm redness</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really works or really did anything good for me.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this product a try after reading many of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>For the price you can certainly give it a shot--just don&#x27;t expect a meaningful difference.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li>this is the right product for you!</li>
            <li>Put it on after shower and it soaks right in!</li>
            <li>That product worked very nicely on my face and no new breakouts have occurred.</li>
            <li>Nothing special - but not bad either.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this lotion because I absolutely love Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s Oil Free 10% Formula, but I don&#x27;t like the way this lotion feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the smooth feeling skin and the reducing of the dark marks on my skin.</li>
            <li>It arrived in great condition and when it was expected.</li>
            <li>Good product for daily maintenance.</li>
            <li>As a retired hairdresser I have some training in skin care and the Alpha Hydrox line is effective and modestly priced.</li>
            <li>This way the lotion is at full  strength, not the slightest bit diluted.    </li>
            <li>I feel this  keeps my skin looking fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does take about 2 weeks before I see the full effect.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised that something so inexpensive is so effective</li>
            <li>The one in the picture seems \\&quot;newer\\&quot; - newer, more modern packaging and font.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many over the counter washes, gels, creams and on and on to get rid of the acne, but haven&#x27;t had much luck.  </li>
            <li>and I liked how soft it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li>Skin was smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>I bought this lotion with retinal cream and mixed them , this way I could have a really good lotion to attack strech mRks</li>
            <li>I would IMA medium like complected African-American male ( like meagan good or somethin)</li>
            <li>many yrs ago when it was really inexpensive for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made the skin peel, so this must be an OK product for a gentle effect if you don&#x27;t want you skin peeling.</li>
            <li>Good stuff especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Cant be sure if its really working</li>
            <li>i know the title sounds campy, but it is so true.  </li>
            <li>my skin feels smooth and fresh</li>
            <li>Good lotion when mixed with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but would prefer if there wasn&#x27;t any toxic ingredients......</li>
            <li>Absolutely hands down the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>--I cleanse with the Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash (which is very mild) using a Clarisonic brush and follow up with the AHA enhanced lotion, a specialized eye cream duo from Avon and then an Aveeno moisturizer for sensitive skin on top.</li>
            <li>Clean, smooth and soft skin you&#x27;ll love.</li>
            <li>I can go to the higher percentage easily.</li>
            <li>This product keeps skin clear, bright and blimish free, I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>Finally, I found a product that works effectively to reduce fine lines and smooths out skin.</li>
            <li>While other people reported great results, I did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li>I am older woman and would like more alpha hydroxy in product</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>week ago, my husband said out of the blue -- &#x27;you know, your skin really looks great&#x27;</li>
            <li>I never had these results so quickly.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>After washing with a mild non-soap cleanser, I put on the AHA Enhanced Lotion before bed and took my niacin and zinc supplements.  </li>
            <li>The mild sting that is noticeable on application will subside with continued use and is not an allergy.</li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>My pores seem smaller and this works great under your makeup because it seems to really make it go on smoother.</li>
            <li>Sometimes there is a mild burning sensation after I apply the lotion, but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I used this product years ago, but as I got older, I thought I needed more help for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>It always absorbs into my skin fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>but the next day looks so much better love it</li>
            <li>The product keeps your skin smooth and soft (you can feel it) and my moisturizer seems to work better after this cream.</li>
            <li>Good for everyday use :-)</li>
            <li>I did not perform the \\&quot;patch test\\&quot; as recommended for this product and this resulted in a reaction on my neck which feels a bit like a mild chemical burn.</li>
            <li>It is mild and does not feel greasy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It took days to heal, it hurt like hell, and he said I was incredibly lucky</li>
            <li>This product definitely has a nice feel to it,  it helps keep my skin on my face smooth -</li>
            <li>Now, none of us should have high hopes that an over-the-counter wrinkle remover will make a meaningful difference.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>My face looked really smooth in the morning when I first woke up...until I had to wash it again and reapply the lotion.</li>
            <li>Great for removing dark spots and hyper-pigmented scars.</li>
            <li>This is helping my skin become more normal again.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price too!</li>
            <li>Let me start my \\&quot;story\\&quot; by saying I\\&quot;m a black woman, age 47 and have always had great skin. .</li>
            <li>You get a lot for your money with this lotion, I  use a nickel sized amount for my face, it covers my whole face easily.</li>
            <li>blackheads have diminished, no change in fine lines, and pores are still large though look diminished somewhat.</li>
            <li>Maybe in a couple of more months I&#x27;ll look younger and more radiant ;).</li>
            <li>bit of background: I was originally scared to try it at first bc</li>
            <li>Maybe this is an allergic reaction, there&#x27;s a first time for everything!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more than surprised!</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I&#x27;m still just n&#x3D;1, and after my amazing result I turned some friends onto this product, and their results have been less striking,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and it glides on, absorbing quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 and have had bouts of mild to moderate acne since I was 15, so you can imagine how nice it is to look at yourself in the mirror after 13 years and see a face that doesn&#x27;t make you upset.</li>
            <li>I laugh at lot, and because of this I have two large fine lines surrounding the sides of my lips.</li>
            <li>Or, at the very least, I thought that my acne was just a fact of life and that The Regimen was the best I could do.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about this on Dr. Oz and ordered it right away!</li>
            <li>WELL, this product made a hugely noticable difference in my sensitive, problematic, acne-prone skin the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li>this works great ,removes dead skin.</li>
            <li>and although alpha hydrox is not a cure all it really helped smooth out my skin and control my acne.</li>
            <li>and I think it works really well to smooth my skin and help with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, especially considering how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li>My face, however, has not had any suchreaction; in fact, I have noticed really great results in just a few weeks time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really helps make my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>In 1 week of using it religiously, I saw amazing results.</li>
            <li>For me, this lotion improved the tone and made me look - and most importantly feel - younger.  </li>
            <li>and I am already white and fair complected and didn&#x27;t really want to get any lighter, but</li>
            <li>but it was well worth the reward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to stick with it.</li>
            <li>stings a bit, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Nothing else I have tried has made my skin clear and healthy like Alpha Hydrox.  </li>
            <li>And I rarely get breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this product, I thought, deserved it.</li>
            <li>For my skin, this product on its own would not provide enough moisturizer.Â Â  </li>
            <li>the supplements I&#x27;m taking also have had a noticeable effect, noted before I started using this lotion, so I can&#x27;t say that my acne success is 100% because of AHA...</li>
            <li>my eye and smile lines softened as well.      </li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>My skin is also smoother and more soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>But maybe it&#x27;s working because I feel a distinct tingle.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s your first time using a dedicated AHA cream/lotion, it&#x27;s important that you do a patch test first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for five years, including the more intense glycolic cream, and it is definitely responsible for preserving my &amp;#34;youth&amp;#34; fo&#x27; sho&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I still say try it if you have more mature skin or experience with glycolic</li>
            <li>I use a different kind of product with anti-oxidents at night before night cream.</li>
            <li>All areas exposed to sunlight during the day MUST be covered with sunscreen, as this lotion makes your skin more sensitive to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I am not afraid to use it on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>This is great to use if you suffer from hyperpigmentation from old acne &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; and also removes damaged top layer dead skin to reveal</li>
            <li>I hope this product doesn&#x27;t break my sensitive skin out, but I will update when more time has passed.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and have tried many products that didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>and he has tried many things to avoid the rash and nothing has stopped it and lotions to clear it up.  </li>
            <li>Honey is great for the skin and is a natural antibiotic for skin wounds when applied topically.</li>
            <li>After just 2 weeks my skin already seems more &#x27;glowy&#x27; and alive.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel and look soft and smooth and moist!</li>
            <li>Once it has been absorbed, I put a SPF</li>
            <li>so soft and has faded many acne scars.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>almost expected they would have changed/cheapened the formulation over the years, but surprisingly, they have not.</li>
            <li>If you feel burning or itching more than 20 minutes after application, you&#x27;re either sensitive or allergic and you should stay away!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is totally great stuff, and although it says \\&quot;for normal to dry skin\\</li>
            <li>The price is just right and the quantity is definitely worth the bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Daily use of AHA is supposed to be the singularly best thing that one can do for one&#x27;s skin other than using moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I went through my first bottle so quickly -</li>
            <li>would good advice from other owners/users of this product)</li>
            <li>I use this product once a day on non shaving days and twice a day 24 hours after a shave (right after I shave I rub my face with a alum block....</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a step in the right direction.    </li>
            <li>The price is right, too.  </li>
            <li>, I wonder if it even has the right ingredients.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it can&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist and I saw it right away.</li>
            <li>I saw signs of it working right away</li>
            <li>Stings a bit, but that means it&#x27;s working right?  </li>
            <li>The price is right, shipped on time and wrapped well.</li>
            <li>I had to wash it right away.</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>I put it on right before going to bed.</li>
            <li>I noticed improved skin appearance right away.  </li>
            <li>I know, hands off, right?)</li>
            <li>If you have a pimple forming you can catch it and stop it by putting this right on the area 1-2 times a day.</li>
            <li>On a fluke I ordered the Alpha Hydrox because as noted the reviews were positive and I figured what the heck;-&gt;!</li>
            <li>The amazing thing is, I can actually see results in my skin even after the first couple of times I used it.</li>
            <li>Looking younger is never a bad thing :)</li>
            <li>Amalactin is another possible choice, but that one uses an ammonia-based acid that has a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, be sure to sign up for email notifications from their website because when they have sales, they tend to be major.</li>
            <li>This particular one got great reviews that seemed genuine, unlike the usual drivel when it comes to skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>My previous favorite was the Bald Guyz items but this seems better.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer here noted, if you purchase the Alpha Hydrox products from their own website, you DO get it for slightly cheaper (with free shipping), esp if buying packages.</li>
            <li>i rarely get a pimple, but when i do, they seem very superficial and disappear quickly.</li>
            <li>This Cream Works Great, Brightens Up Your Face And Removes Dead Skin Cells!</li>
            <li>I really do love this product and  credit it with my skin being clear and limiting some of the lovely redness that my Irish skin is prone to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good: it smoothens the skin, eliminates dark spots, skin is radiant.</li>
            <li>I started noticing fine lines between my eyebrows and this helped clear it in a month!</li>
            <li>Even so, CR was quick to point out that NONE of the creams or serums, as they are oft called, made much of a difference.     </li>
            <li>No, this lotion will not make your lines go away entirely, but I have been happy to note that it seems to have turned back the clock on my skin by five years or so.  </li>
            <li>am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products.  </li>
            <li>am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products.  </li>
            <li>It would be great as a body wash if it didn&#x27;t leave any residue (it only leaves a gross taste) or as a once a day application where people who prefer nighttime could do that, or I would put it on in the morning and then apply my makeup when it dries.    </li>
            <li>Luckily,  I found it at Amazon at reasonable prize.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of creams and at-home treatments to improve my skin, but most products either severely dried it out, made me break out, or did nothing.</li>
            <li>Be sure to avoid eyes, eylids, nostrils, and lips as much as you can; these are sensitive areas that you don&#x27;t want to touch with this lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very soft and smooth on my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only after a full cycle that you will see full and true results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy, no unpleasant scent, and really does produce a smoother, clearer skin.     </li>
            <li>The delivery is very fast........</li>
            <li>I have been using the product and like it very much.</li>
            <li>its very gentle.</li>
            <li>Probably a good product for people in their 20&#x27;s but other than that, it&#x27;s not gonna make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>My aesthetician told me to use a product that contained glycolic acid to help slough off the dead skin cells and get rid of the bumps, so I went ahead and bought this product because it is very reasonably priced and seemed to have good reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to turn cells over to reveal new cells, but not so strong that I cannot use it nightly if I wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>finally something that actually works at an amazing price!</li>
            <li>Amazingly, this product gives me results matching those of products which I&#x27;ve spent $100.</li>
            <li>many of my friends tell me SOMETHING is working to make me look younger than my years!  </li>
            <li>Worked better than an Rx for a topical antibiotic or pill.</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion!</li>
            <li>I have tried an AHA that I picked up from a local store before, and I find this works much better.</li>
            <li>I put a lot of it on first thing in the morning, and let my skin soak up the pudding aspect of it.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was just the first day</li>
            <li>Im so happy and slowly regaining confidence.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it.  </li>
            <li>Got it pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I used to use this many years ago (in my 20&#x27;s) and only stopped because I could no longer find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin glowy, clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I WILL definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>I like to use it all over the body, so prefer larger sizes (6oz or more).  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s most definitely helped!)  </li>
            <li>Smells nice but takes awhile to sink into skin, face feels wet for awhile.</li>
            <li>Now, despite my experimental nature, I have been using Alpha Hydrox lotion for over 20 years, pimple free, and am turning 59.  </li>
            <li>It made my face red and made all my imperfections stand out more.</li>
            <li>I just moved and haven&#x27;t been using his consistently.</li>
            <li>Or even washing my face consistently.</li>
            <li>I use it only once a day, at night and recommmend a spf of 30 or better during the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  a total scheptic regarding most anti aging pitches but a friend suggested I try it.  </li>
            <li>At first this made my skin oily when using at night.</li>
            <li>First, the smell is pretty off putting, but that&#x27;s not the deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li>First application to face</li>
            <li>but many folks think I am in my mid 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I find that my skin feels better than it has in years, and am hopeful that it will provide enough moisture during the winter</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It stings when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>Everything that we know that is in this product, does exactly as it&#x27;s suppose to.  </li>
            <li>The texture of my skin feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I was already Hot Compressing &amp; using the Neutragena Microderm Abrasion system &amp; then a Hyaluronic Acid Serum/Peptide combo(Dry Face but Pores</li>
            <li>This helped even more after a week back using it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>And it is still keeping my face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>At first, I was using it along with another product in the Alpha Hydrox line, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>More recently, I began doing some reading on alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs).  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.    </li>
            <li>And he&#x27;s the type that waits till the very last minute to do things, or not even bother most of the time.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first thing that&#x27;s made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I really like it and use it every day!</li>
            <li>I have been acne free finally after years of trying many products and natural solutions.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s important to wait until the natural oils from the skin return before applying any product.</li>
            <li>I first moisturize my face with Aveeno and then apply AHA.I use Kaya sunscreen when going out in Sun. &#x27;</li>
            <li>Last summer, I would use it without putting any moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to try using it more regularly on my cheeks to see if it will help diminish the freckling in that area.  </li>
            <li>Love Alpha Hydrox products and this is no different.  </li>
            <li>I was considering using a steroid cream, but decided to try AHA first after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>Have used it for years &amp; love it as daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I will continue to use the bottle and report back after more time.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be doing its job, my skin is soft and smooth and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it before bed on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and make sure to wash it off the next day</li>
            <li>It stings a bit at first</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t blend well into the skin.</li>
            <li>It did exactly like it promised.</li>
            <li>In fact this 6 oz lotion was first sold as a &#x27;body lotion&#x27; when they first came out with it.</li>
            <li>I have always had acne and this has helped so much!</li>
            <li>Eventhough I have only been using this product for a few months, I really like that it keeps my skin hydrated perfectly.</li>
            <li>It smells funny.</li>
            <li>and it is my first AHA product to use ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I started out using the Alpha Hydrox pads which have a higher percentage of glycolic acid</li>
            <li>Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shrink my pores exactly...</li>
            <li>I dont remember when exactly I bought it</li>
            <li>I bought this product the first time in Walgreen&#x27;s, but in Amazon I found it cheaper.</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels at first</li>
            <li>I wear sunscreen religiously and make every effort to keep my face out of the sun--even more so with this product.</li>
            <li>I have hyper pigmentation and lots of acne scars around my cheek and chin area and this product has lightened those areas a lot since I have first used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just gone back to my 3x a week routine and my skins gotten alot better.</li>
            <li>I found it to work after about a week of using it daily, but if I skip two days or more, the bumps return.</li>
            <li>i wash off all my makeup, rinse with hot water and pack on the lotion like a mask.</li>
            <li>Within the first day I noticed my face clearing up.</li>
            <li>And it is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really inexpensive!</li>
            <li>This is the first AHA product that I bought.</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>: I bought this at Amazon at first but had to go elsewhere when the price went up.</li>
            <li>Within the first couple of days I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>when i first began using, i was getting hormonal cysts across my cheek each month.</li>
            <li>When you first start using it, it will make you peel a bit though.  </li>
            <li>Then I try this stuff, based on reviews, and for the first time in my life the results were 100% unambiguous.  </li>
            <li>So this is all to say that I&#x27;m pretty sold on this product.  </li>
            <li>It dries nicely on my face and absolutely is NOT greasy.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I noticed it lightened my scars when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I remembered how WELL it helped me the first time and just stuck with it.</li>
            <li>AHA gave me such better results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard good things about glycolic acid as a really thorough exfoliator, which can help cut down on acne.  </li>
            <li>wow!!!!</li>
            <li>I definitely feel like this helps the other products I use work more effectively, e.g. and acne scar cream I am using 4)</li>
            <li>how ironic right?</li>
            <li>and I also don&#x27;t like the smell too much but putting on right before bed</li>
            <li>used for years as general skin care, very mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35, have really great skin (especially considering a history of wine and cigarettes), and have spent boatloads of money on skincare products&amp;#60;&amp;#60;not</li>
            <li>it really enhanced my completion even  tone skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I use Benzoyl Peroxide 10% from clean and clear every morning and night and this lotion after that every morning and night.</li>
            <li>As a result of this lotion and the clean and clear</li>
            <li>This helped clear it again!!&lt;br /&gt;Now 2 weeks after its reintroduction, my skin is clearing back up, is WAY softer, and has an amazing glow.</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally really dry and with this product I get clear even ash free skin :)</li>
            <li>I love this whole line of skin care and have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when I do, I have been using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when I do, I have been using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>old, since using this my skin glows, my cheeks are naturally rosy, my skin tone is evening out and my pores look better.  </li>
            <li>It is better than salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide..especially for very stubborn pimples, and for a low price..</li>
            <li>My favorite as it really does help me look younger!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for the general appearance of my skin and seems to have cut down on the cystic acne problem.</li>
            <li>More than that, the treatment side skin was overall smoother to the touch, which is a nice little bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a positive change in my skin texture after just one night of use, and I&#x27;ve continued using as directed ever since without any problems.</li>
            <li>Nothing in all my years ever gave a positive result.  </li>
            <li>In addition to being acne free, my scars also seem to be fading and my general skin tone is improved.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re consistent in using it, and I do so twice a day, it works and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it for that long on my face, as I use Tretinoin most evenings.</li>
            <li>I waited a LONG time before writing this review because I wanted to be REALLY sure that this product was working for me.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy and hope it even does more in the long run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products like this, I&#x27;m 41 and have minor signs of aging around my eyes and forehead.  </li>
            <li>well, at first i didnt think it was doing a whole lot.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, after using it for a while it will start working on those small wrinkles your trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li>I have used Alpha Hydrox products in the past and I always loved them.</li>
            <li>in my 30s had a full break out of \\&quot;adult hormonal acne\\</li>
            <li>This is great for dry skin or a dry patch.</li>
            <li>Very good for moisturizing and a little bit goes a long way !</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s a good alternative to apricot scrubs as the scrubs can be very harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>Also my mineral make up didn&#x27;t blend well over the top even after I waited for it to dry on my face.</li>
            <li>It leave my skin super soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>My forehead is usually dry but its much better now after using this.</li>
            <li>But this year, I use an additional moisturizer on top of the lotion because my skin always felt dry with just the Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion.  </li>
            <li>The offensive odor doesn&#x27;t linger overly long, it&#x27;s mostly gone within 15-30 minutes, but it really takes away from the enjoyment of this</li>
            <li>(I have always had dry skin but not too many wrinkles)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a dry greasy feeling if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Make sure your face is dry before putting it on.</li>
            <li>like any mask i only use it twice a week, because this stuff is strong.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue this routine and strongly recommend both products.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wait 10 minutes after you wash your face to be certain your skin is completely dry.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what I found it does:  SHRINKS LARGE PORES  </li>
            <li>A large amount comes in this bottle.</li>
            <li>Also may cause certain clothing to discolor.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly buy from this seller again.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;ll help to reduce my large pore size and acne.</li>
            <li>We will certainly order this product again.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for dry, rough, or flaky skin.</li>
            <li>I used to have cystic acne all over my right cheeck and jawline, thankfully my dermatoligist put me on a new prescription regime.</li>
            <li>I have used many (much more expensive) skin care brands in the past, but none are this consistently great for my skin.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t give this product a low rating because it \\&quot;didn&#x27;t remove your fine lines\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is my first alpha hydroxyl product I&#x27;ve ever used, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, other than lotions and creams, but I think this works much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they came up with a product for people with dry skin!</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my skin is firmer, &amp; fine lines appear to be fading.</li>
            <li>I would say a good way to use it is get a good facial brush, cleanse your face, apply this lotion in a thick layer and let it settle in, then use dampen your brush and brush your face in circular motions, rinse, pat dry and moisturize.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and was hoping this would help with uneveness and smooth out the little marks.</li>
            <li>It does a good job to exfoliate dull skin and minimize the look of age spots.</li>
            <li>and it has made a significant difference in reducing both new breakouts and the reddish/scarred appearance of old acne.  </li>
            <li>This is hard to find in stores, I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product because it makes my skin soft, clear, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Lemons work great, but they are sort of messy and gross, and I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my skin while I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and so much clearer and younger looking.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for about a week, and I already see a  huge difference.</li>
            <li>It made my face very itchy and greasy.</li>
            <li>and i do not break out much.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to eliminate some post acne marks that I had and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that you cannot use it every night because since it is not oil free, it will cause some acne to come out -</li>
            <li>It has really helped my teens w/ their blemishes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought this 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Then my children&#x27;s nanny said that I look really refreshed and</li>
            <li>really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it STUNG SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>but glycolic producs didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks what a relief</li>
            <li>You can really feel this lotion tingle for skin changes.</li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t really comment because I stopped using this after a week.</li>
            <li>I have smooth asian skin</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be real, they&#x27;re never going to go away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very oily and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I was really amazed and couldn&#x27;t believe the results</li>
            <li>I am going to start using the lotion on my entire body because I am enjoying the soft texture and glowing appearance of my face and neck so much.    </li>
            <li>Have used this for years and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is not fancy, so the price reflects the product, and is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I think that it clarifies the skin and gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any breakouts, which i used to have occasionally, and my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>If you want to see real results, you have to do a TCA peel.</li>
            <li>This lotion in okay, not greasy, not very moisturising either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I did use it, it was somewhat sticky, stung a bit, and I did not notice much in terms of effect or benefit from it.</li>
            <li>If you have these problems too or just want baby-butt-soft skin without spending too much money then this is your lotion.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Holds my tan longer, and looks so much nicer.</li>
            <li>What I really dislike is the watery texture and</li>
            <li>I would not advise anyone who wants to buy this for kp, it didn&#x27;t work for me........</li>
            <li>skin is so much softer since I have used this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer and smoother because of it.  </li>
            <li>My face just stung, did not see much results as hoped.</li>
            <li>Works fast.</li>
            <li>i really dont think it helped much for me</li>
            <li>no matter how much lotion or olive oil</li>
            <li>She has recommended to several of her friends and they all think its really fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I had a friend ask me if I was applying my makeup differently because my face looked like it was glowing and smooth.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, but my shaving is extremely smooth for some reason with the same old blade which most times i get bumps.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say that it helped my acne that much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply much of this product.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, I will use only a tiny amount of the product (or sometimes skip it altogether), and on top, I will use [[ASIN:B001PV6ONK Olay Complete Lotion for Combination Skin with SPF 15 - 6 oz.]], which contains a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA; salicylic acid) and also SPF, which is important when using AHAs because of increased sun sensitivity.  </li>

            <li>It also really reduced the redness and bumps</li>
            <li>&quot; I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>He loves it so much that he&#x27;s been ordering a bottle before running out.  </li>
            <li>and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
            <li>Gently exfoliates without irritation.</li>
            <li>So far this lotion has been worth the money.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>almost a models face my skin has been clearing up really fast everything evening out on my face and my neck</li>
            <li>HAven&#x27;t really noticed much of a change, if any.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quicky after ordered.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve held off reviewing this for a few months until I could make sure it wasn&#x27;t going to make my skin breakout as is the standard with most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t have much hope for this</li>
            <li>Now, I use AHA every night and my skin is baby smooth, pores are smaller, my makeup goes on and wears evenly.</li>
            <li>I really like this and will be sticking with it.</li>
            <li>my whole face started to itch.</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY works.</li>
            <li>Face is much softer than before.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice it until the Spring of 2011.  </li>
            <li>I notice a tingling feeling when I apply it, but I haven&#x27;t seen too much reduction in wrinkles, but my post acne scars are fading.</li>
            <li>but it is very dupable for the silky results you get.</li>
            <li>I use it on my back that is acne free and have noticed that my scars are not as noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy the entire line if Alpha product.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes the skin very well.</li>
            <li>Now I know what real acne is</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say I can tell a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>This stuff will really transform your skin.</li>
            <li>my skin appears much brighter.</li>
            <li>this stuff did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>It is very soothing once it dries.</li>
            <li>Very soon you will see the difference on your skin.</li>
            <li>This product has really improved my skin texture and feel.  </li>
            <li>it works really well for the bumps brought on by keratosis pilaris.  </li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>Seems to really keep my skin hydrated and helps with my acne.</li>
            <li>(is that a real word?).  </li>
            <li>It does seem to soften my skin, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my&lt;br /&gt;dark spots.</li>
            <li>But I started using it on my body and this lotion really works.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really nothing that &#x27;hurts&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I did break out on my neck and wonder if I had just put too much on.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>This product has helped so much for my arms, legs and face.</li>
            <li>I have quit using when I ran out, and have not noticed much of a difference in my skin since.  </li>
            <li>I cant tell its really doing much.</li>
            <li>but it still felt very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my hands at night and it really softens them, though.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>It has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this - it really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Not too much.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t see much result from using this cream</li>
            <li>I put it on every night and have not seen much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>I also have very oily skin, and my acne is going away.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li>I already have a fairly intense routine to keep everything in check- 3 step cleanser, toner, and medicated lotion twice a day.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast this started working.</li>
            <li>The person using this product in our house says it it working very well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and</li>
            <li>I started using it to get ready to start using acid peels.</li>
            <li>Since I still had the whole bottle, I decided to use this as my night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The scarring I had on my face is so much lighter.</li>
            <li>I have really oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I justlove this so much.</li>
            <li>I like how it makes my skin feel, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Certainly there are stronger products, this is a very inexpensive way to achieve maintenence</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this..</li>
            <li>And the price is certainly reasonable.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>I apply it to spots in the morning and leave it on all day, and apply it to my whole face at night.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this product didn&#x27;t really agree with my face.</li>
            <li>but they really are.</li>
            <li>The sun damage on my skin is really beginning to show.  </li>
            <li>I really regret being a &#x27;sun worshiper&#x27;, but it is what it is.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect form this product, as I&#x27;ve read the reviews</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a visible change in wrinkle reduction around my eyes, but I have almost gone through the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>much much</li>
            <li>i really like dr graf</li>
            <li>I tried it for a whole week and let me tell you</li>
            <li>just dont really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I order many items for friends- my male friend (80 years young), stands by this product 100%.</li>
            <li>the reason for my nice skin at this point, as I&#x27;ve tried and failed with many, so I owe a lot to genes and the fact that I now see a doctor for my skincare needs and use a couple of [pricey] products from Switzerland.</li>
            <li>But otherwise, this helped with acne on my back, what i think might be kp on my shoulders, and seems to enhance any moisturization i do on the following days, which is nice in the winter.  </li>
            <li>My dark spots are fading, and more radiant skin is evident.  </li>
            <li>This is my second order of this product, and I definitely think it is effective against wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>That beats Proactive/Neutrogena/Clean&amp;Clear Kits a $20 per month regimen, by far!!!</li>
            <li>I will never waste money on another face washing product or kit again!!!</li>
            <li>I received this last night and washed first with a mild soap then a Glytone Body wash with a loofah.  </li>
            <li>As the other reviews note, your skin will break out for roughly two weeks or so, but it will look great after that.</li>
            <li>Had really dark spots from sun damage on my face..honestly less than 2 weeks there was a significant change; some are almost completely faded and it&#x27;s great for acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried kits from Proactive, Neutrogena, clean and clear, and a few more.</li>
            <li>I have found that this product works very well, better than any other lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is a good price, as some of the aha products don&#x27;t have the potency of this, and are 3 to 5 times more expensive!</li>
            <li>In fact, I still see them and possibly more due to smiling and laughing so much.</li>
            <li>I have loved this lotion for years, but use it as a body lotion instead of just a facial lotion when my skin is especially dry.  </li>
            <li>would say that the appearance of stretch marks is still the same, but for the price of the bottle this is definitely worth it for combating cellulite!</li>
            <li>Does burn a little when you first use it but goes away with more uses / time on after you use it.</li>
            <li>I posted my original review last year, Sep. 2012.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I use it on top of a serum as a moisturizer, other times i just use this alone</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in the overall feel and texture of my skin through this routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>none the less, it is an amazing product that will definitely make your skin smoother and make you LOOK YOUNGER :-)  </li>
            <li>So far, I find it light, but it makes my skin look better (less old looking).  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and they were overwhelmingly positive but having spent most my adult life (I&#x27;m 45 now) lavishing $150 brand name lotions on my face, I didn&#x27;t expect much from something that costs under $15.  </li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use, this lotion made no considerable changes in the fine line on my face.</li>
            <li>My face started looking healthier and more radiant within a few days after first using.</li>
            <li>On my face, it felt tighter and better the first few days.</li>
            <li>It helps the skin to exfoliate the old skin making it fresh and new looking.  </li>
            <li>It super moisturizes my skin, leaves it really soft and young.</li>
            <li>high concentration of active ingredients, no fragrance or coloring; i&#x27;m using the entire line-without a doubt beats high end brands like Peter Roth whose products are quite fascinating</li>
            <li>I have a tan, olive complexion, good skin, but wanted to smooth out my pores and see if it would remove some small dark spots.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear for the first time since my teens.</li>
            <li>It didnt drastically lighten my skin, I can stil see some dark spots, but it looks 1000x better than what it looked like before.</li>
            <li>Do use sunscreen and test first if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m pretty much a beauty product lazy bones, and prior to using these I rarely even washed my face before bed--reason being, that I doubted most products really DID much of anything.</li>
            <li>Short and Sweet.</li>
            <li>My acne has gotten better, my skin is smoother, and dark spots have gotten lighter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 African American female and have always taken good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>I first started using this, my face completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>I also have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>For reference, I&#x27;m very fair skinned with mild to moderate closed comedones and sensitive to fatty acids.  </li>
            <li>The active ingredients in this product are what you need in an anti-aging routine (which I recommend you begin by 27)--don&#x27;t spend more for the same thing in a prettier bottle with a rosy scent, because that&#x27;s what many products are actually charging you for.</li>
            <li>this lotion and my skin seem to be a match made in heaven, so far (mixed skin with fine lines around the eyes and on the forehead).</li>
            <li>Better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get all the old skin cells taken away and new ones brought out!!</li>
            <li>Your skin will get used to it after a while, so you can switch to a retinol product (Avene&#x27;s Eluage for exemple, so good and plumping too), then come back to this little jewel.</li>
            <li>You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.)  </li>
            <li>You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.)  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels fresh, clean, and it really improved any uneven skin tone splotches I had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again...YES, it burns, but it will make your flaky skin look and feel better and less itchy.</li>
            <li>My skin is basically like stone at this point so it doesn&#x27;t even slightly burn, but most people will have to use it sparingly for a couple weeks while they adjust.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne more than half my life.  </li>
            <li>Most reviews mentioned a slight tingling sensation upon applying the product however</li>
            <li>My pores are less visible, I have a healthy glow</li>
            <li>If anyone knows of a similar product, I would love to know what it is if it has the same formula.</li>
            <li>This will have your skin looking so young, fresh and alive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular product and product line for about 20 years.</li>
            <li>This is only the 2nd item that I have been able to use that does not clog the pores.  </li>
            <li>I use in combination with a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I will order more in the future and can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my skin once I use it regularly.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t particularly work for me.</li>
            <li>I believe it aids in accelerated skin turn over because I am seeing more dead skin ready to be sloughed away after I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I consider myself lucky to find out mine was VERY LOW because my Dr. Ran a Test.  </li>
            <li>I mainly bought it to control my acne</li>
            <li>This product is as mild as basic hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and have lived in Midwest where I cannot find this stuff..</li>
            <li>So I decided to \\&quot;invest\\&quot; in my skin now that I\\&quot;m getting older by trying a product that helps preserve your youthful looks.  </li>
            <li>Main reason I use it - It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or that I have cling wrap slathered on my face.</li>
            <li>I use this once week, but mainly for spot treatments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is this product is worth the money and will work to smooth out skin, but in my experience it had to be applied everyday for any noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>so I can attest that it helps maintain their current state and not deepen as quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this for use on my 25 Y/O boyfriend with acne scars on his back and mild acne on his face.</li>
            <li>But this one is SERIOUSLY not greasy.</li>
            <li>I suffer from minor adult acne and with my wedding coming up, I wanted to make sure my face was clear.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit funky, and it tingles a bit, but didn&#x27;t bother my skin much&amp;my skin is VERY sensitive!</li>
            <li>it was some \\&quot;junk\\&quot; working its way out -- because after that my skin looked more even, more radiant, little lines were less noticeable. .</li>
            <li>but it was full up and thick and really strong.</li>
            <li>the reviews were high and ti seemed legit.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it because I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lotion.</li>

            <li>highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the high rating, but after using it for about 2 weeks, there is still no progress.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It really hurts you mentally and this stuff along side of a GENTLE cleanser, BP and regular (oil free) moisturizer has really changed my skin and my life!</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive and have had no problem with this but better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>I layer a face lotion (with a little almond oil) on top for hydration.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin at ALL, do not purchase this!!</li>
            <li>, I have not had a major break out since the first couple weeks of the regimen.</li>
            <li>sure that you moisturize after use, as it is a little drying (nothing horrid).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Alpha Hydrox for a little over two months now, and honestly, there&#x27;s barely any discernable difference, if any.</li>
            <li>I started using Jan Marini&#x27;s Bioglycolic face lotion, a little more expensive but great product.</li>
            <li>This lotion also does such a great job of exfoliating that I&#x27;ve had little flakes form on my face -- something that never ever happened to me before using, since I never could exfoliate well enough before this lotion to make a difference with my acne.  </li>
            <li>Lotion is not thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li>:)  I&#x27;m hoping thatcontinued use will smooth out the deeper line on my forehead (at least I only have one!)</li>
            <li>i have sensitive, very combo acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I do really well with Jurlique natural products.  </li>
            <li>I have layered lotion on top of it, and noticed that it still kept my pores nice and small, but I don&#x27;t usually need additional moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and it gently exfoliates the skin while making it soft.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is too expensive for its size, but the product inside does a great job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My face looked much brighter and clear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped clear up my KP.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this lotion works very well without me breaking out.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t take more than a few days of this.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be scared when you get a burning sensation, thats normal and proof that it is working.</li>
            <li>After a few days of use, the dryness is vastly better with no problems.  </li>
            <li>i tried using scar gel which normally does the jobthen</li>
            <li>If I start to have a breakout, it is pretty much gone the next morning.</li>
            <li>This is rated as one of the strongest alpha hydrox lotions, but I had no negative skin reactions and am hanging in there, using it every day.  </li>
            <li>B000UVZU1S St. Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz</li>
            <li>B000UVZU1S St. Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz</li>
            <li>Tingling feel is normal .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical enough to be used as a body lotion.</li>
            <li>I will encourage you to test a strip of your face a few nights to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction.</li>
            <li>This was my first glycolic acid product and I am glad I started slow with the lower percentage.(this</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it especially for the price!</li>
            <li>As much as I LOVE this cream, it wasn&#x27;t suitible for everyday use on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and don&#x27;t need to use an additional moisturizer after for night time.</li>
            <li>If I miss a few nights in a row I&#x27;ll start to get acne again, so I try not to miss more than one night.</li>
            <li>It can cause some stinging if you&#x27;re not used to it, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t severe as it once was during my middle school &amp; high school years, but in recent years its been pretty mild.</li>
            <li>Rubs on so easily and makes skin nice and soft, Use everyday and see some wrinkles become less visible!</li>
            <li>The last product seemed to become less effective</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of dry, not very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Places where I had dry patches are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have compared similar glycolic acid products from other manufacturers and this is the most reasonable that I can find.</li>
            <li>The only place I break out now is right below my eyebrows, which also happens to be a spot where I can&#x27;t put this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I get them right under my butt on the back of my thighs.</li>
            <li>My left cheek had bumps all over it specifically and not my right one.</li>
            <li>and i go right back to using this on.  </li>
            <li>I had mainly bought this for discoloration and while I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really done much on that front, it has seemed to improve my overall clarity.</li>
            <li>My breakouts are healing much faster than normal, a few new ones were coming out at first, but that&#x27;s pretty much stopped now.    </li>
            <li>but it has a very strong, not very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price especially because a little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I normally have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this product because i barely get any sleep and have and have like 2 pimple scar i wanted it gone haha.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it has removed fine lines and softened brown spots and left a revitalized glow to my complexion.</li>
            <li>When you try a new product give it 6 weeks of use before deciding whether or not it works for you.</li>
            <li>nothing new for me.</li>
            <li>But it helps to keeps me 34 each new year I guess.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>This is no longer carried anywhere close to where I live.</li>
            <li>Your skin will look glowing and new..</li>
            <li>If you want to live your life like a vampire...</li>
            <li>Overall I have a more even tone, less break-outs, and my face is much smoother.</li>
            <li>use it nightly but really haven&#x27;t seen much peeling of the facial skin.</li>
            <li>Yes it most definitely made my skin DRAMATICALLY smoother and clearer,and after only a few days of use, people were commenting on how young I looked and how wrinkle -free</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and blemish free, which is something I could never really achieve with the store bought brand.</li>
            <li>As a teen, I had very oily skin but only mild acne problems.  </li>
            <li>I started getting breakouts in my early 40s thanks to hormones and read one of the reviews that recommended AHA and this product for adult acne.</li>
            <li>I find this lotion to be thick and not spread very easily.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft, evens the tone and reduces breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old with oily, acne prone skin and this came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin very soft and moist, as well.</li>
            <li>I definitely have some fine wrinkles below my eyes and some broken blood vessels on my cheeks (too many nights out on the town in my youth;-&gt;).</li>
            <li>It burns a little when freshly applied, but that&#x27;s normal for an Acid ;)</li>
            <li>The darkest ones seems to turn slightly lighter and I&#x27;m happy about that, but other lighter spots are the same and still there.  </li>
            <li>I am for my age (56, people think I am in my early 40&#x27;s, ha!)  </li>
            <li>I think stress was making me breakout more than usual</li>
            <li>I have been using Alpha Hydrox for years, and although I have tried many other products - I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other product you could grab at your local drug store, etc.</li>
            <li>The first time upon application, I did get a deep tingling sensation on my face.</li>
            <li>first couple of times you use it, your face may get a bit red and sting.</li>
            <li>Other brands charge so much more for the same ingredient.</li>
            <li>This cream may make your  face tingle a bit--it does on mine, which indicates that it might be slightly acidic and therefore help remove the thinnest layer of skin and with it, some fine lines (</li>
            <li>You obviously don&#x27;t know much about chem peels then!</li>
            <li>I have used it almost nightly for about a month, and even though my sleeping has been less than desirable, my fine lines are definetly minimized.</li>
            <li>First of all, it came one of those yellow manilla envelopes lined with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I first used it when I was an international flight Attendent.  </li>
            <li>Hydrates your skin just enough, never too much!</li>
            <li>Second time ordering this as I gave away my first bottle.</li>
            <li>Wish I had gotten (or could get) the exact same formula with an SPF around 30!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this item in the past I just love it.</li>
            <li>Is starting to work pretty well...</li>
            <li>To my amazement, my skin cleared up, felt so soft and looked glowing!</li>
            <li>The top layer of dermis usually shed in 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>this goes a long way to give it a fresh look.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it on my face tingled and got really red</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month ,the first two weeks it stung and made my face red</li>
            <li>The first bottle I used all over, this second bottle I am using on my face and I purchased the silk body wrap lotion for my body.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to like this product enough for me to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li>I used several AHA products before and it&#x27;s the first time I got something that just sits on my skin.</li>
            <li>Have purchased many times over the years from amazon and elsewhere, can usually find at marshalls or tj maxx</li>
            <li>This happens only the first time you use it after some time your skin get use.</li>
            <li>fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>So I still recommend starting with this product, but if you find it stops working for you, try something of theirs of a slightly higher concentration.</li>
            <li>It is the first and only skin care product from which I have seen any resultsâwhatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular benefit to using this after many months, however I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li>Personally, it wasn&#x27;t anything special enough that I would consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I read on a website (acne.org I think) about using alpha-hydroxy to help turnover new cells and clear up acne</li>
            <li>Once it finally dries, it does sort of tighten the skin, but leaves it feeling sort of tuggy, not soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>However, that goes away quickly as the lotion sinks into your skin.  </li>
            <li>so not sure how it would work on more mature skin.</li>
            <li>was not sure if it was effective enough though.</li>
            <li>Research has shown that AHA can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but there is little evidence to suggest long-term efficacy.</li>
            <li>It seems very light to be just a moisturizer on its own - which I don&#x27;t think it is trying to be - and as such it makes my skin feel a little tight after it sinks in.</li>
            <li>i am over 60 with a few fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>and right now I dont have a single razor bump.</li>
            <li>I was never overweight or large, so there was never a lot of cellulite, but enough to make me self-conscious in a swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used one pea sized drop of this lotion for a  really large zit on his face and the next morning he woke up</li>
            <li>I would end up with ingrown hairs and large red bumps.  </li>
            <li>Hands are looking a little wrinkly and need something to smooth them out.  </li>
            <li>The lotion did not help smooth out the little bumps</li>
            <li>I am 51, have fine lines beginning to appear around my upper lip, so I&#x27;m curious to see how it turns out.</li>
            <li>it stung a lot in the beginning and became a little better once I started using it regularly.</li>
            <li>I had little bumps all over my face and more red spots than I ever had.</li>
            <li>I know that glycolic acid is one of only a few skin care ingredients that really work at targeting fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>so I know that many purported skin care creams and lotions have little or no actual beneficial ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and although the lotion burns slightly when on my face, it is soooo definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>so I could get a clear view of the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>In that time, my skin has been closer to 100% clear than I ever dreamed it could be.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s clear, my acne scars are fading.</li>
            <li>AHA helps clear up acne scars and prevents/lessens acne breakouts for me.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face to clear up acne and use as a chemical exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(most people think I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>I am switching to ROC retinol serum and will see if it&#x27;ll clear all the skin tags.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clean and I have a slightly peeling.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to try and clear up body acne.</li>
            <li>When I do get a breakout, it seems to clear up quicker.  </li>
            <li>I can be clear for months and then break out all over my face.</li>
            <li>BTW i dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I stopped using it on my neck (which is actually wrinkle free anyways) because either the lotion or the itching caused my neck to be red the next day.  </li>
            <li>(anyone married a long time knows how UNobservant husbands can be ..</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I always wear 100% sunscreen if out in the direct sun.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it because I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily, sensitive and problematic, but I bought this lotion and it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate acne or oiliness.    </li>
            <li>As far as the seller, it arrived promptly</li>
            <li>leaves skin soft just what it should do.</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily and mature skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had stubborn adult acne for years.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t find this to be an issue.</li>
            <li>I use this frequently at night.  </li>
            <li>My skin is truly glowing (not because of pregnancy) and it looks like I&#x27;ve had a professional chemical exfoliation treatment.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the product stung like hell each time I used it.</li>
            <li>If Used too often, can irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You will have to apply the acid directly onto your face.</li>
            <li>I read on Amazon that this lotion could help, and indeed it has, within about 5 days the area has been completely cleared of the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Benzoyl Peroxide, for example, caused acne breakouts and I then learned that I had sensitive skin and watched my product ingredients to avoid ongoing problems.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe all the compliments that came my way - everyone started telling me I looked so young and</li>
            <li>Dr. Oz recommended using glycolic acid to keep your skin young.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I can get back to my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it because I have sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t be surprised if you break out.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell I guess.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from adult acne for over 10 years and nothing has cleared up my skin like this product.</li>
            <li>This also leaves your skin soft and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li>bought this 10% Glycolic-AHA cream to give my sensitive skin a break from the stronger 12% cream as needed.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>It is now said that we need this formulation to keep our skin young.  </li>
            <li>Really seems to make a difference the the overall appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 years old</li>
            <li>I am currently in my early 40s.  </li>
            <li>(The only thing that really worked was Accutane, but that became WAY too cumbersome to continue to use given all of the requirements surrounding prescribing it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely, this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>My only drawback with this is that it really needs to be used two times a day.</li>
            <li>Made it feel so soft but</li>
            <li>If youâre sensitive to petrolatum products, I suggest getting the enhanced cream instead.</li>
            <li>(My problem is adult acne coupled with premature signs of aging)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li>Also, it did not irritate my notoriously sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>5+ years old are now gone or atleast minimized.</li>
            <li>When the product arrived, the package was completely mangled.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 days, I developed this rash on my neck.</li>
            <li>No breakouts so far.</li>
            <li>I freaked out about aging because I look young for my age</li>
            <li>I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t be that much of a drain on me financially if I bought this product</li>
            <li>And my skin is so soft like a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I do not think this is a common side effect but just make sure you are not allergic to any of the ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>I have been using the aha 10% lotion for about three weeks now, my skin tone, dryness, blotchiness, blackheads and pimples have completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>advice is to give it a shot, even if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>These products allows your skin to repair and the products glide on leaving your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely looks brighter and makeup goes on much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I just use my hands and gentle pressure and wash for 1 entire minute.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin is overly sensitive or anything</li>
            <li>but when I started using this, it completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 years old</li>
            <li>I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>a teen, I didn&#x27;t have much acne but</li>
            <li>Leave it on for about 5 minutes like a mask then rinse completely.</li>
            <li>wow, you&#x27;ve gotta be kidding</li>
            <li>No reduction in old acne hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin, but I have no problem on this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and combination (only/dry) and it works for me.</li>
            <li>I find it gives me the same results at a much, much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am young (29) but have been using anti-aging type creams for sevearal years in an effort to prevent signs of aging on my face before they occur.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I really needed something to stop the left side from the break outs.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be surprised by the flaking, that is part of the process.</li>
            <li>I have a very hairy bikini line and over the last 20 years I have given up on keeping it shaved for swimsuits and just wear boy shorts.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this years ago and completely forgot I had it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s baby soft without any over-drying effect.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend trying this one.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the cause, I stopped using the Souffle and have been using only the Enhanced Lotion alone for a few months now, and my skin is looking better than it has in years!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>(obviously.. ) When used everyday my skin started to flake&amp;peel, causing more of a break out.</li>
            <li>I am sorry that I couldn&#x27;t give this product a good rating..</li>
            <li>Have bought all the really expensive items with fancy names but have had good luck with this product thus far.</li>
            <li>Nice and thin, doesn&#x27;t leave you with any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>But a few quick checks in the mirror daily keep facial flakes from becoming too numerous.    </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s can mean the difference between cute and coot.</li>
            <li>never really makes it starts healing away right away.  </li>
            <li>It eliminates the funny bumps on my chin and smoothes out the dry, flaky skin elsewhere.</li>
            <li>If you have a stubborn pimple you can first put BP on it and then after a few minutes add a little of this on top.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this same company makes a similar product with a higher concentration of the active ingredient.</li>
            <li>Mild acid breaks the oil surface tension on your pores, allows O2 in and helps clear up the infection; acid environment is also less hospitable for the bacteria that cause the blackhead</li>
            <li>Good~ but ! Smells bad~</li>
            <li>You do not need that much when you apply this lotion so it will last a long time, plus with the continuous skin exfoliation my skin has been so much softer.</li>
            <li>It may sting a little after application, depending on your skin type, mine is oily &amp; can take pretty much anything you throw at it.</li>
            <li>You actually get a lot for what you pay, especially because you don&#x27;t need to use very much of it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed some difference in the fine wrinkles but not sure which to give the credit to.</li>
            <li>I washed daily with a mild antibacterial soap, followed by Loreal&#x27;s pH Toner, and then the Alpha Hydrox (back then the regular face lotion was 12% glycolic acid).  </li>
            <li>product overall, particularly for the price according to her.</li>
            <li>It also lightened hyperpigmentation and when I get small pimples, I apply this more heavily or multiple times a day</li>
            <li>It does removes dark spots but ONLY the light ones.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first as I have had skin discoloration on my legs for most of my life - well over 30 years.</li>
            <li>It does sting a bit when I first put it on, especially if you have open acne spots.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a thin consistency, and I would say it&#x27;s good for all skin types (I have dry sensitive, acne prone skin).</li>
            <li>I have learned to avoid certain substances, including retinol, the previous wonder product for reviving the skin, so I was eager to try acids instead, but also, naturally, very cautious about it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any major change so far.</li>
            <li>I have other products that I&#x27;m using now that I can tell a difference from right away</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and my skin has been a mess this time around.  </li>
            <li>I poured it into a different bottle with a smaller spout, and so I can apply the cream more efficiently and it lasts a little longer as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great lotion for dry skin, and it doesn&#x27;t have any weird odor or anything.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s supposed to sting, tickle, and leave the face dry, but most people said it went away after a few days.</li>
            <li>not only were all my acne spots smaller and MUCH less inflamed than when I&#x27;d gone to bed, but my skin had an overall healthy glow to it that is has literally never, ever had before, except perhaps when I was a very young child.  </li>
            <li>I only use this lotion in the evenings because it tends to make my face look and feel oily (which was initially concerning because I already have really oily skin), but it has worked wonders so far.</li>
            <li>first off never really write but reviews</li>
            <li>After cleansing I add a tiny drop to my normal moisturizer and mix it all up and apply.</li>
            <li>Started using this lotion a few weeks ago and the first thing I noticed is that it caused me to break out -- I haven&#x27;t had pimples like this since high school....</li>
            <li>The price is so much less than any other Alpha Hydrox product out there and seems to work better.  </li>
            <li>The product is an exfoliant so it is always having you show new skin, which keeps your skin looking younger.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using these two products about two weeks ago, I have noticed that I have not any any new breakouts on my back or chest.</li>
            <li>and I actually got new pimples on my face.</li>
            <li>This cream has helped with fading my scars, and helped heal any new pimples that have occured (especially when I break the rules and pick at my skin...</li>
            <li>something new every day, deep beneath the skin&#x27;s surface, and it just wouldn&#x27;t quit no matter what I did.</li>
            <li>not able to use it much because its causing my wife to have breakouts but makes the skin more tight</li>
            <li>I purchased three Alpha Hydrox products and although I have only been using them less than a month, I believe&lt;br /&gt;these products work better (for me, anyway) than products that are way more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using the glycolix 20% pads and taking B-stress vitamins, my skin is getting dry.</li>
            <li>I went to a local cosmetic store and actually paid 3x the price for one of those very \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; AHA cream in the 10% concentration.</li>
            <li>I have used this product off and on for 20 years gets rid of uneven skin tone, the scent is not something I would desire but the smells goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>and I love that it only takes a little bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li>But I have be using it twice a day for two weeks and the difference in my skin is very apparent.  </li>
            <li>I follow the Alpha Hydrox Lotion with a broad spectrum sunscreen.Â  </li>
            <li>I have barely had a zit since!  </li>
            <li>I have since ordered 4 more bottles, but in an effort to make it last longer, this past week I have only been using on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other product has came close..</li>
            <li>I use this product each night (start out using it every other night, as it might sting a bit at first).</li>
            <li>stuff}.I was using no other cleanser.</li>
            <li>I got maybe one or two new acne spots after the first few uses and none since.  </li>
            <li>Secondly,It reduces acne by drying up oil, yes it will dry out skin too much of your not careful.</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to evaluate its effectiveness but the price is excellent compared to the very expensive department store brands that claim the same benefit</li>
            <li>I do get a slight burning sensation right after shaving but that is it.</li>
            <li>Most have lightened and the break outs happen less often and are less severe.</li>
            <li>It is indeed fragrance free as advertized, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li>Try a little tester first, some folks with sensitive skin will need to cut it with Curel, Eucerin type lotion.  </li>
            <li>The only cons are that it smells a little odd and you&#x27;ll find that you sunburn very easily, but lotions and makeup with SPF will prevent that.</li>
            <li>It reacts fast and hard to everything: temperature, humidity, direct pressure, indirect rubbing, what I&#x27;m eating, what I&#x27;m drinking, how much sleep I&#x27;ve had, what day of the week it isâ</li>
            <li>It generally doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle unless my skin was irritated by something else, like using a washcloth, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only clear because of this product, but it glows.</li>
            <li>My face is clear, pores appear smaller, and skin is smoother.  </li>
            <li>In addition to using it on my face, I&#x27;ve been using it on my shoulders and back to help clear up my body breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I was excited, and expected some improvement since researching AHAs, but have seen improvement with other AHA products.  </li>
            <li>which helps them stay smaller and not become inflamed or enlarged by dirt and oil, Once my pores are purged they seem to stay clear.</li>
            <li>the scent is barely there at all, I only mention it because I know how sensitive peoples noses can be.</li>
            <li>It initially kept my skin semi clear.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to help with brown spots on the skin, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it really works.  </li>
            <li>People always think I&#x27;m much younger than the old lady I am.  </li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness, it definitely works.</li>
            <li>I am 30 and have had moderate to severe acne since my early teens.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised they don&#x27;t carry this at a local drug store.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and have a professional facial done.</li>
            <li>People 45 years old mistake me as younger than they are.  </li>
            <li>I am using this as a preventive measure (I am only 24 years old)</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found a combination of wash and topical solution that really truly works for my chest and back.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is that Amazon no longer carries it direct so you have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly 50, you wouldn&#x27;t know it by this sudden beautifying of my skin.</li>
            <li>B000G8LWZI Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA 1.6 oz (45 g)]], and experiencing problems--it turns out that I was sold a container of the Souffle that was actually several years old.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from</li>
            <li>Also, I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from</li>
            <li>It removes the old and drab looking skins .... leaving a much younger and revialized appearance.</li>
            <li>(25 female, sensitive combination skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to not have freckles but they developed in my mid- to late-20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 years old, and just starting to need some wrinkle prevention help</li>
            <li>so be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>Back to my Kiehl&#x27;s, Lush, Dermatologica, and Origins staples.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it twice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it occasionally would itch/burn, I now use it specifically on the locations where I&#x27;m trying to fight off the closed comedones, and I&#x27;m seeing just as much success as before when I was covering my entire face.</li>
            <li>I have minor acne scars and this slowly lightens them away :)</li>
            <li>I hope it will help remove a few wrinkles, but not sure yet how effective it will be on me.</li>
            <li>Aha stung slightly (and still does) when i put it on, but its not horrible by any means, just put on a little at a time.</li>
            <li>Firstly it keeps oil down.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on any product with less than 8% glycolic acid, and don&#x27;t be suckered into buying brands that promise more than 14%.</li>
            <li>With the dry winter air, its even worse so I try to keep the skin hydrated, but I don&#x27;t know if this product is effective if used layered under lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first shaved with some Dudu black soap and a safety razor...</li>
            <li>- my skin is usually normal (not overly dry or oily).</li>
            <li>I have dry cheeks and normal to oily skin in the T Zone area.  </li>
            <li>Upon first use, you may feel a bit of tingling to a slight burning sensation</li>
            <li>Slight stinging at first but goes away as you wear it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any better than any other glycolic acid lotion.</li>
            <li>The only thing is if I forget to put on sunscreen in direct sun for a long time, I&#x27;m more likely to turn a tad pink versus tan since I think it has some slight bleaching properties.  </li>
            <li>Your skin gets very dry and even cracks, and this is the only thing we have found that really works.</li>
            <li>the cream isn&#x27;t very moisturizing and to me doesn&#x27;t have a velvet-ey texture that some of my other moisturizers have.  </li>
            <li>This burns the skin a little, especially when fresh out the bath, but nothing painful/intolerable.  </li>
            <li>When both my products arrived, I immediately went for the 12% as I wanted quicker and more dramatic results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not totally blemish-free, but the zits I do have are tiny, infrequent, and clear within a day or two (I should note,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about this working for wrinkles on your face, but I can say that it works amazingly to clear up my keratosis pilaris (bumps on the backs of my upper arms and sometimes upper legs).  </li>
            <li>I am a male in my mid 20s that has been suffering from acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li>The cream sinks in well enough but really dont see any changes in my skin after using for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>At first the sting bothered me a little, but I thought about what a chemical peal does and realized that it was a sign it was working.  </li>
            <li>May sting a little a first.</li>
            <li>It did sting a little at first, but after a week</li>
            <li>The first week I use it, I feel little bit tingling , but after a week, I don&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this lotion on my face, I noticed that it was tingling and stinging a little.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small tab to go along way but doesn&#x27;t seem to really absorb so have white spots on my face until I really work it in or remove with a towel.</li>
            <li>i actually dont use it as a moisturizer because it makes my skin dry in large red patches, especially in the drier parts of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it has been thanks to this cream or the fact that it is now winter where I live that has lighten my skin.</li>
            <li>Use when blackheads first surface on face, skin, back etc, and they&#x27;ll be almost gone in half a day.  </li>
            <li>As with other Alpha Hydrox products, initial use brings with it a tingling sensation to the skin, but it is not irritating over time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 years old, asian skin tone and have always had moderate acne, and this has actually worked!  </li>
            <li>Im an African American male in my my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>will sting the first few times you use it, but don&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li>(bc the results were noticeable within the first few days</li>
            <li>used to put lemon juice on my face a few times a week, and this AHA cream feels exactly how the lemon juice felt, so I wasn&#x27;t alarmed.  </li>
            <li>Although it does feel itchy for the first few applications.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, this stuff can really make your skin peel, so be VERY careful with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually went to two different dermatologists and tried various tropical and oral medications with little success.  </li>
            <li>On the box it says that if application does not dry within a minute or less, you&#x27;ve used too much.  </li>
            <li>-- I had to take pictures of myself and compare them to older pictures to be sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive, very dry skin.</li>
            <li>A small, less than a dime sized amount, is more than enough to work with.  </li>
            <li>I also only use a small amount at a time and spread it on top of my slightly damp face, I find that works best/improves absorbability.  </li>
            <li>I was aware of this product and so decided to try this one as all of the scores of other skin products I&#x27;ve used over the years have either made my face greasy feeling or dry and peeling -</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to clear up the severe scarring all over my face and dry up the bumps I had.</li>
            <li>I always had sensitive dry skin, and after using this product it just made my face looks brighter and youthful</li>
            <li>Oily, dry, sensitive, acne, wrinkles...</li>
            <li>lastly it reduces dark spots quicker than anything I have ever used  because of the anti wrinkle properties, it helps soon regenerate fast</li>
            <li>It tingled a bit upon the first few applications only.</li>
            <li>a small few notable occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first few times I felt a little tingle and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>use it all over my face at night after washing and toning with a little pure tea tree oil diluted with water on a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks of consistent use, applied once at night and then once in the morning, I felt my skin needed a rest, so now I use it only once a day for a week, putting it on just before bedtime, then don&#x27;t use for a few days, (only use a coconut oil moisturizer)</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox naturally removes the dead skin cells from your skin revealing the new skin underneath.</li>
            <li>and if I use this lotion regularly, I have much softer, less flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He has oily skin, and his previous moisturizer didn&#x27;t do much for him, so after extensive researching on Amazon, I got this for him 9 months ago</li>
            <li>Definitely, this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it highly!at happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind.  </li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox AHA enhanced lotion should be applied sparingly, as it is very thin and it does not take much to get full coverage of your face.</li>
            <li>My dark spots were mainly on my shaving areas, my neck &amp; jawline.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very diligent about it and stopped using it after a little while.  </li>
            <li>I tried many other, more expensive products, but my skin started having breakouts, looked dull and was not soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li>Lotion goes on smooth, a little heavy, but I felt nothing and saw no changes.</li>
            <li>One night when I was sleepily getting ready for bed my moisturizer and this stuff got a little mixed up</li>
            <li>It does make my fair skin feel a little vulnerable in the sun if I don&#x27;t have sunscreen on</li>
            <li>My skin tone has definitely improved - the broken capillaries look smaller, the sun/age spots seem to have faded, the fine lines around my eyes have improved (although not gone away entirely).</li>
            <li>The old acne scars are starting to disappear but no significant changes in the old marks.</li>
            <li>I know it is supposed to be for dry skin, but it really doesn&#x27;t make my skin any oilier than any other lotion.</li>
            <li>I think I might be using too much of this product; a little goes a long way, and I usually apply about a dimes worth to my face and, and I feel it may be overkill.  </li>
            <li>Be wary when you have a fresh mani/pedi because depending on the top coat this may cause it to go dull.  </li>
            <li>nothing good, nothing bad.</li>
            <li>I have been told I look younger (late 20s, early 30s) than my real age (age 42).</li>

            <li> In fact, Consumer Reports just rated a dozen or so and the best one was the $20 Neutrogena wrinkle remover, which received a better rating than LancÃ´me and others costing $65.</li>
            <li> there, too, it&#x27;s done a remarkable job of reducing the amount of time my spots stick around, reducing redness, and reducing size.    </li>
            <li> I have tried many hydroxyl products over the years and this lotion is the best of them all in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I always had awesome skin, felt confident and got compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li> Nice price also!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any remarkable changes in my skin from this product but, 1)</li>
            <li> or i just have good genes, lol.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy :^)</li>
            <li> It is pleasant to use</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and still use it because it works, it is well priced and is pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> lotion has a pleasant texture and it doesn&#x27;t feel too drying on the skin.</li>
            <li> Even more effective than the night cream!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, but I also exfoliate once a week which makes my skin even more glowing and flawless.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just not as good as the Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12%.</li>
            <li> At this point I stop applying it and use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Now with each week my skin feels smooth and looks great!</li>
            <li> Great price and effective.</li>
            <li> This works good.</li>
            <li> It is a good face moisturizer</li>
            <li> Good AHA lotions (10%</li>
            <li> Its also good for preventing ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> It also does a really good job at hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> I did a search on Amazon and stumbled upon the Alpha Hydrox which had some good reviews</li>
            <li> But u will need a good sunblock as well with continued usage.</li>
            <li> Good price for it as well</li>
            <li> I began getting an abnormal amount of wrinkles for my age, so I began reading all the anti-aging info I could find and invested in Nuskin products which I really loved.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my body instead, almost finished a bottle in 2 month, the result is good, helped my acne a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a bit over three weeks and results are so good.  </li>
            <li> I already knew that it is good.</li>
            <li> all was good.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality product and has a descent amount of AHA acid.</li>
            <li> i hope good reviews would encourge others to try this product so they wont take it off the market.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is not that good</li>
            <li> Basically, a good product that delivers all it says.  </li>
            <li> i feel it is good as moisturizer</li>
            <li> Works best when up apply a light oil (i.e. olive/almond oil mix) or lotion after you apply the glycolic AHA.</li>
            <li> Based on all the good reviews, I figured there was no risk in trying this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good proudct,packed well and delivered on time ...</li>
            <li> this way ou will know if it is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s just life, but still would like to find a good anti wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> This is a good exfoliating lotion.</li>
            <li> although it felt good on my body, it runs out faster like that</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> and that lasted for a good 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> This is a Cleopatra recipe... who was reputed to have had gorgeous skin.</li>
            <li> All good.</li>
            <li> I taught Its a good bargain when its on sale.....</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin looking good.</li>
            <li> LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I have received the package in 2 days, it was well wrapped and in good conditions.</li>
            <li> and I loved the results</li>
            <li> this is as good as Walgreens AHA cream.</li>
            <li> good stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as another brand of glycolic acid product I use and</li>
            <li> Non greasy, feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> Good for AHA exfoliation</li>
            <li> I became so excited when I saw these perfect reviews for this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this because of the wonderful reviews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother with this again, as it isn&#x27;t the best at moisturizing (not bad -</li>
            <li> Very glad I found it online.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very many wrinkles to begin with.</li>
            <li> This product is very potent with Alpha Hydroxy Acids(10%) which can cause irritation, photo-sensitivity and flaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very healthy but before using this lotion, I was getting acne on both my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the alpha hydrox lotion.</li>

            <li> I have no association with this product or this company, except as a satisfied customer!  </li>
            <li> - I might try to find an even higher level after I readjust (but I may just be being greedy because the souffle is great!)</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better!</li>

            <li> Fabulous stuff!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot better now!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I am definitely satisfied with Alpha Hydrox!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 6 months ago &amp; my face hasn&#x27;t looked better!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used and my first product review.</li>
            <li> But the most pleasant side effect was that my skin looked a lot plumper and more youthful!</li>
            <li> I was able to build up my tolerance fairly quickly, after a week of using it every night the redness and burning sensation I experienced was greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing</li>
            <li> Specifically it is great for tackling acne primarily caused by keratinization issues.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 weeks ago along with the face wash and souffle and the difference these products have made is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing lotion.</li>
            <li> so I tried the lotion because of all the amazing reviews</li>
            <li> and they have an AHA lotion along with acne care and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> This is a light lotion that works great.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> But after I discovered this amazing lotion, my face is so even toned and no pimples!Not even one!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I look in the mirror, I honestly can&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never submitted an online review before,  but because this product was so effective, I am compelled to write one now.</li>
            <li> All in all this product really does what it says it will do, and that&#x27;s something great !</li>
            <li> It was $30 and a fraction of the amount of this stuff but it works nicely on my face.</li>
            <li> Love it, good moisturizer for my face</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled.</li>
            <li> It evens out complexion and also leaves skin with a nice warm youthful glow.</li>
            <li> My mother uses it for wrinkles and it works nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice price .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the whole body.</li>
            <li> Especially useful for men as it slows the formation of creases in the neck and around the ears.</li>
            <li> I bought this item before and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast order and great price!</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li> Nice amount for the price.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to an inexpensive, effective way to reduce the lines in my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way my skin looked this morning.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Alpha Hydroxy lotion, taking her own bottle out of her purse to show me.  </li>
            <li> Alos gives me a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I don&#x27;t remember having any complaints towards shipping, so it was probably good and not late.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice texture, no scent and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and works well as a lotion, but it has yet to get rid of my &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; as a lot of users said it would.</li>
            <li> Good luck with yours:)</li>
            <li> Fast service and excellent communication.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, than this might work nicely for you.</li>
            <li> Very effective for maintaining a smooth skin</li>
            <li> The immediate results were great, so I&#x27;m excited to see what happens after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This is my new best product for my head.  </li>
            <li> but im always searching for that *new* product that is going to do all these wonderful things!</li>
            <li> My forehead looks a lot more smooth and youthful and I&#x27;m happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the awesome forehead wrinkle-and I don&#x27;t notice much improvement, but that&#x27;s probably because I keep raising my eyebrows :)</li>
            <li> This is great Alpha Hydroxy lotion ~ non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, I discovered that if I used this lotion in conjunction with another brand of lotion I had from wal-mart it began to have a VERY strong ammonia scent.</li>
            <li> I love this day cream and am pleased that I ordered it with the night cream, what a deal!  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good for the keratitis, scars and blown spots!</li>
            <li> Out of all the products i have used to treat my acne marks, this is by far the best and the price is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I will update my review if this is no longer a good fit for my skin.  </li>
            <li> More effective with a loofah.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a scrub/lotion from KP and tend skin, but this is more effective for me.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly see the difference myself - even, healthy, younger-looking skin.</li>
            <li> At this % of glycolic acid, it&#x27;s also nice to not have to worry about neutralizing it afterwards and being able to just leave it on.</li>
            <li> The prince is really good and it works on my skin fantastic.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine a product being any more effective than this one.    </li>
            <li> Now my skin turned smooth and good.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion (10% Glycolic AHA)is one of the most effective beauty lotions (or creams) that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My skin is near perfect with use of this, it is defitnetly a cure all.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I read all the good reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest best kept secret to perfect skin.</li>
            <li> , I just apply a bit (more doesn&#x27;t means more effective)</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s priced nicely and why stop a good thing, right.</li>
            <li> Great for first time GA users like myself.</li>
            <li> The best treatment for blackheads, as well as general skin care.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve experienced much fewer breakouts!</li>
            <li> It is not expensive but works great.</li>
            <li> This product is very straightforward and highly effective as an anti-aging preventative and combatant when used in the morning: apply after cleansing, toning and serum (if you use one), and be SURE TO USE AN SPF as your grand finale.</li>
            <li> whatever that means--they&#x27;re not so fine to me!).</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get rid of fine lines as well, but this has had no effect on wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and I like the feel</li>
            <li> The lotion is very light</li>
            <li> After cleansing, toning and using the Hydroxy product my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> Use sunblock, very important.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how quickly it works!</li>
            <li> I had beautiful skin in high school, then broke out in college.</li>
            <li> As always, Alpha Hydrox is my favorite skin product.  </li>
            <li> lOVE</li>
            <li> But most of all, I feel that my skin is glowing and its almost like its added lost volume to my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks more supple and glowing and has evened out a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It works better than the designer products at triple the price.</li>
            <li> I think I pulled out more than 100 hairs over time....</li>
            <li> If you have a more darker complexion then you might want to have someone else find the ingrown hairs for you.</li>
            <li> More and more of my favorite products are going this way.  </li>
            <li> Probably to make way for the, \\&quot;latest thing\\&quot; products.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of lotion and moisturizers, and Alpha Hydrox works best for me.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because it goes on smoother and lighter</li>
            <li> The results are noticeably better/ more even toned with the souffle</li>
            <li> This product works better than ANY of my Rx acne treatments, and Proactive and Clinique acne regimens.    </li>
            <li> Compared to tretinoin creams, benzol peroxide cream, a sulfur cleanser, and solodyn pill, this lotion works better than all of those.</li>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> You can pay 4 to 5 times more on products that don&#x27;t hold a candle to this.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better product for the price.</li>
            <li> better than retin A</li>
            <li> Biggest fear is that it will be discontinued  Excellent value  Alternate using it at nite with a night cream.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years or more</li>
            <li> Love this lotion-</li>
            <li> and I am able to tolerate using this lotion every day.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> My complection has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because for more than 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this product</li>
            <li> This lotion has done what nothing else has ever been able to -- reduce the huge, gaping pores on my nose!  </li>
            <li> The side effects of petrolatum include: finding this product in breast tumors, suffocation of the skin, premature aging, aggravated acne and much more.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a scent which I greatly appreciate.Â Â  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels, too.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for more than this.</li>
            <li> and if anything changes for the better, I&#x27;ll adjust my review.</li>
            <li> and help prevent more from forming.    </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the results of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love Alpha Hydrox lotion.</li>
            <li> I can put sun screens or foundation (w/ SPF) on top of the Alpha Hydrox</li>
            <li> It is such an excellent deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to so many of my friends and family members, and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> I have done many chemical peels.</li>
            <li> love all the Alpha Hydrox products.  </li>
            <li> This product is just OK for me.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got better stuff for that already).</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s ok to put a moisturizer over it because I feel like I need</li>
            <li> :  Just needed to use more of it for it to be moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be purchasing again and am on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Please try this, as I have friends that love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> (There is a warning:))</li>
            <li> so I preferred cocoa butter more cheaper</li>
            <li> Within two weeks I was acne free!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe something so effective is so cheap.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that there are not too many chemicals that are harmful in this product compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also make sure to use sunblock/sunscreen when using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Did a test patch to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase anything stronger than 10%.</li>
            <li> But, be sure to heed the warnings about avoiding your lips</li>
            <li> Love this product I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I have people come up to me and ask me many times on what product I am using on my face.  </li>
            <li> Glad to find it at this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure heredity plays a part in that, as does sleeping each night hanging from the closet pole by my knees, but the Alpha Hydroxy hasn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> and I love them</li>
            <li> I would have gladly paid a lot more for this product, but please do not tell the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok for some people</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use it once or twice a day and always exfoliate while showering.</li>
            <li> love this 2 products!&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I love how it tingles.</li>
            <li> was then able to obtain my Hormone Cream again(Bio Identicals).</li>
            <li> up on how it plays into Skin Health &amp; so much more.  </li>
            <li> I love Alpha Hydrox</li>
            <li> if the sent would had been a lil better..</li>
            <li> and I am quite pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I look forward to more results after a week, two weeks, a month, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; acne treatments, and even prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I figured, it&#x27;s cheap, what do I have to lose?!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products because they work and they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> At night, I will apply the product slightly more generously.  </li>
            <li> At night, I will apply the product slightly more generously.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product at night in conjunction with my vitamin c cream in the morning my skin is looking so much better.</li>
            <li> It is so nice and light.</li>
            <li> This has made my acne much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I already have more wrinkles than I want and was looking for something to help with that problem.  </li>
            <li> I just want to prevent any more from growing.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone seeking a safer way of renewing their skin for a better looking you.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t magic but it is close to it.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still a favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it seems to stimulate blood flow, as ought to be the case if you&#x27;re scraping the top layers of your skin off, whether mechanically or chemically, and it has improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 bottles as I thought I would need certainly more than 1-2...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and won&#x27;t go without it agian</li>
            <li> There are better products out there.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> love it ....</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many cremes, lotions, scents, etc., but I can use this and have none of those problems.  </li>
            <li> most people think I\\&quot;m 35.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this before I ordered it as I do with most things I order from Amazon, and was overall impressed.  </li>
            <li> and I believe my skin is in better condition because of it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> If you plan on using it during the day, please make sure to apply sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s magic in a bottle, it&#x27;s this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do want to add that I use lots of beauty products, mostly the department store brands like shiseido, clinique, estee lauder, lancome, bobby brown, etc.  </li>
            <li> That being said if you have, then this is a really good peeler that leaves your skin smooth and oil free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all sorts of pricey face lotions and this is not only affordable but one of the best.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wash it off fingernails, all those acidy lotions tend to weaken them.</li>
            <li> Will be a life-long user :-)</li>
            <li> love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you are exfoliating your skin by washing.  </li>
            <li> I like this product and have purchased it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I heard the excitement about Alpha Hydroxy from my favorite entertainment/health info show of Dr. Oz.</li>
            <li> This bottle was the best value I could find after moderate searching on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So glad I ended up purchasing this.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion.  </li>
            <li> but when I started using this product my skin cleared up and has a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Besides working to eradicate/mitigate the bumps, it also helps my skin have a healthy, even tone.</li>
            <li> There are waaayy better products, like Bliss</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what this lotion would do but wanted to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - i use it on my body and face.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is better without tax and handling charges.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice too many differences</li>
            <li> I will probably order this product again when I run out, but that won&#x27;t be for quite a while :).</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not creamy but more like a gel-like substance like the face wash.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already worked 200% better than this.</li>
            <li> I hope my review is helpful to you:)</li>
            <li> And even better, it works for taking away these embarrassing bumps.</li>
            <li> A year ago I lost the top layer of the skin on my neck from glacial burn and it sometimes gets blotchy.</li>
            <li> Likewise, I make sure to wash my hands after applying the lotion</li>
            <li> I love AHA Lotion.</li>
            <li> This is 10% AHA in it which is the most percentage I&#x27;ve been able to find in a face lotion.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love how this product feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use in conjuction with the face wash for better results.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly as a spot treatment for my scars, for now, since I&#x27;m still fixing my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li> Oh well I am sure it will work anyway.</li>
            <li> overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used to use Kiss My Face&#x27;s Peaches &amp; Cream Moisturizer (no longer sold), and was glad to find Alpha Hydrox.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s OK to use a moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li> and I found something better instead.</li>
            <li> Glycolic acid is safe to use during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome under makeup and sunscreen, and alone or mixed with a body lotion (I use Ambi).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product and very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a year</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> But somehow I&#x27;m still quite confident that it will work.</li>
            <li> lotion hydrates therefore helps you smooth out your skin!</li>
            <li> I used many moisturizers, peels, creams, lotions, retinoids etc..</li>
            <li> but then after that it was way better.  </li>
            <li> or more for.</li>
            <li> I even use it all over my body for the same awesome results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  glad that I rediscovered this product.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for a year, I can see the difference, and I will purchase more when I need to.</li>
            <li> BUT, like most beauty products, it has dimethicone, which is an acne irritant.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the product</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and really works great.</li>
            <li> On a whim I tried to shave once more</li>
            <li> and I have never had better results with any product I have tried</li>
            <li> It was much more even in texture and color.</li>
            <li> I love this n</li>
            <li> it does everything they say it does couldn&#x27;t be more please with this product</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It has the most glycolic aha that I can find.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite lotion</li>
            <li> I started using the Acne.org regimen many years ago, and found that to be sufficient for the most part.</li>
            <li> I totally LOVE this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A+ :)</li>
            <li> I used it one night and in the morning had more breakouts</li>
            <li> I love this, and would sell my soul to have this at all times.</li>
            <li> and I think the 10% is doing a better job.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know which one of the products is doing a better job Avene or Alpha Hydrox or both working together.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for many years.  </li>
            <li> I originally tried using this on its own as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I originally got this for use on my face and didn&#x27;t see the kind of results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I think that this would go great for most people, except of course, somebody with a high sensitivity to glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent mild action.</li>
            <li> The side states that tingling, etc. is normal, but I experienced nothing.</li>
            <li> It is the best product I have ever used for keeping my face younger looking and free of most acne flareups.</li>
            <li> I give this product the top rating... and the price is right!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the best wrinkly type cream I;ve used but for the price, pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> I break out easily and this lotion helps me not to :-)</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me for cracked dry skin and worked wonderfully,</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a nice mild shine and is virtually scentless.</li>
            <li> Lemons are incredible for brightening my complexion, but it appears that this AHA lotion has the same effect; yay! :)</li>
            <li> weeks three and four it doesn&#x27;t really sting now and the flakiness is better , my skin looks good and my family has noticed and commented on it.</li>
            <li> But, if you know your skin, you&#x27;ll be fine:)</li>
            <li> It is the perfect way to reveal and maintain the beautiful skin one might have hidden below the old top layer.</li>
            <li> It burned alittle (tingled is probably more accurate).</li>
            <li> I started using it in my 20&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the reason why time has kind of stood still for my skin.</li>
            <li> This product for me is probably most important--</li>
            <li> Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne.</li>
            <li> and its doing great at fading some old scars.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell the Oil Free 10% formula is on my skin, which is one of my favorite things about the product, I was just hoping to add in some moisturizing effects as well</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Lotions I find is one of the better lotions available.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks more glowy and smooth now.</li>
            <li> Its so smooth I keep touching my face throughout the day, even though i know i shouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Great lotion, has helped clear up sebum in my pores around my T-zone and freshened up my face.</li>
            <li> In the morning I exfoliate with a light scrub and my skin always looks better than it did the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great and leaves face so soft when you wake up in the morning after putting it on at night.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my healthier diet didn&#x27;t contribute, but I&#x27;ve had a very stressful life and amconfident that I wouldn&#x27;t look this good without the Alpha Hydrox.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much real success with these department store brands in terms of improving skin quality.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt do much for deeper wrinkles or scaring, but over all a good product.</li>
            <li> It really does help the wrinkle thing and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion really feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very nice texture and soft.</li>
            <li> I will come back after we have been using for a while and will provide an update, hopefully a good one!</li>
            <li> i could easily see the hairs under my skin once the sunlight hit em.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it is easy to apply, it don&#x27;t irritate my skin and the smell is not noticeable.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Lotion is easy to apply and I like the way the bottle dispenses the product.Â  </li>
            <li> It has no detectable odor or smell, is not greasy and washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very mild smell.    </li>
            <li> It was easy to find a cleanser and lotion made by Alpha Hydrox on Amazon, so I figured I would try it.</li>
            <li> I have been following this regimen for 2 months and my skin looks and feels wonderful and fresh</li>
            <li> It goes on light and smooth and I wake up with much better looking skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see an improvement on my face, except that it gets very irritated and sensitive, don&#x27;t recommend if you have acne prone skin, is best to use beta hydroxy acid.</li>
            <li> and if I do get a spot it clears up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> So, listen up, I believe that AHA is a strong contributor to my skin looking as well as it does.  </li>
            <li> but it is not too strong.</li>
            <li> I recommend to take a break of 2 days if you feel it too strong for your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also strongly suggest doing the recommended spot patch test.</li>
            <li> After the first week I noticed amazing results.</li>
            <li> People always compliment me on my beautiful skin and they think I am 45-48, when I am actually 58.  </li>
            <li> I have consistently bought products regardless of price and find these to be as effective as any of the others that I have used</li>
            <li> my skin was so beautiful; all my friends wanted me to teach them how to have the same results.      </li>
            <li> Use in the morning for a beautiful glow under makeup or alone (but with sunscreen) and at night before going to sleep and you&#x27;ll see a big difference in your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes your skin kind of sting and itch when you first use it and that is because of the exfoliation, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s doing something which others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try because it seemed to have some good active ingredients at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Best treatment for keratosis Pilaris hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for dry skin which I have.  </li>
            <li> But I have definitely learned enough (esp from the doc) to know that not all the best and most effective products have to break the bank.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I still use and love use their face wash (sometimes you get special promos where the face-wash is free after buying the cream).</li>
            <li> I think it helps diminish fine lines and evens skin tone to some degree.</li>
            <li> Fine lines seem to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> I started noticing fine lines in my forehead</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a visible reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to be making my fine lines fade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that the fine lines on my forehead seem to be decreasing....</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t seemed to change my fine lines in anyway</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that this will decrease the fine lines and wrinkles that are coming in as I age.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO HELP WITH SOME FINE LINES ON MY FOREHEAD AND MY ACNE</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine by me, however, because I&#x27;d rather avoid getting wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has reduced the fine lines on my face, but it does have a moisturizing effect that gives my skin a dewy look.  </li>
            <li> Loyal customer from now on!</li>
            <li> If you have super stubborn skin &amp; cystic acne, you may need something more.</li>
            <li> With the additional glow he was wondering if I was pregnant!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only $10, it lasts a good while, and it may have an incredible effect on your acne situation and your face&#x27;s glow in general.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very economical, the lotion formula is easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores.</li>
            <li> The best &amp; most reasonable I have ever used, I live in Florida  and have sum baked skin , really helped .</li>
            <li> I love alpha hydroxy &amp; it&#x27;s getting hard to find - best one I ever used was taken out of production so I&#x27;ll be comparing closely with this one</li>
            <li> but I see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I didnt suffer from the HUGE type of razor bumps....</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t use it that much because I feel the serum does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin, but the combination of the two products has made a huge difference in my life.</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels nice and light.</li>
            <li> After having used the product for about 3 weeks, i see huge improvements on skin color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of AHA products and I&#x27;ve used a variety of them.</li>
            <li> I have acne all over my face, blackheads and huge cysts.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and seems to reduce lines.  </li>
            <li> Wish this came as an oil free product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different strengths of AHA&#x27;s for years and have great looking skin.</li>
            <li> mine were puss filled pimple sized razor bumps; but I had a bunch of em&#x27;.   </li>
            <li> And like I stated before Im light brown, so</li>
            <li> and i am already seeing great improvements in the texture, tone and the overall health of my face.</li>
            <li> amazing line of products; inexpensive and very efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d avoid using it on the face, but as a therapeutic body lotion it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> But honestly, I don&#x27;t care that much.  </li>
            <li> AHA products are an important part of skin care.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how great this moisturizer is, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I use this every night after I wash my face, and my skin looks fantastic (if i do say so...)</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin smooth and unlined.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic lotion.</li>
            <li> Functions as light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Skin is now smooth and shimmers in the light,,lol.  </li>
            <li> I started using this again at night and the oil free in the day.</li>
            <li> I like it a great deal and have noticed a difference in my skin since I have been using it for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoy this product along with the Night Replenishing CrÃ¨me.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was lightly scented as I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> Light weight lotion with glycolic acid..</li>
            <li> , after using this product daily for about two months, my skin looks great:</li>
            <li> Overall a great product</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and free from spots.</li>
            <li> Use it for smooth arms and...</li>
            <li> this product seems to cause break outs and just seems cheap..</li>
            <li> The aha lotion is whats important, its like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve teamed this up with Stridex in the Red Box, Vanicream Cleansing Bar, Vanicream Lite Moisturizer, and Aquaphor with great results.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it says it is odor free on the bottle</li>
            <li> use it every day and it appears to smooth my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> used this product before having bought it in a retail drugstore but then could not find it till I saw it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Happy it&#x60;s available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed each time I notice how smooth my arms are, now.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I use it primarily on my body...</li>
            <li> so it is light and does not break me out.</li>
            <li> Cheap and it works!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Makes my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> cheap, if not i go here.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly smooth to touch and</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth both on my face as well as bumpy parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin on face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> it is so cheap</li>
            <li> And my acne has cleared up!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> However I received it and started using it as a night time facial lotion, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My face feels ridiculously smooth too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, but not too sensitive</li>
            <li> This lotion is good too as a first AHA lotion, if you want to go on to a stronger AHA product higher than a 10% solution.  </li>
            <li> With religious use it is good at smoothing the skin, but don&#x27;t look to it for a magical acne treatment as some have suggested.</li>
            <li> Buy it for boyfriend, and he says it smells good and natural.</li>
            <li> It is too  early for me to fairly rate the performance of the product.  </li>
            <li> I also got free face wash with every bottle of aha lotion I purchased - their face wash is nice too, but really any ph balanced one will do.</li>
            <li> Good for mature skin to fight wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Great product works better than expected  </li>
            <li> So Far so good.</li>
            <li> For people with sensitive skin it may not be too good.</li>
            <li> the best which really showed a big improvement on my skin</li>
            <li> This brand is a good choice because it is cost effective (also usually available at local pharmacy) and the right pH balance in order for the glycolic acid to maintain efficacy.</li>
            <li> Yep, that&#x27;s right, about 20 years, maybe more.  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands of Alpha Hydroxy Lotions and this one is very good and does what it is supposed too.  </li>
            <li> She will repurchase - something she very rarely does - Unbeatable</li>
            <li> The lotion is smooth going on, and it&#x27;s tingly, light weight, not pasty, and feels clean.  </li>
            <li> Very important, ESP at higher altitudes.</li>
            <li> My face looks so clean &amp; feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> My new favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended on a popular TV show and after using it for months, I agree.  </li>
            <li> This one is very reasonably priced and a much better deal on Amazon.Â Â  </li>
            <li> It is very reasonably priced and works better than skin products triple the price.</li>
            <li> Good product but not quite strong enough.</li>
            <li> hence I was able to notice my skin tone changing within the first 2 months.   </li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy it after reading all these rave reviews.</li>
            <li> i was familiar with the product before I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It smooths and exfoliates with a higher glycolic content than most over the counter alpha hydrox products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Overall I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> Smooths, lightens mild hyper-pigmentation, reduces the appearance of fine lines, and brightens.</li>
            <li> It is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed with the lotion alone, however.   </li>
            <li> Definately worth the money!</li>
            <li> helped to make skin texture more consistent.  </li>
            <li> but no where else but so worth it!</li>
            <li> Also, I know it is a small thing, but the popover lid is perfect!</li>
            <li> I love how it feels when I first put it on because I can feel tingling</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> my skin feels so much better, and I prefer the higher percentage of AHA.  </li>
            <li> I did notice some &amp;#34;expelling&amp;#34; when I first started (more acne)</li>
            <li> I originally wrote this review, I was using this morning and night.</li>
            <li> It is VERY important to stay out of the sun, as your face is much more sensitive to the sun&#x27;s rays when using the Alpha Hydrox lotion.</li>
            <li> I went searching online for more ideas, and to my surprise, found this on Acne.org&#x27;s website with pretty unanimous acclaim (which is impressive since acne &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; seem to be very hit-and-miss).</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and absorbs fairly quick into the skin.Â  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and applied the lotion to a clean face, morning and night.</li>
            <li> I use this every night after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li> apply at night (you must wait atleast 30 mins after showering to apply, or else it will sting) with a clean t-shirt on.</li>
            <li> And because it is a lotion and not containing tiny granules that would scratch the skin, it is more effective.</li>
            <li> Proof - my boyfriend who already thinks I have amazing skin actually commented that it was looking even better.</li>
            <li> I quickly found that it was important to follow instructions when using this product, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re looking for a deep moisturizer and to calm redness</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really works or really did anything good for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try after reading many of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> For the price you can certainly give it a shot--just don&#x27;t expect a meaningful difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li> this is the right product for you!</li>
            <li> Put it on after shower and it soaks right in!</li>
            <li> That product worked very nicely on my face and no new breakouts have occurred.</li>
            <li> Nothing special - but not bad either.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this lotion because I absolutely love Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s Oil Free 10% Formula, but I don&#x27;t like the way this lotion feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the smooth feeling skin and the reducing of the dark marks on my skin.</li>
            <li> It arrived in great condition and when it was expected.</li>
            <li> Good product for daily maintenance.</li>
            <li> As a retired hairdresser I have some training in skin care and the Alpha Hydrox line is effective and modestly priced.</li>
            <li> This way the lotion is at full  strength, not the slightest bit diluted.    </li>
            <li> I feel this  keeps my skin looking fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does take about 2 weeks before I see the full effect.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised that something so inexpensive is so effective</li>
            <li> The one in the picture seems \\&quot;newer\\&quot; - newer, more modern packaging and font.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many over the counter washes, gels, creams and on and on to get rid of the acne, but haven&#x27;t had much luck.  </li>
            <li> and I liked how soft it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> Skin was smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> I bought this lotion with retinal cream and mixed them , this way I could have a really good lotion to attack strech mRks</li>
            <li> I would IMA medium like complected African-American male ( like meagan good or somethin)</li>
            <li> many yrs ago when it was really inexpensive for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made the skin peel, so this must be an OK product for a gentle effect if you don&#x27;t want you skin peeling.</li>
            <li> Good stuff especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Cant be sure if its really working</li>
            <li> i know the title sounds campy, but it is so true.  </li>
            <li> my skin feels smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> Good lotion when mixed with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but would prefer if there wasn&#x27;t any toxic ingredients......</li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> --I cleanse with the Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash (which is very mild) using a Clarisonic brush and follow up with the AHA enhanced lotion, a specialized eye cream duo from Avon and then an Aveeno moisturizer for sensitive skin on top.</li>
            <li> Clean, smooth and soft skin you&#x27;ll love.</li>
            <li> I can go to the higher percentage easily.</li>
            <li> This product keeps skin clear, bright and blimish free, I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a product that works effectively to reduce fine lines and smooths out skin.</li>
            <li> While other people reported great results, I did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I am older woman and would like more alpha hydroxy in product</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> week ago, my husband said out of the blue -- &#x27;you know, your skin really looks great&#x27;</li>
            <li> I never had these results so quickly.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> After washing with a mild non-soap cleanser, I put on the AHA Enhanced Lotion before bed and took my niacin and zinc supplements.  </li>
            <li> The mild sting that is noticeable on application will subside with continued use and is not an allergy.</li>
            <li> It does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> My pores seem smaller and this works great under your makeup because it seems to really make it go on smoother.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there is a mild burning sensation after I apply the lotion, but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I used this product years ago, but as I got older, I thought I needed more help for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> It always absorbs into my skin fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> but the next day looks so much better love it</li>
            <li> The product keeps your skin smooth and soft (you can feel it) and my moisturizer seems to work better after this cream.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday use :-)</li>
            <li> I did not perform the \\&quot;patch test\\&quot; as recommended for this product and this resulted in a reaction on my neck which feels a bit like a mild chemical burn.</li>
            <li> It is mild and does not feel greasy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It took days to heal, it hurt like hell, and he said I was incredibly lucky</li>
            <li> This product definitely has a nice feel to it,  it helps keep my skin on my face smooth -</li>
            <li> Now, none of us should have high hopes that an over-the-counter wrinkle remover will make a meaningful difference.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My face looked really smooth in the morning when I first woke up...until I had to wash it again and reapply the lotion.</li>
            <li> Great for removing dark spots and hyper-pigmented scars.</li>
            <li> This is helping my skin become more normal again.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> Let me start my \\&quot;story\\&quot; by saying I\\&quot;m a black woman, age 47 and have always had great skin. .</li>
            <li> You get a lot for your money with this lotion, I  use a nickel sized amount for my face, it covers my whole face easily.</li>
            <li> blackheads have diminished, no change in fine lines, and pores are still large though look diminished somewhat.</li>
            <li> Maybe in a couple of more months I&#x27;ll look younger and more radiant ;).</li>
            <li> bit of background: I was originally scared to try it at first bc</li>
            <li> Maybe this is an allergic reaction, there&#x27;s a first time for everything!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more than surprised!</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m still just n&#x3D;1, and after my amazing result I turned some friends onto this product, and their results have been less striking,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and it glides on, absorbing quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and have had bouts of mild to moderate acne since I was 15, so you can imagine how nice it is to look at yourself in the mirror after 13 years and see a face that doesn&#x27;t make you upset.</li>
            <li> I laugh at lot, and because of this I have two large fine lines surrounding the sides of my lips.</li>
            <li> Or, at the very least, I thought that my acne was just a fact of life and that The Regimen was the best I could do.  </li>
            <li> I first heard about this on Dr. Oz and ordered it right away!</li>
            <li> WELL, this product made a hugely noticable difference in my sensitive, problematic, acne-prone skin the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li> this works great ,removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> and although alpha hydrox is not a cure all it really helped smooth out my skin and control my acne.</li>
            <li> and I think it works really well to smooth my skin and help with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, especially considering how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li> My face, however, has not had any suchreaction; in fact, I have noticed really great results in just a few weeks time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps make my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> In 1 week of using it religiously, I saw amazing results.</li>
            <li> For me, this lotion improved the tone and made me look - and most importantly feel - younger.  </li>
            <li> and I am already white and fair complected and didn&#x27;t really want to get any lighter, but</li>
            <li> but it was well worth the reward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to stick with it.</li>
            <li> stings a bit, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Nothing else I have tried has made my skin clear and healthy like Alpha Hydrox.  </li>
            <li> And I rarely get breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product, I thought, deserved it.</li>
            <li> For my skin, this product on its own would not provide enough moisturizer.Â Â  </li>
            <li> the supplements I&#x27;m taking also have had a noticeable effect, noted before I started using this lotion, so I can&#x27;t say that my acne success is 100% because of AHA...</li>
            <li> my eye and smile lines softened as well.      </li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> My skin is also smoother and more soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> But maybe it&#x27;s working because I feel a distinct tingle.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s your first time using a dedicated AHA cream/lotion, it&#x27;s important that you do a patch test first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for five years, including the more intense glycolic cream, and it is definitely responsible for preserving my &amp;#34;youth&amp;#34; fo&#x27; sho&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I still say try it if you have more mature skin or experience with glycolic</li>
            <li> I use a different kind of product with anti-oxidents at night before night cream.</li>
            <li> All areas exposed to sunlight during the day MUST be covered with sunscreen, as this lotion makes your skin more sensitive to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I am not afraid to use it on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> This is great to use if you suffer from hyperpigmentation from old acne &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; and also removes damaged top layer dead skin to reveal</li>
            <li> I hope this product doesn&#x27;t break my sensitive skin out, but I will update when more time has passed.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and have tried many products that didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> and he has tried many things to avoid the rash and nothing has stopped it and lotions to clear it up.  </li>
            <li> Honey is great for the skin and is a natural antibiotic for skin wounds when applied topically.</li>
            <li> After just 2 weeks my skin already seems more &#x27;glowy&#x27; and alive.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel and look soft and smooth and moist!</li>
            <li> Once it has been absorbed, I put a SPF</li>
            <li> so soft and has faded many acne scars.</li>
            <li> Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> almost expected they would have changed/cheapened the formulation over the years, but surprisingly, they have not.</li>
            <li> If you feel burning or itching more than 20 minutes after application, you&#x27;re either sensitive or allergic and you should stay away!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is totally great stuff, and although it says \\&quot;for normal to dry skin\\</li>
            <li> The price is just right and the quantity is definitely worth the bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Daily use of AHA is supposed to be the singularly best thing that one can do for one&#x27;s skin other than using moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I went through my first bottle so quickly -</li>
            <li> would good advice from other owners/users of this product)</li>
            <li> I use this product once a day on non shaving days and twice a day 24 hours after a shave (right after I shave I rub my face with a alum block....</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a step in the right direction.    </li>
            <li> The price is right, too.  </li>
            <li> , I wonder if it even has the right ingredients.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it can&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist and I saw it right away.</li>
            <li> I saw signs of it working right away</li>
            <li> Stings a bit, but that means it&#x27;s working right?  </li>
            <li> The price is right, shipped on time and wrapped well.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it right away.</li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> I put it on right before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I noticed improved skin appearance right away.  </li>
            <li> I know, hands off, right?)</li>
            <li> If you have a pimple forming you can catch it and stop it by putting this right on the area 1-2 times a day.</li>
            <li> On a fluke I ordered the Alpha Hydrox because as noted the reviews were positive and I figured what the heck;-&gt;!</li>
            <li> The amazing thing is, I can actually see results in my skin even after the first couple of times I used it.</li>
            <li> Looking younger is never a bad thing :)</li>
            <li> Amalactin is another possible choice, but that one uses an ammonia-based acid that has a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, be sure to sign up for email notifications from their website because when they have sales, they tend to be major.</li>
            <li> This particular one got great reviews that seemed genuine, unlike the usual drivel when it comes to skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> My previous favorite was the Bald Guyz items but this seems better.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer here noted, if you purchase the Alpha Hydrox products from their own website, you DO get it for slightly cheaper (with free shipping), esp if buying packages.</li>
            <li> i rarely get a pimple, but when i do, they seem very superficial and disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> This Cream Works Great, Brightens Up Your Face And Removes Dead Skin Cells!</li>
            <li> I really do love this product and  credit it with my skin being clear and limiting some of the lovely redness that my Irish skin is prone to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good: it smoothens the skin, eliminates dark spots, skin is radiant.</li>
            <li> I started noticing fine lines between my eyebrows and this helped clear it in a month!</li>
            <li> Even so, CR was quick to point out that NONE of the creams or serums, as they are oft called, made much of a difference.     </li>
            <li> No, this lotion will not make your lines go away entirely, but I have been happy to note that it seems to have turned back the clock on my skin by five years or so.  </li>
            <li> am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products.  </li>

            <li> It would be great as a body wash if it didn&#x27;t leave any residue (it only leaves a gross taste) or as a once a day application where people who prefer nighttime could do that, or I would put it on in the morning and then apply my makeup when it dries.    </li>
            <li> Luckily,  I found it at Amazon at reasonable prize.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of creams and at-home treatments to improve my skin, but most products either severely dried it out, made me break out, or did nothing.</li>
            <li> Be sure to avoid eyes, eylids, nostrils, and lips as much as you can; these are sensitive areas that you don&#x27;t want to touch with this lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very soft and smooth on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only after a full cycle that you will see full and true results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy, no unpleasant scent, and really does produce a smoother, clearer skin.     </li>
            <li> The delivery is very fast........</li>
            <li> I have been using the product and like it very much.</li>
            <li> its very gentle.</li>
            <li> Probably a good product for people in their 20&#x27;s but other than that, it&#x27;s not gonna make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician told me to use a product that contained glycolic acid to help slough off the dead skin cells and get rid of the bumps, so I went ahead and bought this product because it is very reasonably priced and seemed to have good reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to turn cells over to reveal new cells, but not so strong that I cannot use it nightly if I wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> finally something that actually works at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> Amazingly, this product gives me results matching those of products which I&#x27;ve spent $100.</li>
            <li> many of my friends tell me SOMETHING is working to make me look younger than my years!  </li>
            <li> Worked better than an Rx for a topical antibiotic or pill.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have tried an AHA that I picked up from a local store before, and I find this works much better.</li>
            <li> I put a lot of it on first thing in the morning, and let my skin soak up the pudding aspect of it.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just the first day</li>
            <li> Im so happy and slowly regaining confidence.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it.  </li>
            <li> Got it pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I used to use this many years ago (in my 20&#x27;s) and only stopped because I could no longer find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin glowy, clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I WILL definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> I like to use it all over the body, so prefer larger sizes (6oz or more).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s most definitely helped!)  </li>
            <li> Smells nice but takes awhile to sink into skin, face feels wet for awhile.</li>
            <li> Now, despite my experimental nature, I have been using Alpha Hydrox lotion for over 20 years, pimple free, and am turning 59.  </li>
            <li> It made my face red and made all my imperfections stand out more.</li>
            <li> I just moved and haven&#x27;t been using his consistently.</li>
            <li> Or even washing my face consistently.</li>
            <li> I use it only once a day, at night and recommmend a spf of 30 or better during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  a total scheptic regarding most anti aging pitches but a friend suggested I try it.  </li>
            <li> At first this made my skin oily when using at night.</li>
            <li> First, the smell is pretty off putting, but that&#x27;s not the deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> First application to face</li>
            <li> but many folks think I am in my mid 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I find that my skin feels better than it has in years, and am hopeful that it will provide enough moisture during the winter</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It stings when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> Everything that we know that is in this product, does exactly as it&#x27;s suppose to.  </li>
            <li> The texture of my skin feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I was already Hot Compressing &amp; using the Neutragena Microderm Abrasion system &amp; then a Hyaluronic Acid Serum/Peptide combo(Dry Face but Pores</li>
            <li> This helped even more after a week back using it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> And it is still keeping my face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> At first, I was using it along with another product in the Alpha Hydrox line, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> More recently, I began doing some reading on alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs).  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.    </li>
            <li> And he&#x27;s the type that waits till the very last minute to do things, or not even bother most of the time.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first thing that&#x27;s made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I really like it and use it every day!</li>
            <li> I have been acne free finally after years of trying many products and natural solutions.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s important to wait until the natural oils from the skin return before applying any product.</li>
            <li> I first moisturize my face with Aveeno and then apply AHA.I use Kaya sunscreen when going out in Sun. &#x27;</li>
            <li> Last summer, I would use it without putting any moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try using it more regularly on my cheeks to see if it will help diminish the freckling in that area.  </li>
            <li> Love Alpha Hydrox products and this is no different.  </li>
            <li> I was considering using a steroid cream, but decided to try AHA first after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years &amp; love it as daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I will continue to use the bottle and report back after more time.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be doing its job, my skin is soft and smooth and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it before bed on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and make sure to wash it off the next day</li>
            <li> It stings a bit at first</li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t blend well into the skin.</li>
            <li> It did exactly like it promised.</li>
            <li> In fact this 6 oz lotion was first sold as a &#x27;body lotion&#x27; when they first came out with it.</li>
            <li> I have always had acne and this has helped so much!</li>
            <li> Eventhough I have only been using this product for a few months, I really like that it keeps my skin hydrated perfectly.</li>
            <li> It smells funny.</li>
            <li> and it is my first AHA product to use ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I started out using the Alpha Hydrox pads which have a higher percentage of glycolic acid</li>
            <li> Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shrink my pores exactly...</li>
            <li> I dont remember when exactly I bought it</li>
            <li> I bought this product the first time in Walgreen&#x27;s, but in Amazon I found it cheaper.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels at first</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen religiously and make every effort to keep my face out of the sun--even more so with this product.</li>
            <li> I have hyper pigmentation and lots of acne scars around my cheek and chin area and this product has lightened those areas a lot since I have first used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just gone back to my 3x a week routine and my skins gotten alot better.</li>
            <li> I found it to work after about a week of using it daily, but if I skip two days or more, the bumps return.</li>
            <li> i wash off all my makeup, rinse with hot water and pack on the lotion like a mask.</li>
            <li> Within the first day I noticed my face clearing up.</li>
            <li> And it is not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really inexpensive!</li>
            <li> This is the first AHA product that I bought.</li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> : I bought this at Amazon at first but had to go elsewhere when the price went up.</li>
            <li> Within the first couple of days I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> when i first began using, i was getting hormonal cysts across my cheek each month.</li>
            <li> When you first start using it, it will make you peel a bit though.  </li>
            <li> Then I try this stuff, based on reviews, and for the first time in my life the results were 100% unambiguous.  </li>
            <li> So this is all to say that I&#x27;m pretty sold on this product.  </li>
            <li> It dries nicely on my face and absolutely is NOT greasy.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I noticed it lightened my scars when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I remembered how WELL it helped me the first time and just stuck with it.</li>
            <li> AHA gave me such better results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard good things about glycolic acid as a really thorough exfoliator, which can help cut down on acne.  </li>
            <li> wow!!!!</li>
            <li> I definitely feel like this helps the other products I use work more effectively, e.g. and acne scar cream I am using 4)</li>
            <li> how ironic right?</li>
            <li> and I also don&#x27;t like the smell too much but putting on right before bed</li>
            <li> used for years as general skin care, very mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35, have really great skin (especially considering a history of wine and cigarettes), and have spent boatloads of money on skincare products&amp;#60;&amp;#60;not</li>
            <li> it really enhanced my completion even  tone skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I use Benzoyl Peroxide 10% from clean and clear every morning and night and this lotion after that every morning and night.</li>
            <li> As a result of this lotion and the clean and clear</li>
            <li> This helped clear it again!!&lt;br /&gt;Now 2 weeks after its reintroduction, my skin is clearing back up, is WAY softer, and has an amazing glow.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally really dry and with this product I get clear even ash free skin :)</li>
            <li> I love this whole line of skin care and have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when I do, I have been using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when I do, I have been using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> old, since using this my skin glows, my cheeks are naturally rosy, my skin tone is evening out and my pores look better.  </li>
            <li> It is better than salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide..especially for very stubborn pimples, and for a low price..</li>
            <li> My favorite as it really does help me look younger!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for the general appearance of my skin and seems to have cut down on the cystic acne problem.</li>
            <li> More than that, the treatment side skin was overall smoother to the touch, which is a nice little bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a positive change in my skin texture after just one night of use, and I&#x27;ve continued using as directed ever since without any problems.</li>
            <li> Nothing in all my years ever gave a positive result.  </li>
            <li> In addition to being acne free, my scars also seem to be fading and my general skin tone is improved.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re consistent in using it, and I do so twice a day, it works and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it for that long on my face, as I use Tretinoin most evenings.</li>
            <li> I waited a LONG time before writing this review because I wanted to be REALLY sure that this product was working for me.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy and hope it even does more in the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products like this, I&#x27;m 41 and have minor signs of aging around my eyes and forehead.  </li>
            <li> well, at first i didnt think it was doing a whole lot.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, after using it for a while it will start working on those small wrinkles your trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I have used Alpha Hydrox products in the past and I always loved them.</li>
            <li> in my 30s had a full break out of \\&quot;adult hormonal acne\\</li>
            <li> This is great for dry skin or a dry patch.</li>
            <li> Very good for moisturizing and a little bit goes a long way !</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s a good alternative to apricot scrubs as the scrubs can be very harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Also my mineral make up didn&#x27;t blend well over the top even after I waited for it to dry on my face.</li>
            <li> It leave my skin super soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> My forehead is usually dry but its much better now after using this.</li>
            <li> But this year, I use an additional moisturizer on top of the lotion because my skin always felt dry with just the Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion.  </li>
            <li> The offensive odor doesn&#x27;t linger overly long, it&#x27;s mostly gone within 15-30 minutes, but it really takes away from the enjoyment of this</li>
            <li> (I have always had dry skin but not too many wrinkles)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more of a dry greasy feeling if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Make sure your face is dry before putting it on.</li>
            <li> like any mask i only use it twice a week, because this stuff is strong.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue this routine and strongly recommend both products.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wait 10 minutes after you wash your face to be certain your skin is completely dry.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I found it does:  SHRINKS LARGE PORES  </li>
            <li> A large amount comes in this bottle.</li>
            <li> Also may cause certain clothing to discolor.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly buy from this seller again.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;ll help to reduce my large pore size and acne.</li>
            <li> We will certainly order this product again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for dry, rough, or flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I used to have cystic acne all over my right cheeck and jawline, thankfully my dermatoligist put me on a new prescription regime.</li>
            <li> I have used many (much more expensive) skin care brands in the past, but none are this consistently great for my skin.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t give this product a low rating because it \\&quot;didn&#x27;t remove your fine lines\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is my first alpha hydroxyl product I&#x27;ve ever used, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, other than lotions and creams, but I think this works much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they came up with a product for people with dry skin!</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my skin is firmer, &amp; fine lines appear to be fading.</li>
            <li> I would say a good way to use it is get a good facial brush, cleanse your face, apply this lotion in a thick layer and let it settle in, then use dampen your brush and brush your face in circular motions, rinse, pat dry and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have light skin and was hoping this would help with uneveness and smooth out the little marks.</li>
            <li> It does a good job to exfoliate dull skin and minimize the look of age spots.</li>
            <li> and it has made a significant difference in reducing both new breakouts and the reddish/scarred appearance of old acne.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores, I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product because it makes my skin soft, clear, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Lemons work great, but they are sort of messy and gross, and I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my skin while I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and so much clearer and younger looking.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for about a week, and I already see a  huge difference.</li>
            <li> It made my face very itchy and greasy.</li>
            <li> and i do not break out much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to eliminate some post acne marks that I had and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that you cannot use it every night because since it is not oil free, it will cause some acne to come out -</li>
            <li> It has really helped my teens w/ their blemishes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought this 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Then my children&#x27;s nanny said that I look really refreshed and</li>
            <li> really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it STUNG SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> but glycolic producs didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks what a relief</li>
            <li> You can really feel this lotion tingle for skin changes.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t really comment because I stopped using this after a week.</li>
            <li> I have smooth asian skin</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be real, they&#x27;re never going to go away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very oily and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I was really amazed and couldn&#x27;t believe the results</li>
            <li> I am going to start using the lotion on my entire body because I am enjoying the soft texture and glowing appearance of my face and neck so much.    </li>
            <li> Have used this for years and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging is not fancy, so the price reflects the product, and is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I think that it clarifies the skin and gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any breakouts, which i used to have occasionally, and my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> If you want to see real results, you have to do a TCA peel.</li>
            <li> This lotion in okay, not greasy, not very moisturising either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I did use it, it was somewhat sticky, stung a bit, and I did not notice much in terms of effect or benefit from it.</li>
            <li> If you have these problems too or just want baby-butt-soft skin without spending too much money then this is your lotion.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Holds my tan longer, and looks so much nicer.</li>
            <li> What I really dislike is the watery texture and</li>
            <li> I would not advise anyone who wants to buy this for kp, it didn&#x27;t work for me........</li>
            <li> skin is so much softer since I have used this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is much clearer and smoother because of it.  </li>
            <li> My face just stung, did not see much results as hoped.</li>
            <li> Works fast.</li>
            <li> i really dont think it helped much for me</li>
            <li> no matter how much lotion or olive oil</li>
            <li> She has recommended to several of her friends and they all think its really fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I had a friend ask me if I was applying my makeup differently because my face looked like it was glowing and smooth.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, but my shaving is extremely smooth for some reason with the same old blade which most times i get bumps.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say that it helped my acne that much.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply much of this product.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, I will use only a tiny amount of the product (or sometimes skip it altogether), and on top, I will use [[ASIN:B001PV6ONK Olay Complete Lotion for Combination Skin with SPF 15 - 6 oz.]], which contains a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA; salicylic acid) and also SPF, which is important when using AHAs because of increased sun sensitivity.  </li>

            <li> It also really reduced the redness and bumps</li>
            <li> &quot; I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> He loves it so much that he&#x27;s been ordering a bottle before running out.  </li>
            <li> and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliates without irritation.</li>
            <li> So far this lotion has been worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> almost a models face my skin has been clearing up really fast everything evening out on my face and my neck</li>
            <li> HAven&#x27;t really noticed much of a change, if any.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quicky after ordered.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve held off reviewing this for a few months until I could make sure it wasn&#x27;t going to make my skin breakout as is the standard with most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t have much hope for this</li>
            <li> Now, I use AHA every night and my skin is baby smooth, pores are smaller, my makeup goes on and wears evenly.</li>
            <li> I really like this and will be sticking with it.</li>
            <li> my whole face started to itch.</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works.</li>
            <li> Face is much softer than before.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice it until the Spring of 2011.  </li>
            <li> I notice a tingling feeling when I apply it, but I haven&#x27;t seen too much reduction in wrinkles, but my post acne scars are fading.</li>
            <li> but it is very dupable for the silky results you get.</li>
            <li> I use it on my back that is acne free and have noticed that my scars are not as noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy the entire line if Alpha product.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the skin very well.</li>
            <li> Now I know what real acne is</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I can tell a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff will really transform your skin.</li>
            <li> my skin appears much brighter.</li>
            <li> this stuff did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> It is very soothing once it dries.</li>
            <li> Very soon you will see the difference on your skin.</li>
            <li> This product has really improved my skin texture and feel.  </li>
            <li> it works really well for the bumps brought on by keratosis pilaris.  </li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> Seems to really keep my skin hydrated and helps with my acne.</li>
            <li> (is that a real word?).  </li>
            <li> It does seem to soften my skin, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my&lt;br /&gt;dark spots.</li>
            <li> But I started using it on my body and this lotion really works.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really nothing that &#x27;hurts&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I did break out on my neck and wonder if I had just put too much on.  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> This product has helped so much for my arms, legs and face.</li>
            <li> I have quit using when I ran out, and have not noticed much of a difference in my skin since.  </li>
            <li> I cant tell its really doing much.</li>
            <li> but it still felt very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hands at night and it really softens them, though.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> It has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this - it really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Not too much.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see much result from using this cream</li>
            <li> I put it on every night and have not seen much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> I also have very oily skin, and my acne is going away.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li> I already have a fairly intense routine to keep everything in check- 3 step cleanser, toner, and medicated lotion twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast this started working.</li>
            <li> The person using this product in our house says it it working very well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and</li>
            <li> I started using it to get ready to start using acid peels.</li>
            <li> Since I still had the whole bottle, I decided to use this as my night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The scarring I had on my face is so much lighter.</li>
            <li> I have really oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I justlove this so much.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my skin feel, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Certainly there are stronger products, this is a very inexpensive way to achieve maintenence</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this..</li>
            <li> And the price is certainly reasonable.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I apply it to spots in the morning and leave it on all day, and apply it to my whole face at night.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product didn&#x27;t really agree with my face.</li>
            <li> but they really are.</li>
            <li> The sun damage on my skin is really beginning to show.  </li>
            <li> I really regret being a &#x27;sun worshiper&#x27;, but it is what it is.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect form this product, as I&#x27;ve read the reviews</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a visible change in wrinkle reduction around my eyes, but I have almost gone through the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> much much</li>
            <li> i really like dr graf</li>
            <li> I tried it for a whole week and let me tell you</li>
            <li> just dont really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I order many items for friends- my male friend (80 years young), stands by this product 100%.</li>
            <li> the reason for my nice skin at this point, as I&#x27;ve tried and failed with many, so I owe a lot to genes and the fact that I now see a doctor for my skincare needs and use a couple of [pricey] products from Switzerland.</li>
            <li> But otherwise, this helped with acne on my back, what i think might be kp on my shoulders, and seems to enhance any moisturization i do on the following days, which is nice in the winter.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are fading, and more radiant skin is evident.  </li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product, and I definitely think it is effective against wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> That beats Proactive/Neutrogena/Clean&amp;Clear Kits a $20 per month regimen, by far!!!</li>
            <li> I will never waste money on another face washing product or kit again!!!</li>
            <li> I received this last night and washed first with a mild soap then a Glytone Body wash with a loofah.  </li>
            <li> As the other reviews note, your skin will break out for roughly two weeks or so, but it will look great after that.</li>
            <li> Had really dark spots from sun damage on my face..honestly less than 2 weeks there was a significant change; some are almost completely faded and it&#x27;s great for acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried kits from Proactive, Neutrogena, clean and clear, and a few more.</li>
            <li> I have found that this product works very well, better than any other lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is a good price, as some of the aha products don&#x27;t have the potency of this, and are 3 to 5 times more expensive!</li>
            <li> In fact, I still see them and possibly more due to smiling and laughing so much.</li>
            <li> I have loved this lotion for years, but use it as a body lotion instead of just a facial lotion when my skin is especially dry.  </li>
            <li> would say that the appearance of stretch marks is still the same, but for the price of the bottle this is definitely worth it for combating cellulite!</li>
            <li> Does burn a little when you first use it but goes away with more uses / time on after you use it.</li>
            <li> I posted my original review last year, Sep. 2012.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I use it on top of a serum as a moisturizer, other times i just use this alone</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in the overall feel and texture of my skin through this routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> none the less, it is an amazing product that will definitely make your skin smoother and make you LOOK YOUNGER :-)  </li>
            <li> So far, I find it light, but it makes my skin look better (less old looking).  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they were overwhelmingly positive but having spent most my adult life (I&#x27;m 45 now) lavishing $150 brand name lotions on my face, I didn&#x27;t expect much from something that costs under $15.  </li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use, this lotion made no considerable changes in the fine line on my face.</li>
            <li> My face started looking healthier and more radiant within a few days after first using.</li>
            <li> On my face, it felt tighter and better the first few days.</li>
            <li> It helps the skin to exfoliate the old skin making it fresh and new looking.  </li>
            <li> It super moisturizes my skin, leaves it really soft and young.</li>
            <li> high concentration of active ingredients, no fragrance or coloring; i&#x27;m using the entire line-without a doubt beats high end brands like Peter Roth whose products are quite fascinating</li>
            <li> I have a tan, olive complexion, good skin, but wanted to smooth out my pores and see if it would remove some small dark spots.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear for the first time since my teens.</li>
            <li> It didnt drastically lighten my skin, I can stil see some dark spots, but it looks 1000x better than what it looked like before.</li>
            <li> Do use sunscreen and test first if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m pretty much a beauty product lazy bones, and prior to using these I rarely even washed my face before bed--reason being, that I doubted most products really DID much of anything.</li>
            <li> Short and Sweet.</li>
            <li> My acne has gotten better, my skin is smoother, and dark spots have gotten lighter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 African American female and have always taken good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> I first started using this, my face completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> I also have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> For reference, I&#x27;m very fair skinned with mild to moderate closed comedones and sensitive to fatty acids.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredients in this product are what you need in an anti-aging routine (which I recommend you begin by 27)--don&#x27;t spend more for the same thing in a prettier bottle with a rosy scent, because that&#x27;s what many products are actually charging you for.</li>
            <li> this lotion and my skin seem to be a match made in heaven, so far (mixed skin with fine lines around the eyes and on the forehead).</li>
            <li> Better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get all the old skin cells taken away and new ones brought out!!</li>
            <li> Your skin will get used to it after a while, so you can switch to a retinol product (Avene&#x27;s Eluage for exemple, so good and plumping too), then come back to this little jewel.</li>
            <li> You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.)  </li>
            <li> You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.)  </li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels fresh, clean, and it really improved any uneven skin tone splotches I had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again...YES, it burns, but it will make your flaky skin look and feel better and less itchy.</li>
            <li> My skin is basically like stone at this point so it doesn&#x27;t even slightly burn, but most people will have to use it sparingly for a couple weeks while they adjust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne more than half my life.  </li>
            <li> Most reviews mentioned a slight tingling sensation upon applying the product however</li>
            <li> My pores are less visible, I have a healthy glow</li>
            <li> If anyone knows of a similar product, I would love to know what it is if it has the same formula.</li>
            <li> This will have your skin looking so young, fresh and alive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular product and product line for about 20 years.</li>
            <li> This is only the 2nd item that I have been able to use that does not clog the pores.  </li>
            <li> I use in combination with a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I will order more in the future and can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my skin once I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly work for me.</li>
            <li> I believe it aids in accelerated skin turn over because I am seeing more dead skin ready to be sloughed away after I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I consider myself lucky to find out mine was VERY LOW because my Dr. Ran a Test.  </li>
            <li> I mainly bought it to control my acne</li>
            <li> This product is as mild as basic hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and have lived in Midwest where I cannot find this stuff..</li>
            <li> So I decided to \\&quot;invest\\&quot; in my skin now that I\\&quot;m getting older by trying a product that helps preserve your youthful looks.  </li>
            <li> Main reason I use it - It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or that I have cling wrap slathered on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this once week, but mainly for spot treatments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is this product is worth the money and will work to smooth out skin, but in my experience it had to be applied everyday for any noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> so I can attest that it helps maintain their current state and not deepen as quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use on my 25 Y/O boyfriend with acne scars on his back and mild acne on his face.</li>
            <li> But this one is SERIOUSLY not greasy.</li>
            <li> I suffer from minor adult acne and with my wedding coming up, I wanted to make sure my face was clear.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit funky, and it tingles a bit, but didn&#x27;t bother my skin much&amp;my skin is VERY sensitive!</li>
            <li> it was some \\&quot;junk\\&quot; working its way out -- because after that my skin looked more even, more radiant, little lines were less noticeable. .</li>
            <li> but it was full up and thick and really strong.</li>
            <li> the reviews were high and ti seemed legit.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it because I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> (of course I use a high SPF sun cream anyway).</li>
            <li> highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the high rating, but after using it for about 2 weeks, there is still no progress.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It really hurts you mentally and this stuff along side of a GENTLE cleanser, BP and regular (oil free) moisturizer has really changed my skin and my life!</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive and have had no problem with this but better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> I layer a face lotion (with a little almond oil) on top for hydration.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin at ALL, do not purchase this!!</li>
            <li> , I have not had a major break out since the first couple weeks of the regimen.</li>
            <li> sure that you moisturize after use, as it is a little drying (nothing horrid).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Alpha Hydrox for a little over two months now, and honestly, there&#x27;s barely any discernable difference, if any.</li>
            <li> I started using Jan Marini&#x27;s Bioglycolic face lotion, a little more expensive but great product.</li>
            <li> This lotion also does such a great job of exfoliating that I&#x27;ve had little flakes form on my face -- something that never ever happened to me before using, since I never could exfoliate well enough before this lotion to make a difference with my acne.  </li>
            <li> Lotion is not thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> :)  I&#x27;m hoping thatcontinued use will smooth out the deeper line on my forehead (at least I only have one!)</li>
            <li> i have sensitive, very combo acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I do really well with Jurlique natural products.  </li>
            <li> I have layered lotion on top of it, and noticed that it still kept my pores nice and small, but I don&#x27;t usually need additional moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and it gently exfoliates the skin while making it soft.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is too expensive for its size, but the product inside does a great job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My face looked much brighter and clear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped clear up my KP.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and this lotion works very well without me breaking out.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t take more than a few days of this.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be scared when you get a burning sensation, thats normal and proof that it is working.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, the dryness is vastly better with no problems.  </li>
            <li> i tried using scar gel which normally does the jobthen</li>
            <li> If I start to have a breakout, it is pretty much gone the next morning.</li>
            <li> This is rated as one of the strongest alpha hydrox lotions, but I had no negative skin reactions and am hanging in there, using it every day.  </li>
            <li> B000UVZU1S St. Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz</li>
            <li> B000UVZU1S St. Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz</li>
            <li> Tingling feel is normal .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical enough to be used as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> I will encourage you to test a strip of your face a few nights to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction.</li>
            <li> This was my first glycolic acid product and I am glad I started slow with the lower percentage.(this</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it especially for the price!</li>
            <li> As much as I LOVE this cream, it wasn&#x27;t suitible for everyday use on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and don&#x27;t need to use an additional moisturizer after for night time.</li>
            <li> If I miss a few nights in a row I&#x27;ll start to get acne again, so I try not to miss more than one night.</li>
            <li> It can cause some stinging if you&#x27;re not used to it, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t severe as it once was during my middle school &amp; high school years, but in recent years its been pretty mild.</li>
            <li> Rubs on so easily and makes skin nice and soft, Use everyday and see some wrinkles become less visible!</li>
            <li> The last product seemed to become less effective</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of dry, not very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Places where I had dry patches are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have compared similar glycolic acid products from other manufacturers and this is the most reasonable that I can find.</li>
            <li> The only place I break out now is right below my eyebrows, which also happens to be a spot where I can&#x27;t put this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I get them right under my butt on the back of my thighs.</li>
            <li> My left cheek had bumps all over it specifically and not my right one.</li>
            <li> and i go right back to using this on.  </li>
            <li> I had mainly bought this for discoloration and while I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really done much on that front, it has seemed to improve my overall clarity.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are healing much faster than normal, a few new ones were coming out at first, but that&#x27;s pretty much stopped now.    </li>
            <li> but it has a very strong, not very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price especially because a little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I normally have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this product because i barely get any sleep and have and have like 2 pimple scar i wanted it gone haha.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it has removed fine lines and softened brown spots and left a revitalized glow to my complexion.</li>
            <li> When you try a new product give it 6 weeks of use before deciding whether or not it works for you.</li>
            <li> nothing new for me.</li>
            <li> But it helps to keeps me 34 each new year I guess.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> This is no longer carried anywhere close to where I live.</li>
            <li> Your skin will look glowing and new..</li>
            <li> If you want to live your life like a vampire...</li>
            <li> Overall I have a more even tone, less break-outs, and my face is much smoother.</li>
            <li> use it nightly but really haven&#x27;t seen much peeling of the facial skin.</li>
            <li> Yes it most definitely made my skin DRAMATICALLY smoother and clearer,and after only a few days of use, people were commenting on how young I looked and how wrinkle -free</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and blemish free, which is something I could never really achieve with the store bought brand.</li>
            <li> As a teen, I had very oily skin but only mild acne problems.  </li>
            <li> I started getting breakouts in my early 40s thanks to hormones and read one of the reviews that recommended AHA and this product for adult acne.</li>
            <li> I find this lotion to be thick and not spread very easily.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft, evens the tone and reduces breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old with oily, acne prone skin and this came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin very soft and moist, as well.</li>
            <li> I definitely have some fine wrinkles below my eyes and some broken blood vessels on my cheeks (too many nights out on the town in my youth;-&gt;).</li>
            <li> It burns a little when freshly applied, but that&#x27;s normal for an Acid ;)</li>
            <li> The darkest ones seems to turn slightly lighter and I&#x27;m happy about that, but other lighter spots are the same and still there.  </li>
            <li> I am for my age (56, people think I am in my early 40&#x27;s, ha!)  </li>
            <li> I think stress was making me breakout more than usual</li>
            <li> I have been using Alpha Hydrox for years, and although I have tried many other products - I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other product you could grab at your local drug store, etc.</li>
            <li> The first time upon application, I did get a deep tingling sensation on my face.</li>
            <li> first couple of times you use it, your face may get a bit red and sting.</li>
            <li> Other brands charge so much more for the same ingredient.</li>
            <li> This cream may make your  face tingle a bit--it does on mine, which indicates that it might be slightly acidic and therefore help remove the thinnest layer of skin and with it, some fine lines (</li>
            <li> You obviously don&#x27;t know much about chem peels then!</li>
            <li> I have used it almost nightly for about a month, and even though my sleeping has been less than desirable, my fine lines are definetly minimized.</li>
            <li> First of all, it came one of those yellow manilla envelopes lined with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I first used it when I was an international flight Attendent.  </li>
            <li> Hydrates your skin just enough, never too much!</li>
            <li> Second time ordering this as I gave away my first bottle.</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten (or could get) the exact same formula with an SPF around 30!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past I just love it.</li>
            <li> Is starting to work pretty well...</li>
            <li> To my amazement, my skin cleared up, felt so soft and looked glowing!</li>
            <li> The top layer of dermis usually shed in 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> this goes a long way to give it a fresh look.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li> When I first put it on my face tingled and got really red</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month ,the first two weeks it stung and made my face red</li>
            <li> The first bottle I used all over, this second bottle I am using on my face and I purchased the silk body wrap lotion for my body.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to like this product enough for me to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> I used several AHA products before and it&#x27;s the first time I got something that just sits on my skin.</li>
            <li> Have purchased many times over the years from amazon and elsewhere, can usually find at marshalls or tj maxx</li>
            <li> This happens only the first time you use it after some time your skin get use.</li>
            <li> fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> So I still recommend starting with this product, but if you find it stops working for you, try something of theirs of a slightly higher concentration.</li>
            <li> It is the first and only skin care product from which I have seen any resultsâwhatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular benefit to using this after many months, however I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> Personally, it wasn&#x27;t anything special enough that I would consider purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I read on a website (acne.org I think) about using alpha-hydroxy to help turnover new cells and clear up acne</li>
            <li> Once it finally dries, it does sort of tighten the skin, but leaves it feeling sort of tuggy, not soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> However, that goes away quickly as the lotion sinks into your skin.  </li>
            <li> so not sure how it would work on more mature skin.</li>
            <li> was not sure if it was effective enough though.</li>
            <li> Research has shown that AHA can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but there is little evidence to suggest long-term efficacy.</li>
            <li> It seems very light to be just a moisturizer on its own - which I don&#x27;t think it is trying to be - and as such it makes my skin feel a little tight after it sinks in.</li>
            <li> i am over 60 with a few fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> and right now I dont have a single razor bump.</li>
            <li> I was never overweight or large, so there was never a lot of cellulite, but enough to make me self-conscious in a swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used one pea sized drop of this lotion for a  really large zit on his face and the next morning he woke up</li>
            <li> I would end up with ingrown hairs and large red bumps.  </li>
            <li> Hands are looking a little wrinkly and need something to smooth them out.  </li>
            <li> The lotion did not help smooth out the little bumps</li>
            <li> I am 51, have fine lines beginning to appear around my upper lip, so I&#x27;m curious to see how it turns out.</li>
            <li> it stung a lot in the beginning and became a little better once I started using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I had little bumps all over my face and more red spots than I ever had.</li>
            <li> I know that glycolic acid is one of only a few skin care ingredients that really work at targeting fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> so I know that many purported skin care creams and lotions have little or no actual beneficial ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and although the lotion burns slightly when on my face, it is soooo definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> so I could get a clear view of the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> In that time, my skin has been closer to 100% clear than I ever dreamed it could be.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s clear, my acne scars are fading.</li>
            <li> AHA helps clear up acne scars and prevents/lessens acne breakouts for me.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face to clear up acne and use as a chemical exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (most people think I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> I am switching to ROC retinol serum and will see if it&#x27;ll clear all the skin tags.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clean and I have a slightly peeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try and clear up body acne.</li>
            <li> When I do get a breakout, it seems to clear up quicker.  </li>
            <li> I can be clear for months and then break out all over my face.</li>
            <li> BTW i dont have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I stopped using it on my neck (which is actually wrinkle free anyways) because either the lotion or the itching caused my neck to be red the next day.  </li>
            <li> (anyone married a long time knows how UNobservant husbands can be ..</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I always wear 100% sunscreen if out in the direct sun.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it because I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily, sensitive and problematic, but I bought this lotion and it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate acne or oiliness.    </li>
            <li> As far as the seller, it arrived promptly</li>
            <li> leaves skin soft just what it should do.</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily and mature skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stubborn adult acne for years.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t find this to be an issue.</li>
            <li> I use this frequently at night.  </li>
            <li> My skin is truly glowing (not because of pregnancy) and it looks like I&#x27;ve had a professional chemical exfoliation treatment.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the product stung like hell each time I used it.</li>
            <li> If Used too often, can irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You will have to apply the acid directly onto your face.</li>
            <li> I read on Amazon that this lotion could help, and indeed it has, within about 5 days the area has been completely cleared of the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Peroxide, for example, caused acne breakouts and I then learned that I had sensitive skin and watched my product ingredients to avoid ongoing problems.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe all the compliments that came my way - everyone started telling me I looked so young and</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz recommended using glycolic acid to keep your skin young.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I can get back to my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because I have sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be surprised if you break out.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell I guess.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne for over 10 years and nothing has cleared up my skin like this product.</li>
            <li> This also leaves your skin soft and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> bought this 10% Glycolic-AHA cream to give my sensitive skin a break from the stronger 12% cream as needed.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> It is now said that we need this formulation to keep our skin young.  </li>
            <li> Really seems to make a difference the the overall appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old</li>
            <li> I am currently in my early 40s.  </li>
            <li> (The only thing that really worked was Accutane, but that became WAY too cumbersome to continue to use given all of the requirements surrounding prescribing it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely, this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> My only drawback with this is that it really needs to be used two times a day.</li>
            <li> Made it feel so soft but</li>
            <li> If youâre sensitive to petrolatum products, I suggest getting the enhanced cream instead.</li>
            <li> (My problem is adult acne coupled with premature signs of aging)</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li> Also, it did not irritate my notoriously sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> 5+ years old are now gone or atleast minimized.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived, the package was completely mangled.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 days, I developed this rash on my neck.</li>
            <li> No breakouts so far.</li>
            <li> I freaked out about aging because I look young for my age</li>
            <li> I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t be that much of a drain on me financially if I bought this product</li>
            <li> And my skin is so soft like a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I do not think this is a common side effect but just make sure you are not allergic to any of the ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> I have been using the aha 10% lotion for about three weeks now, my skin tone, dryness, blotchiness, blackheads and pimples have completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> advice is to give it a shot, even if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> These products allows your skin to repair and the products glide on leaving your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely looks brighter and makeup goes on much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I just use my hands and gentle pressure and wash for 1 entire minute.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin is overly sensitive or anything</li>
            <li> but when I started using this, it completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old</li>
            <li> I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> a teen, I didn&#x27;t have much acne but</li>
            <li> Leave it on for about 5 minutes like a mask then rinse completely.</li>
            <li> wow, you&#x27;ve gotta be kidding</li>
            <li> No reduction in old acne hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin, but I have no problem on this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and combination (only/dry) and it works for me.</li>
            <li> I find it gives me the same results at a much, much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am young (29) but have been using anti-aging type creams for sevearal years in an effort to prevent signs of aging on my face before they occur.</li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I really needed something to stop the left side from the break outs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be surprised by the flaking, that is part of the process.</li>
            <li> I have a very hairy bikini line and over the last 20 years I have given up on keeping it shaved for swimsuits and just wear boy shorts.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this years ago and completely forgot I had it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s baby soft without any over-drying effect.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend trying this one.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the cause, I stopped using the Souffle and have been using only the Enhanced Lotion alone for a few months now, and my skin is looking better than it has in years!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (obviously.. ) When used everyday my skin started to flake&amp;peel, causing more of a break out.</li>
            <li> I am sorry that I couldn&#x27;t give this product a good rating..</li>
            <li> Have bought all the really expensive items with fancy names but have had good luck with this product thus far.</li>
            <li> Nice and thin, doesn&#x27;t leave you with any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> But a few quick checks in the mirror daily keep facial flakes from becoming too numerous.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s can mean the difference between cute and coot.</li>
            <li> never really makes it starts healing away right away.  </li>
            <li> It eliminates the funny bumps on my chin and smoothes out the dry, flaky skin elsewhere.</li>
            <li> If you have a stubborn pimple you can first put BP on it and then after a few minutes add a little of this on top.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this same company makes a similar product with a higher concentration of the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Mild acid breaks the oil surface tension on your pores, allows O2 in and helps clear up the infection; acid environment is also less hospitable for the bacteria that cause the blackhead</li>
            <li> Good~ but ! Smells bad~</li>
            <li> You do not need that much when you apply this lotion so it will last a long time, plus with the continuous skin exfoliation my skin has been so much softer.</li>
            <li> It may sting a little after application, depending on your skin type, mine is oily &amp; can take pretty much anything you throw at it.</li>
            <li> You actually get a lot for what you pay, especially because you don&#x27;t need to use very much of it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some difference in the fine wrinkles but not sure which to give the credit to.</li>
            <li> I washed daily with a mild antibacterial soap, followed by Loreal&#x27;s pH Toner, and then the Alpha Hydrox (back then the regular face lotion was 12% glycolic acid).  </li>
            <li> product overall, particularly for the price according to her.</li>
            <li> It also lightened hyperpigmentation and when I get small pimples, I apply this more heavily or multiple times a day</li>
            <li> It does removes dark spots but ONLY the light ones.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first as I have had skin discoloration on my legs for most of my life - well over 30 years.</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit when I first put it on, especially if you have open acne spots.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a thin consistency, and I would say it&#x27;s good for all skin types (I have dry sensitive, acne prone skin).</li>
            <li> I have learned to avoid certain substances, including retinol, the previous wonder product for reviving the skin, so I was eager to try acids instead, but also, naturally, very cautious about it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any major change so far.</li>
            <li> I have other products that I&#x27;m using now that I can tell a difference from right away</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and my skin has been a mess this time around.  </li>
            <li> I poured it into a different bottle with a smaller spout, and so I can apply the cream more efficiently and it lasts a little longer as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lotion for dry skin, and it doesn&#x27;t have any weird odor or anything.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s supposed to sting, tickle, and leave the face dry, but most people said it went away after a few days.</li>
            <li> not only were all my acne spots smaller and MUCH less inflamed than when I&#x27;d gone to bed, but my skin had an overall healthy glow to it that is has literally never, ever had before, except perhaps when I was a very young child.  </li>
            <li> I only use this lotion in the evenings because it tends to make my face look and feel oily (which was initially concerning because I already have really oily skin), but it has worked wonders so far.</li>
            <li> first off never really write but reviews</li>
            <li> After cleansing I add a tiny drop to my normal moisturizer and mix it all up and apply.</li>
            <li> Started using this lotion a few weeks ago and the first thing I noticed is that it caused me to break out -- I haven&#x27;t had pimples like this since high school....</li>
            <li> The price is so much less than any other Alpha Hydrox product out there and seems to work better.  </li>
            <li> The product is an exfoliant so it is always having you show new skin, which keeps your skin looking younger.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using these two products about two weeks ago, I have noticed that I have not any any new breakouts on my back or chest.</li>
            <li> and I actually got new pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> This cream has helped with fading my scars, and helped heal any new pimples that have occured (especially when I break the rules and pick at my skin...</li>
            <li> something new every day, deep beneath the skin&#x27;s surface, and it just wouldn&#x27;t quit no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> not able to use it much because its causing my wife to have breakouts but makes the skin more tight</li>
            <li> I purchased three Alpha Hydrox products and although I have only been using them less than a month, I believe&lt;br /&gt;these products work better (for me, anyway) than products that are way more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using the glycolix 20% pads and taking B-stress vitamins, my skin is getting dry.</li>
            <li> I went to a local cosmetic store and actually paid 3x the price for one of those very \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; AHA cream in the 10% concentration.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for 20 years gets rid of uneven skin tone, the scent is not something I would desire but the smells goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> and I love that it only takes a little bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li> But I have be using it twice a day for two weeks and the difference in my skin is very apparent.  </li>
            <li> I follow the Alpha Hydrox Lotion with a broad spectrum sunscreen.Â  </li>
            <li> I have barely had a zit since!  </li>
            <li> I have since ordered 4 more bottles, but in an effort to make it last longer, this past week I have only been using on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other product has came close..</li>
            <li> I use this product each night (start out using it every other night, as it might sting a bit at first).</li>
            <li> stuff}.I was using no other cleanser.</li>
            <li> I got maybe one or two new acne spots after the first few uses and none since.  </li>
            <li> Secondly,It reduces acne by drying up oil, yes it will dry out skin too much of your not careful.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to evaluate its effectiveness but the price is excellent compared to the very expensive department store brands that claim the same benefit</li>
            <li> I do get a slight burning sensation right after shaving but that is it.</li>
            <li> Most have lightened and the break outs happen less often and are less severe.</li>
            <li> It is indeed fragrance free as advertized, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Try a little tester first, some folks with sensitive skin will need to cut it with Curel, Eucerin type lotion.  </li>
            <li> The only cons are that it smells a little odd and you&#x27;ll find that you sunburn very easily, but lotions and makeup with SPF will prevent that.</li>
            <li> It reacts fast and hard to everything: temperature, humidity, direct pressure, indirect rubbing, what I&#x27;m eating, what I&#x27;m drinking, how much sleep I&#x27;ve had, what day of the week it isâ</li>
            <li> It generally doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle unless my skin was irritated by something else, like using a washcloth, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only clear because of this product, but it glows.</li>
            <li> My face is clear, pores appear smaller, and skin is smoother.  </li>
            <li> In addition to using it on my face, I&#x27;ve been using it on my shoulders and back to help clear up my body breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I was excited, and expected some improvement since researching AHAs, but have seen improvement with other AHA products.  </li>
            <li> which helps them stay smaller and not become inflamed or enlarged by dirt and oil, Once my pores are purged they seem to stay clear.</li>
            <li> the scent is barely there at all, I only mention it because I know how sensitive peoples noses can be.</li>
            <li> It initially kept my skin semi clear.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to help with brown spots on the skin, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it really works.  </li>
            <li> People always think I&#x27;m much younger than the old lady I am.  </li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness, it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have had moderate to severe acne since my early teens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised they don&#x27;t carry this at a local drug store.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and have a professional facial done.</li>
            <li> People 45 years old mistake me as younger than they are.  </li>
            <li> I am using this as a preventive measure (I am only 24 years old)</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found a combination of wash and topical solution that really truly works for my chest and back.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is that Amazon no longer carries it direct so you have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 50, you wouldn&#x27;t know it by this sudden beautifying of my skin.</li>
            <li> B000G8LWZI Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA 1.6 oz (45 g)]], and experiencing problems--it turns out that I was sold a container of the Souffle that was actually several years old.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from</li>
            <li> Also, I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from</li>
            <li> It removes the old and drab looking skins .... leaving a much younger and revialized appearance.</li>
            <li> (25 female, sensitive combination skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to not have freckles but they developed in my mid- to late-20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 years old, and just starting to need some wrinkle prevention help</li>
            <li> so be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> Back to my Kiehl&#x27;s, Lush, Dermatologica, and Origins staples.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it twice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it occasionally would itch/burn, I now use it specifically on the locations where I&#x27;m trying to fight off the closed comedones, and I&#x27;m seeing just as much success as before when I was covering my entire face.</li>
            <li> I have minor acne scars and this slowly lightens them away :)</li>
            <li> I hope it will help remove a few wrinkles, but not sure yet how effective it will be on me.</li>
            <li> Aha stung slightly (and still does) when i put it on, but its not horrible by any means, just put on a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Firstly it keeps oil down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on any product with less than 8% glycolic acid, and don&#x27;t be suckered into buying brands that promise more than 14%.</li>
            <li> With the dry winter air, its even worse so I try to keep the skin hydrated, but I don&#x27;t know if this product is effective if used layered under lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first shaved with some Dudu black soap and a safety razor...</li>
            <li> - my skin is usually normal (not overly dry or oily).</li>
            <li> I have dry cheeks and normal to oily skin in the T Zone area.  </li>
            <li> Upon first use, you may feel a bit of tingling to a slight burning sensation</li>
            <li> Slight stinging at first but goes away as you wear it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any better than any other glycolic acid lotion.</li>
            <li> The only thing is if I forget to put on sunscreen in direct sun for a long time, I&#x27;m more likely to turn a tad pink versus tan since I think it has some slight bleaching properties.  </li>
            <li> Your skin gets very dry and even cracks, and this is the only thing we have found that really works.</li>
            <li> the cream isn&#x27;t very moisturizing and to me doesn&#x27;t have a velvet-ey texture that some of my other moisturizers have.  </li>
            <li> This burns the skin a little, especially when fresh out the bath, but nothing painful/intolerable.  </li>
            <li> When both my products arrived, I immediately went for the 12% as I wanted quicker and more dramatic results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not totally blemish-free, but the zits I do have are tiny, infrequent, and clear within a day or two (I should note,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this working for wrinkles on your face, but I can say that it works amazingly to clear up my keratosis pilaris (bumps on the backs of my upper arms and sometimes upper legs).  </li>
            <li> I am a male in my mid 20s that has been suffering from acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li> The cream sinks in well enough but really dont see any changes in my skin after using for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> At first the sting bothered me a little, but I thought about what a chemical peal does and realized that it was a sign it was working.  </li>
            <li> May sting a little a first.</li>
            <li> It did sting a little at first, but after a week</li>
            <li> The first week I use it, I feel little bit tingling , but after a week, I don&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this lotion on my face, I noticed that it was tingling and stinging a little.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small tab to go along way but doesn&#x27;t seem to really absorb so have white spots on my face until I really work it in or remove with a towel.</li>
            <li> i actually dont use it as a moisturizer because it makes my skin dry in large red patches, especially in the drier parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has been thanks to this cream or the fact that it is now winter where I live that has lighten my skin.</li>
            <li> Use when blackheads first surface on face, skin, back etc, and they&#x27;ll be almost gone in half a day.  </li>
            <li> As with other Alpha Hydrox products, initial use brings with it a tingling sensation to the skin, but it is not irritating over time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old, asian skin tone and have always had moderate acne, and this has actually worked!  </li>
            <li> Im an African American male in my my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> will sting the first few times you use it, but don&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li> (bc the results were noticeable within the first few days</li>
            <li> used to put lemon juice on my face a few times a week, and this AHA cream feels exactly how the lemon juice felt, so I wasn&#x27;t alarmed.  </li>
            <li> Although it does feel itchy for the first few applications.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, this stuff can really make your skin peel, so be VERY careful with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually went to two different dermatologists and tried various tropical and oral medications with little success.  </li>
            <li> On the box it says that if application does not dry within a minute or less, you&#x27;ve used too much.  </li>
            <li> -- I had to take pictures of myself and compare them to older pictures to be sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive, very dry skin.</li>
            <li> A small, less than a dime sized amount, is more than enough to work with.  </li>
            <li> I also only use a small amount at a time and spread it on top of my slightly damp face, I find that works best/improves absorbability.  </li>
            <li> I was aware of this product and so decided to try this one as all of the scores of other skin products I&#x27;ve used over the years have either made my face greasy feeling or dry and peeling -</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to clear up the severe scarring all over my face and dry up the bumps I had.</li>
            <li> I always had sensitive dry skin, and after using this product it just made my face looks brighter and youthful</li>
            <li> Oily, dry, sensitive, acne, wrinkles...</li>
            <li> lastly it reduces dark spots quicker than anything I have ever used  because of the anti wrinkle properties, it helps soon regenerate fast</li>
            <li> It tingled a bit upon the first few applications only.</li>
            <li> a small few notable occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few times I felt a little tingle and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> use it all over my face at night after washing and toning with a little pure tea tree oil diluted with water on a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of consistent use, applied once at night and then once in the morning, I felt my skin needed a rest, so now I use it only once a day for a week, putting it on just before bedtime, then don&#x27;t use for a few days, (only use a coconut oil moisturizer)</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox naturally removes the dead skin cells from your skin revealing the new skin underneath.</li>
            <li> and if I use this lotion regularly, I have much softer, less flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He has oily skin, and his previous moisturizer didn&#x27;t do much for him, so after extensive researching on Amazon, I got this for him 9 months ago</li>
            <li> Definitely, this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it highly!at happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind.  </li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox AHA enhanced lotion should be applied sparingly, as it is very thin and it does not take much to get full coverage of your face.</li>
            <li> My dark spots were mainly on my shaving areas, my neck &amp; jawline.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very diligent about it and stopped using it after a little while.  </li>
            <li> I tried many other, more expensive products, but my skin started having breakouts, looked dull and was not soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> Lotion goes on smooth, a little heavy, but I felt nothing and saw no changes.</li>
            <li> One night when I was sleepily getting ready for bed my moisturizer and this stuff got a little mixed up</li>
            <li> It does make my fair skin feel a little vulnerable in the sun if I don&#x27;t have sunscreen on</li>
            <li> My skin tone has definitely improved - the broken capillaries look smaller, the sun/age spots seem to have faded, the fine lines around my eyes have improved (although not gone away entirely).</li>
            <li> The old acne scars are starting to disappear but no significant changes in the old marks.</li>
            <li> I know it is supposed to be for dry skin, but it really doesn&#x27;t make my skin any oilier than any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I think I might be using too much of this product; a little goes a long way, and I usually apply about a dimes worth to my face and, and I feel it may be overkill.  </li>
            <li> Be wary when you have a fresh mani/pedi because depending on the top coat this may cause it to go dull.  </li>
            <li> nothing good, nothing bad.</li>
            <li> I have been told I look younger (late 20s, early 30s) than my real age (age 42).</li>
            <li> I usually just blot with a cool wet facecloth and that stops the stinging.</li>
            <li> This product has help slowly even out my skin tone and leave me looking fresh.</li>
            <li> What was most comforting was that my very ugly purse-lines on my upper lip started to smooth out and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not smell pretty, but it does not spell bad or have a strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my chest} where the treatment side was completely clear and the other side had standard acne.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my face all the time, because the skin there is sensitive, but overall it has smoothed out shaving bumps and other irritation, made my skin smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this without hesitation to my extremely chemically and perfume sensitive mother.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s a few ways I use this product with results almost instantly but realistic results in 1-2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most middle aged women, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to stop or slow down the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up in the first few days if you don&#x27;t see a huge improvement because that is unrealistic.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it and there was little to no smell from the product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just what I need for the discoloration on my face, slowly but surely they are fading away, I am curious to try their other products!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to se  a big diference.</li>
            <li> This performs well and at this price, you get a big bottle that should last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> and I need to make this product last as long as possible).</li>
            <li> The age spots, large and small, were unchanged.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up hormonal breakouts evened out skin tone tighten and firmed this 46 year old face and is lightening the sun damage, the lines above my lips are way less noticeable as are the forehead lines and tightened pores.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really work on wrinkle because I don&#x27;t have any; however, maybe because it working..</li>
            <li> I have use this in the past and  my skin responses to this product very well.</li>
            <li> i also had some sun spots and general skin discoloration from years spent in the sun without sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I also am prone to getting minor keratosis pilaris (kp) on my outer upper arms and this lotion also reduces those bumps.</li>
            <li> We all want to hold on to a youthful look as long as possible!</li>
            <li> My acne instantly began clearing up and the acne discolorations that had long been there</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use long enough to see if it worked or not.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is anything long term for KP (short of any surgical procedures)</li>
            <li> I only have minor wrinkles in my life now</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to reap the benefits I wanted, which was using it conjunction with retinol cream 12 hours apart to help remove stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I use it morning and night, and a tiny amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Now, I generally do not develop any permanent scarring from my acne.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a very faint smell, that is kind of like glue.</li>
            <li> I am going to be 39 years old in less than a month, am an Asian-American female, have dry skin, lots of freckling on my cheeks, and I suffered from a droopy crepe-y skinned forehead that happened all of a sudden in 2011.  </li>
            <li> You can use it under your makeup or blend a little of your liquid foundation into the lotion before applying it to your face for a sheer natural look.  </li>
            <li> I started applying this and in a few days my problem has been remedied along with a new glow to to my skin.</li>
            <li> Before very long my skin stopped stinging from it and hasn&#x27;t been bothered since despite daily use.  </li>
            <li> Not much to this product, may not do anything to your skin, good or bad.</li>
            <li> how it seems to just sit on my skin in white streaks that don&#x27;t seem to absorb so much as dry on the face.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin like me, try matching this product with this Alpha Hydrox Sheer Silk Moisturizer SPF 15.</li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t use makeup, not because i don&#x27;t want to but because i can&#x27;t do it and its too much work, so their is no way for me to cover pimples scar or dark circle eyes, unwanted dark spots</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing works to totally remove they dry scales and the bleeding cracks.  </li>
            <li> After I had a couple of moles removed on my face a few years back, I developed flakey skin cells on the scar area.  </li>
            <li> Super irritating when that happens.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s May 2010 &amp; after using this product religiously every single night, I&#x27;m noticing that I need a stronger concentration of the Alpha hydroxy.</li>
            <li> You definitely feel tingling and a slight to moderate stinging shortly after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> I backed off for a while and only used it once every 3 days, and then 1 every other day, and then finally every night.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but even when I used a little</li>
            <li> I think it has helped a little with lightening up some old acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li> In expensive way to brighten and clean facial skin.</li>
            <li> I have old acne scars and minimal active acne.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin to and this product does not irritate it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I hoped this product would lighten my age (sun) spots,  but so far, after several months of trying, it has worked very little.  </li>
            <li> The only drawbacks for me have been the smell -- many people have remarked that this lotion is scent-free, but it does have a noticeably unpleasant odor in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> You do not need much of this, at least my skin doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This has helped clear it up dramatically in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 42 year old man, and people always think I&#x27;m at least ten years younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of this product and would suggest it to anyone of any age grp.</li>
            <li> Hence why one bottle lasts me for so long.</li>
            <li> i recently switched my cleansers from the PINK loreal 360 to the apricot scrub also by Loreal 360 and since the scrub dries out my face, i used this</li>
            <li> The dermatologist replied that we&#x27;ve come a long way in skin care and that today&#x27;s glycolic acid doesn&#x27;t sting anymore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to try this lotion.</li>
            <li> Have not really noticed any big changes.  </li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this company for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> Not long ago i posted a question as to whether this product works on men with discoloration due to shaving.  </li>
            <li> I had used this product a long time ago, and started using it again.</li>
            <li> but i see no action of the glycolic</li>
            <li> I had minor backne and chestne from working out and sweating a ton which lead to clogged pores which lead to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had minor breakouts but nothing compared to before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, along with the foaming face wash, on the recommendation of my esthetician who said it would \\&quot;go a long way towards preventing aging.\\</li>
            <li> so long I slather it on, but my son says it burns.</li>
            <li> I wish I had used this long before now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for as long as I can remember, and I just turned 33.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated all day long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had it happen when I apply another lotion after this one has dried completely.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell, isn&#x27;t greasy and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with KP on arms and legs, and the occasional rough elbows.</li>
            <li> If my face is wet, my skin tends to get red.</li>
            <li> i used it regularly for a month and not much happened.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle of lotion a day ago and my rash is already starting to go away, the inflammation and redness instantly calmed down.  </li>
            <li> I started to feel a slight tingle but nothing major.</li>
            <li> You must be careful to stay away from fragile eye area though as it will dry it</li>
            <li> my daughter tried it last night and everything looked less red this morning, so again we may give it a shot.</li>
            <li> This is too thin to use alone unless on sweaty summer days  but for right now it needs to combined.</li>
            <li> I can already tell his back is starting to dry out and become less oily.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount, as it is thin and spreads easily over the entire face.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount, as it is thin and spreads easily over the entire face.  </li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin this may burn you and you may need to mix a small amount into your moisturizer to start with.</li>
            <li> all of a sudden there are red patches everywhere on my face and what looks like hundred of small red bumps!  </li>
            <li> I definitely plan on trying out some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Took a little big, scrubbing in the shower and daily lotion for a couple months</li>
            <li> I am going to try other products in this range in future.</li>
            <li> My pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they were before and the only breakouts I have are about 1-2 pimples a month due to my menstrual cycle.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I only use it at night every other day.  </li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and it is only a fraction of the cost of other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> I HAVE to mix with a tiny little bit of my yummy smelling BLISS moisturizer to negate the gross smell - which works.</li>
            <li> I use it every day in the morning along with other products, I can tell a big difference when I don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> This product caused a rash but other Alpha Hydrox products with similar ingredients have not.</li>
            <li> the past I&#x27;d tried just about every OTC topical treatment / cleanser, two kinds of oral antibiotics and two kinds of scrip topical antibiotics, as well as several &#x27;home remedies&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I do a cross-over and start applying it to the other side of the face while neglecting the former treatment side.  </li>
            <li> so long as it keeps doing its job!</li>
            <li> I might use this again in a financial crisis, other than that i&#x27;ll stick to Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will serve a very long time.</li>
            <li> They had been there for a very long time</li>
            <li> Glycolic lotion is one of the AHA&#x27;s my dermatologist highly recommends, but the 10% content is hard to find and is so costly when I did find it...</li>
            <li> My skin is combination or dry.</li>
            <li> As noted, I have dry to combination skin and no problem with acne</li>
            <li> In fact it seemed to dry it out.</li>
            <li> My problem is dry, flaking skin.  </li>
            <li> Of course the bottle states for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it under my liquid foundation, as a night cream before bedtime, and as a moisturizer any time my skin feels dry.  </li>
            <li> My dry patchy areas have diminished in size, some have even disappeared.Â Â  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I found that all these make your sking feel rather dry.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and my skin started to dry out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive stuff any more.</li>
            <li> some form of Dry Acne.  </li>
            <li> I just put it on my callouses after I shower and wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using this moisturizer before, and my skin would be dry from the cleanser.</li>
            <li> My face would be dry for an hour then greasy for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my dry scaly skin...</li>
            <li> I even put it on my feet when they get too dry.</li>
            <li> It takes care of dry or cracked skin and is not scented.</li>
            <li> Enhanced Lotion is for dry skin types (so we are in luck).</li>
            <li> After a while the lotion did dry out to where my face was dry</li>
            <li> It can dry the skin</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it by itself if your skin is on the dry side.</li>
            <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t dry my face out, I use as my face lotion morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of small pimples, but that is to be expected and they are not even noticeable compared to the heat rash like appearance that I normally suffer from.  </li>
            <li> Within only a week or two of discontinuing the Souffle (which made my skin break out even worse) and using the Enhanced Lotion alone, my skin was MUCH</li>
            <li> My skin tingles when it&#x27;s applied, but only for a few minutes, and it does not go red, and I have not had any problems with sun exposure</li>
            <li> I was using this product a few years ago and all of a sudden the local stores stop selling them.</li>
            <li> I barely wanted to leave my house and makeup was pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> I say off and on because every now and then, I&#x27;ll venture off and buy those more expensive products as a way to &#x27;treat&#x27; myself then humbly return to Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li> la roche and skinceuticals only) stopped taking vitamins, because frankly i just dont like taking pills, and only used the alpha hydrox on any blemish that came up or maybe every few months when i was feeling girly.  </li>
            <li> whether it was the lotion, time, age (late 30s) going natural with my skin, the vitaimins, i dont know, but i would definitely give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> ; it gives me some color, almost like I was in the sun, but a healthy color, not like Retin-A red, where it&#x27;s splotchy and sickly looking.  </li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way with this stuff so this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few ltions that does no drag or dry out after I&#x27;ve put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible... just unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> If you use it all the time and stay out of the sun, it makes your skin look fresher and, I suppose, &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; Not appropriate, IMHO, for people with sensitive or aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have started using it on my dark elbows in the hope it will help renew, soften and lighten that skin, also so I can use the lotion up and go to the next level of acid strength.</li>
            <li> I was getting small flesh-colored bumps here and there, but they&#x27;re completely gone now.</li>
            <li> I am not sure the age spots will completely go away, but I will continue using it and see.</li>
            <li> For me it has brought any imbedded black heads or white heads on my face to the surface to dry out.  </li>
            <li> I do occasionally get a small pimple or two (usually around the same time in my menstrual cycle), but when that happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind.  </li>
            <li> B/c i use only a little on my face and neck, the product lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I am pale and have sensitive skin, and I mean sensitive.</li>
            <li> but you will definitely need another moisturizer since after you use this your skin will feel slightly dry and tight</li>
            <li> I have rough patches and dry itchy skin here.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry and rough skin.</li>
            <li> my white heads are gradually dissapearing and my skin is less bumpy, but u should give it time to work.</li>
            <li> I typically use it twice daily:  </li>
            <li> I actually use this on my arms in the shower to help with the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;, or small red bumps.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with dry skin and my skin was looking a tad rough around the chin.</li>
            <li> If I apply twice a day my skin will get a slight red irritation, so don&#x27;t over apply.  </li>
            <li> I worshiped the sun when I was young and this keeps the brown spots very pale.</li>
            <li> I am 50 and have had very dry skin all my life.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> and I was sad because I was seeing less of a result and in the summer you want smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I have had a few big breakouts since using this and NEVER have I EVER seen a breakout dry up and heal faster.</li>
            <li> It does sometimes burn just slightly and cause a small amount of redness when first rubbed in, though it always goes away within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> (although I did have 1 little red raised area for a day after about 3 days of using the lotion..it never formed a pimple</li>
            <li> i have a little product left</li>
            <li> The pores on and around my nose look a little smaller, and I have fewer blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have little white bumps I get on my arms.</li>
            <li> I still exfoliate daily with a little silicone cleansing pad that I bought from Sephora, and the combination of that and this lotion seems to be working for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn and costs a lot less than other similar products.  </li>
            <li> This 6 oz bottle will last a long time since very little is needed with each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has helped smooth out my skin and reduce the \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; look on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Not only did this not clear up the small KP bumps</li>
            <li> and it works w/ sensitive skin too (although it says not for delicate skin).</li>
            <li> In my late 20s/early 30s, however, I began to experience increasing issues with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I was a heavy smoker and used to &#x27;tan&#x27; a lot when I was younger.</li>
            <li> and I realized it was finally time to do something about my lifeless, uneven, and wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li> But I had minimal spots on my jawline.  </li>
            <li> but only after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days and</li>
            <li> However, be careful...particularly careful with your face.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s unscented so you can faintly smell the acid, so I use a thin layer on arms and legs and then a regular body lotion on top.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a skin improvement, but I have only used it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I expected it would take a couple of weeks before I saw a measurable difference in my skin,</li>
            <li> Not much has changed.</li>
            <li> but what I wanted from this product was to lighten my age (sun) spots and for that purpose I think this has not deliver the expected result.  </li>
            <li> - I learned keeping the pores empty helped reduce skin damage that caused wrinkling too.  </li>
            <li> Inside, the product box was crushed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for approximately three months now and absolutely will not buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen improvements in only a few days of use.</li>
            <li> To avoid sounding redundant, I won&#x27;t retrace the benefits of AHAs, but read up; it&#x27;s crucial to your skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> It made absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I seen an improvement in my skin texture in only a few days.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit careful since it says that you have to avoid the sun or limit sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> It works for my pimples, but I don&#x27;t use it oftenly because I only have few pimples once in a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune trying to figure out how to get my skin under control</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling adult-onset acne in the form of closed comedones which are resisting my efforts like they&#x27;ve planned this all along.</li>
            <li> Using glycolic acid (in combination with salicylic acid, plenty of moisturizer and careful attention to my face) has helped to keep them at bay.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle over a few months.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> so I have minimal wrinkles</li>
            <li> You MUST be careful not to get this on your eyelids or lips.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and looks like I spent a day at the spa.</li>
            <li> After several weeks from my initial use, I noticed the brown marks on my face slowly fade away &amp; disappear.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the stuff that dermatologists tell you to use that costs twice as much as smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Yes, it may sting a little going on, but that&#x27;s very typical for those of us that have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It was very slight and not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I was using a harsh scrub on my face every other day, but it still wasn&#x27;t exfoliating enough.</li>
            <li> My one criticism is that it also seems to dry my face out slightly.</li>
            <li> Only negative is it takes a long time to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> and seriously it&#x27;s changed my life as far as how I feel about my body acne.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I typically let it dry and then apply a sunscreen moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and goes into the skin with a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way also, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> long as I use this product every other day or every 3 days, I get little to no acne on my</li>
            <li> I even get that icky look when I put on my make-up where you can actually see the dry patches.  </li>
            <li> after that i dropped to a few times a week, eventually less, sometimes only applying to problem areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After cleansing, the skin feels tight because it becomes dry.</li>
            <li> It contains an alpha hydroxy acid that works like an extremely slow-motion peel.</li>
            <li> As for me, it didn&#x27;t go away even after a month, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my face type, but this lotion left my face stinging, burning, and itchy on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have used other AHA products, and could &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Around 3 years ago, due to a move and other family events, I stopped religously using face cream every day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting my face like other reviewers might point out.</li>
            <li> Just lay back and have them use a small desk lamp or anything that wil help them spot the ingrown hairs.   </li>
            <li> my skin&#x27;s texture feels somewhat softer but i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s entirely because of this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the problem of skin break outs and irritation I&#x27;ve had with other products.</li>
            <li> It also gave me contact dermatitis in one area - which I wonder if that&#x27;s what other reviewers may have mistaken for acne.</li>
            <li> Pretty sad that I&#x27;m in my mid-20s &amp; still have acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of other brands but nothing comes close to the quality of this one.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 days of starting to use this product my lower cheeks become covered in bumps (not pimples) - not sure what these are</li>
            <li> It was sent in due time and it was packed well.</li>
            <li> I was convinced I had rosacea due to the amount of flakiness</li>
            <li> I did not break out, but it did not help with the acne and other sundry bumps on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also had regular stress-related pimples and scars from past acne.  </li>
            <li> I never miss using the Alpha Hydrox even if I skip some of the other steps.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had the usual clusters of pimples on my upper back and chest as usual.  </li>
            <li> The product is a bit thicker so you can use a small amount especially if you have oily skin like me</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem much different than any other ordinary face cream.</li>
            <li> Does cause a small amount of redness initially, but that subsided with continued use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if works for that since I don&#x27;t actually have wrinkles yet,</li>
            <li> Compared to other store brands.</li>
            <li> I have KP (Keratosis Pilaris) on my back and small areas of my thighs</li>
            <li> I use it every other night or so after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I do not get a \\&quot;stinging\\&quot; as described by other users of AHA when the lotion is applied, and it does not have a \\&quot;strange\\&quot; smell as other users had described.</li>
            <li> When I first applied the lotion to my face and neck, it was a bit tingly and had a weird odor to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever noticed results like this after using any other skincare</li>
            <li> I guess my face must be allergic to the ingredients in this product, but I was only able to use it once and the next day my face broke out horribly.</li>
            <li> but be careful on the face!</li>
            <li> This products did help diminish lines and other skin flaws.  </li>
            <li> have senstive skin, if you had seen my reviews on other lotions, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> I have had a few minor blemishes pop up</li>
            <li> I have used other products that worked about as well, no problem.  </li>
            <li> However, because of the cost of the other products, you had to use sparingly, unless you were into robbing banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont give it a five star rating because I havent seen in other glycolic products I have used before, although I would still recommend it as your skin will feel softer after using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My forehead and chin used to be covered in small bumps which would not go away regardless of what products I used and with daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I think I was trying other skin products.</li>
            <li> Shortly after I began using it, I began to get compliments in my &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; skin, something I have never been noted for in the past.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is due to the fact that it exfoliates your skin and brings everything to the surface.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as i was hoping it would for bumps on my upper arms :/</li>
            <li> So i was a bit skeptical about this product at first.</li>
            <li> , another thing i notice was when i didn&#x27;t use this product for 4 days, my face was still moisturizer, no longer little pieces of dry skin hanging like it used to.</li>
            <li> yes I had a few little bumps pop up, couple red blotches, .</li>
            <li> and it made my skin peel a LOT and became very rough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very curious, I purchased both the Alpha Hydrox 12% souffle and the 10% lotion</li>
            <li> I use a little honey &amp; salt... watered down to a grainy but workable consistency... and sometimes a little mashed avacado or olive oil mixed together.</li>
            <li> I use a combination of benzyl peroxide wash, dry face, then use this as moisturizer everyday.  </li>
            <li> I expected less quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> I also think it&#x27;s because at the same time, I purchased the NUFACE microdermbrasion facial toning device which I use approximately three times per week.</li>
            <li> glycolic acid face wash and all my active pimples are GONE.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t say whether it could or could not be used on the face, however, I chose to use it on the face because the active ingredient was Glycolic-AHA.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to fragrant products and this one does not have any irritating scents.</li>
            <li> The dark red scars all over my cheeks from years&#x27; worth of bad breakouts were noticeably lighter.  </li>
            <li> I had rough bumpy skin on my upper arm and it was getting pretty badly scarred.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely not right for under makeup.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried other products and found them to either be sticky or antagonize my skin.  </li>
            <li> I even started using it for my toes knuckles they have gotten hard from last summer.. and its helping!!</li>
            <li> the dark spots that appeared with menopause have also dimished.  </li>
            <li> When it pertains to the remaining dark spots, Im considering doing a acid peel to finish myself off.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with wrinkles and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Use of the bottle is difficult because too much comes out at once.</li>
            <li> and i thought this was going to help dark spots in my face</li>
            <li> Some of the dark spots from acne (PIH&#x3D;post inflammatory Hyperpigmentation)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Do NOT expect miracles when comes about dark spots.</li>
            <li> Today while dressing I noticed that some of the dark spots I had are literally gone.</li>
            <li> well moisturized, and dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my boyfriend hates how it tastes when it ends up on my lips.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Gets rid of old skin cells without irritating.</li>
            <li> It also removes dead skin from rough heels and elbows to help feel smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> I apply a thick layer on my back, shoulders, and chest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also caused my face to break out, I gave it a few tries to see if my skin just needed to get used to it</li>
            <li> I used this a few years ago but for some unknown reason stopped??</li>
            <li> So, whenever I try something like this I apply it to half my face {and half of other afflicted areas}, and if I appear to see results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks every other night, so it&#x27;s hard to rate it.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t understand why the prices  have gone up and the amount per package has gone down:  </li>
            <li> Tonight I seen this tor $5  which pissed me off because I bought the 10% oil-free watered down formula</li>
            <li> Beats any other cream, lotion, serum, elixir etc out there!</li>
            <li> (I have used other glycolic products before), which makes the skin look a little smoother, firmer, less wrinkly.</li>
            <li> It does still sting a little bit, but much less than the other brand.</li>
            <li> Acids are all the rage for skin care, which sounds crazy, and one does read real horror stories on-line, not only of over-doing it at homeâsome spas and clinics are not safe either.</li>
            <li> In addition to changing my pillow case everyday other day I literally stopped breaking out.</li>
            <li> I have turned 40 this year and suddenly have come down with adult acne and was just about desperate.  </li>
            <li> I use a glycolic facial cleanser by Serious Skin Care.Â  </li>
            <li> and I have less wrinkles now than I had when I was 35.  </li>
            <li> It did not bother my eczema, I even feel itchy less often now.</li>
            <li> It does cause a slight tingling sensation because of the AHA, but that tells me that it&#x27;s working to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> I have less break outs.</li>
            <li> and I do think my skin tends to wrinkle less.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s so slight</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research of various products both here on Amazon and on the web site Makeup Alley, and after my failed experiment with the Alpha Hydrox Souffle mentioned above, I decided to try this product, the 10% Enhanced Lotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does sting slightly when I put it on</li>
            <li> So I figured I would find the ingredients in this regimen and see if I could find something for less money.  </li>
            <li> And I still have over half the bottle of AHA cleanser</li>
            <li> I am a black</li>
            <li> In addition to my face and neck, I have be using it on hands and they are smoother and less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> I ordered from the aha official website and received through fed ex in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I use a LOT less than I used to</li>
            <li> It looked brighter, and my face had less redness.  </li>
            <li> Now I use about half a pea size or less.</li>
            <li> Slight tingle.</li>
            <li> Slight burn on the arms</li>
            <li> but less like drain cleaner on your skin..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has helped reduce wrinkling around the eyes and neck and the price was a lot less than AmLactin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AHA helps even out my skin tone, reduce acne, and slightly improve wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after only about three weeks of use, my skin tone has lightened overall.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t even find anything less which is nuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black and latino</li>
            <li> The lines I do have look softer, and even the crease between my eyebrows is softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have unpredictable acne.</li>
            <li> I still recommend this product, however you may find after using it for a while that your skin gets used to it and the effect is slightly diminished.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a ridiculous price increase and enough for me to look for another product with glycolic acid!!  </li>
            <li> but I was skeptical because I am an African American.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received an outdated product or it was just in outdated packaging, but the lotion itself left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> Also, my eczema has acted up the past year and nothing i used seemed to work (i went through tons of products, some eased the itching, but my face and skin was still uneven, blotchy, dry, and broke out a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth my time or trouble.</li>
            <li> I looked like a mess.</li>
            <li> Personally, I just think this product is not good for people who have acne, but it could just be me.</li>
            <li> Previously I had little clogged pores on my forehead</li>
            <li> Burns very little (i hardly notice the sting from it, and it only lasts 3 seconds).</li>
            <li> But when I do use it during the day it encourages my skin to form a greasy film over it that feels tight.  </li>
            <li> so my scars were very dark, almost black.</li>
            <li> The bad: it does sting for 10 seconds, it has a mild smell.</li>
            <li> i typed up uneven skin tone and at the time i saw this product with 4 and a half stars but using it</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re usually too greasy, they make me break out (which I am still very prone to even in my 30s), or they&#x27;re just too expensive to justify using with no discernible results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Junk...made my skin super dry..even following the instructions on how to apply and then limiting myself to less times than the instructions called for...just hated it and made my skin break out.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a longggg way.</li>
            <li> it stung my face a little.  </li>
            <li> It does have just a little burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> I think the lotion tends to break me out a little bit around my chin, so I don&#x27;t use it there anymore, but a dab on my nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the AHA lotion for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> and I did feel a little tingling.</li>
            <li> I wish all my purchases could be made online with as little hassle as these.</li>
            <li> This is a little embarrassing sharing all this</li>
            <li> It does sting a little after applying, but I feel that means it is working</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, a little background information about me.  </li>
            <li> and not the using this for a little over a week</li>
            <li> It stings a little on face</li>
            <li> Within a week I did but not before my skin had it&#x27;s little reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt a little tighter.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a little improvement.  </li>
            <li> It has been a little over a year of using this product</li>
            <li> Like Brylcreem, a little dab will do.</li>
            <li> After a little time applying Alpha Hydrox Lotion.</li>
            <li> It does burn a little, but it&#x27;s not unreasonable.</li>
            <li> It does leave a little bit of that greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Feels a little greasy, but does its job.</li>
            <li> I use it on both my face and my arms; I have a lot of little age spots on my arms.  </li>
            <li> once - maybe because it stung a little.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even noticed but one or two little pimples try to pop up, and they literally seem to just fizzle and die after applying this stuff.</li>
            <li> little dab&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and need to use a thick, heavy cream.</li>
            <li> I say just about anyone because those with very sensitive skin might find it irritating to their delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> It is sour a little bit, but it does its job!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I supplement with an eye gel or cream because this stuff is a bit harsh and tingles a little</li>
            <li> I spent about $40, instead of $300!!!  </li>
            <li> My skin is no longer rough nor dull.</li>
            <li> Over the next couple of days, the situation went from bad to nearly cured.  </li>
            <li> I finally feel comfortable going without my make up, which I haven&#x27;t done that since I was 13, pathetic huh?  </li>
            <li> My skin shows that - a bit leathery and uneven.  </li>
            <li> I used this along with the AHA foam wash, and 48 hours after my face was ten times worse.</li>
            <li> I would like to provide a few suggestions for its use.  </li>
            <li> This removed all the dead skin cells, and makes your skin smoother for applying make-up.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days, peeling begins.  </li>
            <li> It does sting for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I dont think it prevents breakouts because I had few breakouts since using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite itchy for a few days.</li>
            <li> Will update once I see results after few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> when it stopped working i took a guess its just uneven skin tone so on amazon</li>
            <li> i wouldnt recommend it if your trying to get rid of uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> I waited to do my Reviews because I purchased a few products &amp; wanted to try them Separately.  </li>
            <li> I had gone without my Hormone cream for a few Mo&#x27;s &amp; noticed I was getting what &amp;#34;appeared to be&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> AHA is also one of the few products that I have read that you can use during pregnancy, unlike the BHA counterpart.</li>
            <li> I have used the products for a few days now</li>
            <li> Also works well to remove the dead skin that causes a condition called ichthyosis vulgaris that causes crocodile looking skin.</li>
            <li> and I have a few.  </li>
            <li> well, please don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I still have a few bumps pop up from time to time...</li>
            <li> My makeup would wear uneven, sink into pores, ball up with flaky skin...</li>
            <li> I always wait few mins before applying cream/lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is FIRM, and the clearest it has been in years.</li>
            <li> and then I applied heavy moisturizer over it, and the stinging sensation subsided.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after I wash my face at night, and then put a heavy moisturizing cream on after it.  </li>
            <li> me this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and then it goes away after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I still have a few here or there, but when I use this lotion they decrease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a few months</li>
            <li> I think I can see a noticeable difference in my skin texture after using it once a day for a few days.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks my skin adapts so I start using it morning and night.</li>
            <li> Then I take a break for a few weeks and do it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting it on at night a few nights a week.</li>
            <li> i apply this to it few times through out day and zit</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this ,i bought this a while ago</li>
            <li> After using it a few times I did notice that my face was looking smoother.</li>
            <li> The acids in the product act to remove dead, dulling skin cells, giving skin a fresher look.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of dead skin cells, without being harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> It did however remove dead skin cells without causing redness.  </li>
            <li> Another product that was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It also helps prevent acne because the dead skin cells aren&#x27;t clogging up my pores anymore.  </li>
            <li> my son has been on doxy and retin a for a few years, and using this as a spot treatment does seem to reduce cysts quicker.</li>
            <li> im going to suggest maybe using it all over a few times a week.</li>
            <li> This product has a few cons, so I&#x27;ll start with them.</li>
            <li> Over time, that was too harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly I don&#x27;t use this every day, or if I do use it everyday I take a mini break after 3 or 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every time i think I will try another one, my skin starts breaking out within a few days of use</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m less than 1/8 done with the container!</li>
            <li> you can put this on your face, and not get half of the stuff stuck under your fingernails because you have to scoop it out of a jar...try it!</li>
            <li> Also, it is difficult to find in local drug stores and other stores.</li>
            <li> I am seeing some slow changes using this product every other night (I am alternating with a Retin-A).</li>
            <li> I have very delicate skin, and I can only tolerate Retin-A twice a week, or I get a lot of irritation and redness (not cute redness</li>
            <li> I would recommend diluting this lotion, one part AHA lotion, one part plain moisturizer (1:1), then two parts AHA, one part plain moisturizer until your skin gets used to the AHA lotion (it took me about 2 wk to get used to).</li>
            <li> It just seems like plain lotion.</li>
            <li> I saw DRAMATIC improvement after only 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe some overall evening of skintone but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> You will feel a very slight tingling sensation when you apply the lotion</li>
            <li> So my breakouts have been far less extreme, but I have some bad scarring.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard line running down my face {and...</li>
            <li> It brings all the bad things out of your skin at first.  </li>
            <li> I had them already pretty bad on my legs.  </li>
            <li> , my kids are blessed with my genes and are suffering from pretty bad acne.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t broken out on my forehead for a long time and</li>
            <li> Been using it 2x/day for the past few months.</li>
            <li> so I am a little skeptical about seeing any type of change in my skin in the future.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this one tended to break me out on my chin and along side my nose with little white pimples.</li>
            <li> and my face felt so raw.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only issue I encountered was with applying the AHA enhanced lotion to my neck area, which resulted in a painful red rash/reaction.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for a month now and see very little change.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other products and this works!!!</li>
            <li> Prior to then, it was always the expensive ones -</li>
            <li> this small 6oz bottle lasts me for months.</li>
            <li> in the past couple of months i&#x27;ve improved my diet and also incorporated gym trips.  </li>
            <li> Not sure, but its a shame.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to use on my back though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magical product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its working.</li>
            <li> On the show, one lady mentioned that she had used glycolic acid in the past but that it stung when she applied it, so she stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> When the peeling stops, usually in just a day or two, I resume using the product.  </li>
            <li> No more lizard skin or sandpaper knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> But I am not sure about the effects yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using on my hips/thighs/booty in conjunction with zone-specific exercises (which in the past by itself hasn&#x27;t produced results like these).</li>
            <li> I believe the seller should start shipping the product in a small box instead of an envelope to prevent this from happening in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I decided to try this product out and start using a blade, no more ingrown hair and scars are clearing up.</li>
            <li> Not sure about wrinkles....</li>
            <li> I didnt see results in diminishing wrinkles and burns your face but small price to pay no?</li>
            <li> I usually avoid any product with that ingredient</li>
            <li> I PUT A SMALL AMOUNT ON EVERY NIGHT</li>
            <li> Past 5-7 years</li>
            <li> It makes sense to remove dead skin in order to allow moisturizers and face creams to soak in and start working!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using moisturizers in the past</li>
            <li> was waste of money!</li>
            <li> Make sure to FOLLOW WITH SUNSCREEN as your &amp;#34;new skin&amp;#34; needs the protection desperately!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for the past 5-6 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the lotion or just time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a wash cloth to wash, because that is too harsh for the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> at least a few weeks is needed before seeing results.</li>
            <li> But it gotten worst when I tried it, gave me more pimples I gave it a try for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I usually use luxury products.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to work like that,</li>
            <li> I feel like it will take me over half a year to use up this bottle, seriously.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually get pimples with it, but</li>
            <li> I shower as usual, and closer to the end, I take a quarter size amount of this lotion, slather it on my arms, wait two minutes, and wash off.</li>
            <li> Was using expensive lotion before, but this is one third the price and works faster.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this means its working or not.</li>
            <li> Getting rid of small bumps and improving clarity and skintone of my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is one of several products I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon that contains the ingredient propylene glycol.</li>
            <li> But after the summer past my skin was STILL breaking out.</li>
            <li> No more face or body acne with this.</li>
            <li> A warning was issued on the lable, but silly me didn&#x27;t think it would be that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> My skin is healthy-looking, smooth and I haven&#x27;t had bad eczema breakouts this year (last year was horrible for me, but this helped reign my skin back in.)</li>
            <li> I used to get some very few ingrown hairs after shaving</li>
            <li> AHA works by removing the dead cells that make skin look thick and dull.</li>
            <li> I have a few lines on my face, but nothing serious.</li>
            <li> They were just little ones trapped under my skin&#x27;s surface that were going to rear their ugly heads sooner or later.</li>
            <li> This product Made my soon break out worse:( fast delivery though.. just not right for my skin.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the long review.</li>
            <li> I have stuggled since my teens with sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin that sometimes develops dry spots in the brutal Ohio winters.</li>
            <li> No more chicken skin on arms, back of thighs or butt.</li>
            <li> My mom saw me without makeup and was literally shocked that my skin looked so clear!</li>
            <li> The product is hard to moisturize into the skin.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just so hard to tell.   </li>
            <li> and I notice hardly any stinging when using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, what this does do, is soften the hard scales so that they do not crack and bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is to hard to find.</li>
            <li> Well, I found out the hard way</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t use retinol products, my eyes burn so badly all day after using them  (even if I don&#x27;t it near my eyes they still burn).  </li>
            <li> DO NOT USE IT UNDER THE EYES, the skin is too delicate there, and do use a moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li> I having been using Alpha Hydrox for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> This just feels icky yo use before bed</li>
            <li> I am generously giving this 2 stars because at least it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like to judge a product before I&#x27;ve given it at least 3 months</li>
            <li> It takes time, but stick with it at least once a day, and you will see results.</li>
            <li> I have problem skin prone to at least two cystic bumps a month.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a 10% for at least $5</li>
            <li> the shower late at night,</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing this out because I discovered this too late.</li>
            <li> She thought I had on at least something to cover my scarring</li>
            <li> If you are pampering and plucking, put a thick layer of the lotion in the problem spot areas and let it soak into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The scars started fading slowly.</li>
            <li> It evens out all the patches on my face, leaving it sofffffft as a baby&#x27;s tush.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well and fast, without leaving any nasty sticky residue, and there&#x27;s no built-up of sebum like with other creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel a bit silly writing a review for a product after only 2 uses, but my results have been that dramatic that I just couldn&#x27;t wait to share.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately,Â  at the time I didn&#x27;t have any other purchases for Amazon and this is an add on item.  </li>
            <li> Nothing, I mean nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> Since using this lotion, no more acne!</li>
            <li> this has seriously changed my skin (at least while i continue to use it).</li>
            <li> and I hate it even though it has really high ratings.</li>
            <li> We live where the winter&#x27;s can get very cold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I had these small bumps, in the fold behind my knees.</li>
            <li> Less visible lines and tighter skin!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously try this.</li>
            <li> It seriously burned my skin</li>
            <li> It seriously helps the healing process and makes everything go away</li>
            <li> The product left me with bad acne.</li>
            <li> , I always looked bad the next day.  </li>
            <li> Although I rarely get acne on my forehead, I still get those nasty buggers on my cheeks &amp; chin.</li>
            <li> My breakouts have decreased by at least 90% after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I went to my doctor and my d and told me this product was not good for the skin</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;ve neglected your skin over the years it&#x27;s not fair that you should expect miracles over night from this or any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading up on exfoliation I found that physical/mechanical scrubs are NOT good for people with acne prone skin and chemical exfoliants ARE</li>
            <li> Use only one time and throw it away in the trash :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 80% ( chemical peel ) and that&#x27;s still a weak chem peel too.</li>
            <li> ; reviews only to be disappointed when it doesn&#x27;t cure yours.</li>
            <li> and it sucks!</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to be less product in the size bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never been bad enough to resort to Accutane, but I definitely hated going outside without makeup on.  </li>
            <li> Also, my neck and chest where I applied it looks like it has broken out in a rash.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s getting worse</li>
            <li> I also use their glycolic peel and glycolic pads once a week and have never experienced any burning, tingling or irritation with those products.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve suffered from body acne you know how embarrassing it is and how frustrating it can be to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Alas, as I already know, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the lotion a.m. and p.m. for approximately 10 months.</li>
            <li> In the summer when i might not want to wear lotion every day, this makes additional lotion seem unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve skipped using it a handful of times and it seems like my skin immediately gets worse.</li>
            <li> A lot of acne scarring has decreased so I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup often anymore</li>
            <li> My skin felt moist but not oily, almost like wearing a thin face mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% behind this product, but I think it is doing what it is supposed to for my face.</li>
            <li> It firms, smoothes, reduces pore sizes and evens out skintone and isn&#x27;t irritating.</li>
            <li> For about 2 months, I could not figure out why my breakouts were worse and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shocking how fast this works when your pimple is just forming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued by Adult acne on my (bald) head for years and the skin dries out very badly making it worse.</li>
            <li> I also felt no stinging or other painful sideffects of using an acidic lotion.</li>
            <li> This stopped my breakouts (seriously!)</li>
            <li> Used this in connection with vitamin E oil and though stretch marks seriously run in my family, I didn&#x27;t get any on my stomach during pregnancy!  </li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results</li>
            <li> i have noticed a dramatic difference with my acne and just the texture of my face.</li>
            <li> I hate putting it on at night because my fiance always gets himself a mouthful of chemicals when he tries to kiss me on the cheek.</li>
            <li> That is VERY weak.</li>
            <li> It feels to greasy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I am returning the product.</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical about people reviews</li>
            <li> Wrong answer</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, my obnoxious skin doesn&#x27;t seem to like the face lotion and wash.</li>
            <li> like it suggest i&#x27;m wondering if i ordered the wrong thing..</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I did.  </li>
            <li> Its weird, like it has taken years off my face.</li>
            <li> for now 5 stars, if anything changes ill provide an update :</li>
            <li> After a series of expensive test and research, my derm said it was contact dermatitis from using this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this hasn&#x27;t been a miracle-worker for me, it has taken some time to get them to go away, but it IS working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> principle as the expensive benzoyl peroxide treatments you see on TV..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive elsewhere now, too.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face and on my body and in all cases it seems that the product doesn&#x27;t absurd at all.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical using for two weeks,I like it.</li>
            <li> But last summer my skin had began breaking out horribly.</li>
            <li> I was so sad.</li>
            <li> I burnt horribly the next day from 20 min. of sun exposure!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I found my bottle and applied it to the affected areas over night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a science minded person {it&#x27;s my job, in fact}, and I&#x27;m hugely skeptical of all products&#x27; claims to efficacy.  </li>
            <li> know you might be skeptical</li>
            <li> hope this helps someone because I know how frustrating problematic skin can be!</li>
            <li> if any; either that, or I&#x27;d react poorly to it and would wake up with a bad breakout.    </li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox doesn&#x27;t smell bad; just not great, either, but that disappears as you apply.</li>
            <li> I had a HORRIBLE breakout that pushed me over the edge mentally to find something that would help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so discouraged because my skin looks awful under foundation due to the flakiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two nights of using this product and the flakes are gone, and</li>
            <li> It does have a slight tingle to it, but nothing awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a persistent case of keratosis pilaris (the chicken bumps that people get on their arms) for years.  </li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t helped my skin at all (hormonal acne), and stings like crazy if you have a cut, etc.</li>
            <li> I was desperate, though, so I still used them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using neutrogena, aveeno and those horrible harsh chemical peels in vain for years thinking it was helping my skin</li>
            <li> Stinks to me didn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this because I have tried just about everything out there on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this followed by 5-10% benzoyl peroxide to imitate a very expensive treatment sent monthly.  </li>
            <li> I like that I don&#x27;t have to be stingy with the lotion since it isn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> I get cystic acne which seems impossible to treat and has to run its course.</li>
            <li> Broke out really bad around my chin and mouth.</li>
            <li> also gave me a bad rash</li>
            <li> but i had bad acne scars</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any bad effects.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad except for my pride.</li>
            <li> I feel bad buying this stuff because it does not work.</li>
            <li> I had not had skin this bad ever.</li>
            <li> Dimethicone is bad no matter what, but it wont hurt your skin appearance if you have no acne.</li>
            <li> it smells bad.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I&#x27;m utterly shocked at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was really shocked by the comment).  </li>
            <li> After using it, I got horribly painful cystic pimples.</li>
            <li> acid.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that they don&#x27;t anymore.  </li>
            <li> My skin just didn&#x27;t like it :(</li>
            <li> This stuff made me break out like CRAZY!</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> price was also enticing for me, under 10 bucks, as I&#x27;d hate to try a $25-30 dollar lotion just to discover that it sucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I hated using them.</li>
            <li> im very disappointed and cant see that it is doing anything to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this lotion has given my skin the worst reaction of any skin care lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a shocking difference in my skin!    </li>
            <li> This is a horrible ingredient which should never be used on your skin!</li>
            <li> But I know that I will get them real bad some day on my forehead.</li>
            <li> , it did not go away and worst of of</li>
            <li> looks like it got worst...</li>
            <li> but for some reason it turned out to be a lot worst</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about AHA products but they all make me break out insanely.</li>
            <li> but it was horrible.</li>
            <li> but my face became worst</li>
            <li> but nothing horrible.</li>
            <li> If you have horrible acne like me, dimethicone is TERRIBLE for you!</li>
            <li> But a month ago I had literally the worst acne flare-up</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> In expensive way to brighten and clean facial skin.</li>
            <li> Make my skin rashes not working for me.. Use only one time and throw it away in the trash :(</li>
            <li> This is another product that no longer appears on the shelves of local stores. It contains an alpha hydroxy acid that works like an extremely slow-motion peel. If you use it all the time and stay out of the sun, it makes your skin look fresher and, I suppose, &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; Not appropriate, IMHO, for people with sensitive or aging skin.</li>
            <li> this works great ,removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> Item received as described. Good product for daily maintenance.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, my skin has been feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li> use it nightly but really haven&#x27;t seen much peeling of the facial skin. I am older woman and would like more alpha hydroxy in product</li>
            <li> As always, Alpha Hydrox is my favorite skin product.  Has been so for years.  It makes my skin feel smooth and seems to reduce lines.  I use it every day and many of my friends tell me SOMETHING is working to make me look younger than my years!  Is it the Alpha Hydrox?.....................I personally think so.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s supposed to sting, tickle, and leave the face dry, but most people said it went away after a few days. As for me, it didn&#x27;t go away even after a month, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just my face type, but this lotion left my face stinging, burning, and itchy on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I ordered this awhile ago.  The side states that tingling, etc. is normal, but I experienced nothing. The lotion seems like it is just regular lotion, and I have not noticed a difference.  I have used other AHA products, and could &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the AHA in the product- with this product, there was nothing... so I am a little skeptical about seeing any type of change in my skin in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this every day....in the am...under my sunSCREEN * OVER THE vit c SERUM!....lOVE IT....mY SKIN LOOKS GREAT...i&#x27;M 78YO.!</li>
            <li> This does work, but keep in mind that you need to continue your sun protection and keep using the product for best results. I had brown spots started on the side of my neck from driving and having the sun hit that side of my body, but after a week of using this they almost disappeared.</li>
            <li> I bought this b\c the reviews were high and ti seemed legit. I used this product for 2 days . Broke out really bad around my chin and mouth. It made my face very itchy and greasy. The product is hard to moisturize into the skin. It feels to greasy and uncomfortable. i will never buy glycolic acid again!! BTW i dont have sensitive skin and i do not break out much. The product left me with bad acne. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be drying &amp; itchy.  Also my mineral make up didn&#x27;t blend well over the top even after I waited for it to dry on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this product every evening and do believe it is helping my skin.  There is the slightest stinging sensation when applied but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to eliminate some post acne marks that I had and it worked very well. The only thing is that you cannot use it every night because since it is not oil free, it will cause some acne to come out - how ironic right? It helps with marks, but it also causes what you are trying to avoid. Wish this came as an oil free product.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my teens w/ their blemishes. Most have lightened and the break outs happen less often and are less severe. Worked better than an Rx for a topical antibiotic or pill. I can&#x27;t find this in my drug store any longer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought this 2 weeks ago. I read the reviews and they were overwhelmingly positive but having spent most my adult life (I&#x27;m 45 now) lavishing $150 brand name lotions on my face, I didn&#x27;t expect much from something that costs under $15.  All I can say is I&#x27;m utterly shocked at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of background. As noted, I&#x27;m 45. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in over 20 years. My skin is combination or dry. I definitely have some fine wrinkles below my eyes and some broken blood vessels on my cheeks (too many nights out on the town in my youth;-&gt;). I was a heavy smoker and used to &#x27;tan&#x27; a lot when I was younger. My skin shows that - a bit leathery and uneven.  Around 3 years ago, due to a move and other family events, I stopped religously using face cream every day. Prior to then, it was always the expensive ones - I tended to favor lancome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip to two weeks ago and I realized it was finally time to do something about my lifeless, uneven, and wrinkled skin. I actually debated plastic surgery. On a fluke I ordered the Alpha Hydrox because as noted the reviews were positive and I figured what the heck;-&gt;! I used it at night on my face and neck. It burned alittle (tingled is probably more accurate). I also noticed that it itched a bit on my neck. I stopped using it on my neck (which is actually wrinkle free anyways) because either the lotion or the itching caused my neck to be red the next day.  So, nightly I use the Alpha Hydrox sometimes with a bit of Cereve face lotion (which I bought at the same time). During the day, I put on a basic moisturizer w/ SPF and thats it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 week ago, my husband said out of the blue -- &#x27;you know, your skin really looks great&#x27; (anyone married a long time knows how UNobservant husbands can be ..so I was really shocked by the comment).  Then my children&#x27;s nanny said that I look really refreshed and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I look in the mirror, I honestly can&#x27;t believe the difference.My skin tone has definitely improved - the broken capillaries look smaller, the sun/age spots seem to have faded, the fine lines around my eyes have improved (although not gone away entirely). But most of all, I feel that my skin is glowing and its almost like its added lost volume to my face.  I WAS NOT EXPECTING anything -- so imagine my surprise to not only have noticed the change myself but to have both my husband and my kids&#x27; nanny point it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product. As noted, I have dry to combination skin and no problem with acne (although I did have 1 little red raised area for a day after about 3 days of using the lotion..it never formed a pimple but I did worry it might ..it went away by the next day).  For me, this lotion improved the tone and made me look - and most importantly feel - younger.  My skin looks more supple and glowing and has evened out a lot.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of pimples which is what I bought it for. Doesn&#x27;t sting my face like other reviewers might point out. Just try it out, it works!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use, this lotion made no considerable changes in the fine line on my face. In fact it seemed to dry it out. I did use an adddtional moisturizer as was recommended on the box. It made my face tingle, which made me feel that there would be changes, but there was NO CHANGE.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS !! I&#x27;ve never submitted an online review before,  but because this product was so effective, I am compelled to write one now. Yes it most definitely made my skin DRAMATICALLY smoother and clearer,and after only a few days of use, people were commenting on how young I looked and how wrinkle -free I am for my age (56, people think I am in my early 40&#x27;s, ha!)  but the reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because it also seemed to make my skin LIGHTER and I am already white and fair complected and didn&#x27;t really want to get any lighter, but none the less, it is an amazing product that will definitely make your skin smoother and make you LOOK YOUNGER :-)  Here&#x27;s what I found it does:  SHRINKS LARGE PORES  BRIGHTENS SKIN TONE  SMOOTHS WRINKLES  FADES FRECKLES/SUN SPOTS  After about 2 weeks of consistent use, applied once at night and then once in the morning, I felt my skin needed a rest, so now I use it only once a day for a week, putting it on just before bedtime, then don&#x27;t use for a few days, (only use a coconut oil moisturizer) and that&#x27;s how I use it, intermittently.   I also only use a small amount at a time and spread it on top of my slightly damp face, I find that works best/improves absorbability.  DO NOT USE IT UNDER THE EYES, the skin is too delicate there, and do use a moisturizer as well.  All in all this product really does what it says it will do, and that&#x27;s something great !</li>
            <li> Watching an episode of \\&quot;Oprah\\&quot; on the topic of skin care, I learned that one of the best ingredients of a skin product was alpha hydroxy, which has been clinically proven to renew and nourish skin.  I was aware of this product and so decided to try this one as all of the scores of other skin products I&#x27;ve used over the years have either made my face greasy feeling or dry and peeling - I am 50 and have had very dry skin all my life.  This product really works!  Not only has my dryness virtually disappeared but I believe the texture and firmness of my skin has shown improvement as well as my occasional break-outs (can&#x27;t believe at my age I still can break out)have ceased and the dark spots that appeared with menopause have also dimished.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you can buy this in the stores anymore.  Years ago, I could find it just about anywhere.  I didn&#x27;t think it existed until I ran across it at Amazon.  I&#x27;ve used different products since. So, listen up, I believe that AHA is a strong contributor to my skin looking as well as it does.  I&#x27;ve been using different strengths of AHA&#x27;s for years and have great looking skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Lotion is not thick and sticky.  Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve been a long time user of this product and would suggest it to anyone of any age grp.</li>
            <li> As a retired hairdresser I have some training in skin care and the Alpha Hydrox line is effective and modestly priced. It works better than the designer products at triple the price. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on any product with less than 8% glycolic acid, and don&#x27;t be suckered into buying brands that promise more than 14%. The FDA mandates no more than 14%, and those products that claim higher concentrations are \\&quot;fudging\\&quot; their formulations. One thing to remember? When you try a new product give it 6 weeks of use before deciding whether or not it works for you. It takes 6 weeks for skin cells to go through their \\&quot;life\\&quot; cycle. It&#x27;s only after a full cycle that you will see full and true results. I love this whole line of skin care and have been using it for several years. I just turned 50, and people are constantly asking what skin care products I use. You simply cannot beat the Alpha Hydrox line for effectivness and cost!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion! I have minor acne scars and this slowly lightens them away :) It a also improves the texture of stretch marks. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks but I see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and at night.It has definitely toned my skin on my face and has cleared up some red acne spots that I&#x27;ve had for months. Works great together with the foaming face wash. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Ive never put a review on the internet before until now.   Anyways....I hit the jackpot with this product! Ive used a number of razor bump products designed for people of color, but none seemed to work. I started using this product about 3-4 months ago and right now I dont have a single razor bump. Plus my skin has lightened up quite a bit. It didnt drastically lighten my skin, I can stil see some dark spots, but it looks 1000x better than what it looked like before. When it pertains to the remaining dark spots, Im considering doing a acid peel to finish myself off. My dark spots were mainly on my shaving areas, my neck &amp; jawline. But I had minimal spots on my jawline.  FYI....I didnt suffer from the HUGE type of razor bumps....mine were puss filled pimple sized razor bumps; but I had a bunch of em&#x27;.   My skin complexion is similar to the Rapper T.I. i.e. Im sorta beige looking/light brown.....hence I was able to notice my skin tone changing within the first 2 months.   Oh...btw...in order to heal myself from razor bumps I had to \\&quot;release\\&quot; the ingrown hairs that I did have prior to using this product. I first shaved with some Dudu black soap and a safety razor...then I grab a sterilized safety pin, a make-up mirror and just went outside under the sunlight so I could get a clear view of the ingrown hairs. And like I stated before Im light brown, so i could easily see the hairs under my skin once the sunlight hit em. The precedure took a while. I think I pulled out more than 100 hairs over time....but it was well worth the reward. If you have a more darker complexion then you might want to have someone else find the ingrown hairs for you. Just lay back and have them use a small desk lamp or anything that wil help them spot the ingrown hairs.   btw....this small 6oz bottle lasts me for months. But keep in mind that Im only using it on area where I shave (Neck and jawline). I use this product once a day on non shaving days and twice a day 24 hours after a shave (right after I shave I rub my face with a alum block....then after i rinse that off I use African shea butter mixed with tea tree oil until the 24 hour mark).   When I use the acid lotion I only have to use around 5 pea sized drops for my entire neck and cheeks. Hence why one bottle lasts me for so long.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve been using this product for around 5+ months. it stung a lot in the beginning and became a little better once I started using it regularly. the cream isn&#x27;t very moisturizing and to me doesn&#x27;t have a velvet-ey texture that some of my other moisturizers have.  i guess it did seem to work but only after a few months. my skin&#x27;s texture feels somewhat softer but i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s entirely because of this. in the past couple of months i&#x27;ve improved my diet and also incorporated gym trips.  i recently switched my cleansers from the PINK loreal 360 to the apricot scrub also by Loreal 360 and since the scrub dries out my face, i used this and it STUNG SO MUCH. i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and i have normal/dry skin  i have a little product left but i am not repurchasing and i&#x27;m switching to st. ivers elastic collagen? cream.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I read all the good reviews on this product. I couldnt wait to use it. I suffer from minor adult acne and with my wedding coming up, I wanted to make sure my face was clear. I think stress was making me breakout more than usual, I started to get lots of red spots. I used this along with the AHA foam wash, and 48 hours after my face was ten times worse. I had little bumps all over my face and more red spots than I ever had. I really wanted to like this product but I&#x27;m proof that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox works great. I have tried an AHA that I picked up from a local store before, and I find this works much better. My skin is soft and blemish free, which is something I could never really achieve with the store bought brand. For some reason the store bought brand always gave me whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;This will sting the first few times you use it, but don&#x27;t give up on it. It&#x27;s worth it to stick with it.</li>
            <li> l saw this product advertised when reknowned dermatologist Doris Day appeared on Dr. Oz.  She recommended using St. Ives Collagen elastin moisturizer during the day and the alpha hydrox at night.  The St. Ives is $5 a tub.  I put a lot of it on first thing in the morning, and let my skin soak up the pudding aspect of it.  I use alpha hydrox at night.  I look younger now than I did when I started using the product which may be 5-8 years ago at about age 50.  It is not oily at all.  People always compliment me on my beautiful skin and they think I am 45-48, when I am actually 58.  The product is an exfoliant so it is always having you show new skin, which keeps your skin looking younger.  I always wear 100% sunscreen if out in the direct sun.  Now I don&#x27;t understand why the prices  have gone up and the amount per package has gone down:  capitalism at its finest.  If anyone knows of a similar product, I would love to know what it is if it has the same formula.</li>
            <li> love it! has smoothed my face and body. Also, if I have a breakout coming on I put some of this on and it seems to keep the breakout away. stings a bit, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this lotion has given my skin the worst reaction of any skin care lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can&#x27;t believe it because I do not have sensitive skin. I was so excited to buy it after reading all these rave reviews. I have a tan, olive complexion, good skin, but wanted to smooth out my pores and see if it would remove some small dark spots.  I have only been using it a few days and all of a sudden there are red patches everywhere on my face and what looks like hundred of small red bumps!  It looks like I have acne!  Also, my neck and chest where I applied it looks like it has broken out in a rash. I thought maybe it was just the first day and it would go away but it&#x27;s getting worse and I can&#x27;t take more than a few days of this.  Sadly, I am returning the product.</li>
            <li> I have been having acne issues since i was 13 and im now 23. Nothing ever seem to work for the acne scar. I am usually skeptical about people reviews but I heard that AHA could help and i gave it a try. My goodness! Its only been 2 weeks and i am already seeing great improvements in the texture, tone and the overall health of my face. The price is just right and the quantity is definitely worth the bang for your buck. Don&#x27;t be scared when you get a burning sensation, thats normal and proof that it is working. Out of all the products i have used to treat my acne marks, this is by far the best and the price is a bonus! This will have your skin looking so young, fresh and alive. You will glow! Im so happy and slowly regaining confidence. i can&#x27;t wait to see future results.</li>
            <li> Have been using off and on for years. Back again to stay. I don&#x27;t have the problem of skin break outs and irritation I&#x27;ve had with other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years, and I would recommend it to just about anyone.  I say just about anyone because those with very sensitive skin might find it irritating to their delicate skin.  I have fair skin, but not too sensitive so it works for me.  I would like to provide a few suggestions for its use.  Be sure to wait 10 minutes after you wash your face to be certain your skin is completely dry.  This way the lotion is at full  strength, not the slightest bit diluted.    This lotion is good too as a first AHA lotion, if you want to go on to a stronger AHA product higher than a 10% solution.  This helps your skin adapt to the lotion to help  prevent irritation.  After I had a couple of moles removed on my face a few years back, I developed flakey skin cells on the scar area.  This removed all the dead skin cells, and makes your skin smoother for applying make-up.  My local drug store that used to carry this no longer does, so I have to buy it online.  More and more of my favorite products are going this way.  Probably to make way for the, \\&quot;latest thing\\&quot; products.  Not sure, but its a shame.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of lotion and moisturizers, and Alpha Hydrox works best for me.  My problem is dry, flaking skin.  Alpha Hydrox moisturizes and exfoliates at the same time!  Nothing else I have tried has made my skin clear and healthy like Alpha Hydrox.  I have no association with this product or this company, except as a satisfied customer!  I have been using Alpha Hydrox for years, and although I have tried many other products - I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> works great!!! I can see the difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my back and chest for two weeks now. I have old acne scars and minimal active acne. I cna&#x27;t review this product individually since I&#x27;m using this AHA product in combination with [[ASIN:B002NKMGCA PanOxyl Acne Facial Wash - 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide , 5.5-Ounce  (156 g) Tube]] I use the Benzoyl Peroxide in the shower to wash my back and chest with. After drying off, I use the AHA. Since I started using these two products about two weeks ago, I have noticed that I have not any any new breakouts on my back or chest. The old acne scars are starting to disappear but no significant changes in the old marks. I will admit that the marks DO appear lighter but not gone ... yet. I bought two bottles and I&#x27;m going to continue to use all of it and see where we stand. I think it&#x27;s a step in the right direction.    Side Note: I do not use this on my face as it seemed to make me breakout. I gave it a week on  my face and I actually got new pimples on my face. And I rarely get breakouts on my face. So I did something different. I went to a local cosmetic store and actually paid 3x the price for one of those very \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; AHA cream in the 10% concentration. That product worked very nicely on my face and no new breakouts have occurred. It was $30 and a fraction of the amount of this stuff but it works nicely on my face. Too expensive to use on my back though.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because it goes on smoother and lighter but it&#x27;s just not as good as the Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12%. The results are noticeably better/ more even toned with the souffle and I can feel it working. 2% makes a difference - I might try to find an even higher level after I readjust (but I may just be being greedy because the souffle is great!)</li>
            <li> This definitely helps get rid of stubborn acne and residual redness. However, be careful...particularly careful with your face. I only used it once a day and it made my skin peel a LOT and became very rough - my skin is usually normal (not overly dry or oily). It also gave me contact dermatitis in one area - which I wonder if that&#x27;s what other reviewers may have mistaken for acne.</li>
            <li> I having been using Alpha Hydrox for at least 10 years.  Can no longer purchase it locally and have, of course, found it on Amazon.com!    It is the best product I have ever used for keeping my face younger looking and free of most acne flareups.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily, sensitive and problematic, but I bought this lotion and it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate acne or oiliness.    I use this twice a day and I have noticed a shocking difference in my skin!    My breakouts are healing much faster than normal, a few new ones were coming out at first, but that&#x27;s pretty much stopped now.    This product works better than ANY of my Rx acne treatments, and Proactive and Clinique acne regimens.    Compared to tretinoin creams, benzol peroxide cream, a sulfur cleanser, and solodyn pill, this lotion works better than all of those. I never had these results so quickly.    I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, I am 21, SO I cannot attest to that aspect.    The smell is a bit funky, and it tingles a bit, but didn&#x27;t bother my skin much&amp;my skin is VERY sensitive! Aveeno products irritate my face. This product tingles barely enough to notice.    Also, a little goes a longggg way. You do not need much of this, at least my skin doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magical product. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for anyone who is prone to oily skin. Of course the bottle states for dry skin. With religious use it is good at smoothing the skin, but don&#x27;t look to it for a magical acne treatment as some have suggested. Personally, it wasn&#x27;t anything special enough that I would consider purchasing again. It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other product you could grab at your local drug store, etc. As far as the seller, it arrived promptly and I had no problems with it&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li> Pretty sad that I&#x27;m in my mid-20s &amp; still have acne. It isn&#x27;t severe as it once was during my middle school &amp; high school years, but in recent years its been pretty mild. I got the product around Xmas of 2009, hoping it would help with my blemishes. The first time upon application, I did get a deep tingling sensation on my face. The next morning, my skin was glowing radiantly &amp; my pores were shrinking. I was ecstatic that I found a product that would actually help my skin.  After several weeks from my initial use, I noticed the brown marks on my face slowly fade away &amp; disappear. Now that it&#x27;s May 2010 &amp; after using this product religiously every single night, I&#x27;m noticing that I need a stronger concentration of the Alpha hydroxy. I&#x27;m no longer feeling the tingling sensation on my face so I think my skin has definitely adapted to the AHA. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not totally acne-free. Although I rarely get acne on my forehead, I still get those nasty buggers on my cheeks &amp; chin. Once I&#x27;m finished with this product, I&#x27;ll go ahead &amp; purchase the souffle which has 12% of AHA. I&#x27;ll also buy the lactic acid 50% gel peel by SkinLaboratory as well.</li>
            <li> It arrived in great condition and when it was expected. I am not noticing any affects yet though. No red skin or burning. Not sure if its working. Been using it for about a month. I will keep using to see though.</li>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced. You can pay 4 to 5 times more on products that don&#x27;t hold a candle to this.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I&#x27;ve been using this particular product and product line for about 20 years. Yep, that&#x27;s right, about 20 years, maybe more.  Best skin care decision I ever made! If you&#x27;re consistent in using it, and I do so twice a day, it works and works very well.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love it.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments about my skin. It&#x27;s not only clear because of this product, but it glows. I started using it in my 20&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the reason why time has kind of stood still for my skin. People always think I&#x27;m much younger than the old lady I am.  I rarely write reviews, but this product, I thought, deserved it. Plus, I like spreading the word when I find something that works.  Faithful customer for life!</li>
            <li> I saw a dermatologist on Dr. Oz recommend glycolic acid for aging skin.  She actually said everyone should be using it because it encourages cell turnover and brightens skin, diminishing the signs of aging. On the show, one lady mentioned that she had used glycolic acid in the past but that it stung when she applied it, so she stopped using it.  The dermatologist replied that we&#x27;ve come a long way in skin care and that today&#x27;s glycolic acid doesn&#x27;t sting anymore. I&#x27;m here to tell you it does, especially around the lip area! I usually just blot with a cool wet facecloth and that stops the stinging. As far as effectiveness, it definitely works. Within a few days, peeling begins.  At this point I stop applying it and use a good moisturizer. When the peeling stops, usually in just a day or two, I resume using the product.  I alternate between glycolic acid and retinol, both of which cause peeling. I highly recommend this product. You can&#x27;t get a better product for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased three Alpha Hydrox products and although I have only been using them less than a month, I believe&lt;br /&gt;these products work better (for me, anyway) than products that are way more expensive.  The skin on my sagging face&lt;br /&gt;has definitely tightened!!  This product for me is probably most important--but I don&#x27;t want to be without all three--and&lt;br /&gt;at these prices, I can afford all three!!  Did I mention I am 79--almost 80--</li>
            <li> amazing line of products; inexpensive and very efficient. high concentration of active ingredients, no fragrance or coloring; i&#x27;m using the entire line-without a doubt beats high end brands like Peter Roth whose products are quite fascinating but glycolic producs didn&#x27;t really work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Got it pretty fast! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> IT&amp;#34;s okay,,,but Iguess I was expecting miracles. I will continue to use it.. Perhaps I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to se  a big diference.</li>
            <li> it tingles but works. leaves skin soft just what it should do. I suffer from clogged pores on my chin and this lotion helped me reduce those pores. better than retin A</li>
            <li> I purchasedd this along with the serum and I really don&#x27;t use it that much because I feel the serum does a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products, professional, cheap, expensive and this stuff does the trick. Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Biggest fear is that it will be discontinued  Excellent value  Alternate using it at nite with a night cream. Very effective for maintaining a smooth skin</li>
            <li> not able to use it much because its causing my wife to have breakouts but makes the skin more tight</li>
            <li> This lotion is terrific. Glycolic lotion is one of the AHA&#x27;s my dermatologist highly recommends, but the 10% content is hard to find and is so costly when I did find it...until I saw this lotion. I use it nightly after my glycolic toner. It&#x27;s smooth and it glides on, absorbing quickly. It helps to reduce lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been using it about one month and I love it. I&#x27;ll be re-ordering this.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good product for the price. I was afraid it was going to be less product in the size bottle but it was full up and thick and really strong. Don&#x27;t ever change the product, I use it for bumps that form on my skin and the skin does not slough off, my Dermatologist recommended it. The last product seemed to become less effective and I was sad because I was seeing less of a result and in the summer you want smooth skin. Now with each week my skin feels smooth and looks great! Thanks what a relief and I can actually afford this-it is something I need to be on for the rest of my life. You make me feel beautiful again! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for a couple of years. It&#x27;s been a great moisturizer for my face and neck. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly. I think it helps diminish fine lines and evens skin tone to some degree. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best Apha Hydroxy skin lotion that I have ever used!!  I have tried a variety of other brands but nothing comes close to the quality of this one.  I use it under my liquid foundation, as a night cream before bedtime, and as a moisturizer any time my skin feels dry.  It is the perfect blend so it never feels like you have something greasy on your face and neck. I have been using this product for 10 years or more and it is the only brand I will buy.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for dry, rough, or flaky skin. If you have really sensitive skin I&#x27;d avoid using it on the face, but as a therapeutic body lotion it&#x27;s fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel all silky while on and it&#x27;s unscented so you can faintly smell the acid, so I use a thin layer on arms and legs and then a regular body lotion on top. By second application, voila! No more lizard skin or sandpaper knees and elbows. Works much better than the stuff that dermatologists tell you to use that costs twice as much as smells terrible. The stuff that&#x27;s seven times the price doesn&#x27;t work as well as this. Very glad I found it online. [[ASIN:B000052YM7 Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion - 6 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> I use this on my face to manage my oily skin. Firstly it keeps oil down. Secondly,It reduces acne by drying up oil, yes it will dry out skin too much of your not careful. lastly it reduces dark spots quicker than anything I have ever used  because of the anti wrinkle properties, it helps soon regenerate fast</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;ve used it for yrs!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to try this lotion. I have sensitive, oily and mature skin. I know it is supposed to be for dry skin, but it really doesn&#x27;t make my skin any oilier than any other lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it a week and have noticed brighter, smoother facial skin. Fine lines seem to be disappearing. I am very pleased with this product and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Great! Love this lotion- I have very sensitive skin and I am able to tolerate using this lotion every day. It makes my skin very soft, evens the tone and reduces breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stubborn adult acne for years.  Lots of red scars.  This has helped clear it up dramatically in just a few weeks.  My face is clear, pores appear smaller, and skin is smoother.  Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn and costs a lot less than other similar products.  I definitely plan on trying out some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days of starting to use this product my lower cheeks become covered in bumps (not pimples) - not sure what these are but my skin looks and feels bumpy. It has been 2 days without use and the bumps have still not gone away. Has anyone else had this experience?</li>
            <li> i was familiar with the product before I ordered it. It was sent in due time and it was packed well. I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it, good moisturizer for my face</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest best kept secret to perfect skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I used to use this many years ago (in my 20&#x27;s) and only stopped because I could no longer find it in the stores. I&#x27;ve always credited it with the fact that I look younger than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times you use it, your face may get a bit red and sting. This is temporary. I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t find this to be an issue. Since I had read it could happen, it didn&#x27;t deter me. It was very slight and not a big deal. You do NOT want to use it and go out in the sun. You WILL burn if you do that. Best to use it before bed. Keeps my skin glowy, clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended on a popular TV show and after using it for months, I agree.  It smooths and exfoliates with a higher glycolic content than most over the counter alpha hydrox products.  The price is right, too.  I use it nightly.</li>
            <li> You can really feel this lotion tingle for skin changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It keeps my skin bright! Love it! Other brands charge so much more for the same ingredient. I will keep buying this in the future.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t really comment because I stopped using this after a week. it stung my face a little.  I started using Jan Marini&#x27;s Bioglycolic face lotion, a little more expensive but great product.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this because I have tried just about everything out there on my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any noticable results until now. I use this with Alpha Hydrox facewash. My skin has never looked better! After the first week I noticed amazing results. I have oily acne prone skin, but the combination of the two products has made a huge difference in my life. My complection has never looked better. I finally feel comfortable going without my make up, which I haven&#x27;t done that since I was 13, pathetic huh?  I reccommend this to EVERYONE! It&#x27;s worth every penny! I started noticing fine lines in my forehead so I wanted to find a anti-wrinkle cream to help with all my skin issues,uneven skin tone, breakouts, oily skin, etc.&lt;br /&gt;After a 2 weeks of this wah la! PERFECTION!!!!</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended, said I could spend $50 at Nordstrom for the same ingred.  I use in my face and arms. It does sting for a few minutes but I have used it for 15 years.</li>
            <li> Buy it for boyfriend, and he says it smells good and natural. But I am not sure about the effects yet. Hope it&#x27;s good!  The delivery is very fast........</li>
            <li> I use this frequently at night.  Then wash off in the morning.  It does have just a little burning sensation.  After 30 minutes to an hour I layer a face lotion (with a little almond oil) on top for hydration.  I feel this  keeps my skin looking fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great price and effective. Regular use will even skin and lighten P.I.H.&lt;br /&gt;Use sunblock and save money on MD Forte.. You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because for more than 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve been using this product and I have not seen any improvement or difference on my skin yet. I dont think it prevents breakouts because I had few breakouts since using it. I have smooth asian skin and I don&#x27;t feel that my face gotten any smoother. I have some keratosis on both my upper arms after my second pregnancy and this product did not improve the skin condition on my arms. Anyways, it is easy to apply, it don&#x27;t irritate my skin and the smell is not noticeable.</li>
            <li> This lotion has done what nothing else has ever been able to -- reduce the huge, gaping pores on my nose!  Let&#x27;s be real, they&#x27;re never going to go away.  But this AHA lotion does minimize them, which is something that I&#x27;d never dreamed possible.  I think the lotion tends to break me out a little bit around my chin, so I don&#x27;t use it there anymore, but a dab on my nose and I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> This product contains petroleum. (mineral oil) This is a horrible ingredient which should never be used on your skin! The side effects of petrolatum include: finding this product in breast tumors, suffocation of the skin, premature aging, aggravated acne and much more.</li>
            <li> When this product sold in drug stores years ago, I used to buy a couple of bottles and would refill it when I almost ran out.  I missed it.  Now it can only find it in beauty supply stores.  It does a good job to exfoliate dull skin and minimize the look of age spots. --S from Silicon Valley CA</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really work on wrinkle because I don&#x27;t have any; however, maybe because it working.. lol</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Walgreens after reading all the great reviews.Â  I was looking for a glycolic moisturizer to replace one that I didn&#x27;t care for. This one is very reasonably priced and a much better deal on Amazon.Â Â  Unfortunately,Â  at the time I didn&#x27;t have any other purchases for Amazon and this is an add on item.  Alpha Hydrox Lotion is easy to apply and I like the way the bottle dispenses the product.Â  It glides on smoothly and absorbs fairly quick into the skin.Â  It does not leave the skin feeling sticky, tacky or oily.Â  There isn&#x27;t much of a scent which I greatly appreciate.Â Â  I put this on over my Vitamin C Serum and Rosehip Oil.Â  I follow the Alpha Hydrox Lotion with a broad spectrum sunscreen.Â  For my skin, this product on its own would not provide enough moisturizer.Â Â  I have dry cheeks and normal to oily skin in the T Zone area.  When I apply the Alpha Hydrox Lotion, there is no burning, tingling or irritation.Â Â  I use a glycolic facial cleanser by Serious Skin Care.Â  I also use their glycolic peel and glycolic pads once a week and have never experienced any burning, tingling or irritation with those products.  I feel that my skin has improved since I added the Alpha Hydrox Lotion into my skin care routine.Â  My dry patchy areas have diminished in size, some have even disappeared.Â Â  I plan to continue using Alpha Hydrox Lotion and would recommend it to others.Â  Debi B.</li>
            <li> The 10% AHA in this product is great.  The delivery from this vendor was excellent.</li>
            <li> The best &amp; most reasonable I have ever used, I live in Florida  and have sum baked skin , really helped .</li>
            <li> This works good. Burns very little (i hardly notice the sting from it, and it only lasts 3 seconds). I haven&#x27;t noticed a skin improvement, but I have only used it a few weeks. It is a good face moisturizer and I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued by Adult acne on my (bald) head for years and the skin dries out very badly making it worse. This is only the 2nd item that I have been able to use that does not clog the pores.  It stings a bit when it goes on, but  that disappears in seconds.  After a few days of use, the dryness is vastly better with no problems.  This is my new best product for my head.  It has no detectable odor or smell, is not greasy and washes off easily with soap and water. I use it twice a day. I WILL definitely buy more when needed. This 6 oz bottle will last a long time since very little is needed with each use.&lt;br /&gt; My previous favorite was the Bald Guyz items but this seems better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for only a short time, along with St Ive* Exfoliating Pads. Everybody I know is telling me that my face is glowing! I love the way my skin feels, too.</li>
            <li> Good AHA lotions (10% AHA, appropriate PH level) can be expensive.  This is one of the cheapest (per oz) quality AHA lotions I&#x27;ve found.  I like to use it all over the body, so prefer larger sizes (6oz or more).  Amalactin is another possible choice, but that one uses an ammonia-based acid that has a very strong smell.  This lotion has a very mild smell.    I have dry skin and if I use this lotion regularly, I have much softer, less flaky skin.  It does take about 2 weeks before I see the full effect.  I also am prone to getting minor keratosis pilaris (kp) on my outer upper arms and this lotion also reduces those bumps.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox is awesome. I&#x27;ve always had very oily and acne prone skin and although alpha hydrox is not a cure all it really helped smooth out my skin and control my acne. Its also good for preventing ingrown hairs. I used to get some very few ingrown hairs after shaving but since I started using alpha hydrox I haven&#x27;t seen one in ages. I highly recommend it because I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Just be careful with it outside, it does make your skin sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a persistent case of keratosis pilaris (the chicken bumps that people get on their arms) for years.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of different creams and holistic treatments and nothing worked.  I got this bottle of lotion a day ago and my rash is already starting to go away, the inflammation and redness instantly calmed down.  I also put it in on my face where I had some acne and the acne disappeared in a day.  I am surprised that something so inexpensive is so effective and I&#x27;m SO happy to have found it.  And a 6 oz bottle of lotion is a lot, so that&#x27;s great too.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I have combo skin prone to breakouts.. just had a baby and I&#x27;m breastfeeding so hormones are all over the place and my skin was suffering. This stopped my breakouts (seriously!) and its doing great at fading some old scars. I am so thrilled. Oh, and the price...wow!!!! You can&#x27;t ask for more than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Alpha Hydrox for a little over two months now, and honestly, there&#x27;s barely any discernable difference, if any. Now, none of us should have high hopes that an over-the-counter wrinkle remover will make a meaningful difference. In fact, Consumer Reports just rated a dozen or so and the best one was the $20 Neutrogena wrinkle remover, which received a better rating than LancÃ´me and others costing $65. Even so, CR was quick to point out that NONE of the creams or serums, as they are oft called, made much of a difference.     This cream may make your  face tingle a bit--it does on mine, which indicates that it might be slightly acidic and therefore help remove the thinnest layer of skin and with it, some fine lines (whatever that means--they&#x27;re not so fine to me!). But it&#x27;s just so hard to tell.   For the price you can certainly give it a shot--just don&#x27;t expect a meaningful difference. As I said, it&#x27;s been about two months and if anything changes for the better, I&#x27;ll adjust my review.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion to help with my acne.  I am 30 and have had moderate to severe acne since my early teens.  It has worsened in recent years.  I&#x27;d heard good things about glycolic acid as a really thorough exfoliator, which can help cut down on acne.  I thought, for $10, I had nothing to lose by trying it.  After washing with a mild non-soap cleanser, I put on the AHA Enhanced Lotion before bed and took my niacin and zinc supplements.  I expected it would take a couple of weeks before I saw a measurable difference in my skin, if any; either that, or I&#x27;d react poorly to it and would wake up with a bad breakout.    To my surprise, after ONE USE my skin was noticeably improved.  I woke the next morning and stared in amazement at my face in the mirror -- not only were all my acne spots smaller and MUCH less inflamed than when I&#x27;d gone to bed, but my skin had an overall healthy glow to it that is has literally never, ever had before, except perhaps when I was a very young child.  The dark red scars all over my cheeks from years&#x27; worth of bad breakouts were noticeably lighter.  After one use.  I was really amazed and couldn&#x27;t believe the results -- I had to take pictures of myself and compare them to older pictures to be sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy (I wasn&#x27;t!).    I&#x27;ve now been using AHA Enhanced nightly for about a month.  In that time, my skin has been closer to 100% clear than I ever dreamed it could be.  It&#x27;s not totally blemish-free, but the zits I do have are tiny, infrequent, and clear within a day or two (I should note, the supplements I&#x27;m taking also have had a noticeable effect, noted before I started using this lotion, so I can&#x27;t say that my acne success is 100% because of AHA...but it&#x27;s most definitely helped!)  I have also noticed a visible reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  No, this lotion will not make your lines go away entirely, but I have been happy to note that it seems to have turned back the clock on my skin by five years or so.  :)  I&#x27;m hoping thatcontinued use will smooth out the deeper line on my forehead (at least I only have one!) and help prevent more from forming.    In addition to using it on my face, I&#x27;ve been using it on my shoulders and back to help clear up my body breakouts.  there, too, it&#x27;s done a remarkable job of reducing the amount of time my spots stick around, reducing redness, and reducing size.    I am going to start using the lotion on my entire body because I am enjoying the soft texture and glowing appearance of my face and neck so much.    I normally have very sensitive skin and I notice hardly any stinging when using this lotion.  It goes away within a couple of minutes.      The only drawbacks for me have been the smell -- many people have remarked that this lotion is scent-free, but it does have a noticeably unpleasant odor in my opinion.  However, that goes away quickly as the lotion sinks into your skin.  This lotion also does such a great job of exfoliating that I&#x27;ve had little flakes form on my face -- something that never ever happened to me before using, since I never could exfoliate well enough before this lotion to make a difference with my acne.  But a few quick checks in the mirror daily keep facial flakes from becoming too numerous.    I&#x27;ll be an AHA user for life!  This is great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I feel a bit silly writing a review for a product after only 2 uses, but my results have been that dramatic that I just couldn&#x27;t wait to share.  I am pregnant and my skin has been a mess this time around.  I was convinced I had rosacea due to the amount of flakiness/redness I&#x27;ve had.  No amount of exfoliating scrubs, lotions, or creams could make a difference.  I&#x27;ve been so discouraged because my skin looks awful under foundation due to the flakiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two nights of using this product and the flakes are gone, and my skin feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I am amazed at my results.  My skin is truly glowing (not because of pregnancy) and it looks like I&#x27;ve had a professional chemical exfoliation treatment.  I was preparing myself to buy Paula&#x27;s Choice 2 oz weekly treatment (I think 10% AHA?) but the price kept stopping me.  To get 6 oz of this for under $10 is an incredible value.  I will update my review if this is no longer a good fit for my skin.  Overall I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> I am sixty six years old with skin that is not very wrinkled. This product has done nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this product 10 years ago and I&#x27;m still using today. Beats any other cream, lotion, serum, elixir etc out there! My skin is naturally really dry and with this product I get clear even ash free skin :)</li>
            <li> Just like pouring muriatic acid on your skin. Gotta love the burn!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Seems to help.  Maybe it&#x27;s a placebo effect, but I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I find this lotion to be thick and not spread very easily.  It only takes a small tab to go along way but doesn&#x27;t seem to really absorb so have white spots on my face until I really work it in or remove with a towel.</li>
            <li> I read about AHA a while back regarding acne and decided to try it out.  I can&#x27;t believe this works.  I&#x27;m 28 years old, asian skin tone and have always had moderate acne, and this has actually worked!  I have tried everything. I&#x27;m really surprised they don&#x27;t carry this at a local drug store.  I use a combination of benzyl peroxide wash, dry face, then use this as moisturizer everyday.  It leave my skin super soft and moisturized all day.  I have barely had a zit since!  Even my nagging grandma who always makes remarks about how I look seemed to notice.  The only thing is if I forget to put on sunscreen in direct sun for a long time, I&#x27;m more likely to turn a tad pink versus tan since I think it has some slight bleaching properties.  But honestly, I don&#x27;t care that much.  Overall, will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but takes awhile to sink into skin, face feels wet for awhile. I don&#x27;t care for that, I&#x27;m always in a rush.</li>
            <li> I would never recommend this product to anyone. Too over rated and too pricey. Save your money and have a professional facial done.</li>
            <li> This is a lotion with the alpha hydroxide that is supposed to be the best ingredient for aging skin.  I have not used it long enough to evaluate its effectiveness but the price is excellent compared to the very expensive department store brands that claim the same benefit</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like it. It helped already in one week. It&#x27;s quite itchy for a few days. Try to use it only once a day and then later on twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bottle because its the cheapest alpha hydroxy I could find. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m displeased with the results. I didn&#x27;t have very many wrinkles to begin with. But I know that I will get them real bad some day on my forehead. I have been using this stuff for about a year and no sign of forehead wrinkles..yay! It also does a really good job at hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  My skin feels so much younger.  Great results without spending department store prices on skin care.</li>
            <li> All this stuff I heard on the Internet was hype.  The actual chemical compound and product does nothing.</li>
            <li> No tingle or burning, no feeling whatsoever, I wonder if it even has the right ingredients. Used twice a day for weeks with no results. Lotion goes on smooth, a little heavy, but I felt nothing and saw no changes. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product and like it very much. The lotion is very soft and smooth on my face and I hope to see results soon.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the results of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion.  The packaging is not fancy, so the price reflects the product, and is reasonable.  The lotion appears to be improving the texture and appearance of lines on my face and neck. As with other Alpha Hydrox products, initial use brings with it a tingling sensation to the skin, but it is not irritating over time.  Overall, the product does what it claims at a no-frills price that I can afford.</li>
            <li> I had done a lot of reading on treating cellulite and stretch marks and found a recommendation to try glycolic acid and AHA. I did a search on Amazon and stumbled upon the Alpha Hydrox which had some good reviews so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now, twice a day and I am actually seeing a reduction in the appearance of cellulite! I&#x27;ve been using on my hips/thighs/booty in conjunction with zone-specific exercises (which in the past by itself hasn&#x27;t produced results like these). I was never overweight or large, so there was never a lot of cellulite, but enough to make me self-conscious in a swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that the appearance of stretch marks is still the same, but for the price of the bottle this is definitely worth it for combating cellulite!</li>
            <li> Very good.  More effective with a loofah.</li>
            <li> I love Alpha Hydrox lotion. It moiturizes my skin and prevents blemishes even at the age of 63! I think that it clarifies the skin and gently exfoliates. I can put sun screens or foundation (w/ SPF) on top of the Alpha Hydrox and I&#x27;m never oily looking which is a concern for people who have/had acne prone and oily skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> AHA products are an important part of skin care.AHA works by removing the dead cells that make skin look thick and dull.This product has alpha hydroxy acid at the correct PH and with daily use you will notice a difference in your skin within weeks.The amount of product for this price would also make it affordable to use on keratosis pilaris,the bumpy skin that some people have on their upper arms and thighs.The mild sting that is noticeable on application will subside with continued use and is not an allergy.Check with your Doctor before using if you have rosacea or another skin disorder.   I highly recommend.  G Vazquez MD</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product for me because I wanted to get rid of my acne scars. I&#x27;m 21 and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the product stung like hell each time I used it. After about 2 weeks of constant applications, some of my scars did fade. So I&#x27;m not saying the product didn&#x27;t work, but it might not be made for a younger person&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how great this moisturizer is, especially for the price. It is such an excellent deal! I use this every night after I wash my face, and my skin looks fantastic (if i do say so...) I don&#x27;t have any breakouts, which i used to have occasionally, and my skin is so smooth. I&#x27;ve recommended this to so many of my friends and family members, and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> As advertised. If. If Used too often, can irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have done many chemical peels. This cream is just AHA 10%. That is VERY weak. I&#x27;ve done 80% ( chemical peel ) and that&#x27;s still a weak chem peel too. The best what this product can do is improve your skin tone. If you want to see real results, you have to do a TCA peel. But, your skin will literally come off in layers. So I guess it&#x27;s not for everybody. You shouldn&#x27;t give this product a low rating because it \\&quot;didn&#x27;t remove your fine lines\\&quot;. You obviously don&#x27;t know much about chem peels then! The stronger peels don&#x27;t come in creams. You will have to apply the acid directly onto your face. Probably a good product for people in their 20&#x27;s but other than that, it&#x27;s not gonna make much of a difference. My expectation was that it would improve the skin tone. Not much has changed.</li>
            <li> This is my default body lotion. I use in combination with a decent moisturizer. It evens out complexion and also leaves skin with a nice warm youthful glow. Results usually manifest in about 2 weeks to 6 weeks of consistent usage. But u will need a good sunblock as well with continued usage.</li>
            <li> Have not really noticed any big changes.  Very good for moisturizing and a little bit goes a long way !</li>
            <li> Not only did this not clear up the small KP bumps, it have me a red, hive-like rash everywhere I applied it. If you have sensitive skin at ALL, do not purchase this!!</li>
            <li> love all the Alpha Hydrox products.  I have consistently bought products regardless of price and find these to be as effective as any of the others that I have used</li>
            <li> I hoped this product would lighten my age (sun) spots,  but so far, after several months of trying, it has worked very little.  The darkest ones seems to turn slightly lighter and I&#x27;m happy about that, but other lighter spots are the same and still there.  It is very smooth and I like the feel but what I wanted from this product was to lighten my age (sun) spots and for that purpose I think this has not deliver the expected result.  This product is just OK for me.</li>
            <li> I have read that a guy had used this for his acne and it cleared it up.  So I gave it a whirl.  I have turned 40 this year and suddenly have come down with adult acne and was just about desperate.  I have tried everything.  Until this.  This is amazing!  I use it twice a day on my face and shoulders and it has cleared it up.  I also use Glytone exfoliating shower gel twice a day, so maybe it is the pairing?  I dont know but I like what I see in the mirror.  It does sting sometimes, but I will take that over looking like I am 15!</li>
            <li> This product keeps skin clear, bright and blimish free, I highly recommend it . Good price for it as well</li>
            <li> Nothing special - but not bad either. This hasn&#x27;t helped my skin at all (hormonal acne), and stings like crazy if you have a cut, etc. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother with this again, as it isn&#x27;t the best at moisturizing (not bad - but I&#x27;ve got better stuff for that already). I was hoping for some skin texture/color improvement, but haven&#x27;t seen any difference.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used on my face! I break out easily and this lotion helps me not to :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it keeps my skin smooth and unlined.  I worshiped the sun when I was young and this keeps the brown spots very pale.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST EVER!!!... I have tried many hydroxyl products over the years and this lotion is the best of them all in my opinion. The consistency of the lotion is perfect.  You can use it under your makeup or blend a little of your liquid foundation into the lotion before applying it to your face for a sheer natural look.  If you are pampering and plucking, put a thick layer of the lotion in the problem spot areas and let it soak into the skin.  TIP: You will feel a very slight tingling sensation when you apply the lotion and you want to feel that, the tingling means the lotion is working on refining your skin. I am very sensitive to fragrant products and this one does not have any irritating scents.</li>
            <li> This lotion in okay, not greasy, not very moisturising either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it after reading the benefits of including glycolic acid in my skin care regimen, it was intended for my face. I have not used it for that long on my face, as I use Tretinoin most evenings. When I did use it, it was somewhat sticky, stung a bit, and I did not notice much in terms of effect or benefit from it. I did not break out, but it did not help with the acne and other sundry bumps on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I had these small bumps, in the fold behind my knees. I read on Amazon that this lotion could help, and indeed it has, within about 5 days the area has been completely cleared of the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it all over my body, and face, whenever I am taking a break from Tretinoin.</li>
            <li> When I was 35 I began getting an abnormal amount of wrinkles for my age, so I began reading all the anti-aging info I could find and invested in Nuskin products which I really loved.  I also had regular stress-related pimples and scars from past acne.  Seeing the glycolic acid content, I tried Alpha Hydrox Face Lotion and in a very short time saw noticeable improvements.  What was most comforting was that my very ugly purse-lines on my upper lip started to smooth out and my eye and smile lines softened as well.      At first the sting bothered me a little, but I thought about what a chemical peal does and realized that it was a sign it was working.  Before very long my skin stopped stinging from it and hasn&#x27;t been bothered since despite daily use.  I had previously tried other products and found them to either be sticky or antagonize my skin.  Benzoyl Peroxide, for example, caused acne breakouts and I then learned that I had sensitive skin and watched my product ingredients to avoid ongoing problems.  I washed daily with a mild antibacterial soap, followed by Loreal&#x27;s pH Toner, and then the Alpha Hydrox (back then the regular face lotion was 12% glycolic acid).  I also did Nuskin&#x27;s pore-cleaning mud packs 1-2 times a week followed with the Alpha Hydrox - I learned keeping the pores empty helped reduce skin damage that caused wrinkling too.  I also never left my face unprotected - I used Alpha Hydrox Lotion with sunscreen during the day and the regular AHA lotion at night.  I couldn&#x27;t believe all the compliments that came my way - everyone started telling me I looked so young and my skin was so beautiful; all my friends wanted me to teach them how to have the same results.      Now, despite my experimental nature, I have been using Alpha Hydrox lotion for over 20 years, pimple free, and am turning 59.  My skin looks great and I have less wrinkles now than I had when I was 35.  I can&#x27;t say my healthier diet didn&#x27;t contribute, but I&#x27;ve had a very stressful life and amconfident that I wouldn&#x27;t look this good without the Alpha Hydrox.  People 45 years old mistake me as younger than they are.  I never miss using the Alpha Hydrox even if I skip some of the other steps.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and need to use a thick, heavy cream. I found this to be too runny  for my skin type. It does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> Works for bumps on the back of arms.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be making my fine lines fade. I only use it around my eyes and sometimes my forehead on the horizontal creases. I have used it almost nightly for about a month, and even though my sleeping has been less than desirable, my fine lines are definetly minimized. I am using this as a preventive measure (I am only 24 years old) so not sure how it would work on more mature skin. My one criticism is that it also seems to dry my face out slightly. This product is very potent with Alpha Hydroxy Acids(10%) which can cause irritation, photo-sensitivity and flaking. Research has shown that AHA can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but there is little evidence to suggest long-term efficacy.</li>
            <li> I used this product 25 or 30 years ago. Love this product. Dr. Oz recommended using glycolic acid to keep your skin young. I started using it again and am already getting compliments on my skin. I thought it was discontinued, hadn&#x27;t seen it in any drugstores. Thanks to Amazon, I can get back to my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner, but the packaging it was in could use some improvements. First of all, it came one of those yellow manilla envelopes lined with bubble wrap. Inside, the product box was crushed. I believe the seller should start shipping the product in a small box instead of an envelope to prevent this from happening in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the product I received did not match the one in the picture. The one in the picture seems \\&quot;newer\\&quot; - newer, more modern packaging and font. The one I received looked like a lotion bottle from the 90&#x27;s. I&#x27;m not sure if I received an outdated product or it was just in outdated packaging, but the lotion itself left much to be desired. I followed the instructions and applied the lotion to a clean face, morning and night. My face looked really smooth in the morning when I first woke up...until I had to wash it again and reapply the lotion. It made my face red and made all my imperfections stand out more. Definitely will not be buying/using again.</li>
            <li> I have found that this product works very well, better than any other lotion I have ever used. this one realy worked for me</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris and this has helped me quite a bit. The redness and tiny bumps are almost gone now! It did not bother my eczema, I even feel itchy less often now. My skin is also smoother and more soft to the touch. It does sometimes burn just slightly and cause a small amount of redness when first rubbed in, though it always goes away within a few minutes. If you have these problems too or just want baby-butt-soft skin without spending too much money then this is your lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of dry, not very moisturizing.  I hope it&#x27;s ok to put a moisturizer over it because I feel like I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 1/9/12:  Just needed to use more of it for it to be moisturizing.  Definitely works! Have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since using it. Very very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I used it on my body instead, almost finished a bottle in 2 month, the result is good, helped my acne a lot.</li>
            <li> I actually do not see any difference between using this lotion and just regular hand lotion.  Hands are looking a little wrinkly and need something to smooth them out.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again and am on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li> I love alpha hydroxy &amp; it&#x27;s getting hard to find - best one I ever used was taken out of production so I&#x27;ll be comparing closely with this one</li>
            <li> I was looking for this lotion on line since I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I like what it does for my skin and how it feels.</li>
            <li> I just moved and haven&#x27;t been using his consistently. Or even washing my face consistently. But when in use this at night, I can definitely tell in the morning.  My skin is smoother, pores are smaller. This is fantastic lotion. I expected less quality for the price.  I will order more in the future and can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my skin once I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with wrinkles and dark spots.  It does make a difference but you will definitely need another moisturizer since after you use this your skin will feel slightly dry and tight</li>
            <li> Functions as light moisturizer. Evens out skin discoloration with some reduction in scarring and wrinkles. I use it only once a day, at night and recommmend a spf of 30 or better during the day.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it every day. I see a noticeable differance on my face. I will continue t buy it. Thankyou Judy Larson</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because I have sensitive skin.. This is probably a great product, but for me every thing causes break outs.  I am sorry that I couldn&#x27;t give this product a good rating.. I don&#x27;t know if it works or doesn&#x27;t as I broke out in zits and rash.. nothing new for me. Please try this, as I have friends that love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from chest and bacne since I was a teen and am now 34.  I&#x27;ve tried many over the counter washes, gels, creams and on and on to get rid of the acne, but haven&#x27;t had much luck.  I read on a website (acne.org I think) about using alpha-hydroxy to help turnover new cells and clear up acne so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I am ecstatic with the results.  I&#x27;ve been using the AHA lotion for a little over two weeks and it has made a significant difference in reducing both new breakouts and the reddish/scarred appearance of old acne.  I do wash with a benzoyl perozide soap (5%) in the mornings and then apply the AHA lotion after drying.  I apply the lotion again at night before bed (no additional wash).  My skin is so much smoother and I haven&#x27;t had the usual clusters of pimples on my upper back and chest as usual.  I have had a couple of small pimples, but that is to be expected and they are not even noticeable compared to the heat rash like appearance that I normally suffer from.  I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found a combination of wash and topical solution that really truly works for my chest and back.  If you&#x27;ve suffered from body acne you know how embarrassing it is and how frustrating it can be to get rid of.  I would say if you haven&#x27;t tried AHA yet, give it a go.  You&#x27;ve really got nothing to lose.  The amount of product is a value for the $$ you pay, especially if it works for you like it has for me.</li>
            <li> Works as described. I apply faithfully every evening before bed.&lt;br /&gt; Great product. Great price. Quick delivery. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I also did not like this product and did not see any results for myself.  It might work for others but not for me.  I found that all these make your sking feel rather dry.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this lotion because I absolutely love Alpha Hydrox&#x27;s Oil Free 10% Formula, but I don&#x27;t like the way this lotion feels on my skin. I wanted to use it before bedtime but it feels a bit sticky, which bothers me. I can&#x27;t even tell the Oil Free 10% formula is on my skin, which is one of my favorite things about the product, I was just hoping to add in some moisturizing effects as well but I&#x27;ve taken to just using this on the backs of my hands and elbows because I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my face, even when using it just for bedtime (and definitely cannot wear it under makeup).</li>
            <li> Love this product...i ordered the second bottle. This product has help slowly even out my skin tone and leave me looking fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a bit over three weeks and results are so good.  I&#x27;m  a total scheptic regarding most anti aging pitches but a friend suggested I try it.  Skin is now smooth and shimmers in the light,,lol.  Not that I wanted the latter but was a pleasing result.  Just wonder what happens if I stop using it.  Well, it&#x27;s priced nicely and why stop a good thing, right.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Aqua Glycolic and I think it works really well to smooth my skin and help with wrinkles. Just wear sunscreen with it or you will get burned! (There is a warning:))</li>
            <li> This bottle lasts me about a year and I&#x27;m on my second one.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> also gave me a bad rash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before so I already knew that it is good.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have been a fan of this company for a long time now.  I first used it when I was an international flight Attendent.  It&#x27;s supposed to make you tingle just a bit--it&#x27;s an acid.  It brings all the bad things out of your skin at first.  So don&#x27;t be surprised if you break out.  It&#x27;s an excellent mild action.</li>
            <li> I used on my face for one month no defense just the lotions so I preferred cocoa butter more cheaper</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion  for years, woud not use anything else.  The price is so much less than any other Alpha Hydrox product out there and seems to work better.  I have very good skin and I give Alpha Hydrox the credit.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive, very combo acne prone skin and this does wonders for me. i use it every night after cleansing and toning. this has seriously changed my skin (at least while i continue to use it). this is HG for me. it stings sometimes when i use it, don&#x27;t let that deter you. you are going to love this! pleeease give it a try.</li>
            <li> Best product in the world! Gets rid of acne. Hydrates your skin just enough, never too much! Only downside is that Amazon no longer carries it direct so you have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> Not much to this product, may not do anything to your skin, good or bad. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, save your dollars.</li>
            <li> But maybe it&#x27;s working because I feel a distinct tingle.  The price is right and it can&#x27;t hurt.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a couple weeks.  Too early to tell I guess.</li>
            <li> I order many items for friends- my male friend (80 years young), stands by this product 100%. He loves the tinting color, plus the sunscreen added.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne for over 10 years and nothing has cleared up my skin like this product. Within two weeks I was acne free! I still get the occasional pimple but nothing compared to the 7 or 8 I had at any one time. My mother uses it for wrinkles and it works nicely. Only negative is it takes a long time to absorb into the skin. Can&#x27;t believe something so effective is so cheap.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering this as I gave away my first bottle. I will not make that mistake again. The bad: it does sting for 10 seconds, it has a mild smell., skin might experience stripping  The good: it smoothens the skin, eliminates dark spots, skin is radiant. The product is a bit thicker so you can use a small amount especially if you have oily skin like me so this bottle will serve a very long time. I like the fact that there are not too many chemicals that are harmful in this product compared to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have brown skin and I have no complaints. Do use sunscreen and test first if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> At first this made my skin oily when using at night. I stopped using it and my skin started to dry out. I have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using the glycolix 20% pads and taking B-stress vitamins, my skin is getting dry. I started using this again at night and the oil free in the day. My skin is clear for the first time since my teens. Amazed! Finally found my formula that works.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any noticeable changes since I started using this product, would not recommend this product to friends</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Always happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for daytime with 20% vitamin C serum  from Timeless and sunscreen. At night I go for PTR retinol fusion PM.  I also do monthly 30% glycolic peel, this AHA 10% keeps my skin well maintained in between my peels. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find someone that I know that I can give this to. It did nothing for me. I have other products that I&#x27;m using now that I can tell a difference from right away this lotion did nothing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly work for me.</li>
            <li> A great lotion with AHA!</li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down the best lotion I have ever used. Nothing, I mean nothing compares to this. I&#x27;m nearly 50, you wouldn&#x27;t know it by this sudden beautifying of my skin. Neck, arms, legs, back, hands, and feet... Delightful!!!! Holds my tan longer, and looks so much nicer. I use coconut oil, and derma e vitamin A cream on my face</li>
            <li> Not sure how to feel about this b/c I have not used it consistently yet.  But when I do use it during the day it encourages my skin to form a greasy film over it that feels tight.  I do feel a tingly sensation when put on.  I believe it aids in accelerated skin turn over because I am seeing more dead skin ready to be sloughed away after I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try because it seemed to have some good active ingredients at a fair price. Alas, as I already know, you get what you pay for. First, the smell is pretty off putting, but that&#x27;s not the deal breaker for me. What I really dislike is the watery texture and how it seems to just sit on my skin in white streaks that don&#x27;t seem to absorb so much as dry on the face. This just feels icky yo use before bed and it&#x27;s definitely not right for under makeup. Once it finally dries, it does sort of tighten the skin, but leaves it feeling sort of tuggy, not soft and smooth.I am generously giving this 2 stars because at least it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Smooths, lightens mild hyper-pigmentation, reduces the appearance of fine lines, and brightens. I&#x27;ve used this for over 2 yr, and I can&#x27;t imagine what my skin would look like without this lotion. My skin is no longer rough nor dull. This lotion has a thin consistency, and I would say it&#x27;s good for all skin types (I have dry sensitive, acne prone skin). I will always repurchase this lotion.  If it&#x27;s your first time using a dedicated AHA cream/lotion, it&#x27;s important that you do a patch test first. I would recommend diluting this lotion, one part AHA lotion, one part plain moisturizer (1:1), then two parts AHA, one part plain moisturizer until your skin gets used to the AHA lotion (it took me about 2 wk to get used to). Also make sure to use sunblock/sunscreen when using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Just got the product.  Did a test patch to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic n all was good. First application to face I immediately felt the tingle sensation. Great for first time GA users like myself. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase anything stronger than 10%. Will update once I see results after few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I had mainly bought this for discoloration and while I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really done much on that front, it has seemed to improve my overall clarity. My pores seem smaller and this works great under your makeup because it seems to really make it go on smoother. This also leaves your skin soft and moisturized for hours. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I  have what is called kp on my upper arms after the birth of my third child. I read the reviews and was so excited this could be the answer to my prayers!!!!! Wrong answer, it did not go away and worst of of looks like it got worst... I would not advise anyone who wants to buy this for kp, it didn&#x27;t work for me........</li>
            <li> It has formaldehyde in it, so I could not use it.  &amp;#34;Im Urea. My dermatologist and I saw it right away.</li>
            <li> You definitely feel tingling and a slight to moderate stinging shortly after applying the cream. My face started looking healthier and more radiant within a few days after first using. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the fine lines on my forehead seem to be decreasing....YIPPEE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 10% Glycolic-AHA cream to give my sensitive skin a break from the stronger 12% cream as needed. But, be sure to heed the warnings about avoiding your lips or you&#x27;ll end up with severely chapped lips like me, and always follow-up with sunscreen before going out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin since I began using this. As the other reviews note, your skin will break out for roughly two weeks or so, but it will look great after that. The breakout is the reason for four and not five stars.</li>
            <li> I notice some skin improvement and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Use of the bottle is difficult because too much comes out at once.</li>
            <li> Love this product I love the way it makes my skin feel and I love that it only takes a little bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it could help with my ingrown hairs on the back of my legs...I&#x27;ve used a scrub/lotion from KP and tend skin, but this is more effective for me.  The immediate results were great, so I&#x27;m excited to see what happens after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and I love the results.  It is a good quality product and has a descent amount of AHA acid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this locally made product (made in Denver) for over 25 yrs!  I&#x27;m closer to 50 yrs of age but many folks think I am in my mid 30&#x27;s. I know it&#x27;s because of this product that my skin has stayed younger looks over the years. Just be sure to wear sunscreen when using an AH product! Very important, ESP at higher altitudes.</li>
            <li> I believe this has been the cause of my recent break outs. I noticed that my hyper pigmentation seemed to be improving but unfortunately, my obnoxious skin doesn&#x27;t seem to like the face lotion and wash. I hadn&#x27;t broken out on my forehead for a long time and then all of a sudden I have a bunch of pimples. Hopefully I can get rid of them with something else...</li>
            <li> ive been using it for going on a month and i thought this was going to help dark spots in my face but i does not help..i even do it twice a day sometimes like it suggest i&#x27;m wondering if i ordered the wrong thing..im still on the hunt for something to help my blemish</li>
            <li> Love this product. Had really dark spots from sun damage on my face..honestly less than 2 weeks there was a significant change; some are almost completely faded and it&#x27;s great for acne. The lotion is very light and I did feel a little tingling. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so much softer since I have used this product. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent shopping experience.  I wish all my purchases could be made online with as little hassle as these. Great Shopping Experience.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this product, DO IT. Best decision ever. My skin looks great even after 2 days of use! I am already recommending this to my friends!</li>
            <li> I have been using it after shaving for years. It is the only product that I have found that works on my face after shaving.</li>
            <li> why didnt i have known about this product before. its the best ive tried..and i have tried everything. and it works w/ sensitive skin too (although it says not for delicate skin). its very gentle. havent had any irritation at all. i hope good reviews would encourge others to try this product so they wont take it off the market.</li>
            <li> Forget about those expensive and fancy products that cost 10 times more. This is the product you see immediate result. It also helps with pimples and discolorations with acne scars. I have people come up to me and ask me many times on what product I am using on my face.  It works wonders.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive stuff any more. You will be very happy with this brand.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion after shaving my face and before applying after-shave balm.  I like it a great deal and have noticed a difference in my skin since I have been using it for several weeks.  My skin is much clearer and smoother because of it.  It does cause a slight tingling sensation because of the AHA, but that tells me that it&#x27;s working to exfoliate.  Daily use of AHA is supposed to be the singularly best thing that one can do for one&#x27;s skin other than using moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Two, actually. Glad to find it at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time someone asked my age, I told them, and they said they thought I was 25 years younger than that. I&#x27;m sure heredity plays a part in that, as does sleeping each night hanging from the closet pole by my knees, but the Alpha Hydroxy hasn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Alpha Hydrox products for years and I love them, I don&#x27;t want to change to anything else.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few ltions that does no drag or dry out after I&#x27;ve put it on. It can be worn during the day or at night.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a product that works effectively to reduce fine lines and smooths out skin. I have been using this lotion for approximately three months now and absolutely will not buy anything else. I have sensitive skin and although the lotion burns slightly when on my face, it is soooo definitely worth it! I have been told I look younger (late 20s, early 30s) than my real age (age 42). I can honestly see the difference myself - even, healthy, younger-looking skin. I&#x27;m very healthy but before using this lotion, I was getting acne on both my cheeks. I tried every acne creme from over the counter to prescription cremes and nothing worked. Since using this lotion, no more acne! I have to attribute this &#x27;miracle&#x27; to my faithful use of this lotion in the morning and before bed. I also think it&#x27;s because at the same time, I purchased the NUFACE microdermbrasion facial toning device which I use approximately three times per week. As another reviewer here noted, if you purchase the Alpha Hydrox products from their own website, you DO get it for slightly cheaper (with free shipping), esp if buying packages. I love amazon too!!</li>
            <li> Started using this lotion a few weeks ago and the first thing I noticed is that it caused me to break out -- I haven&#x27;t had pimples like this since high school....YIKES! It hasn&#x27;t seemed to change my fine lines in anyway so I probably won&#x27;t keep using .....</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem much different than any other ordinary face cream. Does cause a small amount of redness initially, but that subsided with continued use.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion because eHow recommended it for treating the skin condition Keratosis Pilaris. I&#x27;ve seen improvements in only a few days of use. I&#x27;ve also used it on the bottoms of my feet, and it has made my feet softer already. It&#x27;s a great lotion for dry skin, and it doesn&#x27;t have any weird odor or anything. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this day cream and am pleased that I ordered it with the night cream, what a deal!  I find that my skin feels better than it has in years, and am hopeful that it will provide enough moisture during the winter (so I don&#x27;t need to add another facial lotion).  I would have gladly paid a lot more for this product, but please do not tell the manufacturer.  ;)</li>
            <li> I bought three bottles of this for my family to use.  I am pleasantly surprised.  I had several obvious brown spots on my face and they are gradually fading.  I have started using it on my hands and the brown spots there are fading, also.  Sometimes there is a mild burning sensation after I apply the lotion, but it goes away quickly.  I will keep using this.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy this product along with the Night Replenishing CrÃ¨me.  I would recommend those two products together.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and I think it is starting to get rid of some age spots and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the alpha hydrox lotion. I saw signs of it working right away and I liked how soft it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> from reading all these reviews, i thought why not try.. I actually bought one from walgreens not through amazon. It stings when you first put it on. As for wrinkles, may have some smoothing effect. was not sure if it was effective enough though. Was hoping to get rid of deep marionette lines. My face just stung, did not see much results as hoped. I returned the product. I guess it&#x27;s ok for some people but I think I&#x27;ll keep looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels nice and light. I have less break outs. Nice price .</li>
            <li> I will let everyone know how it works along side my aqua glycolic skin care system. I am using this on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Im an African American male in my my early 20&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve been dealing with ingrown hair and scars on my chin and neck area. My skin was so senitive to shaving that I always used an electrical shaver but I decided to try this product out and start using a blade, no more ingrown hair and scars are clearing up. Just make sure you use it once or twice a day and always exfoliate while showering. This stuff works</li>
            <li> It is now said that we need this formulation to keep our skin young.  It is pleasant to use and I do think my skin tends to wrinkle less.  I am 64 with relatively unwrinkled skin so I am happy to use this product.  I use it daily under makeup</li>
            <li> Works as intended with no side-effects or issues.  Works fast.</li>
            <li> ... But it helps to keeps me 34 each new year I guess.  I wish it was lightly scented as I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again! I mainly bought this product because i barely get any sleep and have and have like 2 pimple scar i wanted it gone haha. It made my face look brighter and youthful then it already is! and it made my nose pour shrink. If you have dry skin like me, try matching this product with this Alpha Hydrox Sheer Silk Moisturizer SPF 15. I always had sensitive dry skin, and after using this product it just made my face looks brighter and youthful, another thing i notice was when i didn&#x27;t use this product for 4 days, my face was still moisturizer, no longer little pieces of dry skin hanging like it used to. love this 2 products!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I don&#x27;t use makeup, not because i don&#x27;t want to but because i can&#x27;t do it and its too much work, so their is no way for me to cover pimples scar or dark circle eyes, unwanted dark spots n healthier looking skin, so if you are similar to me then this can help you have a radiant healthier skin without makeup.</li>
            <li> Really seems to make a difference the the overall appearance of my skin.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Rubs on so easily and makes skin nice and soft, Use everyday and see some wrinkles become less visible! Wish I had gotten (or could get) the exact same formula with an SPF around 30!</li>
            <li> I love how it tingles. A little goes a long ways. Makes my skin feel clean and fresh! Def dries out all belmishes. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> first off never really write but reviews but i had bad acne scars but for some reason it turned out to be a lot worst i tried using scar gel which normally does the jobthen when it stopped working i took a guess its just uneven skin tone so on amazon i typed up uneven skin tone and at the time i saw this product with 4 and a half stars but using it i really dont think it helped much for me i wouldnt recommend it if your trying to get rid of uneven skin tone just does not work..!</li>
            <li> I bought this because some blog recommended it.  I am so sorry I did.  I just can&#x27;t use retinol products, my eyes burn so badly all day after using them  (even if I don&#x27;t it near my eyes they still burn).  I do really well with Jurlique natural products.  When will I ever learn?  Stay with what works.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is not that good</li>
            <li> Best face lotion in the universe. Seriously. Moisturizes, clears blemishes and smoothes wrinkles. Your skin will get used to it after a while, so you can switch to a retinol product (Avene&#x27;s Eluage for exemple, so good and plumping too), then come back to this little jewel.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin red and itchy and rashy...</li>
            <li> I use this every night after I clean my face.  I used to always have flaky skin on my nose and chin no matter how much lotion or olive oil I would use, and then my pores would be all clogged and my skin would still flake.  Anyways-couple nights of using this and I haven&#x27;t had flaky skin on my nose or chin since.(which has been about a month)  and my pores are smaller.  Skin softer. This is my first alpha hydroxyl product I&#x27;ve ever used, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, other than lotions and creams, but I think this works much better.  I have layered lotion on top of it, and noticed that it still kept my pores nice and small, but I don&#x27;t usually need additional moisturizer.  Not sure about wrinkles....I have the awesome forehead wrinkle-and I don&#x27;t notice much improvement, but that&#x27;s probably because I keep raising my eyebrows :)</li>
            <li> My wife bought his and she says this is a wonderful product and it WORKS! She has recommended to several of her friends and they all think its really fantastic.  She will repurchase - something she very rarely does - Unbeatable product overall, particularly for the price according to her.</li>
            <li> Everything that we know that is in this product, does exactly as it&#x27;s suppose to.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it gently exfoliates the skin while making it soft.  Yes, it may sting a little going on, but that&#x27;s very typical for those of us that have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35, have really great skin (especially considering a history of wine and cigarettes), and have spent boatloads of money on skincare products&amp;#60;&amp;#60;not the reason for my nice skin at this point, as I&#x27;ve tried and failed with many, so I owe a lot to genes and the fact that I now see a doctor for my skincare needs and use a couple of [pricey] products from Switzerland. But I have definitely learned enough (esp from the doc) to know that not all the best and most effective products have to break the bank. I&#x27;ve been using this product for five years, including the more intense glycolic cream, and it is definitely responsible for preserving my &amp;#34;youth&amp;#34; fo&#x27; sho&#x27;. The active ingredients in this product are what you need in an anti-aging routine (which I recommend you begin by 27)--don&#x27;t spend more for the same thing in a prettier bottle with a rosy scent, because that&#x27;s what many products are actually charging you for. To avoid sounding redundant, I won&#x27;t retrace the benefits of AHAs, but read up; it&#x27;s crucial to your skincare regimen. This product is very straightforward and highly effective as an anti-aging preventative and combatant when used in the morning: apply after cleansing, toning and serum (if you use one), and be SURE TO USE AN SPF as your grand finale. Upon first use, you may feel a bit of tingling to a slight burning sensation (it&#x27;s so slight I almost wouldn&#x27;t have mentioned it...)-- trust me, this goes away, and it&#x27;s a sign of cell turnover. You can&#x27;t beat the price for such effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I like using this to even out skin tone after using self tanning products when the tan starts to fade. It&#x27;s perfect for the whole body. Gets rid of old skin cells without irritating.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night treatment about 3 times a week.  It is a good price, as some of the aha products don&#x27;t have the potency of this, and are 3 to 5 times more expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and I&#x27;ve had varying amounts of acne since I was 14.  It&#x27;s never been bad enough to resort to Accutane, but I definitely hated going outside without makeup on.  I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a month now, and this is the clearest my skin has ever been.  The only place I break out now is right below my eyebrows, which also happens to be a spot where I can&#x27;t put this lotion.  I didn&#x27;t even start using this stuff for acne, but as an anti-aging preventative.  Not sure if works for that since I don&#x27;t actually have wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in skin tone and texture.  Highly recommended.  The only cons are that it smells a little odd and you&#x27;ll find that you sunburn very easily, but lotions and makeup with SPF will prevent that.</li>
            <li> Read a letter in a magazine praising this lotion. When I checked it out and saw the inexpensive price, I thought why not? Been using it 2x/day for the past few months. The texture of my skin feels so smooth and soft. It tingled a bit upon the first few applications only. The lines around my mouth and eyes have definitely smoothed out. I had a friend ask me if I was applying my makeup differently because my face looked like it was glowing and smooth.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin since using this product.  One thing to note is that it makes your skin taut, and I&#x27;ve had to use moisturizer over this lotion for a softer look.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a scrub/ scar treatment for scab scars on my legs and arms. Took a little big, scrubbing in the shower and daily lotion for a couple months but it definitely reduces the appearance of the scars. I keep it on hand because it is affordable and it works. Not greasy, and no foul smell.</li>
            <li> Not long ago i posted a question as to whether this product works on men with discoloration due to shaving.  After having used the product for about 3 weeks, i see huge improvements on skin color.  Not only that, but my shaving is extremely smooth for some reason with the same old blade which most times i get bumps.  Great product.  Loyal customer from now on!</li>
            <li> I waited to do my Reviews because I purchased a few products &amp; wanted to try them Separately.  Then I added or took away depending on results.  This is one in the end that I did NOT take away.  I have a medical background &amp; I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s. I already knew I was starting to have some Hormone deficiencies.  I had gone without my Hormone cream for a few Mo&#x27;s &amp; noticed I was getting what &amp;#34;appeared to be&amp;#34; some form of Dry Acne.  I have NEVER had Acne issues.  I was already Hot Compressing &amp; using the Neutragena Microderm Abrasion system &amp; then a Hyaluronic Acid Serum/Peptide combo(Dry Face but Pores still open).Then I WAS using a Vitamin C Cream. It helped but still noticed issues.  I then tried a 10% Skin peel(2 diff. brands) a few times which didn&#x27;t do much for me even at 2xs a week.  I then Rec&#x27;d. this Cream &amp; used it in Lieu of the Vitamin C Cream NIGHTLY.  I noticed about a 40% improvement!&lt;br /&gt;I  was then able to obtain my Hormone Cream again(Bio Identicals). This helped even more after a week back using it.  The FINAL Step which not only got rid of ALL the Acne but ALL &amp; ALL sent my skin back in time was Vitamin D3.&lt;br /&gt;  I consider myself lucky to find out mine was VERY LOW because my Dr. Ran a Test.  I actually was prescribed 50,000 IU  Gel tabs which I got from the Pharamacy.&lt;br /&gt;Read up on how it plays into Skin Health &amp; so much more.  I suggest if you have ongoing skin problems and have tried a Lot of products to give this product a try.  In addition  get yourself some D3 GEL Tabs 5,000 IU DAILY. This is a little embarrassing sharing all this but I like to try &amp; help others because facial skin problems suck!  We all want to hold on to a youthful look as long as possible!</li>
            <li> I love Alpha Hydrox it really enhanced my completion even  tone skin soft and smooth ..&lt;br /&gt;try you will love it tooo!!!</li>
            <li> My friend likes it.  I got it for her.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past I just love it.Compared to other store brands.I choose this because of it&#x27;s proven results.</li>
            <li> Is starting to work pretty well... if the sent would had been a lil better.. it would had receive a 5 star..</li>
            <li> This stuff worked wonders for me on controlling my oily skin. Skin was smooth and fresh. I mainly bought it to control my acne but I can&#x27;t say that it helped my acne that much. I&#x27;m 30 years old with oily, acne prone skin and this came highly recommended. It just didn&#x27;t do it for me... at all. If you have super stubborn skin &amp; cystic acne, you may need something more.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Lotions I find is one of the better lotions available.  For me it has brought any imbedded black heads or white heads on my face to the surface to dry out.  It also removes dead skin from rough heels and elbows to help feel smoother and softer.  Just rub some on.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Especially useful for men as it slows the formation of creases in the neck and around the ears. Sounds ludicrous but it&#x27;s can mean the difference between cute and coot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has been thanks to this cream or the fact that it is now winter where I live that has lighten my skin. I didnt see results in diminishing wrinkles and burns your face but small price to pay no?</li>
            <li> I used this product (with and without the Targeted Skin Lightener) for several months trying to remove age spots on my face. It made absolutely no difference. The age spots, large and small, were unchanged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months and I am quite pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen. One of the side benefits of this product, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  I can even rub this lotion on my eye lids without fear of feeling the pain.  Highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I received this last night and washed first with a mild soap then a Glytone Body wash with a loofah.  After, I applied this and when I woke up this morning, I noticed a change in my skin already.  *I have KP (Keratosis Pilaris) on my back and small areas of my thighs* Don&#x27;t expect a miracle overnight, but expect to notice a change in the way your skin feels instantly.  You don&#x27;t need to apply much of this product.  A small, less than a dime sized amount, is more than enough to work with.  On the box it says that if application does not dry within a minute or less, you&#x27;ve used too much.  It&#x27;s true.  I think this is a steal for the price and the thickness of this product.  I look forward to more results after a week, two weeks, a month, etc. and will be back for a second review.  7/24/13</li>
            <li> I was starting to get a lot of breakouts, even though I was in my 40&#x27;s. I was trying everything out there, and nothing was working. I had used this product a long time ago, and started using it again. I can&#x27;t go without it! My breakouts have decreased by at least 90% after using this product.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Light weight lotion with glycolic acid.. Gets rid of acne &amp; wrinkles too. I just wonder if it&#x27;s truly 10% acidic as Label says, otherwise I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any particular benefit to using this after many months, however I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I had beautiful skin in high school, then broke out in college. I&#x27;ve been suffering through cystic acne for 13 years. I&#x27;ve tried many of the &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; acne treatments, and even prescriptions. I started using a glycolic acid peel weekly (for 8 weeks), and it changed my skin! Then I found this lotion, and added it to my regimine. I figured, it&#x27;s cheap, what do I have to lose?! It is so worth it! My skin feels amazing, it&#x27;s clear, my acne scars are fading. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now, and I hope it keeps working as it is now! Great stuff! Update: I&#x27;ve been using the lotion a.m. and p.m. for approximately 10 months. And it is still keeping my face clear and smooth. Fabulous stuff!!</li>
            <li> Basically, a good product that delivers all it says.  I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products because they work and they are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago, but as I got older, I thought I needed more help for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin. I tried many other, more expensive products, but my skin started having breakouts, looked dull and was not soft and dewy.  A couple months ago, I went back using the lotion and foaming wash. To my amazement, my skin cleared up, felt so soft and looked glowing! If I start to have a breakout, it is pretty much gone the next morning. It does sting a little after applying, but I feel that means it is working - it&#x27;s like a mini peel. This is my skin regime forever.  Hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> The tingly feeling is just amazing! You will feel &amp; see the difference as your skin will truly glow! Amazon you are just amazing!</li>
            <li> i feel it is good as moisturizer but i see no action of the glycolic acid.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed by this product. May it didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this item before and really liked it. A little goes a long way and goes into the skin with a greasy feeling. I will probably buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is rated as one of the strongest alpha hydrox lotions, but I had no negative skin reactions and am hanging in there, using it every day.  Maybe in a couple of more months I&#x27;ll look younger and more radiant ;).</li>
            <li> I waited a LONG time before writing this review because I wanted to be REALLY sure that this product was working for me.  At first, I was using it along with another product in the Alpha Hydrox line, [[ASIN:B000G8LWZI Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA 1.6 oz (45 g)]], and experiencing problems--it turns out that I was sold a container of the Souffle that was actually several years old.  Whatever the cause, I stopped using the Souffle and have been using only the Enhanced Lotion alone for a few months now, and my skin is looking better than it has in years!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a little background information about me.  I am currently in my early 40s.  As a teen, I had very oily skin but only mild acne problems.  In my late 20s/early 30s, however, I began to experience increasing issues with adult acne.  Although the problem wasn&#x27;t severe, it was quite persistent and recurrent.  I actually went to two different dermatologists and tried various tropical and oral medications with little success.  (The only thing that really worked was Accutane, but that became WAY too cumbersome to continue to use given all of the requirements surrounding prescribing it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I experimented with using various over-the-counter products, always with mixed results.  More recently, I began doing some reading on alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs).  I did a lot of research of various products both here on Amazon and on the web site Makeup Alley, and after my failed experiment with the Alpha Hydrox Souffle mentioned above, I decided to try this product, the 10% Enhanced Lotion.  I am amazed by the results!  Within only a week or two of discontinuing the Souffle (which made my skin break out even worse) and using the Enhanced Lotion alone, my skin was MUCH clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after using this product daily for about two months, my skin looks great: NO blemishes!  I do occasionally get a small pimple or two (usually around the same time in my menstrual cycle), but when that happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind.  Also, I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from before I started using the Enhanced Lotion are FINALLY starting to fade as well--that is taking longer, but it IS happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product twice a day.  You only need a very small amount, as it is thin and spreads easily over the entire face.  At night, I will apply the product slightly more generously.  (It definitely does sting a bit; this occurs with all AHAs.  You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.)  In the morning, I will use only a tiny amount of the product (or sometimes skip it altogether), and on top, I will use [[ASIN:B001PV6ONK Olay Complete Lotion for Combination Skin with SPF 15 - 6 oz.]], which contains a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA; salicylic acid) and also SPF, which is important when using AHAs because of increased sun sensitivity.  This combination seems to be working well for me.  I haven&#x27;t really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when I do, I have been using [[ASIN:B000UVZU1S St. Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz (283 g)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products.  Definitely, this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it highly!at happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind.

            <li> My only drawback with this is that it really needs to be used two times a day. I hate putting it on at night because my fiance always gets himself a mouthful of chemicals when he tries to kiss me on the cheek. It would be great as a body wash if it didn&#x27;t leave any residue (it only leaves a gross taste) or as a once a day application where people who prefer nighttime could do that, or I would put it on in the morning and then apply my makeup when it dries.    However, it has been doing wonders for my chest and shoulder acne. It also really reduced the redness and bumps I got from a facial waxing earlier this week. It is totally great stuff, and although it says \\&quot;for normal to dry skin\\&quot; I have very oily skin and I don&#x27;t see any bad effects. I will definitely buy more.    I poured it into a different bottle with a smaller spout, and so I can apply the cream more efficiently and it lasts a little longer as well. I&#x27;ve paired my lotion with a Neutrogena face wash which I use as a body wash. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I do not write a lot of reviews at all, so for me to take the time to write this one its a big deal. Saying that, this product is great! I suffer from PIH which is a pigmentation issue on spots of my face that were caused by acne I had as a teenager. Basically pink/red marks. I am 28 and I have had these marks on my face since a teenager! I had read that a combo of alpha hydroxy and vitamin c could help reduce these marks, and it has! Since using this product at night in conjunction with my vitamin c cream in the morning my skin is looking so much better. My marks are fading and my skin is evening out. If you suffer from my issue uou should try this! I have sensitive skin to and this product does not irritate it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> AHA helps clear up acne scars and prevents/lessens acne breakouts for me. I don&#x27;t want to oversell it, because I know how it feels to buy a product with &amp;#34;IT CURED MY ACNE!&amp;#34; reviews only to be disappointed when it doesn&#x27;t cure yours. It is a great product to add to a line up for treating acne, scars, and wrinkles though. Specifically it is great for tackling acne primarily caused by keratinization issues. It didn&#x27;t cure my hormonal acne breakouts, but it did lessen the intensity of those cystic breakouts and I no longer get non-hormonal breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my homework before purchasing a glycolic acid. This brand is a good choice because it is cost effective (also usually available at local pharmacy) and the right pH balance in order for the glycolic acid to maintain efficacy. At this % of glycolic acid, it&#x27;s also nice to not have to worry about neutralizing it afterwards and being able to just leave it on. AHA is also one of the few products that I have read that you can use during pregnancy, unlike the BHA counterpart.</li>
            <li> Stings a bit, but that means it&#x27;s working right?  It is indeed fragrance free as advertized, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> This Cream Works Great, Brightens Up Your Face And Removes Dead Skin Cells!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of AHA products and I&#x27;ve used a variety of them. I like the way this felt on my skin. Made it feel so soft but unfortunately, this one tended to break me out on my chin and along side my nose with little white pimples. I looked at the ingredient list and I suspect it&#x27;s the Petrolatum. I usually avoid any product with that ingredient but it didn&#x27;t occur to me at the time that Alpha Hydrox would include it. If youâre sensitive to petrolatum products, I suggest getting the enhanced cream instead.</li>
            <li> He loves it so much that he&#x27;s been ordering a bottle before running out.  And he&#x27;s the type that waits till the very last minute to do things, or not even bother most of the time.  So that says a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has oily skin, and his previous moisturizer didn&#x27;t do much for him, so after extensive researching on Amazon, I got this for him 9 months ago and he&#x27;s been continuously using it since.  His face wasn&#x27;t even oily by the end of the day, not even during the summer.  He also started using [[ASIN:B000052YM4 Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash -- 6 fl oz]] at that time, and been ordering it as well.</li>
            <li> This product works.  You do feel a tingle on the skin.  I have tried it but am not regulary using it.  I am soon to start to use it every night.  Thank you for fast order and great price!</li>
            <li> I became so excited when I saw these perfect reviews for this lotion.  I bought it and used it for a couple days but it broke me out and made me look oily.  I have sensitive skin but even when I used a little, I always looked bad the next day.  I still say try it if you have more mature skin or experience with glycolic but if you&#x27;re like me, frantically searching amazon to find a product for problem skin, I would wait. (My problem is adult acne coupled with premature signs of aging)</li>
            <li> This product is as mild as basic hand lotion. The product packaging is not sealed (bottle or box), so contents of bottle cannot be guaranteed.</li>
            <li> It is so nice and light. A great price for the quantity. I will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I like it no complaints I came when it said it would and I cant really argue with that at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that this will decrease the fine lines and wrinkles that are coming in as I age. Slight stinging at first but goes away as you wear it</li>
            <li> I have used the products for a few days now and I do not see any changes, however, I have been assured that in 30 days a change will come</li>
            <li> I had minor backne and chestne from working out and sweating a ton which lead to clogged pores which lead to breakouts. This has made my acne much more manageable. I&#x27;ve had minor breakouts but nothing compared to before. This worked for me but may not for you.</li>
            <li> I already have more wrinkles than I want and was looking for something to help with that problem.  This product seems to work.  I know it won&#x27;t remove the wrinkles I already have...I just want to prevent any more from growing.  It makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li> Very nice texture and soft. The prince is really good and it works on my skin fantastic. I will recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li> I notice that my pores have gotten smaller since using this product.  People have commented on it. My face feels smoother.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion with retinal cream and mixed them , this way I could have a really good lotion to attack strech mRks</li>
            <li> I think it has helped a little with lightening up some old acne scars on my face. I use it every other night or so after I wash my face. Does burn a little when you first use it but goes away with more uses / time on after you use it.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product years back but then our stores here in Colorado stopped selling it; I could not believe I found it on Amazon! Alpha Hydrox naturally removes the dead skin cells from your skin revealing the new skin underneath. I believe it&#x27;s a good alternative to apricot scrubs as the scrubs can be very harsh on the skin. Some people can&#x27;t use them at all. I recommend this to anyone seeking a safer way of renewing their skin for a better looking you.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO HELP WITH SOME FINE LINES ON MY FOREHEAD AND MY ACNE THAT AT 29 I STILL HAVE. I PUT A SMALL AMOUNT ON EVERY NIGHT AND I DEFINITELY THINK IT HELPS. I WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Great for removing dark spots and hyper-pigmented scars. Also works well to remove the dead skin that causes a condition called ichthyosis vulgaris that causes crocodile looking skin. Works best when up apply a light oil (i.e. olive/almond oil mix) or lotion after you apply the glycolic AHA.</li>
            <li> Start with the face wash and end with this. Clean, smooth and soft skin you&#x27;ll love. I won&#x27;t go back to using anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 weeks ago along with the face wash and souffle and the difference these products have made is amazing.  Glycolic acid is one of the best ingredients you can put on your skin for just about any problem you have....and I have a few.  Oily, dry, sensitive, acne, wrinkles...you name it.  I seen an improvement in my skin texture in only a few days.  I got maybe one or two new acne spots after the first few uses and none since.  The dryness is gone....my skin actually glows now.      You have got to be faithful using this stuff.  Don&#x27;t give up in the first few days if you don&#x27;t see a huge improvement because that is unrealistic.  This stuff isn&#x27;t magic but it is close to it.    Overall a great product and I would (and have) recommend it to anyone seeking skin care with a budget in mind.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, along with the foaming face wash, on the recommendation of my esthetician who said it would \\&quot;go a long way towards preventing aging.\\&quot; I&#x27;m pretty much a beauty product lazy bones, and prior to using these I rarely even washed my face before bed--reason being, that I doubted most products really DID much of anything. But I decided to give the Alpha Hydrox line a try.    WELL, this product made a hugely noticable difference in my sensitive, problematic, acne-prone skin the very first time I used it! My acne instantly began clearing up and the acne discolorations that had long been there started fading. But the most pleasant side effect was that my skin looked a lot plumper and more youthful! I cannot imagine a product being any more effective than this one.    I have to say that I&#x27;m really impressed. The price cannot be beat. Also, it did not irritate my notoriously sensitive skin. Buy it, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and still use it because it works, it is well priced and is pleasant to use.  It&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy, no unpleasant scent, and really does produce a smoother, clearer skin.     I apply it once a day in the AM, allow it to sink in and then apply a moisturizer with SPF 30 before I go out. I use a different kind of product with anti-oxidents at night before night cream. I figure that way I cover all my bases. But this product is an inportant part of my routine and I get lots of compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliant for face.  I use it daily and it has removed fine lines and softened brown spots and left a revitalized glow to my complexion.</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliates without irritation. This is hard to find in stores, I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been around for years and it&#x27;s still a favorite.</li>
            <li> Good~ but ! Smells bad~</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. I apply a thick layer on my back, shoulders, and chest. Some of the dark spots from acne (PIH&#x3D;post inflammatory Hyperpigmentation) that were 5+ years old are now gone or atleast minimized. This has been a life saver for me, I am no longer ashamed of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I use this product every other day or every 3 days, I get little to no acne on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply at night (you must wait atleast 30 mins after showering to apply, or else it will sting) with a clean t-shirt on. All areas exposed to sunlight during the day MUST be covered with sunscreen, as this lotion makes your skin more sensitive to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and seriously it&#x27;s changed my life as far as how I feel about my body acne. I stil have acne, but this has minimized it to a point where I no longer think about it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had backne since I was a teenager and this is the first thing that&#x27;s made a noticeable difference. The low pH and exfoliating properties are the key factors here. It hasn&#x27;t been very good at getting rid of any scarring though, so you might want to look elsewhere for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Still trying to determine at this time</li>
            <li> Acids are all the rage for skin care, which sounds crazy, and one does read real horror stories on-line, not only of over-doing it at homeâsome spas and clinics are not safe either. I am pale and have sensitive skin, and I mean sensitive. It reacts fast and hard to everything: temperature, humidity, direct pressure, indirect rubbing, what I&#x27;m eating, what I&#x27;m drinking, how much sleep I&#x27;ve had, what day of the week it isâwell, that&#x27;s what it feels likeâand of course skin-care products and make-up. I have learned to avoid certain substances, including retinol, the previous wonder product for reviving the skin, so I was eager to try acids instead, but also, naturally, very cautious about it. So far this lotion has been worth the money. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it seems to stimulate blood flow, as ought to be the case if you&#x27;re scraping the top layers of your skin off, whether mechanically or chemically, and it has improved the texture of my skin. The pores on and around my nose look a little smaller, and I have fewer blackheads. My skin tingles when it&#x27;s applied, but only for a few minutes, and it does not go red, and I have not had any problems with sun exposure (of course I use a high SPF sun cream anyway). I am going to try other products in this range in future.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle. I love the feeling after using it. It keeps my skin moist and free from spots.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working.  I&#x27;ll probably reorder when I use this up, but I will not review my purchase or continue to count words.  It&#x27;s not worth my time or trouble.</li>
            <li> This is great for my skin, I use it each night, and I am seeing a difference. A little goes a long way also, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very good and the product is one I buy often, so yes I would suggest you try it and do as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again from this seller.  The price is right, shipped on time and wrapped well.</li>
            <li> Way back in the 80&#x27;s I was trying to find a cure for what my son calls \\&quot;peeties\\&quot; on the back of my upper arms...and maybe my \\&quot;booty\\&quot; too?!  This lotion, or a similar product (lactic acid lotion) was the answer. Use it for smooth arms and...&lt;br /&gt;feet, knees, thighs, every inch of skin!  Try a little tester first, some folks with sensitive skin will need to cut it with Curel, Eucerin type lotion.  I have used it for so long I slather it on, but my son says it burns. It burns &#x27;cause it works!  Just ease into it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Nicely packaged.  Nice amount for the price.  I only been using it for a short period of time.  It is too  early for me to fairly rate the performance of the product.  I will update later.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to an inexpensive, effective way to reduce the lines in my face.  I was told this was the product.  It was not.  I bought 4 bottles as I thought I would need certainly more than 1-2... well, please don&#x27;t waste your money.  It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating. A large amount comes in this bottle. Use at night to prevent sun burn</li>
            <li> I am not endorsed by this company or anything if I could show pictures I would IMA medium like complected African-American male ( like meagan good or somethin) I know with me to even use this lotion but I&#x27;ve had blotchy spots on my face melasma I think etc. and not the using this for a little over a week my face is like almost a models face my skin has been clearing up really fast everything evening out on my face and my neck I just use it evenings and sometimes the morning. Don&#x27;t know what else to say that it&#x27;s great it helped me a lot!</li>
            <li> Great price and product....love it, but at times, may be irritable. But, if you know your skin, you&#x27;ll be fine:)</li>
            <li> This is a staple for me. I don&#x27;t ever want to run out. It&#x27;s inexpensive and effective. Use it everywhere, not just your face.</li>
            <li> I used this when I was in my 20&#x27;s living in Florida... I always had awesome skin, felt confident and got compliments on my complexion. I just thought it was in my DNA and never thought a moisturizer was doing it.    Past 5-7 years I&#x27;m getting older and have lived in Midwest where I cannot find this stuff.. I have rough patches and dry itchy skin here.  I even get that icky look when I put on my make-up where you can actually see the dry patches.  I&#x27;m sooo glad I found this product again!!!  The first few times I felt a little tingle and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  After continuelly using it 1-2 times a day for about 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve got the complexion I remember from my 20&#x27;s!  I love this stuff and won&#x27;t go without it agian...... I just wish that Amazon carried the blue toner stuff too. I used that in Florida in addition to this lotion.. The two together WILL NOT DISAPPOINT, especially for those with acne... I&#x27;m not disappointed with the lotion alone, however.   Definately worth the money!</li>
            <li> When the product arrived, the package was completely mangled. As I opened the package, one of the bottles of AHA was opened and some had squirted onto the packaging. The product itself does not seem to work. I do not get a \\&quot;stinging\\&quot; as described by other users of AHA when the lotion is applied, and it does not have a \\&quot;strange\\&quot; smell as other users had described. It just seems like plain lotion. It had no effect for me or my son. I am considering buying it again but from another dealer.</li>
            <li> I really like it and use it every day! Since I start using this everyone give me compliment for my skin and ask what do I do !</li>
            <li> Omg this lotion has helped my Keratosis pilaris skin condition! It has helped smooth out my skin and reduce the \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; look on my arms and legs. I am extremely happy with the smooth feeling skin and the reducing of the dark marks on my skin. I wish I had used this long before now. I still have a few bumps pop up from time to time...but it is dramatically reduced. I use it twice a day...morning and night. I hope it keeps helping! :-D</li>
            <li> I recently had a facial and the esthetician recommended  using glycolic lotion.  I used to work in retail and  remembered that drug stores used to carry this.  I was disappointed that they don&#x27;t anymore.  Luckily,  I found it at Amazon at reasonable prize.  I have been using it under my moisturizer with sunblock during daytime.  My skin feels great during the day.  I am a bit careful since it says that you have to avoid the sun or limit sun exposure.  only have been using it for about 2 weeks.  I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and still breakout so I am trying to get back to daily routine and it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> It does what it suppose to do. It stings a little on face but it is bearable. The top layer of dermis usually shed in 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Based on all the good reviews, I figured there was no risk in trying this product. When I first applied the lotion to my face and neck, it was a bit tingly and had a weird odor to it. I figured the tingling meant it was working. After 2-3 days, I developed this rash on my neck. The lotion caused dryness and redness. I then stopped applying it on my neck. On my face, it felt tighter and better the first few days. After that, my face grew tolerance and it no longer made a difference in the texture or appearance. My face is acne-prone and it didn&#x27;t help with breakouts. I stopped using it on my face. I have keratosis pilaris on my upper arms so now I&#x27;m going to try it as treatment for that. I&#x27;ll update my review if I see any results.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any change.  This is a product that I would not try again.  There are better products out there.</li>
            <li> Saw this in an ad and thought I would try it. HAven&#x27;t really noticed much of a change, if any.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quicky after ordered. I love this product. After cleansing, toning and using the Hydroxy product my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> Following the suggestion of dermatologists, I started using a 10% glycolic acid cream before bedtime... after cleansing and before a night moisturizer.  It makes sense to remove dead skin in order to allow moisturizers and face creams to soak in and start working!  I have noticed a visible difference and, because of that, I have even sent this product to friends of mine!  I give this product the top rating... and the price is right!!</li>
            <li> love it .... as one ages, our skin does not have the fitality it once did .. this goes a long way to give it a fresh look. It removes the old and drab looking skins .... leaving a much younger and revialized appearance.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion. I use it on my face to clear up acne and use as a chemical exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even use it on my feet! It&#x27;s making my callouses disappear, and now I have baby feet again! I just put it on my callouses after I shower and wait for it to dry. I saw DRAMATIC improvement after only 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product and  credit it with my skin being clear and limiting some of the lovely redness that my Irish skin is prone to.&lt;br /&gt;It does sting slightly when I put it on but it doesn&#x27;t stay long.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way with this stuff so this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for the face</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago and was very satisfied with it. Happy to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Meh. Not moisturizing at all. Used for a month, no change in skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I have loved this lotion for years, but use it as a body lotion instead of just a facial lotion when my skin is especially dry.  I will use this 2 or 3 days in a row, and then exfoliate and/or go back to another lotion/cream or nothing at all.  Be wary when you have a fresh mani/pedi because depending on the top coat this may cause it to go dull.  Also may cause certain clothing to discolor.  But otherwise, this helped with acne on my back, what i think might be kp on my shoulders, and seems to enhance any moisturization i do on the following days, which is nice in the winter.  In the summer when i might not want to wear lotion every day, this makes additional lotion seem unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I am allergic to many cremes, lotions, scents, etc., but I can use this and have none of those problems.  Leaves the skin very soft and moist, as well.</li>
            <li> This is a good proudct,packed well and delivered on time ...I would certainly buy from this seller again.  I suggest tryng one thing in the Alpha Hydrox brand, this way ou will know if it is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensative and acne prone skin... this product seems to cause break outs and just seems cheap.. it does mosturize , but I wont continue to use or ever buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve held off reviewing this for a few months until I could make sure it wasn&#x27;t going to make my skin breakout as is the standard with most moisturizers. I have fairly oily skin but it still tends to get flaky in the winter. I don&#x27;t know how and I don&#x27;t try to understand it anymore. I&#x27;ve tried using moisturizers in the past but they&#x27;re usually too greasy, they make me break out (which I am still very prone to even in my 30s), or they&#x27;re just too expensive to justify using with no discernible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t have much hope for this but I gave it a shot anyway. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day: once in the morning under my makeup and at night after washing my face. It always absorbs into my skin fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. The amazing thing is, I can actually see results in my skin even after the first couple of times I used it. My skin cleared up instantly. I&#x27;ve skipped using it a handful of times and it seems like my skin immediately gets worse. My skin looks more glowy and smooth now. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever noticed results like this after using any other skincare product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this moisturizer. It&#x27;s a great price especially because a little dab goes a long way. My new favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li> I first heard about this on Dr. Oz and ordered it right away! And boy am I glad I did!!! I noticed a difference right away! Less visible lines and tighter skin!!! It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that! I&#x27;m about to order my 3rd bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasn&#x27;t using this sooner. I was using a harsh scrub on my face every other day, but it still wasn&#x27;t exfoliating enough. My makeup would wear uneven, sink into pores, ball up with flaky skin... I looked like a mess. Now, I use AHA every night and my skin is baby smooth, pores are smaller, my makeup goes on and wears evenly.</li>
            <li> didnt like it i prob will keep it and later throw it out or give my mum see if it works for her was waste of money!</li>
            <li> Felt like putting wax on my face.</li>
            <li> Let me start my \\&quot;story\\&quot; by saying I\\&quot;m a black woman, age 47 and have always had great skin. . most people think I\\&quot;m 35. So I decided to \\&quot;invest\\&quot; in my skin now that I\\&quot;m getting older by trying a product that helps preserve your youthful looks.  I read all the reviews on this before I ordered it as I do with most things I order from Amazon, and was overall impressed.  So, when this arrived I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it to see if I noticed any difference.  Within a week I did but not before my skin had it&#x27;s little reaction to it.  Yes it stung, yes I had a few little bumps pop up, couple red blotches, . .perhaps it was some \\&quot;junk\\&quot; working its way out -- because after that my skin looked more even, more radiant, little lines were less noticeable. . I really like this and will be sticking with it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I believe my skin is in better condition because of it. The price online 2 for 1 was very good.</li>
            <li> Omg I tried this product on my face n my whole face started to itch. I had to wash it right away. My skin just didn&#x27;t like it :(</li>
            <li> I use Benzoyl Peroxide 10% from clean and clear every morning and night and this lotion after that every morning and night. It does NOT cause me to break out. As a result of this lotion and the clean and clear I have been acne free finally after years of trying many products and natural solutions. I wasn&#x27;t using this moisturizer before, and my skin would be dry from the cleanser. I was hoping to get rid of fine lines as well, but this has had no effect on wrinkles! In fact, I still see them and possibly more due to smiling and laughing so much. I guess that&#x27;s just life, but still would like to find a good anti wrinkle cream. I will continue to use this product because it makes my skin soft, clear, and smooth. It also lightened hyperpigmentation and when I get small pimples, I apply this more heavily or multiple times a day and they go away faster.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me for cracked dry skin and worked wonderfully,</li>
            <li> This is an impressive product.  A fraction of the cost of what my dermatologist sells and the ingredients are identical.</li>
            <li> It made my face break out.  I thought I would use it on my hands, but I didn&#x27;t. The lotion is just sitting there.</li>
            <li> Short and Sweet. This stuff REALLY works. My scars are fading and my friends are asking me what I am using!! I am buying more to give away to friends!!</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot better now! Im happy with this product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am 26, female and constantly has problem with acne. I&#x27;ve tried kits from Proactive, Neutrogena, clean and clear, and a few more. None of them worked. My face would be dry for an hour then greasy for the rest of the day.  I saw on oprah, a skin care regimen that cost over $300. A scrub, a cleanser, and a lotion. So I figured I would find the ingredients in this regimen and see if I could find something for less money.  One of the key ingredients in the cleanser and the lotion was AHA. It was easy to find a cleanser and lotion made by Alpha Hydrox on Amazon, so I figured I would try it. I also got a scrub (I like the apricot scrub). I spent about $40, instead of $300!!!  I used the scrub once a week, the AHA cleanser 2 times a day (morning and night), and the AHA lotion just at night. I also got an Olay lotion with spf for the morning and during the day to protect from the sun.  I have been following this regimen for 2 months and my skin looks and feels wonderful and fresh, I have not had a major break out since the first couple weeks of the regimen. And I still have over half the bottle of AHA cleanser left. The lotion I feel will last me almost all year!!! That beats Proactive/Neutrogena/Clean&amp;Clear Kits a $20 per month regimen, by far!!! I think I will call it the Mariah Regimen lol!!!  I will never waste money on another face washing product or kit again!!! I recommend it to any one with or without acne!!!  Hope this helps!  ~Mariah</li>
            <li> We have been using Alpha Hydrox for years. Very effective.</li>
            <li> This is a good exfoliating lotion. I have a dry and rough skin. Now my skin turned smooth and good. No breakouts so far. I apply it once every day . Tingling feel is normal . If it tingles then it means its working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing, the skin feels tight because it becomes dry. So it&#x27;s important to wait until the natural oils from the skin return before applying any product.I always wait few mins before applying cream/lotion on my face. I first moisturize my face with Aveeno and then apply AHA.I use Kaya sunscreen when going out in Sun. &#x27;Must&#x27; use sunscreen ! I recently picked up this routine and it worked out . Hope this post will help someone in need.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Product works great! I started noticing fine lines between my eyebrows and this helped clear it in a month! I use it every night. If you plan on using it during the day, please make sure to apply sunscreen. I have a combination skin type. My forehead is usually dry but its much better now after using this. Cleared my acne too!</li>
            <li> Years ago Vogue magazine recommended Alpha Hydrox Lotion and I gave it a go. It eliminates the funny bumps on my chin and smoothes out the dry, flaky skin elsewhere. It does tingle a bit, but never causes a rash. And because it is a lotion and not containing tiny granules that would scratch the skin, it is more effective. I am not afraid to use it on my neck and chest. My husband even uses it now and so do my daughters.</li>
            <li> This performs well and at this price, you get a big bottle that should last quite a long time. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been ordering it for years. It goes on nice, not greasy. And the price is right.</li>
            <li> Great. I wish I could find it.  Maybe after spring cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great product,  works well and you can actually feel it going to work.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Life changing! I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of creams and at-home treatments to improve my skin, but most products either severely dried it out, made me break out, or did nothing. (25 female, sensitive combination skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s magic in a bottle, it&#x27;s this stuff. My skin is GLOWING after making this part of my routine. My skin looks and feels fresh, clean, and it really improved any uneven skin tone splotches I had. This is great to use if you suffer from hyperpigmentation from old acne &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; and also removes damaged top layer dead skin to reveal bright, beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you moisturize after use, as it is a little drying (nothing horrid). Make sure to FOLLOW WITH SUNSCREEN as your &amp;#34;new skin&amp;#34; needs the protection desperately!!! It does have a slight tingle to it, but nothing awful. Always spot test first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended to me through /r/skincareaddiction on Reddit. Thank you guys for your help and thank you AH for a great product!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for the past 5-6 months and I can see &amp; feel a difference in my face. My pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they were before and the only breakouts I have are about 1-2 pimples a month due to my menstrual cycle. A lot of acne scarring has decreased so I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup often anymore but this does make my face a bit oily from time to time, still a great product, though. Face is much softer than before.</li>
            <li> I was using this product a few years ago and all of a sudden the local stores stop selling them. I was glad to find it on Amazon. It makes my skin look healthier.</li>
            <li> I am going to be 39 years old in less than a month, am an Asian-American female, have dry skin, lots of freckling on my cheeks, and I suffered from a droopy crepe-y skinned forehead that happened all of a sudden in 2011.  I didn&#x27;t really notice it until the Spring of 2011.  I freaked out about aging because I look young for my age (most people think I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s) and I didn&#x27;t want to age all of a sudden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I did some research on amazon about AHA&#x27;s.  This product was well-reviewed by many and the price was great.  I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t be that much of a drain on me financially if I bought this product but it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this lotion and started using it last summer.  I wasn&#x27;t very diligent about it and stopped using it after a little while.  This year, about a month ago, I decided to finally be diligent.  I used it every morning on my forehead before going to work and every evening on my forehead before going to sleep.  Last summer, I would use it without putting any moisturizer on top of it.  But this year, I use an additional moisturizer on top of the lotion because my skin always felt dry with just the Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion.  I use an Estee Lauder day cream and a Lancome night cream.  After about a month, today, I definitely notice that my forehead skin is not noticeably crepe-y anymore.  My forehead looks a lot more smooth and youthful and I&#x27;m happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try using it more regularly on my cheeks to see if it will help diminish the freckling in that area.  I used to not have freckles but they developed in my mid- to late-20&#x27;s.  In Asian culture, freckling is frowned upon.  Hopefully, this product will help with that.  But I do remember using it on my cheek area every day last year and my face felt so raw.  That&#x27;s why I only use it at night every other day.  A lot of times I forget to use it on the rest of my face so I can&#x27;t provide a review about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do want to add that I use lots of beauty products, mostly the department store brands like shiseido, clinique, estee lauder, lancome, bobby brown, etc.  I haven&#x27;t had much real success with these department store brands in terms of improving skin quality.  Estee Lauder and Lancome have great products for moisturizing though.  This lotion is the only lotion where I have actually seen improvement in my skin, making me look younger!  Yay!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used a peeler, research before use. You can damage your skin. That being said if you have, then this is a really good peeler that leaves your skin smooth and oil free.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, after using it for a while it will start working on those small wrinkles your trying to get rid of. I started to feel a slight tingle but nothing major. My skin felt a little tighter. It doesnt do much for deeper wrinkles or scaring, but over all a good product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this from a local store, I have to admit I only bought it because it was reduced price.  But I have be using it twice a day for two weeks and the difference in my skin is very apparent.  I am a black 46 yr. old, since using this my skin glows, my cheeks are naturally rosy, my skin tone is evening out and my pores look better.  And my skin is so soft like a baby&#x27;s.  I will be definitely be using this for quite some time, and the amount you get 6oz. is quite a lot of product.  In addition to my face and neck, I have be using it on hands and they are smoother and less wrinkled.  I wish I could bath in this stuff.  I would highly recommend it and there was little to no smell from the product.</li>
            <li> So ive been using it along with my kojie san soap and I have seen a little improvement.  Not a lot but its only been a month</li>
            <li> I like what product does for my skin, this the second time that I have purchased the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month now. I notice a tingling feeling when I apply it, but I haven&#x27;t seen too much reduction in wrinkles, but my post acne scars are fading. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the lotion or just time. I gave 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results but I don&#x27;t like to judge a product before I&#x27;ve given it at least 3 months</li>
            <li> It works for my pimples, but I don&#x27;t use it oftenly because I only have few pimples once in a while.</li>
            <li> Love Alpha Hydrox products and this is no different.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> It stings a bit if you are not used to glycol acid but it is very dupable for the silky results you get. I would not use it in my face though, it has ingredients that might make you break out if you are cane prone. I use it on my back that is acne free and have noticed that my scars are not as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good product!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years- excellent even if you have acne. This smooths out lines, helps get rid of age spots and seems to stimulate collagen. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of pricey face lotions and this is not only affordable but one of the best. Just make sure to wash it off fingernails, all those acidy lotions tend to weaken them.</li>
            <li> I guess my face must be allergic to the ingredients in this product, but I was only able to use it once and the next day my face broke out horribly. I do not think this is a common side effect but just make sure you are not allergic to any of the ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> I have been using the aha 10% lotion for about three weeks now, my skin tone, dryness, blotchiness, blackheads and pimples have completely cleared up. My skin is FIRM, and the clearest it has been in years. Its weird, like it has taken years off my face. Its so smooth I keep touching my face throughout the day, even though i know i shouldn&#x27;t, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of background: I was originally scared to try it at first bc i have very sensitive, very dry skin. Also, my eczema has acted up the past year and nothing i used seemed to work (i went through tons of products, some eased the itching, but my face and skin was still uneven, blotchy, dry, and broke out a lot. I was considering using a steroid cream, but decided to try AHA first after reading reviews. Aha stung slightly (and still does) when i put it on, but its not horrible by any means, just put on a little at a time. You can also put on your fav moisturizer after the aha (i use olay regenerist at nights and a moisturizer with sun screen in the morning, again i put it on after the aha.). I went through my first bottle so quickly - within 2 weeks (bc the results were noticeable within the first few days I put this all over my body, lol) I have since ordered 4 more bottles, but in an effort to make it last longer, this past week I have only been using on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to give it a shot, even if you have sensitive skin like me. Side note: I ordered from the aha official website and received through fed ex in less than a week. I also got free face wash with every bottle of aha lotion I purchased - their face wash is nice too, but really any ph balanced one will do. The aha lotion is whats important, its like finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for now 5 stars, if anything changes ill provide an update :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-YEAR UPDATE: I posted my original review last year, Sep. 2012. It has been a little over a year of using this product and I promise you it STILL WORKS. I use a LOT less than I used to (I dont put it all over my body, only on my face and neck...although it felt good on my body, it runs out faster like that and I need to make this product last as long as possible). My skin is healthy-looking, smooth and I haven&#x27;t had bad eczema breakouts this year (last year was horrible for me, but this helped reign my skin back in.) B/c i use only a little on my face and neck, the product lasts me a long time. Oh, and I still use and love use their face wash (sometimes you get special promos where the face-wash is free after buying the cream). Will be a life-long user :-)</li>
            <li> I enjoy the entire line if Alpha product. These products allows your skin to repair and the products glide on leaving your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This lotion is 6 oz that contains 10% glycolic acid. You do not need that much when you apply this lotion so it will last a long time, plus with the continuous skin exfoliation my skin has been so much softer.</li>
            <li> love this lotion. I am using it it for 2 years now. My friend recommended it to me. And since that i do not even want to use a different lotion. It is not greasy. It moisturizes the skin very well.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, so thought I would give it a try. I started getting breakouts in my early 40s thanks to hormones and read one of the reviews that recommended AHA and this product for adult acne. Great advise - worked like a charm. I&#x27;ve spent a fortune trying to figure out how to get my skin under control so I Can&#x27;t believe the value and how well it works. I use the wash and this lotion and my skin is finally cleared up! Whoot.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It goes on light and smooth and I wake up with much better looking skin.  For reference, I&#x27;m very fair skinned with mild to moderate closed comedones and sensitive to fatty acids.  It&#x27;s strong enough to turn cells over to reveal new cells, but not so strong that I cannot use it nightly if I wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve teamed this up with Stridex in the Red Box, Vanicream Cleansing Bar, Vanicream Lite Moisturizer, and Aquaphor with great results.  I will be putting this on my subscription list.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. I thought I would try something else and came back to alpha hydrox. May sting a little a first.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin at all. I have used Alpha Hydrox products in the past and I always loved them. I should have kept using it but im always searching for that *new* product that is going to do all these wonderful things!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night.  My face did sting for about 10 minutes, and then I applied heavy moisturizer over it, and the stinging sensation subsided.  I really liked the way my skin looked this morning.  It looked brighter, and my face had less redness.  I think I might be using too much of this product; a little goes a long way, and I usually apply about a dimes worth to my face and, and I feel it may be overkill.  I sort of like how it makes my skin red initially; it gives me some color, almost like I was in the sun, but a healthy color, not like Retin-A red, where it&#x27;s splotchy and sickly looking.  I hope this product doesn&#x27;t break my sensitive skin out, but I will update when more time has passed.  I&#x27;m using this on alternate days with Retin-A cream (both at night before bed), as I have read several places that these two products work well if you use them on alternate days.  I have very delicate skin, and I can only tolerate Retin-A twice a week, or I get a lot of irritation and redness (not cute redness either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to put lemon juice on my face a few times a week, and this AHA cream feels exactly how the lemon juice felt, so I wasn&#x27;t alarmed.  Lemons work great, but they are sort of messy and gross, and I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my skin while I&#x27;m sleeping.  Lemons are incredible for brightening my complexion, but it appears that this AHA lotion has the same effect; yay! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this now for a few weeks, and I really like the results.  I put it on after I wash my face at night, and then put a heavy moisturizing cream on after it.  My skin definitely looks brighter and makeup goes on much smoother.  Just make sure that you are exfoliating your skin by washing.  I wash twice a day, once in the morning in the shower, and then at night.  I don&#x27;t use a wash cloth to wash, because that is too harsh for the delicate skin. I just use my hands and gentle pressure and wash for 1 entire minute.  This makes all the difference in the world.kes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years &amp; love it as daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the awesome reviews. I have light skin and was hoping this would help with uneveness and smooth out the little marks. This stuff made me break out like CRAZY! I have never in my life had acne. I thought I had, but after using this I had a breakout like I have never ever seen before! Now I know what real acne is and it sucks! I am still using it on my arms, it didn&#x27;t make me break out there but be careful on the face!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month. I can&#x27;t really say I can tell a difference in my skin but I will continue to use the bottle and report back after more time. I will say that it says it is odor free on the bottle but it has a very strong, not very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff will really transform your skin. Use it for six weeks and you&#x27;ll see. It&#x27;s anti aging but also works great on acne!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see an improvement on my face, except that it gets very irritated and sensitive, don&#x27;t recommend if you have acne prone skin, is best to use beta hydroxy acid. Good for mature skin to fight wrinkles. If you want to use it so your face peels than it help with that.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I still use it.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle.  Works great.</li>
            <li> what can i say, it really works to remove dead cells without irritation or redness.  my skin appears much brighter.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have purchased it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and it appears to smooth my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Alpha Hydroxy lotion, taking her own bottle out of her purse to show me.  So far, I find it light, but it makes my skin look better (less old looking).  She told me that the cleaners from the same line weren&#x27;t necessary &amp; I agree.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin is overly sensitive or anything but this product caused my neck to start burning and itching, I had to wash the product off of my neck immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also caused my face to break out, I gave it a few tries to see if my skin just needed to get used to it but my skin was not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this was a waste of money. It also has this chemical smell that even my fiance noticed after I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I heard the excitement about Alpha Hydroxy from my favorite entertainment/health info show of Dr. Oz. I bought both the clearm and the lotion.  The lotion is great.  I think I like it!!</li>
            <li> This product seems to be doing its job, my skin is soft and smooth and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the downside would be the smell of this product.  It&#x27;s not horrible... just unpleasant.  The offensive odor doesn&#x27;t linger overly long, it&#x27;s mostly gone within 15-30 minutes, but it really takes away from the enjoyment of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Cream, which has almost no odor at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the high rating, but after using it for about 2 weeks, there is still no progress. I give it 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t give me any breakout or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I like it when I combine it with Lierac Coherence Firming Day Cream. This is too thin to use alone unless on sweaty summer days  but for right now it needs to combined. When putting this on after you wash your face I feel some tingles. It seems to work. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month along with the Lierac and I got a dewy complexion!</li>
            <li> this stuff did absolutely nothing for me. nothing good, nothing bad. just tingled on my skin when I put it on and then it goes away after a few seconds. no results</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moist ,non greasy,absorbs well.Reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this product before having bought it in a retail drugstore but then could not find it till I saw it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Happy it&#x60;s available.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, has helped clear up sebum in my pores around my T-zone and freshened up my face.</li>
            <li> 25 years using this lotion.  Can no longer find in stores. Main reason I use it - It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or that I have cling wrap slathered on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this working for wrinkles on your face, but I can say that it works amazingly to clear up my keratosis pilaris (bumps on the backs of my upper arms and sometimes upper legs).  I&#x27;ve had it for as long as I can remember, and I just turned 33.  I did some research and found that 10% glycolic acid was supposed to help.  This bottle was the best value I could find after moderate searching on Amazon.  I use it before bed on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and make sure to wash it off the next day (so the sun doesn&#x27;t burn it).  The bumps will begin reappearing if I don&#x27;t use it within about 5 days.  I&#x27;m amazed each time I notice how smooth my arms are, now.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry skin or a dry patch. It is very soothing once it dries. I used it at a friend house and ordered it from Amazon. It works great on your feet also! Nice price also! Much more expensive in drug store..</li>
            <li> I use this product as a substitute for body lotion. Apply two days in a row, then rest for one day. Very soon you will see the difference on your skin. The keratosis will be cure as well if you have the patience. Use sunblock, very important.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and have tried many products that didn&#x27;t work out. So glad I ended up purchasing this. This product has really improved my skin texture and feel.  My skin feels softer and smooth.  Previously I had little clogged pores on my forehead but when I started using this, it completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> I purchased alpha hydroxy many yrs ago when it was really inexpensive for my face.&lt;br /&gt; My husband breaks out in a rash that itches  on his shin bones every year as weather gets cooler and he has tried many things to avoid the rash and nothing has stopped it and lotions to clear it up.  This lotion clears it up.  I am now having to order it over the&lt;br /&gt;internet as retail stores are not carrying it. Ulta does.</li>
            <li> The bottle is too expensive for its size, but the product inside does a great job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion.  I&#x27;m 47 years old and I&#x27;ve been told that I look like I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s.  I use this twice a day and I can&#x27;t live without it.  It stings a bit at first but you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> This products did help diminish lines and other skin flaws.  helped to make skin texture more consistent.  Wasn&#x27;t the best wrinkly type cream I;ve used but for the price, pretty decent.  Haven&#x27;t determined if I will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I used to break out a lot but when I started using this product my skin cleared up and has a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, especially considering how inexpensive it is. I use it primarily on my body...it works really well for the bumps brought on by keratosis pilaris.  Besides working to eradicate/mitigate the bumps, it also helps my skin have a healthy, even tone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about AHA products but they all make me break out insanely. I thought maybe it was just the face wash so I tried the lotion because of all the amazing reviews but it was horrible. First, it doesn&#x27;t blend well into the skin. Within two days of using it I have acne all over my face, blackheads and huge cysts. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who has acne. There are waaayy better products, like Bliss No Zit Sherlock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I had 2 people say this review was \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot; so maybe I should clarify. I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all, I&#x27;ve never had a rash or any type of allergic reaction to a face product before. Maybe this is an allergic reaction, there&#x27;s a first time for everything! Personally, I just think this product is not good for people who have acne, but it could just be me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for 20 years gets rid of uneven skin tone, the scent is not something I would desire but the smells goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> it really works. my white heads are gradually dissapearing and my skin is less bumpy, but u should give it time to work. at least a few weeks is needed before seeing results.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this because of the wonderful reviews.  I put it on right before going to bed. The 1st through 4th days were wonderful. It did exactly like it promised. My face looked much brighter and clear.  However on day 5, I woke up with red itchy pimples all over my face and neck.  After a series of expensive test and research, my derm said it was contact dermatitis from using this product. She said that it had the preservative Diazolidinyl Urea in it.  She went on say that a lot of companies are moving away from this preservative because it causes problems with a lot of people. Keep in mind, I do not have sensitive skin. That being said, if they would discontinue using DIAZOLIDINYL UREA in their product, I would definately try it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this on my chest (I have used other glycolic products before), which makes the skin look a little smoother, firmer, less wrinkly. It hasn&#x27;t made the skin peel, so this must be an OK product for a gentle effect if you don&#x27;t want you skin peeling.</li>
            <li> Like most middle aged women, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to stop or slow down the signs of aging. Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion (10% Glycolic AHA)is one of the most effective beauty lotions (or creams) that I&#x27;ve ever used. I am soooo, sooo, happy to have found it online, for as others have mentioned, it is no longer sold in drugstores, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teen, I didn&#x27;t have much acne but in my 30s had a full break out of \\&quot;adult hormonal acne\\&quot; that was treated with Retin-A &amp; zinc cream (at night). After using a couple of tubes of Retin-A cream on my face my complexion was glowing.. no scaring, no wrinkles, etc. and that lasted for a good 10 yrs. Then I found this Alpha Hydrox 10% lotion and it gives me the same glow as the prescription Retin-A did! It&#x27;s a lotion so it is light and does not break me out. It&#x27;s about the same consistency of Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for any women of any age. You can&#x27;t beat the price (around $10) It&#x27;s economical enough to be used as a body lotion. In fact this 6 oz lotion was first sold as a &#x27;body lotion&#x27; when they first came out with it. Use in the morning for a beautiful glow under makeup or alone (but with sunscreen) and at night before going to sleep and you&#x27;ll see a big difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alpha Hydroxy has exfoliating properties of it&#x27;s own, but I also exfoliate once a week which makes my skin even more glowing and flawless. I use a little honey &amp; salt... watered down to a grainy but workable consistency... and sometimes a little mashed avacado or olive oil mixed together. I firmly yet gently rub it onto my face in circular strokes. Leave it on for about 5 minutes like a mask then rinse completely. This is a Cleopatra recipe... who was reputed to have had gorgeous skin. NOTE: Honey is great for the skin and is a natural antibiotic for skin wounds when applied topically. In WWI honey was used with great results on wounds when antibiotics became scarce!)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it. It is very reasonably priced and works better than skin products triple the price. I used to buy it in the stores and then they stopped carrying it. I was happy to find it on Amazon. It makes your skin kind of sting and itch when you first use it and that is because of the exfoliation, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s doing something which others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> In only two weeks time my skin has visibly improved. I have always had acne and this has helped so much! My skin is glowing and it is only a fraction of the cost of other creams I have tried. I will encourage you to test a strip of your face a few nights to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction. I am very sensitive and have had no problem with this but better safe than sorry. Love that it&#x27;s fragrance free!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as one of the steps for Dr. Dubrow&#x27;s &amp;#34;Acne Cure&amp;#34; Which means I use it as a cleanser, rather than it&#x27;s intended purpose of a moisturizer. If I&#x27;m in the shower, I&#x27;ll also put it all over my body after cleansing with actual soap, let it sit for two minutes and then wash it off. It&#x27;s really helped clear up my KP.</li>
            <li> I have Roscea and just recently purchased this product. When I first put it on my face tingled and got really red but the next day looks so much better love it</li>
            <li> Eventhough I have only been using this product for a few months, I really like that it keeps my skin hydrated perfectly.</li>
            <li> I prefer the serum which is discontinued from the maker. This takes time to be absorved.</li>
            <li> Seems to really keep my skin hydrated and helps with my acne. Alos gives me a nice glow. A great addition to my acne fighting battle!</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old, and just starting to need some wrinkle prevention help (I have always had dry skin but not too many wrinkles)!&lt;br /&gt;I Read AHA is the best for skin in my age group - and read this line was good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it in the AM or PM (not both) for about 2 weeks and have noticed the following:&lt;br /&gt;* It smells funny. I HAVE to mix with a tiny little bit of my yummy smelling BLISS moisturizer to negate the gross smell - which works. They need to fix that though.&lt;br /&gt;* After just 2 weeks my skin already seems more &#x27;glowy&#x27; and alive. Coloration is smoother. I&#x27;d say dewy too! (is that a real word?).  Proof - my boyfriend who already thinks I have amazing skin actually commented that it was looking even better. With the additional glow he was wondering if I was pregnant! ha!! (I am not)&lt;br /&gt;* I originally tried using this on its own as a moisturizer but now I use this UNDER my regular moisturizer (SPF in the day and night cream at night)... It seems very light to be just a moisturizer on its own - which I don&#x27;t think it is trying to be - and as such it makes my skin feel a little tight after it sinks in. Adding actual moisturizer afterward just feels better.&lt;br /&gt;* My skin feels hydrated all day long and when I wake up too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am impressed and happy and have had no issues with this product at all - no burning, no redness, no stinging, no increased acne etc... and it is my first AHA product to use ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will order the eye cream and the SPF 15 moisturizer in the line - may as well use all the same product together I figure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling adult-onset acne in the form of closed comedones which are resisting my efforts like they&#x27;ve planned this all along. Using glycolic acid (in combination with salicylic acid, plenty of moisturizer and careful attention to my face) has helped to keep them at bay. I still have a few here or there, but when I use this lotion they decrease. Unfortunately this hasn&#x27;t been a miracle-worker for me, it has taken some time to get them to go away, but it IS working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out using the Alpha Hydrox pads which have a higher percentage of glycolic acid but I hated using them. They were incredibly scratchy on my skin and made it itch/burn like a million fire ants were stinging my face and I just wanted to peel my skin off. I was desperate, though, so I still used them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a pleasant texture and it doesn&#x27;t feel too drying on the skin. My skin is very dry so I always apply another lotion afterward, but that is just me. The lotion has a very faint smell, that is kind of like glue. However, I discovered that if I used this lotion in conjunction with another brand of lotion I had from wal-mart it began to have a VERY strong ammonia scent. I&#x27;ve never had it happen when I apply another lotion after this one has dried completely. It does still sting a little bit, but much less than the other brand. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t sting at all if I don&#x27;t have any exposed skin or scratches on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it occasionally would itch/burn, I now use it specifically on the locations where I&#x27;m trying to fight off the closed comedones, and I&#x27;m seeing just as much success as before when I was covering my entire face. When I was using it all across my face, I only needed a pea-sized amount, this stuff spreads so well. Now I use about half a pea size or less. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a few months and I&#x27;m less than 1/8 done with the container! It will last so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions just let me know!</li>
            <li> After two weeks there appears to be a difference in my skin while not causing breakouts. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s any better than any other glycolic acid lotion. It&#x27;s very economical, the lotion formula is easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores. Solid choice for AHA use.</li>
            <li> DID NOT LIKE THE CREAM AT ALL.  WOULD NOT ORDER IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Thank you!! A+A+A+A+A+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my dry scaly skin...prescription and non-prescription.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works to totally remove they dry scales and the bleeding cracks.  Nothing, including this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what this does do, is soften the hard scales so that they do not crack and bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, or any product with Glycolic AHA ....WILL BURN any open cracks or sores.&lt;br /&gt;After the burning goes away, this one application will last for 15-20 hours, till I shower again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell pretty, but it does not spell bad or have a strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount spreads quite a bit so, apply a small quantity and spread it, then add more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again...YES, it burns, but it will make your flaky skin look and feel better and less itchy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff especially for the price. It does seem to soften my skin, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my&lt;br /&gt;dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this lotion on my neck where there were some tiny brown skin tags. They had been there for a very long time and I didn&#x27;t know what to do to get rid of them. I wasn&#x27;t sure what this lotion would do but wanted to give it a shot. I applied it on my neck every night. After 1 week I noticed the skin tags had noticeably flatten. I continued to use it for another 2 weeks, and 60-70% of the skin tags were gone. However, whatever left on my skin seem to be stubborn. They don&#x27;t react to the lotion anymore. I lost my patience and eventually stopped using the lotion. I am switching to ROC retinol serum and will see if it&#x27;ll clear all the skin tags. I plan to use the remainder of the AHA lotion on my face. Hopefully it&#x27;ll help to reduce my large pore size and acne.</li>
            <li> I originally got this for use on my face and didn&#x27;t see the kind of results I was hoping for. But I started using it on my body and this lotion really works. I even put it on my feet when they get too dry. It doesn&#x27;t smell, isn&#x27;t greasy and lasts long. No qualms about giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks and don&#x27;t notice any real difference.  As a lotion, it works well.  It did sting a little at first, but after a week or so it doesn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s really nothing that &#x27;hurts&#x27;.  I did break out on my neck and wonder if I had just put too much on.  I&#x27;ll use it, but not for wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I use it at night. Slight tingle. I think my skin has been benefiting from the alpha hydroxy.&lt;br /&gt;I have senstive skin, if you had seen my reviews on other lotions, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. All good.</li>
            <li> I have pilaris keratosis. This product has helped so much for my arms, legs and face. Slight burn on the arms but no where else but so worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible! I laugh at lot, and because of this I have two large fine lines surrounding the sides of my lips. I wanted to give this product a try and I&#x27;m more than surprised! I put this lotion on my face twice a day....Cheap and it works!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to wear sunscreen!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Hands, feet, elbows, knees,face. Like Brylcreem, a little dab will do. It takes care of dry or cracked skin and is not scented.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin silky smooth.  Although it does feel itchy for the first few applications.  Nice scent.</li>
            <li> The best treatment for blackheads, as well as general skin care.  Use when blackheads first surface on face, skin, back etc, and they&#x27;ll be almost gone in half a day.  Mild acid breaks the oil surface tension on your pores, allows O2 in and helps clear up the infection; acid environment is also less hospitable for the bacteria that cause the blackhead infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same principle as the expensive benzoyl peroxide treatments you see on TV.. but less like drain cleaner on your skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used for years as general skin care, very mild.</li>
            <li> This is not working for me I bought five of this I taught Its a good bargain when its on sale..... But it gotten worst when I tried it, gave me more pimples I gave it a try for 2 weeks but my face became worst I don&#x27;t recommend this.... at all.</li>
            <li> The lotion is smooth going on, and it&#x27;s tingly, light weight, not pasty, and feels clean.  It has that &amp;#34;oh wow, you&#x27;ve gotta be kidding me&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel and look soft and smooth and moist! That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use Garnier ultimate cleanser, it exfoliates..so I thought. After a little time applying Alpha Hydrox Lotion. My face looks so clean &amp; feels so smooth. When I look in the mirror, Im like Dang! My skin looks good! I like it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - i use it on my body and face. I don&#x27;t use it on my face all the time, because the skin there is sensitive, but overall it has smoothed out shaving bumps and other irritation, made my skin smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Walmart stopped selling this online. Amazon&#x27;s price is better without tax and handling charges. I&#x27;ve used this for years, and it&#x27;s helped with cell turnover immensely. It takes time, but stick with it at least once a day, and you will see results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month ,the first two weeks it stung and made my face red and it peeled which it is supposed to do . It has cleared up hormonal breakouts evened out skin tone tighten and firmed this 46 year old face and is lightening the sun damage, the lines above my lips are way less noticeable as are the forehead lines and tightened pores. weeks three and four it doesn&#x27;t really sting now and the flakiness is better , my skin looks good and my family has noticed and commented on it. I am very happy with this product and the results .</li>
            <li> I will always buy this, it seems to help.</li>
            <li> This lotion works for me. Keeps your skin looking good.</li>
            <li> Never used a glycolic AHA lotion or cream before, so I wanted to give it a try. This particular one got great reviews that seemed genuine, unlike the usual drivel when it comes to skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;What can I say? I&#x27;m impressed, this lotion and my skin seem to be a match made in heaven, so far (mixed skin with fine lines around the eyes and on the forehead). It evens out all the patches on my face, leaving it sofffffft as a baby&#x27;s tush.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs well and fast, without leaving any nasty sticky residue, and there&#x27;s no built-up of sebum like with other creams.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use it on top of a serum as a moisturizer, other times i just use this alone and then I apply the make up.&lt;br /&gt;The price was also enticing for me, under 10 bucks, as I&#x27;d hate to try a $25-30 dollar lotion just to discover that it sucks.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I think that this would go great for most people, except of course, somebody with a high sensitivity to glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> This lotion is non scented, not greasy and moisturizing enough to feel protective on my skin. It also feels like it has firmed up and smoothed  my skin when I put my make up on. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle over a few months.  Didn&#x27;t notice too many differences, I purchased it for acne/wrinkle prevention.  This burns the skin a little, especially when fresh out the bath, but nothing painful/intolerable.  I was excited, and expected some improvement since researching AHAs, but have seen improvement with other AHA products.  I have quit using when I ran out, and have not noticed much of a difference in my skin since.  Would not buy again, but as always, your mileage may vary, and what does not work for me, may work for you.</li>
            <li> I am seeing some slow changes using this product every other night (I am alternating with a Retin-A). For the price and what you get, I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer, this is my 2nd time purchasing. I feel it has greatly improved the texture of my skin. The first bottle I used all over, this second bottle I am using on my face and I purchased the silk body wrap lotion for my body.</li>
            <li> I noticed a positive change in my skin texture after just one night of use, and I&#x27;ve continued using as directed ever since without any problems. I will probably order this product again when I run out, but that won&#x27;t be for quite a while :).</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this wonderful lotion after we sold our pharmacy, and we were very disappointed!! We live where the winter&#x27;s can get very cold. Your skin gets very dry and even cracks, and this is the only thing we have found that really works. We love,love,love it!!</li>
            <li> Great product and am completely satisfied. No issues whatsoever. Will recommend to anyone interested in this product. Will do business again with.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two days with sunscreen and noticed that where my glasses sit on my nose it started forming a scab. I suggest  people who wear glasses not use this on the bridge of your nose and sides where your glasses make contact. Just use a separate non-comedogenic moisturizer and then use this alpha hydrox lotion on places like your chin and cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> I cant tell its really doing much. Ive been using it for a month now and see very little change. Maybe some overall evening of skintone but nothing dramatic. No reduction in lines. No reduction in old acne hyperpigmentation. I have had a few minor blemishes pop up but nothing horrible. I dont experience burning or itching when using it. Use once a day.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Enhanced Lotion is for dry skin types (so we are in luck). It contains 10% Glycolic AHA and is supposed to soften lines and wrinkles as well as improve elasticity and even skin tone. The lotion is not what I expected. It is not creamy but more like a gel-like substance like the face wash. A little goes a long way so be careful not to use too much. When I applied it to my face it took quite a while for me to rub it in and for my face to absorb all of the lotion. My skin felt moist but not oily, almost like wearing a thin face mask. After a while the lotion did dry out to where my face was dry but it still felt very moisturized. When I washed my face that night before bed I could still feel the lotion on my face almost like a gel. My face has been a lot clearer since I started using it. No breakouts!</li>
            <li> I usually use luxury products. A beauty book convinced me to try this. I found it sticky and smelly. Didn&#x27;t use long enough to see if it worked or not. Back to my Kiehl&#x27;s, Lush, Dermatologica, and Origins staples.</li>
            <li> Someth8ing w/this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t agree with me. I get a rash and itch. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to it? I have used it on my hands at night and it really softens them, though.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  I typically use it twice daily:  once in the morning and once at night.  In the morning, I typically let it dry and then apply a sunscreen moisturizer.  My acne has gotten better, my skin is smoother, and dark spots have gotten lighter.  At 6 fluid ounces and 10% glycolic, it doesn&#x27;t pay to buy more expensive products that come in a smaller size like the souffle (which I also have).</li>
            <li> I used this twice and had to give up. After using it, I got horribly painful cystic pimples. Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to work like that, but it&#x27;s not worth it to me. Wish the seller would refund me, but no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using a 40% glycolic peel and it&#x27;s already worked 200% better than this. If you can handle an at home peel, I suggest it!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> This was my first glycolic acid product and I am glad I started slow with the lower percentage.(this would good advice from other owners/users of this product) I was able to build up my tolerance fairly quickly, after a week of using it every night the redness and burning sensation I experienced was greatly reduced. I think once I finish this bottle I can go to the higher percentage easily. You get a lot for your money with this lotion, I  use a nickel sized amount for my face, it covers my whole face easily. I feel like it will take me over half a year to use up this bottle, seriously. I have started using it on my dark elbows in the hope it will help renew, soften and lighten that skin, also so I can use the lotion up and go to the next level of acid strength. I haven&#x27;t noticed any remarkable changes in my skin from this product but, 1) It does not cause break outs for me 2) My skin FEELS like it is toned, taut and renewed 3) I definitely feel like this helps the other products I use work more effectively, e.g. and acne scar cream I am using 4) It doesn&#x27;t shrink my pores exactly...I think it is helping my pores stay clearer longer, which helps them stay smaller and not become inflamed or enlarged by dirt and oil, Once my pores are purged they seem to stay clear. 5) My skin does look fresher and glowy after using it, moist but not shiny, dewy might be the word. 6)  My skin seems to like this product enough for me to be consistent with it. 7) No scent, no perfumes, just a teensy tiny tiny bit like a chemical like ammonia. the scent is barely there at all, I only mention it because I know how sensitive peoples noses can be.This tiny scent dissipates immediately, I had to pour a big glob and stick my nose in it to smell it at all. I would totally recommend this without hesitation to my extremely chemically and perfume sensitive mother.  I hope my review is helpful to you:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Alpha Hydrox Lotion. It has really improved my skin. Overall I have a more even tone, less break-outs, and my face is much smoother. It does burn a little, but it&#x27;s not unreasonable. Once it has been absorbed, I put a SPF 25 face moisturizer over it so I don&#x27;t get burned. I will continue using this - it really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add - I recently went to reorder this lotion and see the price has increased over 300% - what the? It&#x27;s expensive elsewhere now, too.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face and on my body and in all cases it seems that the product doesn&#x27;t absurd at all. I used several AHA products before and it&#x27;s the first time I got something that just sits on my skin. wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin, but I have no problem on this product. The first week I use it, I feel little bit tingling , but after a week, I don&#x27;t feel anything. My skin looks clean and I have a slightly peeling. Not too much. I think I will try 12 percent after that.</li>
            <li> This is no longer carried anywhere close to where I live. I have been using it for years daily. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.  I kept the lotion and I will donate it to someone or give it to homeless person.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a recommendation for it in the book &amp;#34;How to Wash Your Face&amp;#34;. I like it a lot. I think I can see a noticeable difference in my skin texture after using it once a day for a few days. After a few weeks my skin adapts so I start using it morning and night. Then I take a break for a few weeks and do it again. I don&#x27;t know if this is the recommended M.O., but it works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it really worked for me. It does take about a moth of consistantly using it but it lighted my skin about 2 shades lighter.</li>
            <li> I have little white bumps I get on my arms. It has a name but I always forget. Anywho, so I read up about this stuff and decided to try it. I dont remember when exactly I bought it but it was about 5 or 6 months ago and I still have the same bottle. And even better, it works for taking away these embarrassing bumps. I get them right under my butt on the back of my thighs. Nothing bad except for my pride. But this has saved me from my emotions and im all cleared up. It super moisturizes my skin, leaves it really soft and young. It does leave a little bit of that greasy feeling but it&#x27;s more of a dry greasy feeling if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;Well, that about sums it up. I love this stuff, I don&#x27;t remember having any complaints towards shipping, so it was probably good and not late.&lt;br /&gt;Try it for youself, you&#x27;re looking at it for a reason.</li>
            <li> Cant be sure if its really working or i just have good genes, lol. Have purchased many times over the years from amazon and elsewhere, can usually find at marshalls or tj maxx cheap, if not i go here. It feels like its working and thats all that matters. Its my go to mosturizer always. I supplement with an eye gel or cream because this stuff is a bit harsh and tingles a little so i try to keep it away from my eyes.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see much result from using this cream</li>
            <li> Used this in connection with vitamin E oil and though stretch marks seriously run in my family, I didn&#x27;t get any on my stomach during pregnancy!  I had them already pretty bad on my legs.  There is no explanation for why I wouldn&#x27;t get marks.  I have to give credit to this oil.  LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything else for my acne prone skin.  While other people reported great results, I did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just what I need for the discoloration on my face, slowly but surely they are fading away, I am curious to try their other products!</li>
            <li> I have used other products that worked about as well, no problem.  However, because of the cost of the other products, you had to use sparingly, unless you were into robbing banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Alpha Hydrox, you can take a bath in the stuff, and it costs you virtually nothing, which helps your skin a lot!...Also, I know it is a small thing, but the popover lid is perfect!...you can put this on your face, and not get half of the stuff stuck under your fingernails because you have to scoop it out of a jar...try it!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice texture, no scent and moisturizes well. I dont give it a five star rating because I havent seen in other glycolic products I have used before, although I would still recommend it as your skin will feel softer after using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a couple of months now. It&#x27;s nice and works well as a lotion, but it has yet to get rid of my &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; as a lot of users said it would. I put it on every night and have not seen much of an improvement. I will continue to use it until it runs out, but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face and neck. A year ago I lost the top layer of the skin on my neck from glacial burn and it sometimes gets blotchy. This is helping my skin become more normal again. I also have very oily skin, and my acne is going away. I&#x27;ve been putting it on at night a few nights a week.</li>
            <li> I am using acne kit from acne.org.  i got this to compliment that kit.  I use this once week, but mainly for spot treatments.  As soon as i feel a zit coming i apply this to it few times through out day and zit never really makes it starts healing away right away.  Great lotion.  And for spot treatment this bottle will last for years.</li>
            <li> I use this followed by 5-10% benzoyl peroxide to imitate a very expensive treatment sent monthly.  I don&#x27;t usually get pimples with it, but if something starts, I use this again &amp; it is gone by morning - wonderful.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my arms in the shower to help with the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;, or small red bumps. I shower as usual, and closer to the end, I take a quarter size amount of this lotion, slather it on my arms, wait two minutes, and wash off. It&#x27;s amazing how quickly it works! Was using expensive lotion before, but this is one third the price and works faster.</li>
            <li> Junk...made my skin super dry..even following the instructions on how to apply and then limiting myself to less times than the instructions called for...just hated it and made my skin break out.</li>
            <li> i know the title sounds campy, but it is so true.  My skin is near perfect with use of this, it is defitnetly a cure all.</li>
            <li> I noticed improved skin appearance right away.  My dark spots are fading, and more radiant skin is evident.  I am noticing fewer wrinkles around my eyes too!</li>
            <li> I feel bad buying this stuff because it does not work.Dont waste your money on this ,i bought this a while ago and i regret wasting my money on this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product the first time in Walgreen&#x27;s, but in Amazon I found it cheaper. This product works peeling off your skin but it is not too strong. I recommend to take a break of 2 days if you feel it too strong for your skin. This happens only the first time you use it after some time your skin get use. It does removes dark spots but ONLY the light ones. Do NOT expect miracles when comes about dark spots. The product keeps your skin smooth and soft (you can feel it) and my moisturizer seems to work better after this cream. It is not greasy and do not smell. I notice in another review somebody said it doesn&#x27;t absorb, well, my experience was different it does absorbs, I just apply a bit (more doesn&#x27;t means more effective) Actually there should not be a problem dues this is a lotion not cream. The bottle is a big so it last. I have sensitive skin and combination (only/dry) and it works for me. I used it in my face, chest, elbows and knees. Perfect for those with Keratosis Pilaris. This seller is amazing!!! I have received the package in 2 days, it was well wrapped and in good conditions. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels at first I was skeptical using for two weeks,I like it. Has a tingling feeling but no redness I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After using it for a month I can see a difference. fine lines are less noticeable. it does sting a bit when used often but thats just telling me its working.</li>
            <li> im very disappointed and cant see that it is doing anything to improve my skin. ive been using it faithfully every night sinve i received it</li>
            <li> Really good stuff! I put it on under my day and night cream. My skin is sensitive and this lotion works very well without me breaking out.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does what it claims.  You must be careful to stay away from fragile eye area though as it will dry it up.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and will buy again. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get all the old skin cells taken away and new ones brought out!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the retinol night resQ and the enhanced lotion 10%  took over a week longer to arrive to me so I have been using the night longer. I use this during the day. I have noticed some difference in the fine wrinkles but not sure which to give the credit to. Maybe a combination of both. My skin occasionally gets itchy and was thinking the product was drying out my skin but that has not been the case. No peeling or anything to tell me it is drying out.</li>
            <li> I have use this in the past and  my skin responses to this product very well. I&#x27;m seeing improvement .</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it twice and I haven&#x27;t felt a burning sensation at all. I am not sure if this means its working or not. I hope it will help remove a few wrinkles, but not sure yet how effective it will be on me.</li>
            <li> This product Made my soon break out worse:( fast delivery though.. just not right for my skin. Good luck with yours:)</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin oh so soft and has faded many acne scars. I use it after using a Kojic Acid Based Soap. I would say a good way to use it is get a good facial brush, cleanse your face, apply this lotion in a thick layer and let it settle in, then use dampen your brush and brush your face in circular motions, rinse, pat dry and moisturize. Your skin will look glowing and new..</li>
            <li> This product has really helped out my skin in the few months that I&#x27;ve been using it. My forehead and chin used to be covered in small bumps which would not go away regardless of what products I used and with daily exfoliation. My aesthetician told me to use a product that contained glycolic acid to help slough off the dead skin cells and get rid of the bumps, so I went ahead and bought this product because it is very reasonably priced and seemed to have good reviews. You actually get a lot for what you pay, especially because you don&#x27;t need to use very much of it. I only use this lotion in the evenings because it tends to make my face look and feel oily (which was initially concerning because I already have really oily skin), but it has worked wonders so far. My skin is clearing up and the lotion has helped to get rid of a lot of my clogged pores. I still exfoliate daily with a little silicone cleansing pad that I bought from Sephora, and the combination of that and this lotion seems to be working for me. All in all, a very satisfying purchase.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday use :-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell of this</li>
            <li> I have stuggled since my teens with sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin that sometimes develops dry spots in the brutal Ohio winters. As cliche as it sounds, I have tried just about everything on the market to improve my acne and issues with oily skin--including prescription medications like Accutane, Tazorac, and Finacea. My issues with oily skin are hormonal that will likely never change, but working to get a handle on my acne has been a work in progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have worked to get back to basics on my skincare and it seems to be improving overall--I cleanse with the Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash (which is very mild) using a Clarisonic brush and follow up with the AHA enhanced lotion, a specialized eye cream duo from Avon and then an Aveeno moisturizer for sensitive skin on top. I have noticed a significant difference in the overall feel and texture of my skin through this routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primarily, the AHA enhanced lotion has replaced a prescription acne/wrinkle cream (Tazorac) that was prescribed to me by my dermatologist. I find it gives me the same results at a much, much cheaper price. I quickly found that it was important to follow instructions when using this product, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alpha Hydrox AHA enhanced lotion should be applied sparingly, as it is very thin and it does not take much to get full coverage of your face. Be sure to avoid eyes, eylids, nostrils, and lips as much as you can; these are sensitive areas that you don&#x27;t want to touch with this lotion. I apply underneath my eyes, however. Likewise, I make sure to wash my hands after applying the lotion and I follow it up with a moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I encountered was with applying the AHA enhanced lotion to my neck area, which resulted in a painful red rash/reaction. I did not perform the \\&quot;patch test\\&quot; as recommended for this product and this resulted in a reaction on my neck which feels a bit like a mild chemical burn. My face, however, has not had any suchreaction; in fact, I have noticed really great results in just a few weeks time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am young (29) but have been using anti-aging type creams for sevearal years in an effort to prevent signs of aging on my face before they occur. I wear sunscreen religiously and make every effort to keep my face out of the sun--even more so with this product. It is VERY important to stay out of the sun, as your face is much more sensitive to the sun&#x27;s rays when using the Alpha Hydrox lotion. That&#x27;s fine by me, however, because I&#x27;d rather avoid getting wrinkles on my face anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel this is a great product for the price and I anticipate this bottle will last me quite a while. I would recommend researching this product before purchase to ensure the best results.</li>
            <li> I love AHA Lotion. Here are the reasons why: No#1. This is 10% AHA in it which is the most percentage I&#x27;ve been able to find in a face lotion. No#2. I noticed a difference in my skin over the course of 3 days of using this product and No#3. It does not dry out my skin. I just love this stuff. I have hyper pigmentation and lots of acne scars around my cheek and chin area and this product has lightened those areas a lot since I have first used it. No other product has came close.. I&#x27;ve been using neutrogena, aveeno and those horrible harsh chemical peels in vain for years thinking it was helping my skin but... I got a wake up call when I started using AHA, it&#x27;s awesome! I use it about two times a day. In the morning and I leave it on at night. I love how it feels when I first put it on because I can feel tingling and thats when you know it&#x27;s exfoliating. I used something similar to this years ago and I loved the results but it dried out my skin way too much. I&#x27;m glad they came up with a product for people with dry skin! I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I enhance this with additional acids to peel your skin and it works wonders. I use this twice a day.</li>
            <li> Great product works better than expected  I use it daily</li>
            <li> Love how this product feels on my skin.After just a week of use I noticed a difference in  my skin. My skin felt smoother and the skin felt firmer.  I use in conjuction with the face wash for better results. Definitely worth it especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I used to have cystic acne all over my right cheeck and jawline, thankfully my dermatoligist put me on a new prescription regime. So my breakouts have been far less extreme, but I have some bad scarring.  :( This cream has helped with fading my scars, and helped heal any new pimples that have occured (especially when I break the rules and pick at my skin...I know, hands off, right?) I&#x27;ve been using Glycolic Acid based creams on my skin for about a year now, this product and another by Reviva Labs. As much as I LOVE this cream, it wasn&#x27;t suitible for everyday use on my skin. (obviously.. ) When used everyday my skin started to flake&amp;peel, causing more of a break out. I&#x27;ve just gone back to my 3x a week routine and my skins gotten alot better. I use this mostly as a spot treatment for my scars, for now, since I&#x27;m still fixing my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: My Derm. did NOT presribe me anything for topical use, so as for the scar fade, Thank You AHA&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. So happy. My skin is smooth and so much clearer and younger looking. Well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I used this product but there was no difference in my complexion or skin. It doesn&#x27;t work as it claims.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the foaming face wash on a whim and I love it! I have used many (much more expensive) skin care brands in the past, but none are this consistently great for my skin. I have oily combination skin that is prone to hormonal breakouts. I use this product each night (start out using it every other night, as it might sting a bit at first). I have seen my skin even out and I&#x27;ve experienced much fewer breakouts! Horray!</li>
            <li> Really good lotion! Not heavy or greasy feeling at all. Gives my skin a nice mild shine and is virtually scentless. Does not sting my skin or turn it red. Wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with KP on arms and legs, and the occasional rough elbows. I found it to work after about a week of using it daily, but if I skip two days or more, the bumps return. I don&#x27;t know if there is anything long term for KP (short of any surgical procedures) but I am still looking for a product that will continue to deliver even if I miss a day or two.  With the dry winter air, its even worse so I try to keep the skin hydrated, but I don&#x27;t know if this product is effective if used layered under lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped reduce wrinkling around the eyes and neck and the price was a lot less than AmLactin.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is this product is worth the money and will work to smooth out skin, but in my experience it had to be applied everyday for any noticeable improvement. I probably wont buy this again and will still be looking for a KP solution.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked perfectly on my arms.  I was getting small flesh-colored bumps here and there, but they&#x27;re completely gone now.</li>
            <li> I have problem skin prone to at least two cystic bumps a month. Super irritating when that happens. This stuff is great for the general appearance of my skin and seems to have cut down on the cystic acne problem. I feel like my face looks smoother and isn&#x27;t as prone to the acne outbreaks. Great product, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. This stuff is great. It has really helped my moderate acne. I use it at night after washing my face. Make sure your face is dry before putting it on. If my face is wet, my skin tends to get red. You will need to wear sunscreen when using this. Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> This is great Alpha Hydroxy lotion ~ non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  Best value to be found for this type of lotion.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with dry skin and my skin was looking a tad rough around the chin. I started applying this and in a few days my problem has been remedied along with a new glow to to my skin. Looking younger is never a bad thing :)</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. Feels a little greasy, but does its job. I use this for 2 weeks leading up to a chemical peel, and this helps to prep the skin a bit.</li>
            <li> Even more effective than the night cream!! It is smoothing out my skin. Getting rid of small bumps and improving clarity and skintone of my face. It tingles when I use it so I know it&#x27;s working  and finally something that actually works at an amazing price! Can I order a case please???</li>
            <li> I am definitely satisfied with Alpha Hydrox! It is the perfect way to reveal and maintain the beautiful skin one might have hidden below the old top layer. I&#x27;ve added it to my beauty regime and would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with moderate acne. I already have a fairly intense routine to keep everything in check- 3 step cleanser, toner, and medicated lotion twice a day. I&#x27;ve added this lotion after the third step. My skin is basically like stone at this point so it doesn&#x27;t even slightly burn, but most people will have to use it sparingly for a couple weeks while they adjust. AHA helps even out my skin tone, reduce acne, and slightly improve wrinkles. I only have minor wrinkles in my life now so I can attest that it helps maintain their current state and not deepen as quickly. If your skin has become immune to benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, this can shake up your skin and maybe get it back on track. I know some people who can get away with just using this lotion for acne. That&#x27;s not my story, but still. And it&#x27;s cheeeeap on amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth after using this stuff. I&#x27;ve had no issues or skin reactions after months of almost daily nightly application. It burns a little when freshly applied, but that&#x27;s normal for an Acid ;)</li>
            <li> So Far so good. I bought this for use on my 25 Y/O boyfriend with acne scars on his back and mild acne on his face. I can already tell his back is starting to dry out and become less oily. The pock marks and scars are starting to get smaller as well. I used one pea sized drop of this lotion for a  really large zit on his face and the next morning he woke up and it was even with the skin. I was amazed at how fast this started working. I will come back after we have been using for a while and will provide an update, hopefully a good one!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to combat the overall skin darkening and age spots that appeared after menopause. I use it on both my face and my arms; I have a lot of little age spots on my arms.  I was skeptical, but after only about three weeks of use, my skin tone has lightened overall. I am not sure the age spots will completely go away, but I will continue using it and see. I don&#x27;t think it has reduced the fine lines on my face, but it does have a moisturizing effect that gives my skin a dewy look.  And unlike another alpha hydroxy face wash I tried, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin burn.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try and clear up body acne. It worked! So as an experiment I thought to see how it worked on stretch marks. I noticed a great improvement. I will be reordering this product. I also felt no stinging or other painful sideffects of using an acidic lotion.</li>
            <li> I wanted the lotion form and I was looking for a 10% for at least $5 and I couldn&#x27;t even find anything less which is nuts. Tonight I seen this tor $5  which pissed me off because I bought the 10% oil-free watered down formula and I hate it even though it has really high ratings. Oh well I am sure it will work anyway.</li>
            <li> Lowest price for a good AHA product!</li>
            <li> The person using this product in our house says it it working very well.  This product arrived on time and in excellent condition.  We will certainly order this product again.</li>
            <li> I used this a few years ago but for some unknown reason stopped?? I think I was trying other skin products. Also, it is difficult to find in local drug stores and other stores. Anyway, I have rediscovered it!! my skin feels smooth and fresh, so happy I found it again. Where else??? Amazon.com - I find I am making almost ALL of my purchases here - great prices - great selection....</li>
            <li> i am so happy with  this product. i actually dont use it as a moisturizer because it makes my skin dry in large red patches, especially in the drier parts of my face. instead i use it as a mask. i wash off all my makeup, rinse with hot water and pack on the lotion like a mask. like any mask i only use it twice a week, because this stuff is strong. i leave it on until i get it the shower late at night, and i still dont rinse it off until i exfolliate in the shower, the steam reeally helps the product sink in. i have noticed a dramatic difference with my acne and just the texture of my face. overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used to use Kiss My Face&#x27;s Peaches &amp; Cream Moisturizer (no longer sold), and was glad to find Alpha Hydrox.  Works very well and my skin feels so much better, and I prefer the higher percentage of AHA.  Do miss the wonderful scent of the Peaches &amp; Cream, though.  Alpha Hydrox doesn&#x27;t smell bad; just not great, either, but that disappears as you apply.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first as I have had skin discoloration on my legs for most of my life - well over 30 years. I&#x27;m the summer I wear make up on my legs in order to cover the blemishes when I wear shorts.  I decided to give this product a try after reading many of the positive reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month. Today while dressing I noticed that some of the dark spots I had are literally gone. Places where I had dry patches are smooth and soft. I will continue using this lotion as apart of my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> Good product but not quite strong enough.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this lotion on my face, I noticed that it was tingling and stinging a little. Especially where I was broke out. After using it a few times I did notice that my face was looking smoother. I started using it to get ready to start using acid peels. I think it&#x27;s a great product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Shortly after I began using it, I began to get compliments in my &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; skin, something I have never been noted for in the past.  A pea sized drop does the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for dry skin which I have.  For people with sensitive skin it may not be too good.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of Alpha Hydroxy Lotions and this one is very good and does what it is supposed too.  The acids in the product act to remove dead, dulling skin cells, giving skin a fresher look.  It can dry the skin and it&#x27;s OK to use a moisturizer on top.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s necessary, but I wait awhile before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is one of several products I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon that contains the ingredient propylene glycol. I ended up throwing this out because I discovered this too late.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help get rid of the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and legs. The lotion did not help smooth out the little bumps and I found something better instead. Since I still had the whole bottle, I decided to use this as my night time moisturizer. I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s so I have minimal wrinkles so I can&#x27;t attest to how well it helps with those. My skin does feel tighter after using this though. Sometimes I use another moisturizer alongside this one because it can be drying. I wouldn&#x27;t use it by itself if your skin is on the dry side. My skin has been smoother since I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in a while. I&#x27;m not 100% behind this product, but I think it is doing what it is supposed to for my face.</li>
            <li> I suffer from pregnancy-related acne and KP on my legs. I have been using this on my face and body to address both issues. Glycolic acid is safe to use during pregnancy. This product is awesome under makeup and sunscreen, and alone or mixed with a body lotion (I use Ambi). My skin is incredibly smooth to touch and well moisturized, and dark spots are fading. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been using products with salicylic acid in them for years. It initially kept my skin semi clear. But last summer my skin had began breaking out horribly. I figured it was from the humidity. But after the summer past my skin was STILL breaking out. I had not had skin this bad ever. I was so sad. I barely wanted to leave my house and makeup was pretty much useless. I started weeding out products that could possibly be causing this constant break out and it was the salicylic acid! I guess my skin started hating it after all this time. I had been using the &amp;#34;St. Ives&amp;#34; medicated scrub for years. I was looking for something to clear up the severe scarring all over my face and dry up the bumps I had. I have never been so happy about a product until I used this. Within the first day I noticed my face clearing up. My left cheek had bumps all over it specifically and not my right one. I really needed something to stop the left side from the break outs. It has been a couple weeks of using this morning and night along with my &amp;#34;Serious Skin Care&amp;#34; glycolic acid face wash and all my active pimples are GONE. In addition to changing my pillow case everyday other day I literally stopped breaking out. My nose isn&#x27;t clogged with sebum anymore.The scarring I had on my face is so much lighter. I&#x27;m half black and latino so my scars were very dark, almost black. They are probably 50% lighter now. This lotion doesn&#x27;t dry my face out, I use as my face lotion morning and night. I have really oily acne prone skin. This helps keep my face from looking shiny! In the next couple of months my scarring will probably be 100% gone. My mom saw me without makeup and was literally shocked that my skin looked so clear! She thought I had on at least something to cover my scarring but I didn&#x27;t. I will use this forever. And it is not expensive at all. Seriously try this. It does sting a bit when I first put it on, especially if you have open acne spots. Sorry for the long review. I justlove this so much.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this otc but it is to hard to find. This is great for the face.  It helps the skin to exfoliate the old skin making it fresh and new looking.  Don&#x27;t be surprised by the flaking, that is part of the process.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased the lotion and couldn&#x27;t be happier! It was delivered earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a great feeling on the face , not greasy and no perfume. I absolutely love this product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Chilli&#x27;s Outlet store for your truly customer oriented way of conducting business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shergyn Martinez Vitacolonna</li>
            <li> this is as good as Walgreens AHA cream.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of dead skin cells, without being harsh on your skin. I use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this over and over again and it&#x27;s awesome! Makes my skin so smooth both on my face as well as bumpy parts of my body. No more face or body acne with this. And it&#x27;s really inexpensive! I have normal skin and don&#x27;t need to use an additional moisturizer after for night time. No more chicken skin on arms, back of thighs or butt. Smooth skin on face, neck and chest. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion years ago.  I like how it makes my skin feel, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly there are stronger products, this is a very inexpensive way to achieve maintenence&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I really like it.  My skin feels softer.  I will continue to buy and hope it even does more in the long run.</li>
            <li> burn from this produc I went to m I went to my doctor and my d and told me this product was not good for the skin</li>
            <li> Great product!  helps with brown spots!</li>
            <li> This lotion claims to be an anti-wrinkle cream, and guess what?  It does work!  I purchased this with the the Alpha Hydroxy face cleaner.  It is mild and does not feel greasy on my skin.  I plan to use this and reorder it when I finish it.  I recommend this without reservation.</li>
            <li> This is the first AHA product that I bought. I really like this..I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a year and I&#x27;m pleased with the result. I recommend this as a spot treatment. It is better than salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide..especially for very stubborn pimples, and for a low price..it&#x27;s really a good deal!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, and think it helps without breaking me out, as several dept. store cosmetics do.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I purchased this about 6 months ago &amp; my face hasn&#x27;t looked better! I use it every day in the morning along with other products, I can tell a big difference when I don&#x27;t use it! My pores are smaller, my skin is firmer, &amp; fine lines appear to be fading. It may sting a little after application, depending on your skin type, mine is oily &amp; can take pretty much anything you throw at it. This is a definite keeper!!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t say whether it could or could not be used on the face, however, I chose to use it on the face because the active ingredient was Glycolic-AHA. It broke me out on the forehead and scattered acne on my cheeks and jawline. I recommend acne.org&#x27;s AHA lotion. I&#x27;ve been using ACNE.ORG&#x27;s skin line for a year and they have an AHA lotion along with acne care and it works amazingly. I actually had to go back to it and it cleared my acne up again.</li>
            <li> always keep these in stock.</li>
            <li> This product caused a rash but other Alpha Hydrox products with similar ingredients have not. Upon contacting customer service regarding the difference in product reactions, customer service stated that they could not disclose the source of the ingredients (e.g. animal or synthetic) and how they might vary from from product to product.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! It does make my fair skin feel a little vulnerable in the sun if I don&#x27;t have sunscreen on but it has made a visible difference in the softness of my skin.  The lines I do have look softer, and even the crease between my eyebrows is softer and less noticeable. Better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> It works. Can feel the tingle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to reap the benefits I wanted, which was using it conjunction with retinol cream 12 hours apart to help remove stretch marks.  It did however remove dead skin cells without causing redness.  My skin was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any major change so far. Have been using it for a week or so. But somehow I&#x27;m still quite confident that it will work. Very reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> Another product that was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am actually very impressed with my purchase, it&#x27;s well worth the money you will spend.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion hydrates therefore helps you smooth out your skin! I will keep buying this product!</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and at night.  It really helps make my skin smooth.  It also helps prevent acne because the dead skin cells aren&#x27;t clogging up my pores anymore.  When I do get a breakout, it seems to clear up quicker.  It generally doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle unless my skin was irritated by something else, like using a washcloth, etc.  My only complaint is that my boyfriend hates how it tastes when it ends up on my lips.  But I know I&#x27;d break out if I stopped using it, so I guess I&#x27;m stuck.   Update June 2017: I bought this at Amazon at first but had to go elsewhere when the price went up.</li>
            <li> I had rough bumpy skin on my upper arm and it was getting pretty badly scarred. I used many moisturizers, peels, creams, lotions, retinoids etc..But I used this product for 5 days and I see about 75% improvement in the bumpiness and started to remove the scars. Best treatment for keratosis Pilaris hands down.</li>
            <li> This cream really helps loosen dead skin cells and create collagen production. Love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products like this, I&#x27;m 41 and have minor signs of aging around my eyes and forehead.  I have seen noticeable improvement.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this every night before I go to bed. I did notice some &amp;#34;expelling&amp;#34; when I first started (more acne) but then after that it was way better.  If I miss a few nights in a row I&#x27;ll start to get acne again, so I try not to miss more than one night.</li>
            <li> Great product. Within the first couple of days I can see a difference in my skin. Brighter, clearing up faster, and has my pores looking smaller. Can&#x27;t believed I ever lived without this  ! BAM AWESOME GET IT !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, off and on for about 12 years. I say off and on because every now and then, I&#x27;ll venture off and buy those more expensive products as a way to &#x27;treat&#x27; myself then humbly return to Alpha Hydrox. Amazingly, this product gives me results matching those of products which I&#x27;ve spent $100. or more for. I even use it all over my body for the same awesome results. It firms, smoothes, reduces pore sizes and evens out skintone and isn&#x27;t irritating. I&#x27;m 57 African American female and have always taken good care of my skin. However, if you&#x27;ve neglected your skin over the years it&#x27;s not fair that you should expect miracles over night from this or any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost expected they would have changed/cheapened the formulation over the years, but surprisingly, they have not. Lastly, be sure to sign up for email notifications from their website because when they have sales, they tend to be major. Just recently, I stocked up on a buy one get one for $1.49 and that applied to all their products. Will continue to buy :^)</li>
            <li> Stinks to me didn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> silky cream.  Use it on my neck and chest too.  great price.  good stuff.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago, and I noticed a visible difference in my skin health and appearance.  I&#x27;m  glad that I rediscovered this product.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for a year, I can see the difference, and I will purchase more when I need to. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> when i first began using, i was getting hormonal cysts across my cheek each month. i also had some sun spots and general skin discoloration from years spent in the sun without sunscreen. well, at first i didnt think it was doing a whole lot. i used it regularly for a month and not much happened. after that i dropped to a few times a week, eventually less, sometimes only applying to problem areas. i did get a superficial blemish using this occassionally. i wasnt impressed.&lt;br /&gt;however, months later i noticed the sun spots and some freckles had lightened. i also noticed i stopped breaking out monthly. (i was also using opti women vitamins for hormone balance and evening primrose). I went the next summer with religious sunscreen use, (la roche and skinceuticals only) stopped taking vitamins, because frankly i just dont like taking pills, and only used the alpha hydrox on any blemish that came up or maybe every few months when i was feeling girly.  now two years later i dont use anything on my face but my shea butter soap and my skin looks great. my tone is even. i rarely get a pimple, but when i do, they seem very superficial and disappear quickly. blackheads have diminished, no change in fine lines, and pores are still large though look diminished somewhat. whether it was the lotion, time, age (late 30s) going natural with my skin, the vitaimins, i dont know, but i would definitely give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;also, my kids are blessed with my genes and are suffering from pretty bad acne. my son has been on doxy and retin a for a few years, and using this as a spot treatment does seem to reduce cysts quicker. im going to suggest maybe using it all over a few times a week. my daughter tried it last night and everything looked less red this morning, so again we may give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Fast service and excellent communication.  Product is great and fragrance free which was a plus and really loved it for the price. Have bought all the really expensive items with fancy names but have had good luck with this product thus far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re looking for a deep moisturizer and to calm redness but that&#x27;s about it. It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin at all and it feels sticky to the touch.I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people with oily skin .</li>
            <li> Not bad, but would prefer if there wasn&#x27;t any toxic ingredients......</li>
            <li> This lotion had made my skin feels and look smoother.  People have actually commented on the difference.</li>
            <li> If you want to live your life like a vampire...this is the right product for you! Why? Well, I found out the hard way, Glycolic Acid increases your skins sensitivity to the sun. A warning was issued on the lable, but silly me didn&#x27;t think it would be that big of a deal. I burnt horribly the next day from 20 min. of sun exposure! YIKES! Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It does, however, improve the look of the skin, the price is great, and there is no fragrance(YAY). BUT, like most beauty products, it has dimethicone, which is an acne irritant. If you have horrible acne like me, dimethicone is TERRIBLE for you! Find something with out it! If you don&#x27;t, than this might work nicely for you. Dimethicone is bad no matter what, but it wont hurt your skin appearance if you have no acne.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the product</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and really works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I purchased it for my acne, which has improved greatly since I have started it.  It has been about 5 months and I do not break out anymore and if I do get a spot it clears up very quickly.  But the best thing happen just a about a week ago.  I have a very hairy bikini line and over the last 20 years I have given up on keeping it shaved for swimsuits and just wear boy shorts.  I would end up with ingrown hairs and large red bumps.  So I have tried everything to help and nothing worked.  On a whim I tried to shave once more and I have used this product twice a day along with the foaming cleanser once a day in the shower.  I am happy to report that my bikini line looks amazing!  I have shaved three times in a week each time waiting for the bumps and they never came.  WOOHOO!  Thank you!  I do get a slight burning sensation right after shaving but that is it.</li>
            <li> This is a light lotion that works great.  When you first start using it, it will make you peel a bit though.  But keep up with it and soon your skin will be glowing.  When I finish my bottle, I&#x27;m going to purchase the 14% serum.  I only use this at night but once a day is plenty.  I purchased this years ago and completely forgot I had it.  I know that glycolic acid is one of only a few skin care ingredients that really work at targeting fine lines and wrinkles.  And the price is certainly reasonable.  I&#x27;m an ingredient reader so I know that many purported skin care creams and lotions have little or no actual beneficial ingredients.  I know this works.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite as it really does help me look younger! Ive tried a lot but always return to this one! Im out so I will be re ordering it again soon. It really does help the wrinkle thing and it feels good on my skin. I have combination skin. It didn&#x27;t cause break outs and it doesn&#x27;t take much. I even put it on at night to! I would buy it forever! Im 58 but this helps with the aging thing!!!</li>
            <li> This product has a few cons, so I&#x27;ll start with them. You MUST be careful not to get this on your eyelids or lips. It says so on the directions, but please heed that warning. One night when I was sleepily getting ready for bed my moisturizer and this stuff got a little mixed up and I got it all on my bottom eyelid. It seriously burned my skin and I had to see a doctor. It took days to heal, it hurt like hell, and he said I was incredibly lucky I didn&#x27;t damage my eye or tear duct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also strongly suggest doing the recommended spot patch test. If you have very sensitive skin this may burn you and you may need to mix a small amount into your moisturizer to start with. Lastly, this stuff can really make your skin peel, so be VERY careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have unpredictable acne. I can be clear for months and then break out all over my face. I get cystic acne which seems impossible to treat and has to run its course. I have a few lines on my face, but nothing serious. If this product fades them, great, if not I&#x27;m not too concerned about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this, my face completely cleared up. I was amazed, and then my skin went through a purging period. I believe this is due to the fact that it exfoliates your skin and brings everything to the surface. I have had a few big breakouts since using this and NEVER have I EVER seen a breakout dry up and heal faster. It&#x27;s almost miraculous.  I&#x27;m about 3 weeks in to using it and I have noticed a vast improvement. Sometimes blemishes never even reach the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all over my face at night after washing and toning with a little pure tea tree oil diluted with water on a cotton ball. In the morning I exfoliate with a light scrub and my skin always looks better than it did the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I break out, I spot treat with this and I have never had better results with any product I have tried and I swear I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as another brand of glycolic acid product I use and it smells bad. There is no tingling or anything with this one.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! After about four weeks of using it, I could see a big improvement in my skin. It was much more even in texture and color. It seemed firmer too. I use it morning and night, and a tiny amount goes a long way. An excellent product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Works great!  A little goes a LONG way!  Nice and thin, doesn&#x27;t leave you with any sticky feeling. Perfect for my face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as i was hoping it would for bumps on my upper arms :/</li>
            <li> I love this n it does everything they say it does couldn&#x27;t be more please with this product n it is so cheap</li>
            <li> Works wondrerfully and at a great price. I have tried a lot of other products and this works!!! Try it!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best .I love it you still need to use sunscreen though as it doesn&#x27;t have any in it .It works great and my skin looks great. It has the most glycolic aha that I can find.Its my favorite lotion and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and leg. It really works!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a male in my mid 20s that has been suffering from acne since my early teens. I started using the Acne.org regimen many years ago, and found that to be sufficient for the most part. Or, at the very least, I thought that my acne was just a fact of life and that The Regimen was the best I could do.  About a year ago I bought this stuff and for some reason I never used it but once - maybe because it stung a little. But a month ago I had literally the worst acne flare-up I&#x27;ve had in years: something new every day, deep beneath the skin&#x27;s surface, and it just wouldn&#x27;t quit no matter what I did. I went searching online for more ideas, and to my surprise, found this on Acne.org&#x27;s website with pretty unanimous acclaim (which is impressive since acne &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; seem to be very hit-and-miss). Needless to say, I found my bottle and applied it to the affected areas over night. To my surprise, the very next morning things were looking up: the swollen areas of cystic acne looked somewhat &amp;#34;deflated&amp;#34;, and places I could feel were about to erupt were no longer feeling that way. Over the next couple of days, the situation went from bad to nearly cured.  Since then - about a month - I&#x27;ve had literally had my longest stretch of acne-free living that I can remember in years. I apply it to spots in the morning and leave it on all day, and apply it to my whole face at night. Of course, I always wear sunscreen now and have added a tiny bit of Jojoba oil to that to get totally moisturized and protected skin.  I haven&#x27;t even noticed but one or two little pimples try to pop up, and they literally seem to just fizzle and die after applying this stuff. Although all acne cures are likely to have different effects on different people, this has been such a miraculous change for me that I just have to recommend it. It&#x27;s only $10, it lasts a good while, and it may have an incredible effect on your acne situation and your face&#x27;s glow in general. In addition to being acne free, my scars also seem to be fading and my general skin tone is improved.  10/10? I think so.  EDIT: I still recommend this product, however you may find after using it for a while that your skin gets used to it and the effect is slightly diminished. Luckily, this same company makes a similar product with a higher concentration of the active ingredient. I bought it under the name &amp;#34;AHA Souffle&amp;#34; or something like that, but it looks like the closest they now offer is &amp;#34;Alpha Hydrox 14% AHA Serum&amp;#34;. So I still recommend starting with this product, but if you find it stops working for you, try something of theirs of a slightly higher concentration.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really works or really did anything good for me. So I give it a 3 star rating!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Started using it Jan 4. The scars started fading slowly. Almost all my scars are fading away. I highly recommend this product. Best product I have ever used and my first product review.AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product didn&#x27;t really agree with my face. But I have used it on my neck and hands. These areas do look smoother and younger, so this product does do what it claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne more than half my life.  I started at 13, I&#x27;m 29 now.  It&#x27;s never gone away entirely save a small few notable occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started getting gray hair {which is no big deal to me} but I was indignant that I had acne AND gray hair, so I went on another campaign against zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;d tried just about every OTC topical treatment / cleanser, two kinds of oral antibiotics and two kinds of scrip topical antibiotics, as well as several &#x27;home remedies&#x27;.  I&#x27;m a science minded person {it&#x27;s my job, in fact}, and I&#x27;m hugely skeptical of all products&#x27; claims to efficacy.  So, whenever I try something like this I apply it to half my face {and half of other afflicted areas}, and if I appear to see results I do a cross-over and start applying it to the other side of the face while neglecting the former treatment side.  Nothing in all my years ever gave a positive result.  Not even close.  Then I try this stuff, based on reviews, and for the first time in my life the results were 100% unambiguous.  I had a hard line running down my face {and... yeah.. my chest} where the treatment side was completely clear and the other side had standard acne.  More than that, the treatment side skin was overall smoother to the touch, which is a nice little bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a further control, I applied a non-medicated face cream to the side of my face not being treated with this product, to no effect on my acne.  So this is all to say that I&#x27;m pretty sold on this product.  It is the first and only skin care product from which I have seen any resultsâwhatsoever.  Admittedly, I&#x27;m still just n&#x3D;1, and after my amazing result I turned some friends onto this product, and their results have been less striking, if present at all.  So I think this is one of those &#x27;YMMV&#x27; things.  For me it was a silver frikkin bullet, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My treatment regimen was applying just before bed {.a little dab&#x27;ll do ya with this stuff}.I was using no other cleanser.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> Works great and leaves face so soft when you wake up in the morning after putting it on at night. I do use it along with a cleanser that has 12% glycolic acid and the two work wonders together . The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the lotion can make your fingers kinda sticky but just washing off with water for a second works and I also don&#x27;t like the smell too much but putting on right before bed does the trick</li>
            <li> I totally LOVE this product!!&lt;br /&gt;I am 26 and i always had to put fondation on. But after I discovered this amazing lotion, my face is so even toned and no pimples!Not even one!!!&lt;br /&gt;I know you might be skeptical ab it, but I assure you that this product does work!!!! In 1 week of using it religiously, I saw amazing results. It is sour a little bit, but it does its job!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this lotion daily before makeup application. My skin is oily and acne prone, and this helps out with that. Before this, I was against using a moisturizer under my makeup because hello! It&#x27;s just gonna melt it off! Not so with this. It dries nicely on my face and absolutely is NOT greasy. I know some people say lotions aren&#x27;t but they really are. But this one is SERIOUSLY not greasy. Additionally, I noticed it lightened my scars when I first started using it. Now, I generally do not develop any permanent scarring from my acne. And my acne has cleared up!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fantastic product. I also have pretty sensitive skin so if you&#x27;re worried about that, don&#x27;t be. It can cause some stinging if you&#x27;re not used to it, but that&#x27;s normal. If you feel burning or itching more than 20 minutes after application, you&#x27;re either sensitive or allergic and you should stay away!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lasts forever; I&#x27;m on my second bottle after over a year. A+ :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:: JAN 4 2016&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I originally wrote this review, I was using this morning and night. Over time, that was too harsh for my skin so I cut it back to nightly use and started using CeraVe&#x27;s moisturizer in the morning. For WHATEVER reason, I switched away from this. For about 2 months, I could not figure out why my breakouts were worse and my skin&#x27;s texture just.... sucked. I used it one night and in the morning had more breakouts so I blamed this and stopped again.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I remembered how WELL it helped me the first time and just stuck with it. All those breakouts? They were just little ones trapped under my skin&#x27;s surface that were going to rear their ugly heads sooner or later. This helped clear it again!!&lt;br /&gt;Now 2 weeks after its reintroduction, my skin is clearing back up, is WAY softer, and has an amazing glow. And all the scars I acquired from the acne I got are being faded too.&lt;br /&gt;This is my miracle product. I love this, and would sell my soul to have this at all times.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  After years of purchasing this product, I am done with it.  This product used to be just over $10 a bottle, and then 4 months ago went to $17 and now $29?!  That&#x27;s a ridiculous price increase and enough for me to look for another product with glycolic acid!!  This is my second order of this product, and I definitely think it is effective against wrinkles.  It took some time for my skin to adjust to the glycolic acid, so my skin was irritated on the 3rd day of use.  I backed off for a while and only used it once every 3 days, and then 1 every other day, and then finally every night.  My skin has adjusted and now I will continue to use this product forever... so long as it keeps doing its job!</li>
            <li> It is supposed to help with brown spots on the skin, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it really works.  The sun damage on my skin is really beginning to show.  I really regret being a &#x27;sun worshiper&#x27;, but it is what it is.  This lotion really feels good on my skin.  Hopefully, it will work as promised; however, if it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect form this product, as I&#x27;ve read the reviews but I was skeptical because I am an African American. However I received it and started using it as a night time facial lotion, and it&#x27;s great. Also, on tricky places with razor bumps and ingrown hairs, this lotion smooths everything out. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good for AHA exfoliation</li>
            <li> I tried using this product daily, and had no effect at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks every other night, so it&#x27;s hard to rate it. I will revisit in a month or so... I am 51, have fine lines beginning to appear around my upper lip, so I&#x27;m curious to see how it turns out.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  If I apply twice a day my skin will get a slight red irritation, so don&#x27;t over apply.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to be stingy with the lotion since it isn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> Good lotion when mixed with a moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t noticed a visible change in wrinkle reduction around my eyes, but I have almost gone through the whole bottle. Lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for about a week, and I already see a  huge difference. My skin is softer and looks like I spent a day at the spa. Couple of my friends already ordered it! Great product!</li>
            <li> This product definitely has a nice feel to it,  it helps keep my skin on my face smooth - however Paula&#x27;s Choice 8% AHA gave me such better results.  I might use this again in a financial crisis, other than that i&#x27;ll stick to Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this lotion and it is a great bargain.  I have compared similar glycolic acid products from other manufacturers and this is the most reasonable that I can find.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this product is perfect for those with acne prone skin. I had a HORRIBLE breakout that pushed me over the edge mentally to find something that would help. After reading up on exfoliation I found that physical/mechanical scrubs are NOT good for people with acne prone skin and chemical exfoliants ARE good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a few ways I use this product with results almost instantly but realistic results in 1-2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. After cleansing I add a tiny drop to my normal moisturizer and mix it all up and apply. This can be added after you applied Benzoyl Peroxide if you&#x27;re treating acne as I am. You can do this 2 times a day since you&#x27;re using just a tiny bit (pea sized or smaller)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you have a pimple forming you can catch it and stop it by putting this right on the area 1-2 times a day. It&#x27;s shocking how fast this works when your pimple is just forming. I had a cyst forming that freaked me out...put this on and it was gone within 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you have a stubborn pimple you can first put BP on it and then after a few minutes add a little of this on top. It seriously helps the healing process and makes everything go away much much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is glowing. I&#x27;m 28 and have had bouts of mild to moderate acne since I was 15, so you can imagine how nice it is to look at yourself in the mirror after 13 years and see a face that doesn&#x27;t make you upset. My face feels ridiculously smooth too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I don&#x27;t use this every day, or if I do use it everyday I take a mini break after 3 or 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone because I know how frustrating problematic skin can be! It really hurts you mentally and this stuff along side of a GENTLE cleanser, BP and regular (oil free) moisturizer has really changed my skin and my life!</li>
            <li> read the reviews and tried it.  used for a month and saw no difference at all.  i am over 60 with a few fine lines on my face.  i really like dr graf the best which really showed a big improvement on my skin</li>
            <li> The cream sinks in well enough but really dont see any changes in my skin after using for 2 weeks. I have KP so was trying to get rid of but think I will stick to peels and shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I continued with the cream just to use it up and my KP on my arms is noticeably improved. Put it on after shower and it soaks right in! I will keep using and buy again! Good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> So i was a bit skeptical about this product at first. I tried it for a whole week and let me tell you&lt;br /&gt;-brighten skin tone&lt;br /&gt;-acne going away&lt;br /&gt;-old acne scars fading&lt;br /&gt;-new acne scars fading&lt;br /&gt;-softnes&lt;br /&gt;-smoothness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just dont really like the smell. I did a patch test as they said. It burns on acne marks alil but no harm just working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it before I go to bed i apply a peas size that all. I even started using it for my toes knuckles they have gotten hard from last summer.. and its helping!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good for the keratitis, scars and blown spots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I&#x27;m a 42 year old man, and people always think I&#x27;m at least ten years younger. Enough said.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very curious, I purchased both the Alpha Hydrox 12% souffle and the 10% lotion and I think the 10% is doing a better job. When both my products arrived, I immediately went for the 12% as I wanted quicker and more dramatic results. Most reviews mentioned a slight tingling sensation upon applying the product however, I felt nothing with the 12%. I decided to give the 10% lotion a shot and yep, there it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using the Alpha Hydrox lotion in conjunction with Avene TriAcneal so I don&#x27;t know which one of the products is doing a better job Avene or Alpha Hydrox or both working together. Anyhow, my skin has never been this great. My pores are less visible, I have a healthy glow and it&#x27;s baby soft without any over-drying effect. I will definitely continue this routine and strongly recommend both products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for many years.  Every time i think I will try another one, my skin starts breaking out within a few days of use and i go right back to using this on.  It is not expensive but works great. I use it both day and night.  If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend trying this one.  I continually get remarks on how beautiful my skin is.</li>
