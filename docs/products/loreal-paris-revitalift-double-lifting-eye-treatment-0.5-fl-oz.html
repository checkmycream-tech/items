            <li>, this is too perfect</li>
            <li>For me... this works wonderfully well!</li>
            <li>It felt like a very good quality product on my finger and eyes.</li>
            <li>so when I read that this was a great product, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>The ROC product worked amazingly well, I was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It is safe and does work!!  </li>
            <li>My skin is actually very nice</li>
            <li>Great product and a good price.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product!</li>

            <li>Great results and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a couple of years, I love it!</li>
            <li>also it was unconspicuous effective.</li>
            <li>It really works best &amp; Ive tried them all</li>
            <li>The lifting cream is ok, but not as good as the Collagen Moisturizer from St. Ives.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is a nice, light moisturizer for that area, but after more than a month no change at all.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I hoped for more - instead, no lift, not smoothing.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re doing different, you look great!</li>
            <li>Makes my eyes look fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite product and not something I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li>The kids tell me I look more like their mother than their grandmothers.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years now</li>
            <li>and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>I use mostly L&#x27;Oreal skin care and makeup</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>My pores looked smaller, my skin looked smoother and my makeup when on flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much more than a moisturizing effect with the side that treats the lower lids, however.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because my favorite eye cream from ROC has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>The under eye( white) is working wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery of my favorite skin care product!!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to apply feels good and does not leave a greasy appearance</li>
            <li>This is very powerful!</li>
            <li>Pretty  good  </li>
            <li>Maybe was too strong for my skin, but burned when I used it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to help with fine lines and provides a smoother looking appearance.  </li>
            <li>It has one cream for the eyelid to smooth out the fine lines and another cream for the undereye area.</li>
            <li>Meet my expectation great product, excelente I use this product for several years is fantastic</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference</li>
            <li>The needs of the lids are met separately, while the tender, thinner skin of the lower lid is moisterized and filled in well.</li>
            <li>nice item, fast express</li>
            <li>I do this because the upper eye product is basically moisturizer, and it helps counteract any dryness that might be experienced at the hands of the retinol.</li>
            <li>The result is a moisturized and smooth eye area.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on smooth after it dries.</li>
            <li>the under eye does ok on removing dark circles and fair on fine lines, but I see no eye lid lift at all</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t special.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect golden balm products - tried using this in addition and really am not seeing any improvement or difference.</li>
            <li>Double Eye Lift was quite good.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>My eyes look so much better with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Revitalift Double Eye Lift, used either morning or nighttime.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and most products irritate my eyes after a week it two.</li>
            <li>and then the product itself isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it because it works well on my sagging eyelids.</li>
            <li>Price is right for me.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what described, easy to use, nice to colors wake my skin under eyes everyday up... fast delivery, thank you!</li>
            <li>The upper lid cream tingles when applied and my eyes are looking better.</li>
            <li>The Lifting Side really holds up drooping eye lids!  </li>
            <li>This product does a better job of tightening my eye lid tissue than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before, and I&#x27;ve tried several.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I had such sensitivity to this product that my eyes were puffier than before I used it.</li>
            <li>I hope there will be better results in the long run.</li>
            <li>BUT the white side, for the under eye area, was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>B0014ZWHZQ L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced RevitaLift Double Eye Lift, 0.5 Ounce.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being too greasy</li>
            <li>so I wake up with really swollen eyelids.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sting or anything and left my lids feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I really wish you could buy them separately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was cheap enough to give it a shot one time.</li>
            <li>Feels very tingly after appying but no biggy.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t see any difference but still using.  </li>
            <li>Products works better than expected.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris advanced revitalift double eye life .5 ounce.  </li>
            <li>The red side is for the upper lid and it comes out as a nice gel.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but can&#x27;t dispense it due to faulty pumps.</li>
            <li>and I looked 20 years older.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all my older eye sagging friendsI  </li>
            <li>Yet another eye cream that goes to \\&quot;I had high hopes\\&quot; pile.</li>
            <li>It keeps my eye area moist and it&#x27;s gentle on the sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>God, only spent eight days time to China, and it is too fast, I love the amazon.</li>
            <li>I was out of my normal product (health brand formula) that I used and the company was out of stock.</li>
            <li>I am that odd 26 year old who is already trying out many anti-aging products.</li>
            <li>Next, I really just didn&#x27;t see any positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>This has a white eye cream for under eyes and a pink eye gel for the top.</li>
            <li>I have fine lines around my eyes and have used countless products in an attempt to smooth them out, if even only slightly.</li>
            <li>This gives me the moisturizing and I &#x27;very much&#x27; like the upper eye lifting it provides!</li>
            <li>At Amazon, the price is better than at usual stores carrying skin care products.</li>
            <li>Even works better than the $100 skin caviar I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>So, it isn&#x27;t the product&#x27;s fault that I need help with my skin at a young age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will keep using this as long as Loreal keeps producing it. :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t wild about this product.</li>
            <li>I was always scared to put anything near my eyes, but you can use this product.  </li>
            <li>This makes me feel alive again.</li>
            <li>I think it works comparable to most other eye products that are more expensive.</li>
            <li>I love the Double Lift Eyecream, especially the pink cream used on the upper lids.  </li>
            <li>I was always skeptical about commercial products but L&#x27;Oreal has a good reputation.</li>
            <li>Hard to tell for sure that it will work for the long term.  </li>
            <li>A light moisturising cream for the delicate skin surrounding the eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and can barely tell any difference, except that once in a while my eyes (not the skin) burns.  </li>
            <li>and they do the same thing which is nothing as far as what they claim it will do.</li>
            <li>I am &#x27;extremely&#x27; sensitive to cosmetic products - especially products for around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I use them religiously and my skin looks young with no wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li>I have seen absolutely no change in the few fine lines I have under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The other side is a very emollient eye cream.  </li>
            <li>This is the first eye cream system I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, greasy, or takes forever to absorb.  </li>
            <li>This product completely does away with small wrinkles and really reduces deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>At my age not too much will help, but I have notice when I get up in the morning over my eyes are a little puffy and when I apply the over eye cream which is the red color one</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal products are hard to find, but worth the search.</li>

            <li> L&#x27;oreal products are hard to find, but worth the search.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find it at any of my regular sites.</li>
            <li> I used to smoke, I always seem to forget to drink water, I do not get enough sleep, and I had some rough patches in life where I was cry..</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and I will never purchase another night time eye product as long as this is being made.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this based on other reviewer feedback &amp; the only thing this does</li>
            <li> I could tell a slight difference with my eyelids after using an entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other eye products by L&#x27;Oreal and... other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> My skin got very dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> For more than 5 years, I had been suffering from ugly sagging skin on my eye area.</li>
            <li> So, I do not expect miracles and do not really need them.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> All was how and what I expected and ordered with this item.</li>
            <li> I just realized that the expected result was longer to take effect.</li>
            <li> It will take a lot of trying different products for few months each, in order to find what works for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shopping!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and did a test with other products...</li>
            <li> In addition to the other L&#x27;oreal revitalift cream, I have also used this product.</li>
            <li> As with all antiaging products, they can take eight weeks and even longer to see any results, so I recommend sticking with it even if you are skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I have never tried an eye lift or any other product for the eye.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell if the other one is working.</li>
            <li> Dark circles to appear to be less, it has only been a few weeks, but I am seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> I have some weird health thing that makes my whole face swell at night</li>
            <li> My crows feet and oversized eye bags are gone, plus the dark rings around my eyes are getting lighter amazed</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it less than five is that it is slow</li>
            <li> It helps plump up my under eyes to make dark circles less noticeable and helps keep the puffiness out of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about three weeks and find my eyes looking tight and bag less.</li>
            <li> First, the dual eye creams in one product were awkward to use.</li>
            <li> It seems like you waste quite a lot of this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using this product in the morning - at least not the under eye cream, as retinol breaks down in the sunlight and will not work.</li>
            <li> It made my skin raw.</li>
            <li> Not sure, though.</li>
            <li> I have used the past and did not experience this problem.</li>
            <li> This product unfortunately fell way short of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I tend to think if I didn&#x27;t see a difference, I would at least feel some type of tightening around that area</li>
            <li> My sagging skin has slowly  firming up.</li>
            <li> that being said I have also been rather mean to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have never had any trouble with eye products from Oil of Olay  or expensive dept store products</li>
            <li> Could not use, half of the product was dried up, extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> the tired look was getting to me.  </li>
            <li> Very slow delivering !</li>
            <li> Which, after a while, is expensive and wasteful.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am now a L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Customer.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom, but she reported it felt like a fake!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just not great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because I had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> slowly  improve it ~! ! !!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Meet my expectation great product, excelente I use this product for several years is fantastic I love it thank you</li>
            <li> I bought my item in the local drugstore, but have seen no results in the three weeks I&#x27;ve been using the product. I hoped for more - instead, no lift, not smoothing. Yet another eye cream that goes to \\&quot;I had high hopes\\&quot; pile. It is, however, moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So Cal girl in the sun a lot. A neighbour came by and I quote &amp;#34;Whatever you&#x27;re doing different, you look great! Keep doing it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My eyes look so much better with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Revitalift Double Eye Lift, used either morning or nighttime. The needs of the lids are met separately, while the tender, thinner skin of the lower lid is moisterized and filled in well. Makes my eyes look fabulous! At age 60, my eyes don&#x27;t look a day over 45!![[ASIN:B0014ZWHZQ L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced RevitaLift Double Eye Lift, 0.5 Ounce. At Amazon, the price is better than at usual stores carrying skin care products. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> As advertised and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> this product has helped with my under eye wrinkles ( well the stop of the start ) I hope there will be better results in the long run.</li>
            <li> nice item, fast express</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about three weeks and find my eyes looking tight and bag less.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It helps plump up my under eyes to make dark circles less noticeable and helps keep the puffiness out of my eyelids. It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being too greasy and I don&#x27;t have any issues with using it daily.</li>
            <li> I like this Revitalift but will not reorder.  It just isn&#x27;t special.  I&#x27;ll use it up and then move on to something else.  It isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just not great.&lt;br /&gt;The hunt continues.</li>
            <li> Very slow delivering ! Totally 2 mouths later !&lt;br /&gt;And also it was unconspicuous effective.</li>
            <li> I am that odd 26 year old who is already trying out many anti-aging products. My skin is actually very nice and I am going through products to help keep it that way. So, I do not expect miracles and do not really need them.&lt;br /&gt;Now that being said I have also been rather mean to my skin. I used to smoke, I always seem to forget to drink water, I do not get enough sleep, and I had some rough patches in life where I was cry.. a lot.&lt;br /&gt;And I have some weird health thing that makes my whole face swell at night so I wake up with really swollen eyelids. This is stretching my skin out and making it saggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did make a difference with my upper lid. The red side is for the upper lid and it comes out as a nice gel. It didn&#x27;t sting or anything and left my lids feeling smooth. I could tell a slight difference with my eyelids after using an entire bottle. BUT the white side, for the under eye area, was too strong for me. It made my skin raw. Now I still gave this product 4 stars because it does work. Also because it isn&#x27;t intended for my age skin. So, it isn&#x27;t the product&#x27;s fault that I need help with my skin at a young age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it less than five is that it is slow and I could only use the red stuff. Which, after a while, is expensive and wasteful. I really wish you could buy them separately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to give it a try. It will take a lot of trying different products for few months each, in order to find what works for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shopping!</li>
            <li> I have never had any trouble with eye products from Oil of Olay  or expensive dept store products so when I read that this was a great product, I decided to give it a try. I don&#x27;t know if it does what it claims because it made my eyelid itchy and flaky and hurt. I stopped using it and did a test with other products...no problem Tried this again....and same result...eyelid irritation and flakes</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this based on other reviewer feedback &amp; the only thing this does that reviewers have said is cause makeup to run.  Boo to that... will have to use only at night like the one user mentioned.  I don&#x27;t see any improvement in bags, droopiness, or puffiness in the eye area.  I tend to think if I didn&#x27;t see a difference, I would at least feel some type of tightening around that area if it was actually working... which I don&#x27;t.  Not my favorite product and not something I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> In addition to the other L&#x27;oreal revitalift cream, I have also used this product. The eye lift cream works. It is a temporary lifting, but it does work</li>
            <li> Hard to tell for sure that it will work for the long term.  I do see a difference for a short while though.</li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no change in the few fine lines I have under my eyes. It smells good and is a nice, light moisturizer for that area, but after more than a month no change at all. I won&#x27;t buy it again. It was cheap enough to give it a shot one time. I&#x27;m going back to the Olay products.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is great! It has one cream for the eyelid to smooth out the fine lines and another cream for the undereye area. After only a week I could see a big difference. My eyes look much younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference but I like the extra moisture it provides around my eyes. I don&#x27;t use it every day so maybe that&#x27;s the issue.</li>
            <li> Been using for one month and have not seen any results....Feels very tingly after appying but no biggy. Will not purchase again. Going back to Clinique. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find it at any of my regular sites. I highly recommend it to all my older eye sagging friendsI  It truly does the job it claims</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal products are hard to find, but worth the search. I have sensitive eyes and most products irritate my eyes after a week it two. These never give me and side effects and I&#x27;ve been using them about 7 years. I&#x27;m over 60 and work in a middle school. The kids tell me I look more like their mother than their grandmothers. These are the best products on the market. They work well and don&#x27;t leave skin greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years now and I still love it.  At my age not too much will help, but I have notice when I get up in the morning over my eyes are a little puffy and when I apply the over eye cream which is the red color one the puffiness seems to go away.  Now this may not work for everyone keep that in mind as every ones skin responds to creams differently.  I will keep using this as long as Loreal keeps producing it. :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom, but she reported it felt like a fake! The texture and odor were not like the one she bought from CVS or Walgreens. Will never buy it from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love the Double Lift Eyecream, especially the pink cream used on the upper lids.  The upper lid cream tingles when applied and my eyes are looking better.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item. No complaints. All was how and what I expected and ordered with this item. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference in what it said it would improve after using all of it</li>
            <li> It really works best &amp; Ive tried them all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Double Eye Lift for years and only recently couldn&#x27;t find it locally. Thank goodness I searched Amazon!</li>
            <li> I use mostly L&#x27;Oreal skin care and makeup and I have for years.  Price is right for me.  The Double Eye Lift has two products in one container that I would use if bought separately.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see a difference while using this product. I might purchase again and it another try. Not sure, though.</li>
            <li> It felt like a very good quality product on my finger and eyes. I didn&#x27;t like it because I had a bad reaction to it. My skin got very dry and flakey. my tear ducts were swollen and I looked 20 years older.</li>
            <li> the under eye does ok on removing dark circles and fair on fine lines, but I see no eye lid lift at all</li>
            <li> Could not use, half of the product was dried up, extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> best price my wife has seen anywhere</li>
            <li> This has a white eye cream for under eyes and a pink eye gel for the top. Great product and a good price. Very happy with results!</li>
            <li> God, only spent eight days time to China, and it is too fast, I love the amazon.Products affordable, this is too perfect</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have fine lines around my eyes and have used countless products in an attempt to smooth them out, if even only slightly. I have used this product consistently every night for the past several months and am still not done with the bottle. It lasts a long time. I don&#x27;t recommend using this product in the morning - at least not the under eye cream, as retinol breaks down in the sunlight and will not work. I use this product slightly different than the directions tell you to: I apply the under eye serum under my eyes and around my crow&#x27;s feet, then apply the upper eye cream over that and on my upper eye. I do this because the upper eye product is basically moisturizer, and it helps counteract any dryness that might be experienced at the hands of the retinol. The result is a moisturized and smooth eye area. As with all antiaging products, they can take eight weeks and even longer to see any results, so I recommend sticking with it even if you are skeptical at first. This item&#x27;s price and quality is on point and I will never purchase another night time eye product as long as this is being made.</li>
            <li> This product completely does away with small wrinkles and really reduces deep wrinkles.  I never leave the house with out it under my makeup..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and can barely tell any difference, except that once in a while my eyes (not the skin) burns.  You can buy GOLD for the same price of $28 an ounce and make a wiser investment!</li>
            <li> I am loving this product! This is the first eye cream system I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, greasy, or takes forever to absorb.  Great results and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Works great. Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I love it. Exactly what described, easy to use, nice to colors wake my skin under eyes everyday up... fast delivery, thank you!</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t wild about this product. First, the dual eye creams in one product were awkward to use. Next, I really just didn&#x27;t see any positive changes in my skin. It seems like you waste quite a lot of this and then the product itself isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> A light moisturising cream for the delicate skin surrounding the eyes. Quick and easy to apply feels good and does not leave a greasy appearance</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of my favorite skin care product!!</li>
            <li> Good eye cream. The Lifting Side really holds up drooping eye lids!  The other side is a very emollient eye cream.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Maybe was too strong for my skin, but burned when I used it.  Could only use the cream portion.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any difference but still using.  Guess it can&#x27;t hurt to use the bottle up.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple of years, I love it! No sticky feeling, lifts and holds. Makeup goes on smooth after it dries.</li>
            <li> This is very powerful!</li>
            <li> I do not see any difference using this item. I have the same type of stuff I bought from Avon and they do the same thing which is nothing as far as what they claim it will do. Just moisturize with any facial cream it works the same. Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> Dark circles to appear to be less, it has only been a few weeks, but I am seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but can&#x27;t dispense it due to faulty pumps. I have used the past and did not experience this problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other eye products by L&#x27;Oreal and... other manufacturers. For me... this works wonderfully well! I am &#x27;extremely&#x27; sensitive to cosmetic products - especially products for around the eyes. This gives me the moisturizing and I &#x27;very much&#x27; like the upper eye lifting it provides! I absolutely love this product and I hope that L&#x27;Oreal never takes it off the market!</li>
            <li> I much prefer L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect golden balm products - tried using this in addition and really am not seeing any improvement or difference. I&#x27;d pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with fine lines and provides a smoother looking appearance.  It was definitely worth the price and I buy it again.</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 years.  It keeps my eye area moist and it&#x27;s gentle on the sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was out of my normal product (health brand formula) that I used and the company was out of stock. I went to Walgreens and saw that this was on sale (for the price I just paid on Amazon) and decided to try it since I was in need. I was always skeptical about commercial products but L&#x27;Oreal has a good reputation. Let me tell you, when I tried this cream I immediately saw a difference. My pores looked smaller, my skin looked smoother and my makeup when on flawlessly. Needless to say, I am now a L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Customer. I need to check if they make a body lotion.</li>
            <li> This product does a better job of tightening my eye lid tissue than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before, and I&#x27;ve tried several. I don&#x27;t see much more than a moisturizing effect with the side that treats the lower lids, however.  But it&#x27;s worth it because it works well on my sagging eyelids.</li>
            <li> Pretty  good  experience  slowly  improve it ~! ! !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it ! 1 1.  ..  .. . . .. .</li>
            <li> My crows feet and oversized eye bags are gone, plus the dark rings around my eyes are getting lighter amazed</li>
            <li> I like this bc of the duo.  Under eye and the upper eye lift.  I think it works comparable to most other eye products that are more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time now and I think it is a good product. It works well.</li>
            <li> For more than 5 years, I had been suffering from ugly sagging skin on my eye area. L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Double Eye Lift was quite good. I just realized that the expected result was longer to take effect. My sagging skin has slowly  firming up. Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my favorite eye cream from ROC has been discontinued.  The ROC product worked amazingly well, I was very happy with it.  This product unfortunately fell way short of my expectations.  It does not lift the eyelid the way the ROC product did.  On top of that, I had such sensitivity to this product that my eyes were puffier than before I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 40. Actually closer to 40 than 38. Yet I still get carded for cigarettes and alcohol and I swear it has a lot to do with RevitaLift products. I use them religiously and my skin looks young with no wrinkles at all. Even works better than the $100 skin caviar I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. If you want an affordable way to look your youngest, this is it.</li>
            <li> This product works well, especiall for under eye puffiness and any wrinkles reduction. I wear it under my make up. It does the job.</li>
            <li> I have never tried an eye lift or any other product for the eye. I was always scared to put anything near my eyes, but you can use this product.  It is safe and does work!!  It doesn&#x27;t burn, or any harshness to your eyes.  I would recommend this product to all my friends who need or want to look years younger. It tightens the area but when you wash your face it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel like it is sagging again or puffy again.  I have been under a lot of stress and the tired look was getting to me.  This makes me feel alive again.</li>
            <li> The lifting cream is ok, but not as good as the Collagen Moisturizer from St. Ives. This Facial Cream is the bomb!!!!!</li>
            <li> Products works better than expected.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris advanced revitalift double eye life .5 ounce.  The under eye( white) is working wonderfully.  I cannot tell if the other one is working. Some times the red shows on my eye lids.</li>
