            <li>They are great for nail polish remover and eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product and the price here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>These are great and I prefer them to the CVS brand which is too gauzy and falls apart.  </li>
            <li>Great for cleaning off eye</li>
            <li>These cotton rounds are great.  </li>

            <li>Great for when you need to remove makeup</li>

            <li>Great price and great product</li>
            <li>Great when used with toners</li>
            <li>Could not find them anywhere so tried amazon and was happy to find them there.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to have bought the in bulk.</li>
            <li>greatly increases the utility of these pads.</li>
            <li>I greatly recommend these pads as they are versatile and well made.</li>
            <li>Buying in bulk gives a great price for each.</li>
            <li>great quality.</li>
            <li>Great price and quality</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>These are very nice quality cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING quality!</li>
            <li>But these are amazing!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing quality too!</li>
            <li>These rounds don&#x27;t fall apart and don&#x27;t leave cotton fibers behind--extremely nice when doing a manicure!</li>
            <li>Great cotton rounds at a good price.  </li>
            <li>A good deal, the cotton pads were ok, not the best</li>
            <li>That is until a pleasant discovery occurred: the mesh part can be pulled off.</li>
            <li>But I do think the trick to good exfoliation with these pads is a good toner.</li>
            <li>This was a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li>These are exceptionally good cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li>For me, these are superior cotton rounds for removing eye make-up.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a great thing, and the price is nice as well.</li>
            <li>Good value and good quality</li>
            <li>They have a good texture, thickness and absorbency for both using eye makeup remover and applying toner.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good quality cotton rounds, and</li>
            <li>fairly priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quality is good as well.</li>
            <li>In addition to the quality cotton itself, for me it&#x27;s the gauze on the outer side of these pads is what makes them so good.  </li>
            <li>It is good item.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good value in cotton rounds.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the quantity.</li>
            <li>I use it to rub on alcohol and it works good.</li>
            <li>Service is good.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>good for this price</li>
            <li>Good quality....</li>
            <li>These are the good ones.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>Have always loved these</li>
            <li>but I realized that it&#x27;s really good quality.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy-</li>
            <li>They are really good for applying eye makeup remover or toner.</li>
            <li>The soft side is perfect for removing eye make up and the exfoliation side is unbelievably good for the rest of the face and neck!</li>
            <li>I like to order in bulk so being able to buy 800 count was a great find.</li>
            <li>These are a great find and an even better value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to buy in bulk like this.</li>
            <li>These cotton rounds have a softer side and a more textured sides, both are great.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this more than 3 years, and quality was great until I got this batch.</li>
            <li>Not as good as those I used to purchase from Costco and not as cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Great because they have a soft side and a knitted side (which I like the best)...</li>
            <li>Love this cotton rounds!</li>
            <li>Love this cotton!</li>
            <li>Love iT !</li>
            <li>My favorite cotton rounds!  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>These are the best cotton rounds I have found after a pretty exhaustive search.</li>
            <li>These are the best cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever used, and this bulk price is stellar.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>they both love it too!</li>
            <li>The quality is just fine - great for eye makeup removal at night.</li>
            <li>I will never buy another kind of cotton pad if I can help it.</li>
            <li>The more scrubby side is good for using toner and that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely the BEST cotton rounds ever!  </li>
            <li>These are nice and hold up well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and product is excellent!</li>
            <li>The gauze gives it a nice scrubby texture.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what I will do with all these cotton rounds...</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for yet another awesome product!</li>
            <li>some of the scrub grids are coming of on their own.  </li>
            <li>I liked it when it wasn&#x27;t layered.  </li>
            <li>They are the best and very inexpensive</li>
            <li>Nice to know I don&#x27;t have to remember to pick them up at the store.</li>
            <li>Nice but cheaper at Costco</li>
            <li>Honestly I thought that people overreacted on cotton rounds</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Great for removing dirt and scrubbing skin clean.  </li>
            <li>I use them as a great touch up to apply aftershave lotion lotion and clean any problems area with and astringent cleaner.</li>
            <li>If you prefer untextured, soft cotton rounds with great quality this is a great product to buy.</li>
            <li>These rounds are priced well, and more importantly they are of great quality.</li>
            <li>But overall good quality and good stuff!!!</li>
            <li>great price quick delivery</li>
            <li>The pads are strong and a good size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands of cotton rounds/squares, and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Nice quality, very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The lack of shedding (for lack of a better word), also works great if i&#x27;m trying to clean the edges of my nails after painting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to love these, but they went from nice cotton cleaning pads to one where the edges come apart.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s this wonderful soft durable mesh that I believe causes this pad to hold up longer</li>
            <li>These rounds do not have the dots, they work in a much more effective manner.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a more cost effective solution for buying these.</li>
            <li>I use cotton pads every day, these are by far the best I have had.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these a re the best bargain and quality I&#x27;ve found yet in cotton rounds.</li>
            <li>These cotton rounds are the best in quality that I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li>These cotton rounds are so soft and their great!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the textured side, just peel it off (easily) and viola!</li>
            <li>They do not fall apart easy during use like some cotton rounds do!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that these don&#x27;t shred, so overall I&#x27;m happy with the quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from cvs to walmart, target, etc.., but this is the best quality in term of lint free and very absorbent.</li>
            <li>The textured side is great for nail polish removal (removed three layers of polish much faster!).</li>
            <li>Ultimately, these are a great bargain and the most well made, luxurious cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, I use it with face wash every single day and it does a good job of cleaning .</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the size of the rounds since I prefer to buy the XL oval ones from the drugstore (to minimize how many I use for makeup removal).</li>
            <li>Love them and I love to have a bunch because I use one for each eye to remove makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the Delon cotton rounds and have purchased this item more than once from Amazon because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Noticed many reviewers stating they didn&#x27;t receive 800 rounds.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>The product is OK.</li>
            <li>I hoped that the rugged side would be more textured.</li>
            <li>I love these cotton pads.  </li>
            <li>I used to love the Delon+ cotton rounds.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it here.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t do better than these.  </li>
            <li>This brand of cotton rounds hold up way better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many cotton rounds and even the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; ones fall apart as you&#x27;re using them.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite comedic rounds...</li>
            <li>better price in bulk here than at the store.</li>
            <li>Was shipped via Prime &amp; arrived just on time:)</li>
            <li>These cotton rounds are absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure about the product enriched with aloe + vitamin, but it surely adds to the value factor as well.</li>
            <li>There are better quality cotton rounds on the market.  </li>
            <li>and I love it  </li>
            <li>Overall, these are the best!  </li>
            <li>quality is much better</li>
            <li>Thank you.  :)</li>
            <li>Either the edges had to be trimmed to use or make sure to not let the edges touch your skin.</li>
            <li>really pros:&lt;br /&gt;These are great</li>
            <li>they are even cheaper than most brands.</li>
            <li>yes, they have one side that is textured, but I love this as it helps removing make-</li>
            <li>Best pricing I have found for this specific product.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to buy then at Costco</li>
            <li>Really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Better priced here than at Costco.</li>
            <li>They just feel more hygiene than towels.</li>
            <li>Perfect to use with facial toners.  </li>
            <li>Much better than cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Those cotton rounds are soo much better than the ones sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>what more can I say?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to return these and buy more of the star pattern.</li>
            <li>I use these for toner, eye make up removal and topical acne medication and they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>Sure, the manufacturing is now done in Canada instead of Germany.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>No fuzzies stuck on nails when removing polish and the textured side is perfect for applying facial cleanser and toner.  </li>
            <li>though these pads do tend to come apart occasionally, I plan to continue buying them as they have an excellent textured surface.</li>
            <li>I also love the added benefit of one side being textured for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I gave to my kids and they love them too.</li>
            <li>Love these - when Costco stopped carrying them I just had to find them &amp; Amazon&#x27;s price is comparable to what I was paying at Costco.  </li>
            <li>Love the quality of these</li>
            <li>So many cotton rounds for so cheap!</li>
            <li>But, for the price, and how well they work, I don&#x27;t think you can find much better.</li>
            <li>She is enjoying it every day and will order more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>To get this many in store you&#x27;d have to pay $32+ for that many and the quality can vary.</li>
            <li>but more so than most rounds.</li>
            <li>definitely the best cotton pads i have ever used</li>
            <li>Love these cotton rounds.</li>
            <li>so glad I found it on line,&lt;br</li>
            <li>But there are better products out there...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much better than the store brands or swisspers in that they don&#x27;t fall apart</li>
            <li>The ones I used to get at Costco is more padded and softer.  </li>
            <li>These Delon 100% Cotton Rounds are simply the best you can buy.</li>
            <li>love these.....  </li>
            <li>I have repurchased these many times from Costco and have now purchased thru Amazon since I no longer can find them at Costco.</li>
            <li>I did not realize i was getting so many.</li>
            <li>The best part is low cost for highest quality and quantity.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave lint on my face, has the perfect thickness to hold my toner, and that there are two different textured sides.</li>
            <li>However, I found that the top exfoliating layer would come off in mid-use</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they do come in a quantity, so a one time purchase lasts me up to six months or more.</li>
            <li>If you should require exfoliation, you can choose the leave the mesh on (although there are way better ways to exfoliate your face).</li>
            <li>Better than the Up&amp;Up ones I use to use.</li>
            <li>One side is textured and one is smooth!</li>
            <li>Love these rounds and have used them for many years.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a cotton pad that is a bit more fuzzy.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how many cotton rounds I was getting.</li>
            <li>works great with facial toner, superior to cotton balls, no residual cotton on face</li>
            <li>These are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product....have tried others, but I only have to use 1 of these to apply toner on my face and neck and it never falls apart.</li>
            <li>I love them most because there are woven, so unlike cotton balls, they don&#x27;t friz, flake or fall apart.</li>
            <li>I love these because they don&#x27;t leave those cotton residues on your face like the ones from Target.</li>
            <li>It was better when the rounds were &amp;#34;sewed&amp;#34; together.  </li>
            <li>Price is ookkk, prob could find cheaper product, but would BE cheaper quality too, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>Love for removing makeup &amp; using astringent.</li>
            <li>I love it and will keep ordering this.</li>
            <li>great product... Very sturdy and strong... Will not leave traces of lent all over your face.. even with a beard</li>
            <li>These cotton rounds are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>pretty good deal, but the edges of the cotton swabs almost give me papercuts.  </li>
            <li>I love the special exfoliating side!</li>
            <li>Either way Delon Cotton Rounds are super cost effective -- the quality and price-per-quantity can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the quality of these cotton rounds is much better than most others available in the market.</li>
            <li>These are very soft and work great as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>They are great quality and very soft.  </li>
            <li>great value and the pads are so soft!</li>
            <li>Because as of right now...they&#x27;re the best by far.</li>
            <li>The top layer is a fine network pattern of fibers and this layer does the job of exfoliating, while the cotton layers beneath hold the liquid cleanser or toner.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it was fine.  </li>
            <li>and you gotta love Amazon&#x27;s super saver shipping!</li>
            <li>good value for a large supply</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it comes in a huge package.</li>
            <li>The soft side is great for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>My husband is able to use them on his face even with light stubble, with no problems.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say here, it&#x27;s perfect if you want a surplus of cotton rounds!</li>
            <li>For the amount I get this is better priced than any thing cheap I can get at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Very durable and good quality products.</li>
            <li>But on easy makeup days (no eyeliner), I can easily get away with using just ONE of these rounds as both sides are functional.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The cotton rounds easily come apart in layers (not shredding)&lt;br /&gt;There is no Aloe Vera and Pro-vitamin B5 in the rounds like the description</li>
            <li>What that means to the \\&quot;Cotton Rounds Game\\&quot; is easily noticeable.  </li>
            <li>They are not absorbant, and the layers fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li>Wow, these cotton rounds really are the best.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shred easily.  </li>
            <li>*textured side is perfect for me: not too rough or too smooth</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easily removable.</li>
            <li>So basically, I like that it has the scrub side, and that it is extremely easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Helps remove all my makeup easily.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to buy quantity.</li>
            <li>They are quality and don&#x27;t break apart or shred easily during use.  </li>
            <li>It easily pulls away from eachother.</li>
            <li>Strong, durable and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>I regret purchasing these cotton rounds, and strongly advise that you look elsewhere if you want a quality product.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not these pads are far superior than the ones sold in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Thicker, softer, and more absorbent.  </li>
            <li>These work amazing and seem much higher quality than anything else I used.  </li>
            <li>Great product, high quality, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>Product is fine - my issue is the price.  </li>
            <li>No linty bits, they work fine.</li>
            <li>I was going through the cheap cotton rounds very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The cotton pad itself holds up fine and doesn&#x27;t shed or come apart.</li>
            <li>These work just fine...</li>
            <li>They work perfectly fine</li>
            <li>Strong, stands up to liquids and scrubbing, and has both smooth and textured sides.</li>
            <li>These are great for applying astringents and toners, but the edges are kind of sharp!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product as they don&#x27;t leave little bits of cotton on your fingertips and eye lashes.</li>
            <li>The soft side shreds if I have not shaved right before, but the strong side works regardless if I have shaved or not so great for what I needed them for.  </li>
            <li>It is great product overall, though has space to improve, like the edge would be dispersed when filled with toner.</li>
            <li>They are quite sturdy and free of lint.</li>
            <li>I personally found that they absorbed more product than I was happy with</li>
            <li>I got mine for $19.99 for a box of 8 tubes and free shipping when I added another \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; product that I also wanted.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>One side is exfoliating, one side is smooth, neither side falls apart.  </li>
            <li>And cheap - that counts for something too.</li>
            <li>I always use the smooth side</li>
            <li>When i took a roll of rounds out of the box and examined them, they seemed so smooth that i assumed they would not be exfoliating at all.</li>
            <li>I like that they have a textured side and a smooth side.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need the exfoliation, you can pull off that part so both sides are smooth.</li>
            <li>Cheap, durable, absorbent.</li>
            <li>Best cotton round I have found on the market</li>
            <li>There is a different texture on each side that makes them great for a multitude of uses.</li>
            <li>Do not contain aloe fortunately.</li>
            <li>These are great for cosmetic uses such as applying toner.</li>
            <li>so I had to switch to using the softer, smooth side instead.</li>
            <li>it has one side smooth and one side not.</li>
            <li>I use the smooth side.  </li>
            <li>If your face is smooth, you&#x27;ll have no problems.</li>
            <li>oh, how soft it is - is good for taking off eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Contrary to what another review mentioned, the rounds ARE \\&quot;standard\\&quot; size, and fit perfectly into cotton round dispensers and the like.</li>
            <li>As these have a layer of cotton sandwiched between two layers of soft gauze, the number of uses is expansive and they are superior to use.  </li>
            <li>These are soft and good quality.  </li>
            <li>I especially love the two different textures on either side, it is really helpful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and good for skin toner and remove make-up.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it flake off or anything, which is great because so many other cotton rounds I tried would leave cotton all over my face.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price for my sanity!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I first purchased these at Costco many years ago and have purchased them on Amazon every since.  </li>
            <li>probably saves them money to make it that way, but it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the original ones.</li>
            <li>They hold up well, and have light netting on one side that permits mild abrasion whenever that&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li>they have a gentle side and a rough side perfect use on my acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I almost cut my eye when I tried using it to clean my makeup.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all that we needed to get in there and get it clean.</li>
            <li>I used these to clean my face and also for tonic usage.  </li>
            <li>Pull it clean</li>
            <li>I feel that it doesn&#x27;t clean off my eye liner off as smoothly and quickly as it did before the change.</li>
            <li>One side is smooth and the other side is textured which is great for using astringent.</li>
            <li>Not only did I purchase the LARGE LARGE pack, but these are the best cotton rounds I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>nice full pad with soft roundness on the edges.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, and just the product I needed :)</li>
            <li>Since we have a house full of girls, I buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li>Good stuff and durable enough for routine cleaning .</li>
            <li>I give to my daughter to use on her three month old baby&#x27;s face as well as her own...</li>
            <li>I initially purchased these at Costco and loved them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true win-win.</li>
            <li>My guess is they would also be good for a shop environment cleaning tools and such.</li>
            <li>Not the highest quality, but not bad.</li>
            <li>I love the new and improved version of these cotton rounds!  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s pieces of lint stuck to my eye lids and how the cotton rounds demolishes quickly.</li>
            <li>However, quality and value of this made in Canada item are still much better than most cotton rounds you can find at local retail stores.</li>
            <li>I use them constantly during the course of the day, from applying astringent after face washing, removing eye makeup and nail polish, I also keep some stashed in my bag for make up emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;Can not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy Delon in bulk and hope it&#x27;s decent, and I am glad i did that.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for years, but these are even better than the older version that I have been using.</li>
            <li>great price when you add up how much you spend buying these individually at the store, even on sale</li>
            <li>Love this product and the price - highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find the same product at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>They sell for at least $5 a pack in my neighborhood so to see on Amazon for such an amazing price was delightful.</li>
            <li>Cotton rounds can come in handy for a lot of jobs, but I find that for use on the face, these can be too scratchy if one is not careful.</li>
            <li>The quality of this good is okay, however, the size is way too small.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t understand how this product can garner such high scores among so many customers.</li>
            <li>Delon Cotton Rounds have made a huge positive impact on my skin care routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than the grocery store ones by far!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>What happened to these great little pads?</li>
            <li>I felt kind of silly buying these from Amazon and having them ship an item I could easily pick up at any local store, but the price was good and it&#x27;s nice to stock up on things</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to be stocked up for a few months with this order.</li>
            <li>They are also rough on one side which is great for using on your face but not so much when using around the eyes.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best cotton round I&#x27;d ever purchased, it stand up to time, it&#x27;s durable and does not fall apart.  </li>
            <li>Great cotton round that lasts.</li>
            <li>I use the smooth size to wipe off my eye makeup and it is gentle.</li>
            <li>i use two everyday so this bulk deal was great for me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I used them mainly for applying toner, but they also held up easily to eye makeup and nail polish removal.</li>
            <li>in my opinion  the difference in quality is well worth it.</li>
            <li>These are definitely a good deal, but not very well constructed.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>The ones I&#x27;d bought at CVS would kind of break in the middle when I was taking off my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about these cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li>but either way these are totally worth</li>
            <li>, they have many layers of cotton.&lt;br /&gt;A soft side and an exfoliating side which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li>But the difference in product is worth paying the difference to me.</li>
            <li>They are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had that layer kind of roll up and come off when I used it, but only a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>I use them for so many things, and they are durable, and soft.  </li>
            <li>They have the soft side and then the not quite so soft side which is good for scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Then I would pay far more in the supermarket or drug store.  </li>
            <li>They are strong, clean, soft and water absorbed.</li>
            <li>I love them so far.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I make my own facial cleansing pads and they hold up well once you let sit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands that seem to disintegrate in your hands (or on your face) and leave &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; cotton, but these are far superior.  </li>
            <li>The cardboard container fits right under the sink.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>They are awesome quality, and won&#x27;t break down easily like other pure non-sewed cotton rounds!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft, smooth and DON&#x27;T shred/shed all over my face.</li>
            <li>If you are tired of pads or cotton balls shredding on your face guys, these work great if you use the strong side.</li>
            <li>They are the best quality I&#x27;ve found anywhere &amp; love that one side is rough for exfoliation,while other side is soft.</li>
            <li>I love these rounds and will continue to order from here and for me, its a fair price b/c I don&#x27;t have to use so many rounds to do my neck and face so essentially, they last longer and cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that in the most recent batch I got, the textured side is a bit more abrasive than it was before (still not bad) and they do separate from the cotton at times.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best thing I&#x27;ve found lately...</li>
            <li>use them mainly for toner or to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best thing I&#x27;ve found lately...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Now I can thoroughly enjoy the high quality the smooth, soft side brings.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable for the quantity.</li>
            <li>I like them very much.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that one side has an exfoliation portion and the other portion it is smooth.</li>
            <li>However, they are still light years better than other cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li>good quality, but a little thicker than I thought.</li>
            <li>This is such a huge amount!</li>
            <li>There are many different items out there like this</li>
            <li>Smooth and soft on skin.</li>
            <li>These are much better than generic rounds at drugstore</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and would definitely purchase again &amp;amp; again.</li>
            <li>However, there&#x27;s are so many uses for these, such as doing your nails, cleaning your guns, etc.  </li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are quite a bit different than most you get at the store.  </li>
            <li>Most face pads I have used do the same.  </li>
            <li>They are gentler, and more sanitary than washcloths, especially for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>These will last a really long time and were a great deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are so soft and smooth for face.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that these are soft and that they don&#x27;t shed fibers.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>Price online was higher, too, lower volume buying drives up the overhead.</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying them!</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for as a &amp;#34;lint free&amp;#34; nail polisher remover applicator.</li>
            <li>Work exactly as they should.</li>
            <li>At first I was upset about having to buy so many, but these will last me forever.</li>
            <li>I found these, and they work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>said that this is a lot better quality than the ones in the drug stores at local area.</li>
            <li>First of all, perhaps I was not paying attention when I purchased, but 800???</li>
            <li>When I first started using these rounds, I preferred to use the exfoliating side.</li>
            <li>I really like these cotton rounds!  </li>
            <li>Love the product but it was substantially cheaper in Costco for the same quantity.</li>
            <li>one side is fine fine mesh to give a little more scrub but not harsh at all (for nail polish removing, or stubborn eye make up)</li>
            <li>These make it at least half a face of good scrubbing, probably even more if you go with grain, are freshly shaven, or go lightly.</li>
            <li>It takes the day off unlike any other kind of exfoliation product out there.</li>
            <li>To be honest, the best cotton pads I&#x27;ve bought were in Korea, but since I&#x27;ve been back in the States I could only find generic ones at the supermarket that were so weak and flaked so easily, leaving bits of cotton on your face.</li>
            <li>Overall this left me with a good impression.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, they are one of the very last ones of their kind.  </li>
            <li>I would like to see them changed by omitting the rough side--not good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>That caused me to go through double the amount of pads I wanted to because I could only use one side, the good un-meshed side.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I was looking for good exfoliating pads and was led astray by some of the more positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I love to use them to dry my skin after cleaning.</li>
            <li>They are strong enough not too fall apart on a stubbly face.</li>
            <li>This one is strong enough to hold my toner (I do put a lot on), and when I rub it on my face it will not leave any cotton on my face.</li>
            <li>The quality of these are amazing, one side is rough for exfoliating and the other is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>so I use it to remove a certain type of sunblock for my face).</li>
            <li>I always use the exfoliating side to apply my toner to clean my face one more time, and since it also soft enough so that I do not need to worry it will damage my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shred like others do, and the more &amp;#34;abrasive&amp;#34; side isn&#x27;t super harsh.  </li>
            <li>The Delon cotton rounds are very high quality.  </li>
            <li>Everything came and the cotton is pretty high quality.</li>
            <li>Probably the only reason I&#x27;m giving these 2 stars is that you get a lot for your money and when I remember to use the smooth side they work pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>They are a nice thick quality and don&#x27;t fall apart or leave lint.&lt;br /&gt;*decided to edit this: found this exact product at Costco for $10!</li>
            <li>The pads are durable and are not shredded by facial hair as easy as most other brands tend to do.</li>
            <li>One side is texturized for mild exfoliation and better cleaning, the other side is soft.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and it&#x27;s great how it&#x27;s in bulk because I use these everyday to remove my make up and to apply toner to my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now ordered my 2nd huge package of these and hope they continue to carry them</li>
            <li>I notice if I over-apply the toner and soak up the whole pad</li>
            <li>The cotton rounds do not fall apart and holds together very well.</li>
            <li>But these are very sturdy!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very durable cotton pads.</li>
            <li>and then i have to start the whole process again.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t really help with that.</li>
            <li>The quality of these are much nicer than the store bought.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s much nicer to know that when I&#x27;ve finished a pack, I can just go get another pack out of the box that it comes in.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this cotton pads.  </li>
            <li>Very durable construction.</li>
            <li>I even wrote a review saying as much.</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t paying much attention to the quantity.</li>
            <li>What is there to really say about these cotton rounds ?</li>
            <li>so there isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
            <li>However, do the jobs very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Me and my daughter really likes them for our face .&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I only use the smooth side.</li>
            <li>I use them, dampened, to remove my eye make up after applying oil and gently loosening the eye makeup.</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>They hold together really well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>They dn&#x27;t stay together very well.</li>
            <li>I feel it really depends on what cleanser I use, some cleansers don&#x27;t wash well, and I could see some remaining yellowy and oily debri on the cotton pad.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like to buy it again after using it up.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very absorbent.</li>
            <li>I really like these cotton pads.</li>
            <li>The cotton hold up together very well and get the job done.  </li>
            <li>The quality is premium and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Very luxurious.</li>
            <li>But not influencing the use that much.</li>
            <li>So you can only use the smooth side of the pad.</li>
            <li>Really like the thickness and absorption.</li>
            <li>I am obsessed with exfoliating my skin --- and this is kind of like an insurance to make sure I exfoliated every part of my face.</li>
            <li>Personally, I like using the textured side and found this side rubbed off pretty easily exposing just the soft under layer.</li>
            <li>One side is rougher for after facial washes and the other side is more smooth for eye makeup removal.  </li>
            <li>These cotton rounds are way better than any other drugstore brand I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>Hope they bring back the original version.</li>
            <li>Most other cotton rounds or balls leave threads of cotton on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I use these daily to clean my face.</li>
            <li>One side is textured and feels like fine gauze to lift the dirt out and the other side is super soft.</li>
            <li>Just going to buy &amp;#34;cheap brand&amp;#34; next time, these aren&#x27;t special.</li>
            <li>These are soft and gentle one side and the other is great for exfoliating even for dry skin on my granddaughters face!</li>
            <li>These are so much softer and more durable, and cost less per piece.</li>
            <li>buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads are built with &#x27;layers&#x27; that come apart easily by the mere act of reaching in the bag to grab one (reminds me of those flaky layered biscuits, honestly).  </li>
            <li>Bend the pad a little bit, so the mesh kind of floats away from the soft pad</li>
            <li>I love that these feature two different textures on each side: one soft, the other with a texture for when you want a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>Love this cotton rounds but Costco only carries it occasionally.  </li>
            <li>Sorry Amazon, more and more of your items are just not the deal they once were.tax on it too.</li>
            <li>Sorry Amazon, more and more of your items are just not the deal they once were.</li>
            <li>One side is great for exfoliation as it&#x27;s rough and will sweep off dead skin cells when used with a tonic.  </li>
            <li>Initially I found them at my local Costco but haven&#x27;t been able to find them anymore.  </li>
            <li>I hate buying these at the store, so was glad to see these at a great price.  </li>
            <li>When you calculate it out, 1 package is really a decent price</li>
            <li>They are a better price than smaller volumes I purchase locally.  </li>
            <li>This actually made me realize how important it is to use a cotton pad and toner to get everything off completely.</li>
            <li>Super quality you can&#x27;t get at the local stores.</li>
            <li>I go through them quick, so purchasing a box will last me a while.</li>
            <li>Getting a large volume (800) in one shipment is far more convenient than making multiple purchases every time I run low.  </li>
            <li>We used to use another brand of cotton rounds for our facials and they tend to disintegrate pretty quickly when wet or when we take off products.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>They work extremely well, they don&#x27;t fall apart when wiping with them, they don&#x27;t feel rough on the skin, and have a good amount of surface area.</li>
            <li>They are a little more pricier than when I got them at Costco</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;One soft side for gentle cleaning and the other side offers better</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to buy such a large quantity -</li>
            <li>If for some reason you occasionally don&#x27;t want the gauze portion, easily remove it and use the cotton pad which is still less likely to lint shred or fall apart than most.</li>
            <li>At first the cotton rounds appeared to be of poor quality, as the sides aren&#x27;t sown around the \\&quot;rounds\\&quot; like the swisspers kind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely love this brand of cotton round, and I will not buy anything else moving foreword.</li>
            <li>Two issues though, the textured side has a tendency to fall off and the round can fall apart a lot easier than most.</li>
            <li>The scrub side can be useful as well- for removing makeup and such.  </li>
            <li>I experimented with a few pads to perfect the technique, since the first few tries had me destroying an edge of the pad, or pulling the many layers of cotton apart.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick pads</li>
            <li>However, the secret is surprisingly simple.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>However, I was impressed with their durability and absorbency;  these little suckers won&#x27;t quit!</li>
            <li>so many that I feel guilty tossing one without making full use of it!</li>
            <li>One side is smooth while the other is textured.</li>
            <li>One side has a sort of mesh layer on top, I guess to give a little scrub action.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always paid more for premium rounds less likely to shred and they are becoming harder to find in the stores in my area.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>These cotton rounds are the best you can get as far as I know; too bad they got dropped as a Costco store item.</li>
            <li>; they were cheap enough that it didn&#x27;t bother me when I had to use a lot to get rid of glitter nail polish, although once again, especially with the glitter, they shred.</li>
            <li>The rounds are so soft and it don&#x27;t shred lint, also the thickness is decent to absorb whatever you put on there.</li>
            <li>The actual pad bit is impressively smooth and non-linty but the edges are coarse.</li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviewers, I was pretty fed up with inconsistent quality of cotton rounds available at the local drugstore</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable because one pack at a local pharmacy costs between $2-3.</li>
            <li>They are 100% cotton and are very soft though.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I was too lazy to go to the CVS across the street to get more.</li>
            <li>These cotton rounds aren&#x27;t soft at all!</li>
            <li>I was disappointed when Costco stopped carrying but very happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Buying online is OK, but not as convenient as getting them with other shopping at the local store.</li>
            <li>No better bang for your buck out there :)</li>
            <li>However, they are better than the items you usually find in the store.</li>
            <li>They are soft but don&#x27;t fall apart!</li>
            <li>I do peel off the scrub side first when I use them for this, but that&#x27;s extremely simple-</li>
            <li>cotton rounds fall apart, layer by layer; top, textured layer is cut too small from edge material.  </li>
            <li>First found at giant club warehouse, but then they stopped carrying.</li>
            <li>There is a textured side, but if you don&#x27;t like it for your purposes, it&#x27;s easy to pull off the little textured piece.</li>
            <li>, however, these don&#x27;t completely absorb my cleaner, so I don&#x27;t have to really soak the round to clean</li>
            <li>That is small price to pay for a great cotton round that holds up to makeup removal without falling apart, soaking through, or shedding.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t remember what i paid for this, but it was cheap, maybe less than $8.</li>
            <li>I thought the smaller (normal) size would seem restrictive and I&#x27;d go through them twice as fast.</li>
            <li>These are better than your average drugstore cotton rounds, but they&#x27;re inferior to Japanese cotton.</li>
            <li>I would personally prefer both sides to be smooth rather than one side being smooth and the other being textured as the textured side is almost too rough for my face.</li>
            <li>I use the textured side to scrub a little, and the smooth side is very soft.</li>
            <li>price isn&#x27;t bad at all when you consider how many you&#x27;re getting, and when you consider that you&#x27;ll only need one to take off your eye makeup, not one for the first pass and one for the second, the price looks even better!</li>
            <li>These are VERY good quality, not the ones that leave behind little fuzz and strings.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this large amount because I found myself constantly running out of make up pads.  </li>
            <li>I wish one side was a little textured though, both sides are smooth.</li>
            <li>they do have two difference sides, one is smooth and one is a little rougher.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can only use a certain face wash</li>
            <li>The only improvement I can think of would be if the cotton and gauze were molded together a little better.  </li>
            <li>found these soft on the face, and sturdy in my fingers (no lint flying off).</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t shred and have the choice of an exfoliating side or soft side.  </li>
            <li>Durable and soft also.</li>
            <li>(Burts Bees cotton sensitive skin wash), which has no exfoliating property.</li>
            <li>However, they are soft and otherwise durable.</li>
            <li>The soft side - and</li>
            <li>They are soft, yet have two sides for use.  </li>
            <li>have two sides to each round, a smooth side or a textured side.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but definite scrubbing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These pads have two sides to them, a soft side and a stronger side.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall they are soft and they don&#x27;t shred.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that they are not organic; but they are so much cheaper that I will keep using them.</li>
            <li>I use them for removing nail polish, facial scrubs, etc., and the hold up very well through all their duties.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t carry them any more (at least at my location).</li>
            <li>side because I can use the scrubby side on my face and nails (nail polish remover) and then use the soft side to take the eye makeup off my eyes.</li>
            <li>These are soft, but sturdy.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t shed but they are not as soft as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>And yet don&#x27;t feel as soft.  </li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised at the number of packs and the quantity of cotton rounds pads in each pack.  </li>
            <li>The so-called \\&quot;soft</li>
            <li>They also gave a exfoliating pad on one side which is gentle enough for my acne&#x3D;prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have purchased these for years at Costco but haven&#x27;t been able to find them lately.</li>
            <li>Would like to find the old style</li>
            <li>they are also soft.  </li>
            <li>rounds still work alright; however, they are made up of 2 soft sides instead of</li>
            <li>one soft and one textured side.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft around my eyes.</li>
            <li>They are plush and soft but they have an &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; waffle side which causes them to stick to the pad underneath it.  </li>
            <li>The cotton is soft.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t save that much and the back side with the mesh lining comes off if used.</li>
            <li>they are soft cotton</li>
            <li>My only complaint that sometimes the ones at the bottom of a package get kind of soft and separate-y from its two sides, probably from being smushed around in the plastic.</li>
            <li>and when I say lately, I mean since Target (whose quality was never consistent on these since one time they&#x27;d have one kind, then on the next visit their aisles showed no trace that the previous month&#x27;s kind ever even existed)</li>
            <li>They have a smooth side and what you would consider a &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; side, but it&#x27;s not rough just different texture for harder to remove make-up</li>
            <li>I usually buy these at Costco &amp; thought they were the same pillow top.</li>
            <li>They are excellent and no more expensive than others that you purchase at CVS or Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>So many times, even after very carefully washing and drying my hands with towels, paper towels or other \\&quot;lint</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m all about the generic store brands to save money, this is high praise</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for affordable cotton rounds for your facial.</li>
            <li>The price for such a large quantity is CRAZY good</li>
            <li>I still use this everyday, the only problem is that it falls apart easily.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t leave much lint behind and they don&#x27;t peel apart easily.  </li>
            <li>In these days of cheap manufacture and strict adherence to bottom lines, often times (USUALLY) quality falls by the wayside.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t normally use that side (only 1-2 times a week).</li>
            <li>These are pretty rough on one side .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other rounds that easily fall apart or stretch apart when wet.</li>
            <li>Its like a mesh of hard cotton over a smooth soft surface.</li>
            <li>I have to be super careful to keep them flat while I apply products.</li>
            <li>These are hard to find here in Puerto rico and once my wife was able to get a hold of them she has never looked back.</li>
            <li>The other side is the soft cotton, which is nice to dab your delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li>I thought that these would be soft and gentle, but they&#x27;re not really, but I can deal with that.  </li>
            <li>There is a rough side and a smooth side, but the edges seem to have a rough seam.</li>
            <li>These seem to be very absorbant as well, not so much that you waste product</li>
            <li>They are thick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The rounds are very soft and don&#x27;t shed, but sturdy enough to stand up to taking off mascera and nail polish.  </li>
            <li>There are no other cotton rounds that compare to this product.  </li>
            <li>This cotton round has different texture on each side- a smooth surface on one and a rough surface on the other, so that it&#x27;d always fit to your need.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are a little more costly compared to other brands, but they hold up well and don&#x27;t leave bits of cotton on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Work well, but the &#x27;rough&#x27; side of the pad is only a piece of material basically placed on the pad that comes right off.</li>
            <li>The layers stuck to each other fairly well, but that is probably because of the way they pressed the edges, which caused the edges to be sharp and stiff.</li>
            <li>One side smooth, other rough.</li>
            <li>Also, they work extremely well for facials and wherever you would like a superior cotton pad that does the job, holds liquids well without dripping and doesn&#x27;t leave fuzz behind.  </li>
            <li>These really are a high quality cotton round.</li>
            <li>I currently use neutrogena clear pore astringent but I plan on switching to Dickensons witch hazel</li>
            <li>They were made in Germany, have a star-shape central pattern, soft edges, don&#x27;t fall apart when removing makeup...  </li>
            <li>i bought these a while ago now- and still have barely put a dent into my supply of them.  </li>
            <li>I use the soft side for applying toner daily.</li>
            <li>But I was even more annoyed with the exfoliation side.</li>
            <li>If anything, I like them better because they are less &amp;#34;cottony&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t get all the little pieces of fuzz.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle but not super fuzzy.</li>
            <li>I will not be re ordering this product as wal mart has some just as great and less expensive.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and put a lot efforts on skin care so that cotton pads/rounds are essential to my daily skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Guy&#x27;s facial care has come far in the last several years, but face pads have stank (I have just used a really soft washcloth) because man stubble catches cotton balls, rounds, etc.</li>
            <li>One side is a rougher mesh, and the other side is much softer/smoother.</li>
            <li>They are lovely and soft on one side and a little rough on the other.  </li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m sure Target or some place like that has a generic brand that cost a little less.</li>
            <li>They do not leave bits of fuzz on your mug, hold together under considerable stress, and are perfect for removing a lady&#x27;s eye shadow, since she needn&#x27;t be concerned about nasty bits of cotton floating around her eyeballs.</li>
            <li>For one, my more delicate tools benefit from careful cleaning with these reliable rounds, and my wife uses the things to apply paint and occasionally to remove it.</li>
            <li>You can even scratch your skin with it if you are not careful enough.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation side may break apart if you scrub too hard, but that&#x27;s ok for my purposes after I&#x27;m down with it.  </li>
            <li>I tried buying a few different brands at local grocery stores over the years and even the ones that were supposed to be more heavy duty kept tearing up on my face, especially over my stubble</li>
            <li>There is nothing that makes these different or worse than the myriad drugstore brands I would buy except that they have a rough side I don&#x27;t like to use for my face (good for other uses though).</li>
            <li>they fall apart at he sides sometimes bt other than that i live them.</li>

            <li> They are great for nail polish remover and eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and the price here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are great and I prefer them to the CVS brand which is too gauzy and falls apart.  </li>
            <li> Great for cleaning off eye</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are great.  </li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are great.  </li>

            <li> I am so happy I don&#x27;t need to worry about running out of them anytime soon, which give me peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Great for when you need to remove makeup</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side is great for removing makeup.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Great price and great product</li>
            <li> Great when used with toners</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to have bought the in bulk.</li>
            <li> greatly increases the utility of these pads.</li>
            <li> I greatly recommend these pads as they are versatile and well made.</li>
            <li> Buying in bulk gives a great price for each.</li>
            <li> great quality.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> These are very nice quality cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li> AMAZING quality!</li>
            <li> But these are amazing!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing quality too!</li>
            <li> These rounds don&#x27;t fall apart and don&#x27;t leave cotton fibers behind--extremely nice when doing a manicure!</li>
            <li> Great cotton rounds at a good price.  </li>
            <li> A good deal, the cotton pads were ok, not the best</li>
            <li> That is until a pleasant discovery occurred: the mesh part can be pulled off.</li>
            <li> But I do think the trick to good exfoliation with these pads is a good toner.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> These are exceptionally good cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li> For me, these are superior cotton rounds for removing eye make-up.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a great thing, and the price is nice as well.</li>
            <li> Good value and good quality</li>
            <li> They have a good texture, thickness and absorbency for both using eye makeup remover and applying toner.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Good quality cotton rounds, and</li>
            <li> fairly priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quality is good as well.</li>
            <li> In addition to the quality cotton itself, for me it&#x27;s the gauze on the outer side of these pads is what makes them so good.  </li>
            <li> It is good item.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good value in cotton rounds.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the quantity.</li>
            <li> I use it to rub on alcohol and it works good.</li>
            <li> Service is good.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> good for this price</li>
            <li> Good quality....</li>
            <li> These are the good ones.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> Have always loved these</li>
            <li> but I realized that it&#x27;s really good quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy-</li>
            <li> They are really good for applying eye makeup remover or toner.</li>
            <li> The soft side is perfect for removing eye make up and the exfoliation side is unbelievably good for the rest of the face and neck!</li>
            <li> I like to order in bulk so being able to buy 800 count was a great find.</li>
            <li> These are a great find and an even better value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to buy in bulk like this.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds have a softer side and a more textured sides, both are great.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this more than 3 years, and quality was great until I got this batch.</li>
            <li> Not as good as those I used to purchase from Costco and not as cost effective.  </li>
            <li> Great because they have a soft side and a knitted side (which I like the best)...</li>
            <li> Love this cotton rounds!</li>
            <li> Love this cotton!</li>
            <li> Love iT !</li>
            <li> My favorite cotton rounds!  </li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton rounds I have found after a pretty exhaustive search.</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever used, and this bulk price is stellar.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> they both love it too!</li>
            <li> The quality is just fine - great for eye makeup removal at night.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another kind of cotton pad if I can help it.</li>
            <li> The more scrubby side is good for using toner and that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely the BEST cotton rounds ever!  </li>
            <li> These are nice and hold up well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and product is excellent!</li>
            <li> The gauze gives it a nice scrubby texture.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what I will do with all these cotton rounds...</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for yet another awesome product!</li>
            <li> some of the scrub grids are coming of on their own.  </li>
            <li> I liked it when it wasn&#x27;t layered.  </li>
            <li> They are the best and very inexpensive</li>
            <li> Nice to know I don&#x27;t have to remember to pick them up at the store.</li>
            <li> Nice but cheaper at Costco</li>
            <li> Honestly I thought that people overreacted on cotton rounds</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Great for removing dirt and scrubbing skin clean.  </li>
            <li> I use them as a great touch up to apply aftershave lotion lotion and clean any problems area with and astringent cleaner.</li>
            <li> If you prefer untextured, soft cotton rounds with great quality this is a great product to buy.</li>
            <li> These rounds are priced well, and more importantly they are of great quality.</li>
            <li> But overall good quality and good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> great price quick delivery</li>
            <li> The pads are strong and a good size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of cotton rounds/squares, and this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Nice quality, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The lack of shedding (for lack of a better word), also works great if i&#x27;m trying to clean the edges of my nails after painting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to love these, but they went from nice cotton cleaning pads to one where the edges come apart.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s this wonderful soft durable mesh that I believe causes this pad to hold up longer</li>
            <li> These rounds do not have the dots, they work in a much more effective manner.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a more cost effective solution for buying these.</li>
            <li> I use cotton pads every day, these are by far the best I have had.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these a re the best bargain and quality I&#x27;ve found yet in cotton rounds.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are the best in quality that I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are so soft and their great!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the textured side, just peel it off (easily) and viola!</li>
            <li> They do not fall apart easy during use like some cotton rounds do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that these don&#x27;t shred, so overall I&#x27;m happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from cvs to walmart, target, etc.., but this is the best quality in term of lint free and very absorbent.</li>
            <li> The textured side is great for nail polish removal (removed three layers of polish much faster!).</li>
            <li> Ultimately, these are a great bargain and the most well made, luxurious cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I use it with face wash every single day and it does a good job of cleaning .</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the size of the rounds since I prefer to buy the XL oval ones from the drugstore (to minimize how many I use for makeup removal).</li>
            <li> Love them and I love to have a bunch because I use one for each eye to remove makeup.  </li>
            <li> Love love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the Delon cotton rounds and have purchased this item more than once from Amazon because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Noticed many reviewers stating they didn&#x27;t receive 800 rounds.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> The product is OK.</li>
            <li> I hoped that the rugged side would be more textured.</li>
            <li> I love these cotton pads.  </li>
            <li> I used to love the Delon+ cotton rounds.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it here.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do better than these.  </li>
            <li> This brand of cotton rounds hold up way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many cotton rounds and even the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; ones fall apart as you&#x27;re using them.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite comedic rounds...</li>
            <li> better price in bulk here than at the store.</li>
            <li> Was shipped via Prime &amp; arrived just on time:)</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure about the product enriched with aloe + vitamin, but it surely adds to the value factor as well.</li>
            <li> There are better quality cotton rounds on the market.  </li>
            <li> and I love it  </li>
            <li> Overall, these are the best!  </li>
            <li> quality is much better</li>
            <li> Thank you.  :)</li>
            <li> Either the edges had to be trimmed to use or make sure to not let the edges touch your skin.</li>
            <li> really pros:&lt;br /&gt;These are great</li>
            <li> they are even cheaper than most brands.</li>
            <li> yes, they have one side that is textured, but I love this as it helps removing make-</li>
            <li> Best pricing I have found for this specific product.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to buy then at Costco</li>
            <li> Really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Better priced here than at Costco.</li>
            <li> They just feel more hygiene than towels.</li>
            <li> Perfect to use with facial toners.  </li>
            <li> Much better than cotton balls.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Those cotton rounds are soo much better than the ones sold in drugstores.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> what more can I say?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to return these and buy more of the star pattern.</li>
            <li> I use these for toner, eye make up removal and topical acne medication and they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> Sure, the manufacturing is now done in Canada instead of Germany.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> No fuzzies stuck on nails when removing polish and the textured side is perfect for applying facial cleanser and toner.  </li>
            <li> though these pads do tend to come apart occasionally, I plan to continue buying them as they have an excellent textured surface.</li>
            <li> I also love the added benefit of one side being textured for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I gave to my kids and they love them too.</li>
            <li> Love these - when Costco stopped carrying them I just had to find them &amp; Amazon&#x27;s price is comparable to what I was paying at Costco.  </li>
            <li> Love the quality of these</li>
            <li> So many cotton rounds for so cheap!</li>
            <li> But, for the price, and how well they work, I don&#x27;t think you can find much better.</li>
            <li> She is enjoying it every day and will order more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> To get this many in store you&#x27;d have to pay $32+ for that many and the quality can vary.</li>
            <li> but more so than most rounds.</li>
            <li> definitely the best cotton pads i have ever used</li>
            <li> Love these cotton rounds.</li>
            <li> so glad I found it on line,&lt;br</li>
            <li> But there are better products out there...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much better than the store brands or swisspers in that they don&#x27;t fall apart</li>
            <li> The ones I used to get at Costco is more padded and softer.  </li>
            <li> These Delon 100% Cotton Rounds are simply the best you can buy.</li>
            <li> love these.....  </li>
            <li> I have repurchased these many times from Costco and have now purchased thru Amazon since I no longer can find them at Costco.</li>
            <li> I did not realize i was getting so many.</li>
            <li> The best part is low cost for highest quality and quantity.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave lint on my face, has the perfect thickness to hold my toner, and that there are two different textured sides.</li>
            <li> However, I found that the top exfoliating layer would come off in mid-use</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they do come in a quantity, so a one time purchase lasts me up to six months or more.</li>
            <li> If you should require exfoliation, you can choose the leave the mesh on (although there are way better ways to exfoliate your face).</li>
            <li> Better than the Up&amp;Up ones I use to use.</li>
            <li> One side is textured and one is smooth!</li>
            <li> Love these rounds and have used them for many years.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a cotton pad that is a bit more fuzzy.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how many cotton rounds I was getting.</li>
            <li> works great with facial toner, superior to cotton balls, no residual cotton on face</li>
            <li> These are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product....have tried others, but I only have to use 1 of these to apply toner on my face and neck and it never falls apart.</li>
            <li> I love them most because there are woven, so unlike cotton balls, they don&#x27;t friz, flake or fall apart.</li>
            <li> I love these because they don&#x27;t leave those cotton residues on your face like the ones from Target.</li>
            <li> It was better when the rounds were &amp;#34;sewed&amp;#34; together.  </li>
            <li> Price is ookkk, prob could find cheaper product, but would BE cheaper quality too, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li> Love for removing makeup &amp; using astringent.</li>
            <li> I love it and will keep ordering this.</li>
            <li> great product... Very sturdy and strong... Will not leave traces of lent all over your face.. even with a beard</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> pretty good deal, but the edges of the cotton swabs almost give me papercuts.  </li>
            <li> I love the special exfoliating side!</li>
            <li> Either way Delon Cotton Rounds are super cost effective -- the quality and price-per-quantity can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the quality of these cotton rounds is much better than most others available in the market.</li>
            <li> These are very soft and work great as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> They are great quality and very soft.  </li>
            <li> great value and the pads are so soft!</li>
            <li> Because as of right now...they&#x27;re the best by far.</li>
            <li> The top layer is a fine network pattern of fibers and this layer does the job of exfoliating, while the cotton layers beneath hold the liquid cleanser or toner.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it was fine.  </li>
            <li> and you gotta love Amazon&#x27;s super saver shipping!</li>
            <li> good value for a large supply</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it comes in a huge package.</li>
            <li> The soft side is great for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> My husband is able to use them on his face even with light stubble, with no problems.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say here, it&#x27;s perfect if you want a surplus of cotton rounds!</li>
            <li> For the amount I get this is better priced than any thing cheap I can get at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Very durable and good quality products.</li>
            <li> But on easy makeup days (no eyeliner), I can easily get away with using just ONE of these rounds as both sides are functional.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The cotton rounds easily come apart in layers (not shredding)&lt;br /&gt;There is no Aloe Vera and Pro-vitamin B5 in the rounds like the description</li>
            <li> What that means to the \\&quot;Cotton Rounds Game\\&quot; is easily noticeable.  </li>
            <li> They are not absorbant, and the layers fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li> Wow, these cotton rounds really are the best.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shred easily.  </li>
            <li> *textured side is perfect for me: not too rough or too smooth</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easily removable.</li>
            <li> So basically, I like that it has the scrub side, and that it is extremely easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Helps remove all my makeup easily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to buy quantity.</li>
            <li> They are quality and don&#x27;t break apart or shred easily during use.  </li>
            <li> It easily pulls away from eachother.</li>
            <li> Strong, durable and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I regret purchasing these cotton rounds, and strongly advise that you look elsewhere if you want a quality product.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not these pads are far superior than the ones sold in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Thicker, softer, and more absorbent.  </li>
            <li> These work amazing and seem much higher quality than anything else I used.  </li>
            <li> Great product, high quality, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Product is fine - my issue is the price.  </li>
            <li> No linty bits, they work fine.</li>
            <li> I was going through the cheap cotton rounds very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The cotton pad itself holds up fine and doesn&#x27;t shed or come apart.</li>
            <li> These work just fine...</li>
            <li> They work perfectly fine</li>
            <li> Strong, stands up to liquids and scrubbing, and has both smooth and textured sides.</li>
            <li> These are great for applying astringents and toners, but the edges are kind of sharp!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product as they don&#x27;t leave little bits of cotton on your fingertips and eye lashes.</li>
            <li> The soft side shreds if I have not shaved right before, but the strong side works regardless if I have shaved or not so great for what I needed them for.  </li>
            <li> It is great product overall, though has space to improve, like the edge would be dispersed when filled with toner.</li>
            <li> They are quite sturdy and free of lint.</li>
            <li> I personally found that they absorbed more product than I was happy with</li>
            <li> I got mine for $19.99 for a box of 8 tubes and free shipping when I added another \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; product that I also wanted.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> One side is exfoliating, one side is smooth, neither side falls apart.  </li>
            <li> And cheap - that counts for something too.</li>
            <li> I always use the smooth side</li>
            <li> When i took a roll of rounds out of the box and examined them, they seemed so smooth that i assumed they would not be exfoliating at all.</li>
            <li> I like that they have a textured side and a smooth side.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need the exfoliation, you can pull off that part so both sides are smooth.</li>
            <li> Cheap, durable, absorbent.</li>
            <li> Best cotton round I have found on the market</li>
            <li> There is a different texture on each side that makes them great for a multitude of uses.</li>
            <li> Do not contain aloe fortunately.</li>
            <li> These are great for cosmetic uses such as applying toner.</li>
            <li> so I had to switch to using the softer, smooth side instead.</li>
            <li> it has one side smooth and one side not.</li>
            <li> I use the smooth side.  </li>
            <li> If your face is smooth, you&#x27;ll have no problems.</li>
            <li> oh, how soft it is - is good for taking off eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what another review mentioned, the rounds ARE \\&quot;standard\\&quot; size, and fit perfectly into cotton round dispensers and the like.</li>
            <li> As these have a layer of cotton sandwiched between two layers of soft gauze, the number of uses is expansive and they are superior to use.  </li>
            <li> These are soft and good quality.  </li>
            <li> I especially love the two different textures on either side, it is really helpful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and good for skin toner and remove make-up.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it flake off or anything, which is great because so many other cotton rounds I tried would leave cotton all over my face.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price for my sanity!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I first purchased these at Costco many years ago and have purchased them on Amazon every since.  </li>
            <li> probably saves them money to make it that way, but it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the original ones.</li>
            <li> They hold up well, and have light netting on one side that permits mild abrasion whenever that&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li> they have a gentle side and a rough side perfect use on my acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I almost cut my eye when I tried using it to clean my makeup.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all that we needed to get in there and get it clean.</li>
            <li> I used these to clean my face and also for tonic usage.  </li>
            <li> Pull it clean</li>
            <li> I feel that it doesn&#x27;t clean off my eye liner off as smoothly and quickly as it did before the change.</li>
            <li> One side is smooth and the other side is textured which is great for using astringent.</li>
            <li> Not only did I purchase the LARGE LARGE pack, but these are the best cotton rounds I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The price is right!</li>
            <li> nice full pad with soft roundness on the edges.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, and just the product I needed :)</li>
            <li> Since we have a house full of girls, I buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and durable enough for routine cleaning .</li>
            <li> I give to my daughter to use on her three month old baby&#x27;s face as well as her own...</li>
            <li> I initially purchased these at Costco and loved them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true win-win.</li>
            <li> My guess is they would also be good for a shop environment cleaning tools and such.</li>
            <li> Not the highest quality, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I love the new and improved version of these cotton rounds!  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s pieces of lint stuck to my eye lids and how the cotton rounds demolishes quickly.</li>
            <li> However, quality and value of this made in Canada item are still much better than most cotton rounds you can find at local retail stores.</li>
            <li> I use them constantly during the course of the day, from applying astringent after face washing, removing eye makeup and nail polish, I also keep some stashed in my bag for make up emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;Can not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy Delon in bulk and hope it&#x27;s decent, and I am glad i did that.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years, but these are even better than the older version that I have been using.</li>
            <li> great price when you add up how much you spend buying these individually at the store, even on sale</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find the same product at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> They sell for at least $5 a pack in my neighborhood so to see on Amazon for such an amazing price was delightful.</li>
            <li> Cotton rounds can come in handy for a lot of jobs, but I find that for use on the face, these can be too scratchy if one is not careful.</li>
            <li> The quality of this good is okay, however, the size is way too small.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t understand how this product can garner such high scores among so many customers.</li>
            <li> Delon Cotton Rounds have made a huge positive impact on my skin care routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than the grocery store ones by far!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> What happened to these great little pads?</li>
            <li> I felt kind of silly buying these from Amazon and having them ship an item I could easily pick up at any local store, but the price was good and it&#x27;s nice to stock up on things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to be stocked up for a few months with this order.</li>
            <li> They are also rough on one side which is great for using on your face but not so much when using around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cotton round I&#x27;d ever purchased, it stand up to time, it&#x27;s durable and does not fall apart.  </li>
            <li> Great cotton round that lasts.</li>
            <li> I use the smooth size to wipe off my eye makeup and it is gentle.</li>
            <li> i use two everyday so this bulk deal was great for me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I used them mainly for applying toner, but they also held up easily to eye makeup and nail polish removal.</li>
            <li> in my opinion  the difference in quality is well worth it.</li>
            <li> These are definitely a good deal, but not very well constructed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> The ones I&#x27;d bought at CVS would kind of break in the middle when I was taking off my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about these cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li> but either way these are totally worth</li>
            <li> , they have many layers of cotton.&lt;br /&gt;A soft side and an exfoliating side which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li> But the difference in product is worth paying the difference to me.</li>
            <li> They are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had that layer kind of roll up and come off when I used it, but only a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> I use them for so many things, and they are durable, and soft.  </li>
            <li> They have the soft side and then the not quite so soft side which is good for scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> Then I would pay far more in the supermarket or drug store.  </li>
            <li> They are strong, clean, soft and water absorbed.</li>
            <li> I love them so far.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I make my own facial cleansing pads and they hold up well once you let sit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands that seem to disintegrate in your hands (or on your face) and leave &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; cotton, but these are far superior.  </li>
            <li> The cardboard container fits right under the sink.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> They are awesome quality, and won&#x27;t break down easily like other pure non-sewed cotton rounds!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft, smooth and DON&#x27;T shred/shed all over my face.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of pads or cotton balls shredding on your face guys, these work great if you use the strong side.</li>
            <li> They are the best quality I&#x27;ve found anywhere &amp; love that one side is rough for exfoliation,while other side is soft.</li>
            <li> I love these rounds and will continue to order from here and for me, its a fair price b/c I don&#x27;t have to use so many rounds to do my neck and face so essentially, they last longer and cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that in the most recent batch I got, the textured side is a bit more abrasive than it was before (still not bad) and they do separate from the cotton at times.  </li>
            <li> These are by far the best thing I&#x27;ve found lately...</li>
            <li> use them mainly for toner or to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> These are by far the best thing I&#x27;ve found lately...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Now I can thoroughly enjoy the high quality the smooth, soft side brings.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable for the quantity.</li>
            <li> I like them very much.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that one side has an exfoliation portion and the other portion it is smooth.</li>
            <li> However, they are still light years better than other cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li> good quality, but a little thicker than I thought.</li>
            <li> This is such a huge amount!</li>
            <li> There are many different items out there like this</li>
            <li> Smooth and soft on skin.</li>
            <li> These are much better than generic rounds at drugstore</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and would definitely purchase again &amp;amp; again.</li>
            <li> However, there&#x27;s are so many uses for these, such as doing your nails, cleaning your guns, etc.  </li>
            <li> ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are quite a bit different than most you get at the store.  </li>
            <li> Most face pads I have used do the same.  </li>
            <li> They are gentler, and more sanitary than washcloths, especially for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> These will last a really long time and were a great deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are so soft and smooth for face.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that these are soft and that they don&#x27;t shed fibers.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> Price online was higher, too, lower volume buying drives up the overhead.</li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying them!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for as a &amp;#34;lint free&amp;#34; nail polisher remover applicator.</li>
            <li> Work exactly as they should.</li>
            <li> At first I was upset about having to buy so many, but these will last me forever.</li>
            <li> I found these, and they work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> said that this is a lot better quality than the ones in the drug stores at local area.</li>
            <li> First of all, perhaps I was not paying attention when I purchased, but 800???</li>
            <li> When I first started using these rounds, I preferred to use the exfoliating side.</li>
            <li> I really like these cotton rounds!  </li>
            <li> Love the product but it was substantially cheaper in Costco for the same quantity.</li>
            <li> one side is fine fine mesh to give a little more scrub but not harsh at all (for nail polish removing, or stubborn eye make up)</li>
            <li> These make it at least half a face of good scrubbing, probably even more if you go with grain, are freshly shaven, or go lightly.</li>
            <li> It takes the day off unlike any other kind of exfoliation product out there.</li>
            <li> To be honest, the best cotton pads I&#x27;ve bought were in Korea, but since I&#x27;ve been back in the States I could only find generic ones at the supermarket that were so weak and flaked so easily, leaving bits of cotton on your face.</li>
            <li> Overall this left me with a good impression.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, they are one of the very last ones of their kind.  </li>
            <li> I would like to see them changed by omitting the rough side--not good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> That caused me to go through double the amount of pads I wanted to because I could only use one side, the good un-meshed side.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was looking for good exfoliating pads and was led astray by some of the more positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I love to use them to dry my skin after cleaning.</li>
            <li> They are strong enough not too fall apart on a stubbly face.</li>
            <li> This one is strong enough to hold my toner (I do put a lot on), and when I rub it on my face it will not leave any cotton on my face.</li>
            <li> The quality of these are amazing, one side is rough for exfoliating and the other is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> so I use it to remove a certain type of sunblock for my face).</li>
            <li> I always use the exfoliating side to apply my toner to clean my face one more time, and since it also soft enough so that I do not need to worry it will damage my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shred like others do, and the more &amp;#34;abrasive&amp;#34; side isn&#x27;t super harsh.  </li>
            <li> The Delon cotton rounds are very high quality.  </li>
            <li> Everything came and the cotton is pretty high quality.</li>
            <li> Probably the only reason I&#x27;m giving these 2 stars is that you get a lot for your money and when I remember to use the smooth side they work pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> They are a nice thick quality and don&#x27;t fall apart or leave lint.&lt;br /&gt;*decided to edit this: found this exact product at Costco for $10!</li>
            <li> The pads are durable and are not shredded by facial hair as easy as most other brands tend to do.</li>
            <li> One side is texturized for mild exfoliation and better cleaning, the other side is soft.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and it&#x27;s great how it&#x27;s in bulk because I use these everyday to remove my make up and to apply toner to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now ordered my 2nd huge package of these and hope they continue to carry them</li>
            <li> I notice if I over-apply the toner and soak up the whole pad</li>
            <li> The cotton rounds do not fall apart and holds together very well.</li>
            <li> But these are very sturdy!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very durable cotton pads.</li>
            <li> and then i have to start the whole process again.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t really help with that.</li>
            <li> The quality of these are much nicer than the store bought.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s much nicer to know that when I&#x27;ve finished a pack, I can just go get another pack out of the box that it comes in.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this cotton pads.  </li>
            <li> Very durable construction.</li>
            <li> I even wrote a review saying as much.</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t paying much attention to the quantity.</li>
            <li> What is there to really say about these cotton rounds ?</li>
            <li> so there isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
            <li> However, do the jobs very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter really likes them for our face .&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I only use the smooth side.</li>
            <li> I use them, dampened, to remove my eye make up after applying oil and gently loosening the eye makeup.</li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> They hold together really well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> They dn&#x27;t stay together very well.</li>
            <li> I feel it really depends on what cleanser I use, some cleansers don&#x27;t wash well, and I could see some remaining yellowy and oily debri on the cotton pad.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like to buy it again after using it up.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very absorbent.</li>
            <li> I really like these cotton pads.</li>
            <li> The cotton hold up together very well and get the job done.  </li>
            <li> The quality is premium and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious.</li>
            <li> But not influencing the use that much.</li>
            <li> So you can only use the smooth side of the pad.</li>
            <li> Really like the thickness and absorption.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with exfoliating my skin --- and this is kind of like an insurance to make sure I exfoliated every part of my face.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like using the textured side and found this side rubbed off pretty easily exposing just the soft under layer.</li>
            <li> One side is rougher for after facial washes and the other side is more smooth for eye makeup removal.  </li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are way better than any other drugstore brand I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> Hope they bring back the original version.</li>
            <li> Most other cotton rounds or balls leave threads of cotton on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I use these daily to clean my face.</li>
            <li> One side is textured and feels like fine gauze to lift the dirt out and the other side is super soft.</li>
            <li> Just going to buy &amp;#34;cheap brand&amp;#34; next time, these aren&#x27;t special.</li>
            <li> These are soft and gentle one side and the other is great for exfoliating even for dry skin on my granddaughters face!</li>
            <li> These are so much softer and more durable, and cost less per piece.</li>
            <li> buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads are built with &#x27;layers&#x27; that come apart easily by the mere act of reaching in the bag to grab one (reminds me of those flaky layered biscuits, honestly).  </li>
            <li> Bend the pad a little bit, so the mesh kind of floats away from the soft pad</li>
            <li> I love that these feature two different textures on each side: one soft, the other with a texture for when you want a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> Love this cotton rounds but Costco only carries it occasionally.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon, more and more of your items are just not the deal they once were.tax on it too.</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon, more and more of your items are just not the deal they once were.</li>
            <li> One side is great for exfoliation as it&#x27;s rough and will sweep off dead skin cells when used with a tonic.  </li>
            <li> Initially I found them at my local Costco but haven&#x27;t been able to find them anymore.  </li>
            <li> I hate buying these at the store, so was glad to see these at a great price.  </li>
            <li> When you calculate it out, 1 package is really a decent price</li>
            <li> They are a better price than smaller volumes I purchase locally.  </li>
            <li> This actually made me realize how important it is to use a cotton pad and toner to get everything off completely.</li>
            <li> Super quality you can&#x27;t get at the local stores.</li>
            <li> I go through them quick, so purchasing a box will last me a while.</li>
            <li> Getting a large volume (800) in one shipment is far more convenient than making multiple purchases every time I run low.  </li>
            <li> We used to use another brand of cotton rounds for our facials and they tend to disintegrate pretty quickly when wet or when we take off products.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> They work extremely well, they don&#x27;t fall apart when wiping with them, they don&#x27;t feel rough on the skin, and have a good amount of surface area.</li>
            <li> They are a little more pricier than when I got them at Costco</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;One soft side for gentle cleaning and the other side offers better</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to buy such a large quantity -</li>
            <li> If for some reason you occasionally don&#x27;t want the gauze portion, easily remove it and use the cotton pad which is still less likely to lint shred or fall apart than most.</li>
            <li> At first the cotton rounds appeared to be of poor quality, as the sides aren&#x27;t sown around the \\&quot;rounds\\&quot; like the swisspers kind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely love this brand of cotton round, and I will not buy anything else moving foreword.</li>
            <li> Two issues though, the textured side has a tendency to fall off and the round can fall apart a lot easier than most.</li>
            <li> The scrub side can be useful as well- for removing makeup and such.  </li>
            <li> I experimented with a few pads to perfect the technique, since the first few tries had me destroying an edge of the pad, or pulling the many layers of cotton apart.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick pads</li>
            <li> However, the secret is surprisingly simple.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> However, I was impressed with their durability and absorbency;  these little suckers won&#x27;t quit!</li>
            <li> so many that I feel guilty tossing one without making full use of it!</li>
            <li> One side is smooth while the other is textured.</li>
            <li> One side has a sort of mesh layer on top, I guess to give a little scrub action.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always paid more for premium rounds less likely to shred and they are becoming harder to find in the stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are the best you can get as far as I know; too bad they got dropped as a Costco store item.</li>
            <li> ; they were cheap enough that it didn&#x27;t bother me when I had to use a lot to get rid of glitter nail polish, although once again, especially with the glitter, they shred.</li>
            <li> The rounds are so soft and it don&#x27;t shred lint, also the thickness is decent to absorb whatever you put on there.</li>
            <li> The actual pad bit is impressively smooth and non-linty but the edges are coarse.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers, I was pretty fed up with inconsistent quality of cotton rounds available at the local drugstore</li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable because one pack at a local pharmacy costs between $2-3.</li>
            <li> They are 100% cotton and are very soft though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was too lazy to go to the CVS across the street to get more.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds aren&#x27;t soft at all!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when Costco stopped carrying but very happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Buying online is OK, but not as convenient as getting them with other shopping at the local store.</li>
            <li> No better bang for your buck out there :)</li>
            <li> However, they are better than the items you usually find in the store.</li>
            <li> They are soft but don&#x27;t fall apart!</li>
            <li> I do peel off the scrub side first when I use them for this, but that&#x27;s extremely simple-</li>
            <li> cotton rounds fall apart, layer by layer; top, textured layer is cut too small from edge material.  </li>
            <li> First found at giant club warehouse, but then they stopped carrying.</li>
            <li> There is a textured side, but if you don&#x27;t like it for your purposes, it&#x27;s easy to pull off the little textured piece.</li>
            <li> , however, these don&#x27;t completely absorb my cleaner, so I don&#x27;t have to really soak the round to clean</li>
            <li> That is small price to pay for a great cotton round that holds up to makeup removal without falling apart, soaking through, or shedding.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember what i paid for this, but it was cheap, maybe less than $8.</li>
            <li> I thought the smaller (normal) size would seem restrictive and I&#x27;d go through them twice as fast.</li>
            <li> These are better than your average drugstore cotton rounds, but they&#x27;re inferior to Japanese cotton.</li>
            <li> I would personally prefer both sides to be smooth rather than one side being smooth and the other being textured as the textured side is almost too rough for my face.</li>
            <li> I use the textured side to scrub a little, and the smooth side is very soft.</li>
            <li> price isn&#x27;t bad at all when you consider how many you&#x27;re getting, and when you consider that you&#x27;ll only need one to take off your eye makeup, not one for the first pass and one for the second, the price looks even better!</li>
            <li> These are VERY good quality, not the ones that leave behind little fuzz and strings.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this large amount because I found myself constantly running out of make up pads.  </li>
            <li> I wish one side was a little textured though, both sides are smooth.</li>
            <li> they do have two difference sides, one is smooth and one is a little rougher.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can only use a certain face wash</li>
            <li> The only improvement I can think of would be if the cotton and gauze were molded together a little better.  </li>
            <li> found these soft on the face, and sturdy in my fingers (no lint flying off).</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t shred and have the choice of an exfoliating side or soft side.  </li>
            <li> Durable and soft also.</li>
            <li> (Burts Bees cotton sensitive skin wash), which has no exfoliating property.</li>
            <li> However, they are soft and otherwise durable.</li>
            <li> The soft side - and</li>
            <li> They are soft, yet have two sides for use.  </li>
            <li> have two sides to each round, a smooth side or a textured side.  </li>
            <li> Gentle but definite scrubbing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These pads have two sides to them, a soft side and a stronger side.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall they are soft and they don&#x27;t shred.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that they are not organic; but they are so much cheaper that I will keep using them.</li>
            <li> I use them for removing nail polish, facial scrubs, etc., and the hold up very well through all their duties.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t carry them any more (at least at my location).</li>
            <li> side because I can use the scrubby side on my face and nails (nail polish remover) and then use the soft side to take the eye makeup off my eyes.</li>
            <li> These are soft, but sturdy.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t shed but they are not as soft as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> And yet don&#x27;t feel as soft.  </li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised at the number of packs and the quantity of cotton rounds pads in each pack.  </li>
            <li> The so-called \\&quot;soft</li>
            <li> They also gave a exfoliating pad on one side which is gentle enough for my acne&#x3D;prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these for years at Costco but haven&#x27;t been able to find them lately.</li>
            <li> Would like to find the old style</li>
            <li> they are also soft.  </li>
            <li> rounds still work alright; however, they are made up of 2 soft sides instead of</li>
            <li> one soft and one textured side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft around my eyes.</li>
            <li> They are plush and soft but they have an &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; waffle side which causes them to stick to the pad underneath it.  </li>
            <li> The cotton is soft.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t save that much and the back side with the mesh lining comes off if used.</li>
            <li> they are soft cotton</li>
            <li> My only complaint that sometimes the ones at the bottom of a package get kind of soft and separate-y from its two sides, probably from being smushed around in the plastic.</li>
            <li> and when I say lately, I mean since Target (whose quality was never consistent on these since one time they&#x27;d have one kind, then on the next visit their aisles showed no trace that the previous month&#x27;s kind ever even existed)</li>
            <li> They have a smooth side and what you would consider a &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; side, but it&#x27;s not rough just different texture for harder to remove make-up</li>
            <li> I usually buy these at Costco &amp; thought they were the same pillow top.</li>
            <li> They are excellent and no more expensive than others that you purchase at CVS or Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> So many times, even after very carefully washing and drying my hands with towels, paper towels or other \\&quot;lint</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m all about the generic store brands to save money, this is high praise</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for affordable cotton rounds for your facial.</li>
            <li> The price for such a large quantity is CRAZY good</li>
            <li> I still use this everyday, the only problem is that it falls apart easily.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leave much lint behind and they don&#x27;t peel apart easily.  </li>
            <li> In these days of cheap manufacture and strict adherence to bottom lines, often times (USUALLY) quality falls by the wayside.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t normally use that side (only 1-2 times a week).</li>
            <li> These are pretty rough on one side .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other rounds that easily fall apart or stretch apart when wet.</li>
            <li> Its like a mesh of hard cotton over a smooth soft surface.</li>
            <li> I have to be super careful to keep them flat while I apply products.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find here in Puerto rico and once my wife was able to get a hold of them she has never looked back.</li>
            <li> The other side is the soft cotton, which is nice to dab your delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li> I thought that these would be soft and gentle, but they&#x27;re not really, but I can deal with that.  </li>
            <li> There is a rough side and a smooth side, but the edges seem to have a rough seam.</li>
            <li> These seem to be very absorbant as well, not so much that you waste product</li>
            <li> They are thick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The rounds are very soft and don&#x27;t shed, but sturdy enough to stand up to taking off mascera and nail polish.  </li>
            <li> There are no other cotton rounds that compare to this product.  </li>
            <li> This cotton round has different texture on each side- a smooth surface on one and a rough surface on the other, so that it&#x27;d always fit to your need.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are a little more costly compared to other brands, but they hold up well and don&#x27;t leave bits of cotton on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Work well, but the &#x27;rough&#x27; side of the pad is only a piece of material basically placed on the pad that comes right off.</li>
            <li> The layers stuck to each other fairly well, but that is probably because of the way they pressed the edges, which caused the edges to be sharp and stiff.</li>
            <li> One side smooth, other rough.</li>
            <li> Also, they work extremely well for facials and wherever you would like a superior cotton pad that does the job, holds liquids well without dripping and doesn&#x27;t leave fuzz behind.  </li>
            <li> These really are a high quality cotton round.</li>
            <li> I currently use neutrogena clear pore astringent but I plan on switching to Dickensons witch hazel</li>
            <li> They were made in Germany, have a star-shape central pattern, soft edges, don&#x27;t fall apart when removing makeup...  </li>
            <li> i bought these a while ago now- and still have barely put a dent into my supply of them.  </li>
            <li> I use the soft side for applying toner daily.</li>
            <li> But I was even more annoyed with the exfoliation side.</li>
            <li> If anything, I like them better because they are less &amp;#34;cottony&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t get all the little pieces of fuzz.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle but not super fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I will not be re ordering this product as wal mart has some just as great and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and put a lot efforts on skin care so that cotton pads/rounds are essential to my daily skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Guy&#x27;s facial care has come far in the last several years, but face pads have stank (I have just used a really soft washcloth) because man stubble catches cotton balls, rounds, etc.</li>
            <li> One side is a rougher mesh, and the other side is much softer/smoother.</li>
            <li> They are lovely and soft on one side and a little rough on the other.  </li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m sure Target or some place like that has a generic brand that cost a little less.</li>
            <li> They do not leave bits of fuzz on your mug, hold together under considerable stress, and are perfect for removing a lady&#x27;s eye shadow, since she needn&#x27;t be concerned about nasty bits of cotton floating around her eyeballs.</li>
            <li> For one, my more delicate tools benefit from careful cleaning with these reliable rounds, and my wife uses the things to apply paint and occasionally to remove it.</li>
            <li> You can even scratch your skin with it if you are not careful enough.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation side may break apart if you scrub too hard, but that&#x27;s ok for my purposes after I&#x27;m down with it.  </li>
            <li> I tried buying a few different brands at local grocery stores over the years and even the ones that were supposed to be more heavy duty kept tearing up on my face, especially over my stubble</li>
            <li> There is nothing that makes these different or worse than the myriad drugstore brands I would buy except that they have a rough side I don&#x27;t like to use for my face (good for other uses though).</li>
            <li> they fall apart at he sides sometimes bt other than that i live them.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too expensive, are nice and thick, and hold up very well.  </li>
            <li> It was raining really hard, and I knew that if I didn&#x27;t get them right then, I&#x27;d forget</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should be using a smooth or slightly patterened piece,</li>
            <li> I understand one side is for exfoliating but would expect the other to be soft.</li>
            <li> However one side is soft &amp; the other is</li>
            <li> Of course, the other side has the soft cotton, if that&#x27;s what you prefer.</li>
            <li> the other side is soft cotton.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t like one thick round, they&#x27;re like several layers of cotton with thetop layer being flat and the rest being fuzzy and easily torn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricier on Amazon site, but definitely worth paying a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull apart much on my whiskers(occasional small piece of fuzz) which is a plus.</li>
            <li> The scrubby side falls off after use but stays on long enough for me.</li>
            <li> Last For A Long Time.</li>
            <li> price per package of the Delon works out to roughly $3.00 a pack, but you are getting 100 in a pack and the rounds really are thick, soft and don&#x27;t have flakes in them</li>
            <li> However I cannot rate them highly because the edges where they sealed the layers together is stiff and scratches my skin.  </li>
            <li> Ignore the other reviewer saying something about the size being too small, it&#x27;s just the right size as</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll like them, and for me, they last a long time!</li>
            <li> Other than that, there were no other problems.</li>
            <li> This batch will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a soft side and a slightly rougher side to the pad</li>
            <li> It has two sides, one soft and slight textured.</li>
            <li> I did try different techniques and be extra careful.</li>
            <li> I normally have to go to the stores that sell Japanese cotton rounds as they are known for strong and soft material to stock up (such as MUJI) which is very inconvenient since we dont have a MUJI store down here.</li>
            <li> but because the edges are cut and compressed together, it is sharp and if not careful you could end up with paper-cut like marks on your face, she did once.</li>
            <li> None of the cotton rounds are actually \\&quot;bound\\&quot; together--all layers are loose and each pad does NOT stay together.  </li>
            <li> These cotton rounds have a thin layer of gauze on one side that help with exfoliation, and smooth cotton on the other.  </li>
            <li> I use the rough side on my nose and chin and the soft side on other areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and not cheaply made that would make them fall apart.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take a long time to go through all of these cotton rounds</li>
            <li> Just be careful using it especially if you use toners or anything that might sting.</li>
            <li> (I use them everyday to remove makeup and quite frequently to remove nail polish.)</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a long time and will continue to.</li>
            <li> Too rough especially around eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cotton rounds from Walmart and Target where they just start to lint up or break into pieces as soon as you wet them with facial toner and start wiping your face.</li>
            <li> Edge is not soft at all.</li>
            <li> could be used for a long while.</li>
            <li> They are fairly thick and very luxurious.  </li>
            <li> They are thick and cleanse very well, without shredding and shedding on your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to peel it off and the round is still usable, but it really is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I apply astringent every night and was tired of running out of cotton rounds, so I took a chance with such a large order of Delon rounds.</li>
            <li> Weird to be excited about cotton pads</li>
            <li> She will probably not buy this again because of the edges and will look for other brand with similar price and count.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little more expensive at Amazon than they were at Costco.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using Delon Cotton Rounds for as long as they make them!</li>
            <li> I never want to go back to those other ones that shred all over the place.</li>
            <li> one side slightly rougher texture, other side soft.  </li>
            <li> One side of this cotton round is very soft and the other side is mesh.</li>
            <li> i know that if i dry my fingers with one of these after washing my hands,nothing is going into my eye except the contact lens.</li>
            <li> Who knew there could be such a difference in quality in a basic, everyday product like cotton rounds?</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve noticed is sometimes when getting a round out of the pack the exfoliating texture piece will fall off (it&#x27;s similar to gauze).</li>
            <li> it is soft and thick enough.</li>
            <li> Saving a lot of money compared to going to the store for single packages.</li>
            <li> I use cotton rounds every single day to remove my eye makeup and when my daughter is around she is also using them for makeup and nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that one side has a little scrubby net on it, too rough for the face.  </li>
            <li> As long as you aren&#x27;t using it sopping wet, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally you go through the routine of taking out a cotton round, applying astringent (or whatever), and seeing as the cotton round absorbs an incredibly small amount of cosmetic product and wilts into something far too close to a wet piece of toilet paper for anyone&#x27;s face&#x27;s liking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what else to say other than they are soft, but they don&#x27;t shred!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never thought of getting them on Amazon until I got tired of getting small amount of cheap quality pads from the grocery/drug store.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheaper to buy the larger quantity.. which surprisingly enough (at least to me) is not always the case when you break it down to the unit cost of a  bulk purchase.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a &amp;#34;textured side&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;smooth side&amp;#34; for different purposes, but they feel like using little pieces of absorbant cloth on your face.  </li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t have that little ridge along the outside that the CVS ones have, the one sealing them together.</li>
            <li> These are a little smaller than I wanted, but they do work well for removing my fingernail polish.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall apart or leave little white fluffs on the face.  </li>
            <li> the other exfoliating cotton rounds i&#x27;ve used previously are covered with little raised dots that essentially scrape the skin, similar to the tips of a scrub brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft cotton that does not irritate the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> round cleans entire face</li>
            <li> Search carefully at Amazon.com to find the lowest cost.  </li>
            <li> Each round is packed with several layers of cotton,</li>
            <li> I used them all up since obviously it would be a waste</li>
            <li> The problem I have with them is both sides are different, one side has a gauze like feel to it, and any time I&#x27;m not paying attention and use that side with my eye make up remover or toner the gauze stuff separates from the rest of the round.  </li>
            <li> There is a scrubby layer that peels of as soon as it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Careful around you eyes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually really rough, even on the softer cotton side and not the webbed side.</li>
            <li> The lesser pads shred when they contact his heavy beard but the Delon Rounds stay intact.  </li>
            <li> Using these things on your face, either the rough or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; part, seems to scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> Each round has two sides with different textures.</li>
            <li> i will probably use these up, but the rough side is like frigging sandpaper and the edges are kinda sharpish.</li>
            <li> a bit rough on the eyes</li>
            <li> So you have to use it quite carefully.</li>
            <li> Grab the mesh carefully with your thumb and index of the hand not holding the pad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These rounds are thin and very fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to stop the hit-and-miss of WalMart or CVS or whatever other cotton pads are in- or out of stock.  </li>
            <li> One less thing to think about for a long time.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;How little cotton can we put into each round such that it maintains its ability to be packaged and sold and MISTAKEN FOR an actual round of usable cotton?\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate those supermarket ones as they always leave cotton on my face and torn apart very easily.</li>
            <li> Any wet cotton round can leave remnants if run over rough enough surfaces (i.e. your beard or head stubble), but these hold up for quite a few swaths when applying toner.</li>
            <li> I usually use these to remove eye makeup with some makeup remover solution, but I can&#x27;t bear to use these on my eyes since they seems to take an entire layer of skin off and leave my eyes raw with pain, so I&#x27;ve had to buy different ones for my eyes and now to get rid of these</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I purchased these when Costco carried them.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t leave lint like material on your face like some other brands.</li>
            <li> They are slightly different than some I&#x27;d ordered from this company in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still pick these over any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but I will not purchase any other brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t treat it like any other cotton pads that you could just use while in a rush.</li>
            <li> The other side is soft/smooth like a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about it is that the edge is really sharp.</li>
            <li> I know some of the other reviews mentioned that the edges were ruff in the bulk purchase</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave any traces of those small white puffs on your face when you try to remove make up.</li>
            <li> The other cotton rounds would tear and rip while I was using them leaving cotton strands on my face and eyes.  </li>
            <li> and they hold up well and don&#x27;t leave cotton pieces like other do.</li>
            <li> In fact, Delon cotton pads are so well put-together that endless uses for them</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer said, &amp;#34;NO SHREDDING&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these pads after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> Not buying other kinds anymore.</li>
            <li> They do the job of removing nail polish and eye makeup remover as well as being used for toner and other things</li>
            <li> Some of the drugstore one I have used in the past felt too big and wasteful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not leave any cotton fiber on my face like other cotton pads that I had used before.</li>
            <li> That ridge would often rub into my skin, wouldn&#x27;t cut or anything, but it would hurt a bit and sometimes leave a little red mark that would take a few minutes to go away.</li>
            <li> In fact both sides feel very rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I try to be very careful when using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The edges are not stiff and cutting when used near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> New ones are too thin in material compared to others.</li>
            <li> The round separates before you even wet it, and it has a rough feel to it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and and now have a cabinet full of rounds I&#x27;ll likely never use.</li>
            <li> Being as anal retentive as I am, i calculated the cost per single cotton  round  </li>
            <li> Like at least one other reviewer, I bought these at Costco until they abruptly discontinued carrying, sometime within this last year.</li>
            <li> edges\\&quot;, are actually very stiff and scratch my face constantly when I remove makeup.</li>
            <li> I use these at least daily, when I tone my face, and sporadically for other uses like removing nail polish.</li>
            <li> I found the textured side to be a little to rough</li>
            <li> For nail care, they are not useful for nail polish removal.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Now the average cotton rounds at a brick and mortar store I see average from $4-$6 per pack of cotton rounds.</li>
            <li> and these are one of the few that have minimal lint.</li>
            <li> Thick enough for me.</li>
            <li> On side has a piece of gauze, which keeps the cotton fibers from your face, and also is a little rough, which I like for the slight exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> And you can tell the quality also was going down hill.</li>
            <li> Some other brands are scratchy on the edges...not this brand!</li>
            <li> like I would sometimes find in other brands which would cause me to waste a round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try these and you will never use any other cotton &#x27;round&#x27; or &#x27;square&#x27; again.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy another cotton round other than these.  </li>
            <li> I gave them second chance when I saw &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; , but sadly they are the same frayed edged pads as before.</li>
            <li> Granted, the rough side tends to pull away from the round every so often, but even then the round cleans my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;d need scissors to get them in half.</li>
            <li> and now I want nothing less.  </li>
            <li> One side is slightly exfoliating which I like.  </li>
            <li> I rip them in half to get them through.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This happens to about half of the cotton rounds in each roll.</li>
            <li> They hold up to being cut in half as well.</li>
            <li> : get it at Costco for literally half their price</li>
            <li> Seems to be a little overprice, but if you break down the cost ( there are100 in each pack)</li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> putting in my contact lenses - they don&#x27;t leave any of those lint thingies (technical term)  that sometimes stay behind with some other brands..  </li>
            <li> not experienced any &amp;#34;scratching&amp;#34; as other have (individual to how used?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other cotton rounds I&#x27;ve purchased in the past</li>
            <li> so I can use them to exfoliate a little.</li>
            <li> A little upsetting because when I purchased it was $29</li>
            <li> Gives that added bonus when I need that little exfoliation ----</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s come to a point that I fear using these pads a little because of the likelihood that I&#x27;ll be hurt.</li>
            <li> Eighteen dollars for 50 little pieces of gauze?  </li>
            <li> so thought I&#x27;d save a little $ with this bulk</li>
            <li> They leave little pieces of cotton on my nails, around my eyes, wherever I use them.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> tried cutting the edges off, but the whole thing came apart.  </li>
            <li> (once I get it in the mail) as I have acne prone skin and with these pads, the neutrogena toner is rather harsh.</li>
            <li> if i bought a one package from drugstore, then price per round if i bought the bulk package here (800 count).</li>
            <li> but I think it reinforces the round so it doesn&#x27;t tear when using it.  </li>
            <li> She uses both sides of the cotton round but always have to be mindful of the edges.</li>
            <li> There is no cotton residue left behind on your face when you use it.</li>
            <li> The cotton round stays in take and does not rip.  </li>
            <li> a few times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So one cotton round splits into two when you take it out of the roll.</li>
            <li> Each round is made up of a few layers of cotton, which tend to seperate.</li>
            <li> For this reason, I like using them for nails and toner application since nothing is left behind.</li>
            <li> I use the exfoliating side a few times a week and the softer side the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> Removing the mesh also miraculously softens the edge of the round as well.</li>
            <li> They are an everyday staple for me.  </li>
            <li> After getting tired of paying $3 per pack, I took the plunge and ordered a big box.  </li>
            <li> Have gone through a few orders of these, since finding on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The edges are not smooth, so it scratches my face every time I used.</li>
            <li> I also like the size of the round.</li>
            <li> the way, my rounds didn&#x27;t fall apart as some of the other negative reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> They come out of the pack in a stiff way without sacrificing gentleness during application.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate applying toner because I would never feel clean with all the residues which I had to pick off.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered these things (which actually were less expensive than the amount that CVS charges.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 10+ years and it seems like they have improved this cotton round by making it softer.</li>
            <li> These Delon pads are by far the worst by a large margin.</li>
            <li> I completely understand what other reviewers are saying about feeling bad about throwing them out after one use.</li>
            <li> I was always having trouble with these fibers around my eyes which I had a hard time removing.  </li>
            <li> These are a bit hard and not comfortable on my skin.  </li>
            <li> So, at first, I was utterly frustrated by the hard edges these cotton rounds have.</li>
            <li> Unlike costco one, it doesn&#x27;t leave ugly residue on your face and absorb the toner fast.</li>
            <li> Also, the pads do not soak up an excessive amount of fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon came through for me.</li>
            <li> only pads my wife buys because of the unmatched quality, but dang, who knew cotton pads could be so expensive.</li>
            <li> No cotton left behind!</li>
            <li> but for the swishing of your face afterwards to shoo off the cotton it&#x27;s left behind as it fell so weakly apart.  </li>
            <li> These are not very good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where the negative reviews are coming from.</li>
            <li> That part is a little frustrating to me.  </li>
            <li> But that is probably because sewing it may make the edges \\&quot;sharper\\&quot; for the delicate areas like around eyes.</li>
            <li> I am frustrated time and again by rounds that leave me with the clear impression that someone during manufacture put the question to themselves:</li>
            <li> That was at least a couple years ago, and searching around in the interim has been fruitless...until now.  </li>
            <li> I used a store brand rounds and it would shed like crazy... leaving white cottons on my face...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she likes the fact that its thick and cheaper compare to cotton rounds you get from cvs or walgreens</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also thick</li>
            <li> It does the job, but they are not as thick as the ones Costco had.  </li>
            <li> The cotton rounds are thick and do the come apart.</li>
            <li> but I prefer a sturdier round that doesn&#x27;t leave cotton fibers behind.</li>
            <li> problem is that the two textured sides are put together back-to-back very poorly, and they always fall off from each other.</li>
            <li> The price cut is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also impossible to put the two back together at this</li>
            <li> Then I received a message from the company from which I buy a ridiculously expensive facial care regimen, suggesting I purchase their gauze pads to avoid clogging up my extremely expensive face with cotton fibers.  </li>
            <li> a couple years ago changed to their store branded \\&quot;Up&amp;Up\\&quot; brand and went the way of the WORTHLESS toilet paper cotton round.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase this product at a wholesale warehouse but I as of late have been unable to find it.</li>
            <li> I always HATED how some cotton pads leave small white cotton pieces on my face and it annoys the poop out of me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a nice, even split, but rather a split with lots of messy strings between, and impossible to use either of the two sides because it&#x27;s just so thin to use separately</li>
            <li> They were too abrasive for my face, and they shred like crazy and leave little cotton traces behind.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with pads tearing and leaving cotton behind</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave pieces of cotton behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve since switched to using muslin cloths for applying my toner (thin and reusable)</li>
            <li> Does not leave behind cotton pieces when I use it.</li>
            <li> I still end up with something irritating in my eye that i dont \\&quot;see\\&quot; until its on my eyeball..</li>
            <li> and then you look like a poor man&#x27;s Santa face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to find cotton rounds that wouldn&#x27;t leave lint all over your face or even worse break apart when using them with toner or makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> They do not come apart and leave cotton strands behind.</li>
            <li> Some of the cotton rounds were poorly made.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too abraisive, they don&#x27;t fall apart, and they&#x27;re not too thin.</li>
            <li> Not ideal for skin or nail care.</li>
            <li> Probably just another company trying to save their profit by making deficient products that are just as expensive it not more expensive : (.</li>
            <li> These are no nonsense, no perfume, all purpose cotton rounds that don&#x27;t leave any of those annoying little lint balls.</li>
            <li> so I purchased it here before seeing them at Costco again for a mere $9.99 for the identical item.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Kroger brand from Fred Meyer, but they got so thin!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these cotton rounds...thick, sturdy.</li>
            <li> They are absorbent and don&#x27;t leave any &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; behind, so they aren&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I then switched to Safeway brand, but they are expensive!</li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable to hold and move with hand.</li>
            <li> These are very expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Even I&#x27;m not that stupid.  </li>
            <li> I hate how when I try to remove eye makeup</li>
            <li> If you are like me, the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; cotton rounds shred when using them leaving annoying pieces of cotton all over your hand and face.  </li>
            <li> Holy crap</li>
            <li> Because another rounds I used were unpleasant to use for face!</li>
            <li> I purchased based on the rave reviews and was very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I doubt that I would recommend anyone buy these, but they&#x27;re not so horrible that I would return them.</li>
            <li> very annoying when in a hurry..</li>
            <li> Costco is now carrying the Swissper brand, which is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Then I thought, you know, I&#x27;m paying an awful lot of money at the corner drugstore to clog up my face with the cotton fibers, and the search was on.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was concerned about the size of the rounds since I prefer to buy the XL oval ones from the drugstore (to minimize how many I use for makeup removal). I thought the smaller (normal) size would seem restrictive and I&#x27;d go through them twice as fast. However, I was impressed with their durability and absorbency;  these little suckers won&#x27;t quit! I used to use 2-4 XL oval rounds a day; 1-2 for eye makeup removal and 1-2 for toner. But on easy makeup days (no eyeliner), I can easily get away with using just ONE of these rounds as both sides are functional.  I notice if I over-apply the toner and soak up the whole pad then it shreds, but that&#x27;s not the norm. I&#x27;m happy to be stocked up for a few months with this order.</li>
            <li> There are many different items out there like this but I have found this item to be one of the best. This is a repeat for me and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Love them and I love to have a bunch because I use one for each eye to remove makeup.  They are soft and not cheaply made that would make them fall apart.  These are quality.</li>
            <li> These pads seem to flake off.  Not sure if I should be using a smooth or slightly patterened piece, but I often pick out a pad and a layer has flaked off.  Still using them.</li>
            <li> I used to love these, but they went from nice cotton cleaning pads to one where the edges come apart.  I gave them second chance when I saw &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; , but sadly they are the same frayed edged pads as before. What happened to these great little pads?</li>
            <li> I like to order in bulk so being able to buy 800 count was a great find. The pads are durable and are not shredded by facial hair as easy as most other brands tend to do. I have always had a problem with pads tearing and leaving cotton behind but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shredding from these pads</li>
            <li> I use these daily to clean my face. The cotton holds up great.  The scrubby side falls off after use but stays on long enough for me.</li>
            <li> Just got these yesterday. Great quality. Doesn&#x27;t leave pieces of cotton behind. Cost is perfect.</li>
            <li> If you prefer untextured, soft cotton rounds with great quality this is a great product to buy. The cotton rounds do not fall apart and holds together very well. Personally, I like using the textured side and found this side rubbed off pretty easily exposing just the soft under layer. Overall this left me with a good impression. I just wished the textured side held up as well in the stitching.</li>
            <li> This is such a huge amount! great value and the pads are so soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy it again,it&#x27;s very good for me~~</li>
            <li> Product is fine - my issue is the price.  Costco had discontinued this item so I purchased it here before seeing them at Costco again for a mere $9.99 for the identical item. Bah Humbug!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best cotton rounds I have bought. Does not tear apart when I have any stuble on my face.</li>
            <li> The best.  Love love it.  I use them every night.</li>
            <li> Weird to be excited about cotton pads but these are the best cotton pads I&#x27;ve ever purchased. They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; and are so durable. I like that they have two different textures too. I will never buy another kind of cotton pad if I can help it.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;One soft side for gentle cleaning and the other side offers better exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to shred at all&lt;br /&gt;One round cleans entire face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The cotton rounds easily come apart in layers (not shredding)&lt;br /&gt;There is no Aloe Vera and Pro-vitamin B5 in the rounds like the description stated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this cotton rounds! it is soft and thick enough.</li>
            <li> The quality of this good is okay, however, the size is way too small. It is very uncomfortable to hold and move with hand. Do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this cotton! This is our second order and definetly will order it again!</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are way better than any other drugstore brand I have ever come across. They are quite sturdy and free of lint. I hate how when I try to remove eye makeup there&#x27;s pieces of lint stuck to my eye lids and how the cotton rounds demolishes quickly. But these are very sturdy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of this is that it does eat up alot of product! I wish if it was thinner! But overall good quality and good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I purchased these when Costco carried them. I no longer see them there, but I believe Amazon carries them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these soft on the face, and sturdy in my fingers (no lint flying off). I used them mainly for applying toner, but they also held up easily to eye makeup and nail polish removal. I personally found that they absorbed more product than I was happy with but that&#x27;s just the nature of cotton rounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since switched to using muslin cloths for applying my toner (thin and reusable) so I won&#x27;t be repurchasing, but if I were to use cotton rounds it would be these ones.</li>
            <li> Quality product and for a great price!</li>
            <li> If you are like me, the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; cotton rounds shred when using them leaving annoying pieces of cotton all over your hand and face.  I&#x27;ve always paid more for premium rounds less likely to shred and they are becoming harder to find in the stores in my area.  These don&#x27;t shred and have the choice of an exfoliating side or soft side.  Search carefully at Amazon.com to find the lowest cost.  I got mine for $19.99 for a box of 8 tubes and free shipping when I added another \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; product that I also wanted.  I&#x27;m happy to store these until I use them given the quality and price I paid.</li>
            <li> Very durable cotton pads. Smooth and soft on skin. Does not leave behind cotton pieces when I use it.</li>
            <li> Granted, the rough side tends to pull away from the round every so often, but even then the round cleans my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other cotton rounds I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, however, these don&#x27;t completely absorb my cleaner, so I don&#x27;t have to really soak the round to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with the Delon cotton rounds and have purchased this item more than once from Amazon because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 21, 2016 Update:  Noticed many reviewers stating they didn&#x27;t receive 800 rounds.  Picked up my order today and the plastic bag contained 8 tubes of 100 each.  I continue to be a big fan of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 16, 2017:  Still my go to!</li>
            <li> Love them. The soft side is great for makeup removal. The textured side is great for nail polish removal (removed three layers of polish much faster!). At first I was hesitant to buy such a large quantity - but no have no worries we&#x27;ll use them all.</li>
            <li> A good deal, the cotton pads were ok, not the best but the price is great.</li>
            <li> At first the cotton rounds appeared to be of poor quality, as the sides aren&#x27;t sown around the \\&quot;rounds\\&quot; like the swisspers kind. But that is probably because sewing it may make the edges \\&quot;sharper\\&quot; for the delicate areas like around eyes. Each round is packed with several layers of cotton, so many that I feel guilty tossing one without making full use of it! The soft side is perfect for removing eye make up and the exfoliation side is unbelievably good for the rest of the face and neck! It takes the day off unlike any other kind of exfoliation product out there. And I&#x27;ve tried it all! But I do think the trick to good exfoliation with these pads is a good toner. I currently use neutrogena clear pore astringent but I plan on switching to Dickensons witch hazel (once I get it in the mail) as I have acne prone skin and with these pads, the neutrogena toner is rather harsh. Ignore the other reviewer saying something about the size being too small, it&#x27;s just the right size as the swisspers kind(which aren&#x27;t as great as these!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This product is a MUST have for ANY woman who wears make up. The price for such a large quantity is CRAZY good and you gotta love Amazon&#x27;s super saver shipping!</li>
            <li> Nice and thick pads and they don&#x27;t leave lint like material on your face like some other brands.</li>
            <li> Beautiful life saver for cleaning my face.  Durable and soft also. This was a good purchase for me. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are better than your average drugstore cotton rounds, but they&#x27;re inferior to Japanese cotton. I used them all up since obviously it would be a waste but I didn&#x27;t enjoy using them. They were too abrasive for my face, and they shred like crazy and leave little cotton traces behind. I didn&#x27;t like using them for my nails either since they shred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side; they were cheap enough that it didn&#x27;t bother me when I had to use a lot to get rid of glitter nail polish, although once again, especially with the glitter, they shred.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds have a thin layer of gauze on one side that help with exfoliation, and smooth cotton on the other.  I had been using quilted cotton rounds that kept falling apart because of the embossing which created the quilting.  These rounds don&#x27;t fall apart and don&#x27;t leave cotton fibers behind--extremely nice when doing a manicure!</li>
            <li> In these days of cheap manufacture and strict adherence to bottom lines, often times (USUALLY) quality falls by the wayside.  What that means to the \\&quot;Cotton Rounds Game\\&quot; is easily noticeable.  I am frustrated time and again by rounds that leave me with the clear impression that someone during manufacture put the question to themselves: \\&quot;How little cotton can we put into each round such that it maintains its ability to be packaged and sold and MISTAKEN FOR an actual round of usable cotton?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these rounds are different.  As far as I can tell, they are one of the very last ones of their kind.  Normally you go through the routine of taking out a cotton round, applying astringent (or whatever), and seeing as the cotton round absorbs an incredibly small amount of cosmetic product and wilts into something far too close to a wet piece of toilet paper for anyone&#x27;s face&#x27;s liking.  Hanging soggily over your fingertips in some incredibly impotent way, you know it&#x27;s all over now but for the swishing of your face afterwards to shoo off the cotton it&#x27;s left behind as it fell so weakly apart.  And if you&#x27;re a DUDE, forget it!  Your next 5 minutes are booked picking cotton out of your stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Delon ones maintain their consistency from beginning to end.  They come out of the pack in a stiff way without sacrificing gentleness during application.  One side is exfoliating, one side is smooth, neither side falls apart.  These are by far the best thing I&#x27;ve found lately...and when I say lately, I mean since Target (whose quality was never consistent on these since one time they&#x27;d have one kind, then on the next visit their aisles showed no trace that the previous month&#x27;s kind ever even existed) a couple years ago changed to their store branded \\&quot;Up&amp;Up\\&quot; brand and went the way of the WORTHLESS toilet paper cotton round.  That was at least a couple years ago, and searching around in the interim has been fruitless...until now.  Hopefully Delon will not begin tofollow suit.  Because as of right now...they&#x27;re the best by far.</li>
            <li> Use : for makeup removing.  The product is OK. I hoped that the rugged side would be more textured. The price is affordable.</li>
            <li> This will be the only way I buy cotton pads from now on!  It just makes sense.</li>
            <li> I love these cotton pads.  They are slightly different than some I&#x27;d ordered from this company in the past but they&#x27;re still great.  Very gentle but not super fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I used to love the Delon+ cotton rounds. These, however, do not have the flower embossed on one side. They are also rough on one side which is great for using on your face but not so much when using around the eyes. Hope they bring back the original version.</li>
            <li> These are much better than generic rounds at drugstore</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and decided that I&#x27;d go for it and buy these, 800 cotton rounds for a low price.  I use a lot of these things on a daily basis, and figured 800 would last for awhile.  The problem I have with them is both sides are different, one side has a gauze like feel to it, and any time I&#x27;m not paying attention and use that side with my eye make up remover or toner the gauze stuff separates from the rest of the round.  I thought that these would be soft and gentle, but they&#x27;re not really, but I can deal with that.  Probably the only reason I&#x27;m giving these 2 stars is that you get a lot for your money and when I remember to use the smooth side they work pretty decent.  I doubt that I would recommend anyone buy these, but they&#x27;re not so horrible that I would return them.</li>
            <li> Love this cotton rounds but Costco only carries it occasionally.  These cotton rounds do leave residue of lint on your face.</li>
            <li> These are no nonsense, no perfume, all purpose cotton rounds that don&#x27;t leave any of those annoying little lint balls. I use them for astringent, makeup remover, cleaning my cats teeth and eyes. No perfumes or dyes. No fancy packaging. I love it. The cardboard container fits right under the sink.</li>
            <li> These are exceptionally good cotton rounds.  They hold up well, and have light netting on one side that permits mild abrasion whenever that&#x27;s needed.  A very good product at a great price!</li>
            <li> The quality is very good</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers, I was pretty fed up with inconsistent quality of cotton rounds available at the local drugstore so I thought id give these a try.  Being as anal retentive as I am, i calculated the cost per single cotton  round  if i bought a one package from drugstore, then price per round if i bought the bulk package here (800 count). Definitely cheaper to buy the larger quantity.. which surprisingly enough (at least to me) is not always the case when you break it down to the unit cost of a  bulk purchase. Anal retentiveness aside, I would buy them even if  they were more expensive .. in my opinion  the difference in quality is well worth it. Since I&#x27;m all about the generic store brands to save money, this is high praise indeed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How ive used them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. washed my face with cleanser in the shower, and they don&#x27;t shred, even when wet.&lt;br /&gt;2. remove makeup&lt;br /&gt;3. remove nail polish&lt;br /&gt;4. cleaning my dogs ears...&lt;br /&gt;5. putting in my contact lenses - they don&#x27;t leave any of those lint thingies (technical term)  that sometimes stay behind with some other brands..  i know that if i dry my fingers with one of these after washing my hands,nothing is going into my eye except the contact lens. So many times, even after very carefully washing and drying my hands with towels, paper towels or other \\&quot;lint free\\&quot;tissues.. I still end up with something irritating in my eye that i dont \\&quot;see\\&quot; until its on my eyeball.. and then i have to start the whole process again. very annoying when in a hurry..&lt;br /&gt;6. The lack of shedding (for lack of a better word), also works great if i&#x27;m trying to clean the edges of my nails after painting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JANUARY 2014 - UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I still think they&#x27;re great,but I want to point out that since the last time i purchased (within the last 2-3 months), the price has jumped from $17 to $30. I&#x27;ll probably still use them  but will definitely be redoing my unit cost calculation... and oh yes now i have to pay tax on it too. Sorry Amazon, more and more of your items are just not the deal they once were.tax on it too. Sorry Amazon, more and more of your items are just not the deal they once were.</li>
            <li> They are strong enough not too fall apart on a stubbly face.</li>
            <li> These are definitely a good deal, but not very well constructed. There is a scrubby layer that peels of as soon as it gets wet.</li>
            <li> These are very soft and work great as a makeup remover. Sadly, I was looking for good exfoliating pads and was led astray by some of the more positive reviews. I have sensitive skin and can only use a certain face wash (Burts Bees cotton sensitive skin wash), which has no exfoliating property. These don&#x27;t really help with that.</li>
            <li> These things fall apart on one side whenever I apply my toner with&#x27;em.  However, they are soft and otherwise durable. And cheap - that counts for something too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it here. Great money saving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get those cotton squares you find at your drugstore, get this instead.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do better than these.  They are lovely and soft on one side and a little rough on the other.  I use the rough side on my nose and chin and the soft side on other areas of my face.  They are fairly thick and very luxurious.  It&#x27;s going to take a long time to go through all of these cotton rounds but it&#x27;s worth it.  The price is right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands that seem to disintegrate in your hands (or on your face) and leave &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; cotton, but these are far superior.  There&#x27;s a &amp;#34;textured side&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;smooth side&amp;#34; for different purposes, but they feel like using little pieces of absorbant cloth on your face.  They last quite a while too.  Would definitely reccomend.</li>
            <li> We used to use another brand of cotton rounds for our facials and they tend to disintegrate pretty quickly when wet or when we take off products. This brand of cotton rounds hold up way better. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for affordable cotton rounds for your facial.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this product at a wholesale warehouse but I as of late have been unable to find it. I was very pleased to find the same product at Amazon.com. For me, these are superior cotton rounds for removing eye make-up. I have been using this product for the past 10+ years and it seems like they have improved this cotton round by making it softer. It does not fall apart when I use it for removing waterproof eyeliner. It&#x27;s a soft cotton that does not irritate the delicate eye area. I am pleased with this product and would definitely purchase again &amp;amp; again.</li>
            <li> Guy&#x27;s facial care has come far in the last several years, but face pads have stank (I have just used a really soft washcloth) because man stubble catches cotton balls, rounds, etc. and then you look like a poor man&#x27;s Santa face. These make it at least half a face of good scrubbing, probably even more if you go with grain, are freshly shaven, or go lightly. That&#x27;s a great thing, and the price is nice as well.</li>
            <li> Good value and good quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many cotton rounds and even the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; ones fall apart as you&#x27;re using them.  Not these.  The only downside is that in the most recent batch I got, the textured side is a bit more abrasive than it was before (still not bad) and they do separate from the cotton at times.  I&#x27;d still pick these over any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use these cotton rounds daily. I go through packs weekly. I use them to put makeup on and take makeup off.  I decided to buy these bulk so that I don&#x27;t have to keep buying them in the store. The quality of these are much nicer than the store bought. They are thicker and softer. The value is incredible too. And it&#x27;s much nicer to know that when I&#x27;ve finished a pack, I can just go get another pack out of the box that it comes in. I will buy these again. These are a great find and an even better value.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was too lazy to go to the CVS across the street to get more. It was raining really hard, and I knew that if I didn&#x27;t get them right then, I&#x27;d forget and then I&#x27;d be stuck wearing my waterproof mascara until the day I died. So I ordered these things (which actually were less expensive than the amount that CVS charges. Yay DC prices!). Amazon Prime shipping later, I got to try them out. Holy crap these things are wonderful. I completely understand what other reviewers are saying about feeling bad about throwing them out after one use. The more scrubby side is good for using toner and that sort of thing. The soft side - and oh, how soft it is - is good for taking off eye makeup. They never fall apart. The ones I&#x27;d bought at CVS would kind of break in the middle when I was taking off my eye makeup. Not these guys. I think you&#x27;d need scissors to get them in half. They also don&#x27;t have that little ridge along the outside that the CVS ones have, the one sealing them together. That ridge would often rub into my skin, wouldn&#x27;t cut or anything, but it would hurt a bit and sometimes leave a little red mark that would take a few minutes to go away. I just figured that was how cotton rounds were. I was so wrong!&lt;br /&gt;The price isn&#x27;t bad at all when you consider how many you&#x27;re getting, and when you consider that you&#x27;ll only need one to take off your eye makeup, not one for the first pass and one for the second, the price looks even better!</li>
            <li> This bulk pack was a factory defect.  None of the cotton rounds are actually \\&quot;bound\\&quot; together--all layers are loose and each pad does NOT stay together.  I have ordered this brand before, but have never had this type of problem.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite comedic rounds...better price in bulk here than at the store.</li>
            <li> Better than the grocery store ones by far!  They have a good texture, thickness and absorbency for both using eye makeup remover and applying toner.</li>
            <li> Awesome product with amazing price! Was shipped via Prime &amp; arrived just on time:)</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are absolutely fantastic!  They are soft, yet have two sides for use.  One side is great for exfoliation as it&#x27;s rough and will sweep off dead skin cells when used with a tonic.  The exfoliation side may break apart if you scrub too hard, but that&#x27;s ok for my purposes after I&#x27;m down with it.  They are awesome quality, and won&#x27;t break down easily like other pure non-sewed cotton rounds!  I&#x27;m not quite sure about the product enriched with aloe + vitamin, but it surely adds to the value factor as well.</li>
            <li> I tried the cheaper/knock off cosmetic rounds but I will not purchase any other brand from now on. I initially bought the case box from Costco but they no longer sell them so I checked amazon and as always, they came through for me. I love these rounds and will continue to order from here and for me, its a fair price b/c I don&#x27;t have to use so many rounds to do my neck and face so essentially, they last longer and cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about these cotton rounds.  There are better quality cotton rounds on the market.  The round separates before you even wet it, and it has a rough feel to it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cotton round I&#x27;d ever purchased, it stand up to time, it&#x27;s durable and does not fall apart.  One pad does it all and no need to double up.  There&#x27;s this wonderful soft durable mesh that I believe causes this pad to hold up longer and I love it  I will absolutly stock up</li>
            <li> they fall apart at he sides sometimes bt other than that i live them. they have a gentle side and a rough side perfect use on my acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price - highly recommend. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying individual (lower quality) packets at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to find cotton rounds that wouldn&#x27;t leave lint all over your face or even worse break apart when using them with toner or makeup remover.  Finding these cotton rounds were like finding a gold mine!  They are absolutely the BEST cotton rounds ever!  Initially I found them at my local Costco but haven&#x27;t been able to find them anymore.  So I found them on Amazon!  They are a little more pricier than when I got them at Costco but either way these are totally worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have two sides to each round, a smooth side or a textured side.  I always use the smooth side and I can&#x27;t figure out what the textured side would be used for but I think it reinforces the round so it doesn&#x27;t tear when using it.  Overall, these are the best!  If you&#x27;re looking to get cotton rounds, get these NOW!  You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> These are a little smaller than I wanted, but they do work well for removing my fingernail polish. Great price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this cotton pads.  They are a very good quality and do not rip or shed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them mainly for toner or to clean my face.  However, there&#x27;s are so many uses for these, such as doing your nails, cleaning your guns, etc.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is much better then anything I have found at the local stores and I will just continue to but these on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on \\&quot;Helpful\\&quot; below.  Thank you.  :)</li>
            <li> This is the best buy for your money. Very durable construction. It will probably take me 2 years to use them all!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price for my sanity! These are by far the best thing I&#x27;ve found lately... So I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second box of these now and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.  They aren&#x27;t too expensive, are nice and thick, and hold up very well.  They don&#x27;t pull apart much on my whiskers(occasional small piece of fuzz) which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I would personally prefer both sides to be smooth rather than one side being smooth and the other being textured as the textured side is almost too rough for my face. I use these rounds for makeup removal and taking off nail polish. No linty bits, they work fine.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! High quality. One side is smooth and the other side is textured which is great for using astringent.</li>
            <li> I love that these feature two different textures on each side: one soft, the other with a texture for when you want a deeper clean. The one downside I&#x27;ve found to these is that the layer that&#x27;s textured sometimes peels off and separates. I&#x27;m happy to say that these don&#x27;t shred, so overall I&#x27;m happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> When i took a roll of rounds out of the box and examined them, they seemed so smooth that i assumed they would not be exfoliating at all. I even wrote a review saying as much. But when i actually used one with facial cleanser, i was amazed at how well they worked. Gentle but definite scrubbing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the other exfoliating cotton rounds i&#x27;ve used previously are covered with little raised dots that essentially scrape the skin, similar to the tips of a scrub brush. These rounds do not have the dots, they work in a much more effective manner. The top layer is a fine network pattern of fibers and this layer does the job of exfoliating, while the cotton layers beneath hold the liquid cleanser or toner. Also, the pads do not soak up an excessive amount of fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended,</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she likes the fact that its thick and cheaper compare to cotton rounds you get from cvs or walgreens but because the edges are cut and compressed together, it is sharp and if not careful you could end up with paper-cut like marks on your face, she did once. Don&#x27;t treat it like any other cotton pads that you could just use while in a rush. It doesn&#x27;t shred so that&#x27;s good. She uses both sides of the cotton round but always have to be mindful of the edges. Either the edges had to be trimmed to use or make sure to not let the edges touch your skin. Careful around you eyes. Just be careful using it especially if you use toners or anything that might sting. She will probably not buy this again because of the edges and will look for other brand with similar price and count.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, very comfortable. I just wasn&#x27;t paying much attention to the quantity. This will keep me going for years.</li>
            <li> What is there to really say about these cotton rounds ? they&#x27;re cotton...and they are round!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok really pros:&lt;br /&gt;These are great, they have many layers of cotton.&lt;br /&gt;A soft side and an exfoliating side which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Guys can use them and not have the cotton shred across their face if they have any stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con:&lt;br /&gt;when using a lot of pressure or scrubbing the layers of cotton will separate since the edges are not sewn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall: great buy</li>
            <li> These are the ones that they used to sell at Costco.  Costco is now carrying the Swissper brand, which is terrible.  The Delon cotton rounds are very high quality.  They don&#x27;t fall apart on you.  They don&#x27;t leave lint.  I like that they have a textured side and a smooth side.  The like using the textured side w/ toner to get rid of any residual makeup and dirt after washing my face.  Highly recommend.  I wish Costco would start carrying this brand again.  It&#x27;s a little pricier on Amazon site, but definitely worth paying a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> Like at least one other reviewer, I bought these at Costco until they abruptly discontinued carrying, sometime within this last year. They are quite a bit different than most you get at the store.  One side has a gauze-like cover, which works great for exfoliating.  The other side is soft/smooth like a cotton ball.  They don&#x27;t shred all up if you&#x27;re using something like toner.  They&#x27;re a little more expensive at Amazon than they were at Costco.  But the difference in product is worth paying the difference to me.</li>
            <li> Last For A Long Time. Love iT !</li>
            <li> I use these to put acne medication on my face.  The medicine suggests a face pad or cotton balls, but the cotton balls shred across my face being that I have facial stubble being a guy.  Most face pads I have used do the same.  These pads have two sides to them, a soft side and a stronger side.  The soft side shreds if I have not shaved right before, but the strong side works regardless if I have shaved or not so great for what I needed them for.  If you are tired of pads or cotton balls shredding on your face guys, these work great if you use the strong side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from cvs to walmart, target, etc.., but this is the best quality in term of lint free and very absorbent. Seems to be a little overprice, but if you break down the cost ( there are100 in each pack) they are even cheaper than most brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just cotton pads so there isn&#x27;t much to say. One side is smooth while the other is textured. It tears but it depends on how you use it. What I don&#x27;t like about it is that the edge is really sharp. I almost cut my eye when I tried using it to clean my makeup. The price is great but won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> yes, they have one side that is textured, but I love this as it helps removing make-up.&lt;br /&gt;Overall they are soft and they don&#x27;t shred. My only regret is that they are not organic; but they are so much cheaper that I will keep using them.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are pretty good.  They are thick and cleanse very well, without shredding and shedding on your face.  I rated them a 4 only because, of my preference, to having a sealed edge.  These cotton rounds, do not have a sealed edge and therefore the scrubbing side of the pad can come off.  Sometimes when I am in a hurry I reach in to get one and end up with the scrubbing side of the next. That part is a little frustrating to me.  However, do the jobs very well.  I use them for removing nail polish, facial scrubs, etc., and the hold up very well through all their duties.</li>
            <li> These are the ones I can sometimes get at Costco (they only have them sometimes they&#x27;re &#x27;seasonal&#x27;?).  I like that one side is rougher so I can use them to exfoliate a little.</li>
            <li> This product meets the every day needs for required functions of cleansing and treating your eye lids, face, and throat. Best pricing I have found for this specific product. Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Just going to buy &amp;#34;cheap brand&amp;#34; next time, these aren&#x27;t special. Well my weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My favorite cotton rounds!  They do not shred when used for any use at all. Used to be able to buy then at Costco but they don&#x27;t carry them any more (at least at my location).</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of cotton rounds for years.  It&#x27;s great to be able to buy in bulk like this.</li>
            <li> Good quality cotton rounds, and fairly priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these on my face, and never have a problem with them tearing or shedding. They are gentler, and more sanitary than washcloths, especially for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton pads I have ever used. They are sturdy and travel well. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love the new and improved version of these cotton rounds!  I like that they have a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; side and a &amp;#34;slightly scrubby&amp;#34; side because I can use the scrubby side on my face and nails (nail polish remover) and then use the soft side to take the eye makeup off my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use these at least daily, when I tone my face, and sporadically for other uses like removing nail polish. There is nothing that makes these different or worse than the myriad drugstore brands I would buy except that they have a rough side I don&#x27;t like to use for my face (good for other uses though). I only wish I&#x27;d known about these sooner! The price cut is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Really nice and smooth. They do not come apart and leave cotton strands behind. One side is textured for exfoliation. If you don&#x27;t need the exfoliation, you can pull off that part so both sides are smooth. Great product.</li>
            <li> Cheap, durable, absorbent. That&#x27;s all that we needed to get in there and get it clean. Better priced here than at Costco.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and put a lot efforts on skin care so that cotton pads/rounds are essential to my daily skin care routine. I hate those supermarket ones as they always leave cotton on my face and torn apart very easily. I normally have to go to the stores that sell Japanese cotton rounds as they are known for strong and soft material to stock up (such as MUJI) which is very inconvenient since we dont have a MUJI store down here. I ordered this one just for try, but the result is very good. This one is strong enough to hold my toner (I do put a lot on), and when I rub it on my face it will not leave any cotton on my face. I always use the exfoliating side to apply my toner to clean my face one more time, and since it also soft enough so that I do not need to worry it will damage my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I hate buying these at the store, so was glad to see these at a great price.  Quality is good as well.</li>
            <li> Bought them almost a year ago and I&#x27;m still using them. I love to use them to dry my skin after cleaning. They just feel more hygiene than towels.</li>
            <li> They sell for at least $5 a pack in my neighborhood so to see on Amazon for such an amazing price was delightful. A little upsetting because when I purchased it was $29 now it is $17!!!!</li>
            <li> Great because they have a soft side and a knitted side (which I like the best)...</li>
            <li> These are nice and hold up well. I&#x27;ve used other rounds that easily fall apart or stretch apart when wet. These are soft, but sturdy. These will last a really long time and were a great deal.</li>
            <li> I know some of the other reviews mentioned that the edges were ruff in the bulk purchase but I haven&#x27;t experienced that.  I think these are great.  I use them to remove eye make-up and nail polish and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with shredding.  I will definitely buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable for the quantity. Also, the quality of these cotton rounds is much better than most others available in the market.</li>
            <li> Perfect to use with facial toners.  Much better than cotton balls.  The quality is excellent!  Also excellent value.  Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter really likes them for our face .&lt;br /&gt;They are so soft and smooth for face.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I used a store brand rounds and it would shed like crazy... leaving white cottons on my face...&lt;br /&gt;Annoying.&lt;br /&gt;So I switched to this. Strong, durable and doesn&#x27;t shed. It&#x27;s also thick so it holds toners, primers, milk of magnesia... Love it.</li>
            <li> My niece is constantly stealing mine so I bought this jumbo pack and now there&#x27;s enough for both of us!</li>
            <li> There are no other cotton rounds that compare to this product.  One side is texturized for mild exfoliation and better cleaning, the other side is soft.  They do not fall apart or leave pieces of cotton all over the place.  My husband is able to use them on his face even with light stubble, with no problems.  They are worth every penny.  Shipping was fast and product is excellent!</li>
            <li> These are great for applying astringents and toners, but the edges are kind of sharp! I have to be super careful to keep them flat while I apply products.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and feel of the cotton rounds, and the ability to order them in bulk. One side is a rougher mesh, and the other side is much softer/smoother.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds aren&#x27;t soft at all! They&#x27;re actually really rough, even on the softer cotton side and not the webbed side. I usually use these to remove eye makeup with some makeup remover solution, but I can&#x27;t bear to use these on my eyes since they seems to take an entire layer of skin off and leave my eyes raw with pain, so I&#x27;ve had to buy different ones for my eyes and now to get rid of these I only use them to take off nail polish.</li>
            <li> In addition to the quality cotton itself, for me it&#x27;s the gauze on the outer side of these pads is what makes them so good.  If for some reason you occasionally don&#x27;t want the gauze portion, easily remove it and use the cotton pad which is still less likely to lint shred or fall apart than most. The gauze gives it a nice scrubby texture.</li>
            <li> These are not very good.  They are not absorbant, and the layers fall apart easily.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the quality. I wish one side was a little textured though, both sides are smooth.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find here in Puerto rico and once my wife was able to get a hold of them she has never looked back. Great cotton round that lasts.</li>
            <li> Love these! No lint when cleaning my face or removing nail polish. They are the best cotton pads!</li>
            <li> great product... Very sturdy and strong... Will not leave traces of lent all over your face.. even with a beard</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I thought this product was made in Germany but after received the product I saw it was made Canada. Those cotton rounds are soo much better than the ones sold in drugstores. They didn&#x27;t shed but they are not as soft as I thought they would be. I found the textured side to be a little to rough so I only use the smooth side.</li>
            <li> Manufactured with a rough side and a soft side.  Great for removing dirt and scrubbing skin clean.  Best cotton round I have found on the market</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, and just the product I needed :)</li>
            <li> It is good item. I like this item and I &#x27;m satisfied. I will recommend this item to my friends.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a more cost effective solution for buying these. These are very expensive in the stores. I trusted the reviews and ordered these off Amazon. They work extremely well, they don&#x27;t fall apart when wiping with them, they don&#x27;t feel rough on the skin, and have a good amount of surface area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several years and purchased them at my local Costco. I was disappointed when Costco stopped carrying but very happy to find them on Amazon. As usual, Amazon came through for me.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but they are not as thick as the ones Costco had.  Probably just another company trying to save their profit by making deficient products that are just as expensive it not more expensive : (.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, perfectly packaged, perfect quantity -- what more can I say?</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton rounds I have found after a pretty exhaustive search. I use them, dampened, to remove my eye make up after applying oil and gently loosening the eye makeup. It&#x27;s important that these are soft and that they don&#x27;t shed fibers.</li>
            <li> Who knew there could be such a difference in quality in a basic, everyday product like cotton rounds? I felt kind of silly buying these from Amazon and having them ship an item I could easily pick up at any local store, but the price was good and it&#x27;s nice to stock up on things you know you&#x27;ll need. (I use them everyday to remove makeup and quite frequently to remove nail polish.) With all the great reviews, I figured &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have tried these, I will never go back to buying the store brand at Target again! These are so much softer and more durable, and cost less per piece. There is a textured side, but if you don&#x27;t like it for your purposes, it&#x27;s easy to pull off the little textured piece. Ultimately, these are a great bargain and the most well made, luxurious cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Most other cotton rounds or balls leave threads of cotton on your skin.  I was always having trouble with these fibers around my eyes which I had a hard time removing.  Delon rounds don&#x27;t leave stray fibers or threads.  You&#x27;ll like them, and for me, they last a long time!</li>
            <li> I use cotton pads every day, these are by far the best I have had. There is a different texture on each side that makes them great for a multitude of uses.</li>
            <li> Some of the cotton rounds were poorly made. Had to throw some away.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price! High quality! Exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are great! Because another rounds I used were unpleasant to use for face! Really! Happy that I found it!</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are the best you can get as far as I know; too bad they got dropped as a Costco store item. Buying online is OK, but not as convenient as getting them with other shopping at the local store. Price online was higher, too, lower volume buying drives up the overhead. Thanks for carrying them!</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are perfect for all your needs. Since we have a house full of girls, I buy them in bulk. They are great for nail polish remover and eye make up remover. Very happy with this product as they don&#x27;t leave little bits of cotton on your fingertips and eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Wow, these cotton rounds really are the best.  The outer edges do not shred in use, and even the packaging is convenient.  Contrary to what another review mentioned, the rounds ARE \\&quot;standard\\&quot; size, and fit perfectly into cotton round dispensers and the like.</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever used, and this bulk price is stellar. Goodbye to Swisspers and CVS rounds. I wash my face 2x a day with toner. I use the textured side to scrub a little, and the smooth side is very soft. They hold together really well. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  I finally decided to stop the hit-and-miss of WalMart or CVS or whatever other cotton pads are in- or out of stock.  Bought a 100-pack of Delon+ pads from Amazon.  They were made in Germany, have a star-shape central pattern, soft edges, don&#x27;t fall apart when removing makeup...  So... I decided to buy a larger package.  These are made in Canada, rather than in Germany.  Rather than having soft edges and the star pattern, they have a somewhat rough side and a softer side.  But they shred with any amount of friction.  And yet don&#x27;t feel as soft.  I&#x27;m going to try to return these and buy more of the star pattern.</li>
            <li> AMAZING quality! There is no cotton residue left behind on your face when you use it. This batch will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> The best cotton rounds I have ever used. They don&#x27;t fall apart or produce fuzz that gets in your eyes.  I have been using them for a long time and will continue to.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that one side has an exfoliation portion and the other portion it is smooth. Gives that added bonus when I need that little exfoliation ---- I am obsessed with exfoliating my skin --- and this is kind of like an insurance to make sure I exfoliated every part of my face. I use the smooth size to wipe off my eye makeup and it is gentle. I love the fact that it comes in a huge package. 800ct. twice/three times a day usage.....this will last me a while.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best cotton pads I have ever bought! I always HATED how some cotton pads leave small white cotton pieces on my face and it annoys the poop out of me! But these are amazing! There&#x27;s a soft side and a slightly rougher side to the pad and it doesn&#x27;t leave any traces of those small white puffs on your face when you try to remove make up. I would definitely recommend this product and it&#x27;s great how it&#x27;s in bulk because I use these everyday to remove my make up and to apply toner to my face. When you calculate it out, 1 package is really a decent price and it&#x27;s amazing quality too!</li>
            <li> One side smooth, other rough. Too rough especially around eyes.</li>
            <li> I use cotton rounds three times daily for toner after a morning facial wash, eye makeup removal and toner after an evening facial wash.  I was going through the cheap cotton rounds very quickly.  The other cotton rounds would tear and rip while I was using them leaving cotton strands on my face and eyes.  Hooray for these cotton rounds on Amazon.  Not only did I purchase the LARGE LARGE pack, but these are the best cotton rounds I have ever used.  One side is rougher for after facial washes and the other side is more smooth for eye makeup removal.  The cotton round stays in take and does not rip.  Happy with the product and the price here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cotton rounds for years, because they don&#x27;t shred! I&#x27;m not really sure what else to say other than they are soft, but they don&#x27;t shred!</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised at the number of packs and the quantity of cotton rounds pads in each pack.  Also, they work extremely well for facials and wherever you would like a superior cotton pad that does the job, holds liquids well without dripping and doesn&#x27;t leave fuzz behind.  As these have a layer of cotton sandwiched between two layers of soft gauze, the number of uses is expansive and they are superior to use.  I had never tried these before and now I want nothing less.  Great Buy, too!</li>
            <li> These are great and I prefer them to the CVS brand which is too gauzy and falls apart.  One side is slightly exfoliating which I like.  I use these for toner, eye make up removal and topical acne medication and they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> Best value. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these rounds for years.  Sure, the manufacturing is now done in Canada instead of Germany.  However, they are still light years better than other cotton rounds.  They don&#x27;t shred easily.  My husband uses them several times a day on his face with an astringent.  The lesser pads shred when they contact his heavy beard but the Delon Rounds stay intact.  I first purchased these at Costco many years ago and have purchased them on Amazon every since.  Good value.</li>
            <li> These are VERY good quality, not the ones that leave behind little fuzz and strings.  Great for cleaning off eye make up.  No better bang for your buck out there :)</li>
            <li> On time and came as described!</li>
            <li> These really are a high quality cotton round. I used to use the Kroger brand from Fred Meyer, but they got so thin! And you can tell the quality also was going down hill. I then switched to Safeway brand, but they are expensive! Almost $3.00 for a pack of 70, and again, I notice the quality is going down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price per package of the Delon works out to roughly $3.00 a pack, but you are getting 100 in a pack and the rounds really are thick, soft and don&#x27;t have flakes in them like I would sometimes find in other brands which would cause me to waste a round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love this brand of cotton round, and I will not buy anything else moving foreword.</li>
            <li> Well made product. Does not fall apart when used.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t understand how this product can garner such high scores among so many customers. I purchased based on the rave reviews and was very, very disappointed. I have used several brands of cotton rounds before, purchased from CVS, Target, etc. some are name brand, some store brand. These Delon pads are by far the worst by a large margin. I understand one side is for exfoliating but would expect the other to be soft. In fact both sides feel very rough on my skin. The so-called \\&quot;soft edges\\&quot;, are actually very stiff and scratch my face constantly when I remove makeup. It&#x27;s come to a point that I fear using these pads a little because of the likelihood that I&#x27;ll be hurt. In the dozen times I&#x27;ve used these, they&#x27;ve left red scratch marks on my face a few times.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my rounds didn&#x27;t fall apart as some of the other negative reviews mentioned. The layers stuck to each other fairly well, but that is probably because of the way they pressed the edges, which caused the edges to be sharp and stiff. I did try different techniques and be extra careful. Maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> What a great price!  The quality is just fine - great for eye makeup removal at night.</li>
            <li> Not ideal for skin or nail care. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what I will do with all these cotton rounds...Anyways. Using these things on your face, either the rough or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; part, seems to scratch your skin. For nail care, they are not useful for nail polish removal. I regret purchasing these cotton rounds, and strongly advise that you look elsewhere if you want a quality product.</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton rounds on the market today.  The edges are not stiff and cutting when used near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;A nice full pad with soft roundness on the edges.</li>
            <li> I use Delon Cotton Rounds for facial skin care, specifically cleansing, toning and make-up removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delon Cotton Rounds are the BEST cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever used! They&#x27;re super soft, smooth and DON&#x27;T shred/shed all over my face. They also gave a exfoliating pad on one side which is gentle enough for my acne&#x3D;prone skin. Delon Cotton Rounds have made a huge positive impact on my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I purchased a 800-pack of Delon Cotton Rounds for ~$10 at Costco. Then, I purchased a 800-pack of Delon Cotton Rounds for ~$17 on Amazon. Either way Delon Cotton Rounds are super cost effective -- the quality and price-per-quantity can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using Delon Cotton Rounds for as long as they make them!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for cleaning firearms, specifically a 9mm pistol.  The pads are too thick/large to be pushed though the barrel.  I rip them in half to get them through.</li>
            <li> These are soft and good quality.  One side has a sort of mesh layer on top, I guess to give a little scrub action.  I&#x27;ve had that layer kind of roll up and come off when I used it, but only a couple of times.  Most of the time it was fine.  The cotton pad itself holds up fine and doesn&#x27;t shed or come apart.</li>
            <li> Cotton quality is the best among all the cotton pads I have used!!!</li>
            <li> This cotton round has different texture on each side- a smooth surface on one and a rough surface on the other, so that it&#x27;d always fit to your need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the two textured sides are put together back-to-back very poorly, and they always fall off from each other. So one cotton round splits into two when you take it out of the roll. It&#x27;s not a nice, even split, but rather a split with lots of messy strings between, and impossible to use either of the two sides because it&#x27;s just so thin to use separately and it&#x27;s also impossible to put the two back together at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happens to about half of the cotton rounds in each roll. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, this is not the same as the one selling at costco which was made in Germany. However, quality and value of this made in Canada item are still much better than most cotton rounds you can find at local retail stores. I am satisfied and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Will stick to this ever after!</li>
            <li> No fuzzies stuck on nails when removing polish and the textured side is perfect for applying facial cleanser and toner.  These are exactly what I was looking for as a &amp;#34;lint free&amp;#34; nail polisher remover applicator.</li>
            <li> As the title states.  Work well, but the &#x27;rough&#x27; side of the pad is only a piece of material basically placed on the pad that comes right off.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these for years at Costco but haven&#x27;t been able to find them lately. I travel every weekend and when you carry these they start to shred.  Not as good as those I used to purchase from Costco and not as cost effective.  However, they are better than the items you usually find in the store.</li>
            <li> **textured side is perfect for me: not too rough or too smooth&lt;br /&gt;**textured layer tends to pull away from edges&lt;br /&gt;**soft-side doesn&#x27;t leave cotton fibers on skin&lt;br /&gt;**have not experienced any &amp;#34;scratching&amp;#34; as other have (individual to how used?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though these pads do tend to come apart occasionally, I plan to continue buying them as they have an excellent textured surface.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are great.  I especially love the two different textures on either side, it is really helpful.  I use them for so many things, and they are durable, and soft.  Especially good for eye make up removal, and for kids skin.  Will definitely buy them again!</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds were praised in printed reviews as being &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;.  They fall apart when being used as the layers are NOT connected as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where the negative reviews are coming from. These people must have a face made of sandpaper. I apply astringent every night and was tired of running out of cotton rounds, so I took a chance with such a large order of Delon rounds. The packaging was in one piece, so I knew a flaw in the cotton wouldn&#x27;t come from improperly storing them. After 2 weeks of me and my girlfried using them -- every day -- we have no complaints. They&#x27;re not too abraisive, they don&#x27;t fall apart, and they&#x27;re not too thin. Maybe the folks that claim these rounds fall apart, actually need to use sandpaper.</li>
            <li> Finally, cotton rounds that don&#x27;t shed on your face! I also love the added benefit of one side being textured for exfoliating. The only issue I&#x27;ve noticed is sometimes when getting a round out of the pack the exfoliating texture piece will fall off (it&#x27;s similar to gauze). I don&#x27;t mind since it doesn&#x27;t happen all the time and I don&#x27;t normally use that side (only 1-2 times a week). That is small price to pay for a great cotton round that holds up to makeup removal without falling apart, soaking through, or shedding. I&#x27;ll be buying these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> only pads my wife buys because of the unmatched quality, but dang, who knew cotton pads could be so expensive. if it was up to me, i would buy her the $1 pads at Wal Mart but it&#x27;s not up to me.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say here, it&#x27;s perfect if you want a surplus of cotton rounds! Work exactly as they should.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these locally and each pad was sort of &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; around the edges.  These come apart into two pieces.  Would like to find the old style but these will do in a pinch.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Each round is made up of a few layers of cotton, which tend to seperate. When I pull them out of the package, sometimes I get 1/2 thickness, sometimes I get 1, sometimes I get 1 1/2, etc. They dn&#x27;t stay together very well. But, they don&#x27;t leave lint on my face and they do work well for applying toner. They serve their purpose, but I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are great.  They have the soft side and then the not quite so soft side which is good for scrubbing.  Yep, I will continue to use them!</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are just like any others one may find at their local drugstore. The things that makes me dislike these is that the textured side always crumbles after putting my toner on it. I will not be re ordering this product as wal mart has some just as great and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I use to buy these at Costco and because they no longer stock them, I ordered them from Amazon.  I like them very much.  They&#x27;re soft and easy to use.  I purchased them for my daughter as well.  I would like to see them changed by omitting the rough side--not good for sensitive skin.  They could also be thicker.</li>
            <li> Purchased this large amount because I found myself constantly running out of make up pads.  Then I would pay far more in the supermarket or drug store.  Believe it or not these pads are far superior than the ones sold in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Thicker, softer, and more absorbent.  Needless to say, I am so pleased with these pads.  I use them constantly during the course of the day, from applying astringent after face washing, removing eye makeup and nail polish, I also keep some stashed in my bag for make up emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;Can not be more pleased. Thanks Amazon for yet another awesome product!</li>
            <li> I tried buying a few different brands at local grocery stores over the years and even the ones that were supposed to be more heavy duty kept tearing up on my face, especially over my stubble (I&#x27;m a man).  These work amazing and seem much higher quality than anything else I used.  At first I was upset about having to buy so many, but these will last me forever. One less thing to think about for a long time.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are of equal quality as the ones I use daily.  They are a better price than smaller volumes I purchase locally.  Getting a large volume (800) in one shipment is far more convenient than making multiple purchases every time I run low.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good value in cotton rounds.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality at great price.  I ordered it second time and will order again.  I gave to my kids and they love them too.</li>
            <li> These are pretty rough on one side . I am disappointed and and now have a cabinet full of rounds I&#x27;ll likely never use.</li>
            <li> Love these - when Costco stopped carrying them I just had to find them &amp; Amazon&#x27;s price is comparable to what I was paying at Costco.  Love the quality of these</li>
            <li> good value for a large supply</li>
            <li> I love the special exfoliating side!</li>
            <li> I love it!!! i like how it has two different textures so I could do some exfoliation or be gentler on my face. I tend to use the exfoliation side because I feel it really helped me to get the rest of the oily dead skin cells off. I feel it really depends on what cleanser I use, some cleansers don&#x27;t wash well, and I could see some remaining yellowy and oily debri on the cotton pad. This actually made me realize how important it is to use a cotton pad and toner to get everything off completely. I am happy that I purchased this. I can&#x27;t live without it. I feel my skin is clearer and I don&#x27;t get breakouts as often as before. Maybe it is because I get cleaner face now. lol</li>
            <li> Good quality for the quantity.</li>
            <li> I use cotton rounds for everything and these are one of the few that have minimal lint. For this reason, I like using them for nails and toner application since nothing is left behind.</li>
            <li> I  used to get this from Costco, but they stop to sell it. Good stuff and durable enough for routine cleaning .</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these cotton rounds...thick, sturdy. They don&#x27;t fall apart when I use them to remove nail polish. They hold up to being cut in half as well.</li>
            <li> So many cotton rounds for so cheap! Saving a lot of money compared to going to the store for single packages.</li>
            <li> The rounds are very soft and don&#x27;t shed, but sturdy enough to stand up to taking off mascera and nail polish.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that one side has a little scrubby net on it, too rough for the face.  It&#x27;s easy to peel it off and the round is still usable, but it really is unnecessary. I didn&#x27;t notice it when I selected the product.  That being said, I would probably order them again .</li>
            <li> Thick enough for me. I use it to rub on alcohol and it works good.</li>
            <li> One side of this cotton round is very soft and the other side is mesh. You can choose which side to use with toner or makeup remover. Both sides don&#x27;t shred. That&#x27;s impressive. It saves toner compared with the cotton rounds from drugstore. Definitely I will purchase next time.</li>
            <li> I used to buy cotton rounds at my corner drugstore.  Then I received a message from the company from which I buy a ridiculously expensive facial care regimen, suggesting I purchase their gauze pads to avoid clogging up my extremely expensive face with cotton fibers.  Made sense, until I saw the price.  Eighteen dollars for 50 little pieces of gauze?  Even I&#x27;m not that stupid.  Then I thought, you know, I&#x27;m paying an awful lot of money at the corner drugstore to clog up my face with the cotton fibers, and the search was on.    I found these, and they work pretty well.  On side has a piece of gauze, which keeps the cotton fibers from your face, and also is a little rough, which I like for the slight exfoliation.  The other side is the soft cotton, which is nice to dab your delicate eye area.  And you get about a billion of them in this package.    The only improvement I can think of would be if the cotton and gauze were molded together a little better.  But, for the price, and how well they work, I don&#x27;t think you can find much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and can&#x27;t live without them. They are soft but don&#x27;t fall apart! Some other brands are scratchy on the edges...not this brand!</li>
            <li> These work just fine...they do have two difference sides, one is smooth and one is a little rougher. I use after I shave my face and they hold up well and don&#x27;t leave cotton pieces like other do. Great value pack!</li>
            <li> I still use this everyday, the only problem is that it falls apart easily. The exfoliating side is just a piece of cloth attached to the back of the pad so it&#x27;s easily removable. But hey it gets the job done when I&#x27;m applying witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I usually buy these at Costco &amp; thought they were the same pillow top. However one side is soft &amp; the other is&lt;br /&gt;rough, it gives you a exfoliation all in one.</li>
            <li> second time ordering these- best cotton rounds ever</li>
            <li> Great product, high quality, fast delivery!! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I used these to clean my face and also for tonic usage.  New ones are too thin in material compared to others.</li>
            <li> Very durable and good quality products. She is enjoying it every day and will order more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;She said that this is a lot better quality than the ones in the drug stores at local area.</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton rounds I ever used. They are strong, clean, soft and water absorbed. I would recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> Now the average cotton rounds at a brick and mortar store I see average from $4-$6 per pack of cotton rounds. These packs are normally only 80-100 count packs. This pack by Delon has 800 rounds, that&#x27;s 8 rolls of 100 for just $20. To get this many in store you&#x27;d have to pay $32+ for that many and the quality can vary. The quality of these are amazing, one side is rough for exfoliating and the other is nice and soft. These seem to be very absorbant as well, not so much that you waste product but more so than most rounds. They don&#x27;t seem to shred when used like some cheaper dollar store brands either. Even with a scruffy face after not shaving the rounds still stay intact with the toner on them. I use the exfoliating side a few times a week and the softer side the rest of the time. I have sensitive skin and these a re the best bargain and quality I&#x27;ve found yet in cotton rounds. The only issue is finding a place to put all of them. A must buy for anybody&#x27;s beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Everything came and the cotton is pretty high quality. Two issues though, the textured side has a tendency to fall off and the round can fall apart a lot easier than most. However, that hasn&#x27;t led to me wasting one or anything, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a bit deal.</li>
            <li> Super quality you can&#x27;t get at the local stores.</li>
            <li> These work great for the great price.</li>
            <li> I really like to buy it again after using it up.</li>
            <li> These are very nice quality cotton rounds.  They don&#x27;t leave much lint behind and they don&#x27;t peel apart easily.  Excellent buy for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t tear when you use them.  they are also soft.  i use two everyday so this bulk deal was great for me.  definitely the best cotton pads i have ever used</li>
            <li> Best cotton rounds ever!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my girlfriend says and she ONLY uses Delon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cotton rounds from Walmart and Target where they just start to lint up or break into pieces as soon as you wet them with facial toner and start wiping your face. The Delon 100% cotton rounds definitely blows the Walmart and Target brands out of the water. I go through them quick, so purchasing a box will last me a while. Each round has two sides with different textures.</li>
            <li> Love these cotton rounds. Great for removing makeup without falling apart.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Fast shipping. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it at Costco anymore, so glad I found it on line,&lt;br /&gt;x x x x x x</li>
            <li> These are quality cotton rounds and my second order of them.  will order them again and again. The price is right.</li>
            <li> i will probably use these up, but the rough side is like frigging sandpaper and the edges are kinda sharpish. They are absorbent and don&#x27;t leave any &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; behind, so they aren&#x27;t so bad. But there are better products out there...</li>
            <li> Great cotton rounds at a good price.  I use them to remove eye makeup and for applying toner after cleansing.  Also use them to remove nail polish.</li>
            <li> These pads are great. They&#x27;re much better than the store brands or swisspers in that they don&#x27;t fall apart and they don&#x27;t leave lint all over the place.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I use it with face wash every single day and it does a good job of cleaning . I hope they keep selling this product in Amazon.com forever  ha ha</li>
            <li> These are a great quality and deal for the price.  Service is good.  Definitely will reorder again when my current order is out.</li>
            <li> i bought these a while ago now- and still have barely put a dent into my supply of them.  I use them for applying a liquid foundation.  I do peel off the scrub side first when I use them for this, but that&#x27;s extremely simple- some of the scrub grids are coming of on their own.  The scrub side can be useful as well- for removing makeup and such.  So basically, I like that it has the scrub side, and that it is extremely easy to remove.  These are one and done type cotton rounds- I use them once, and toss them.</li>
            <li> We used to buy these at Costco until they stopped carrying them; and now, we understand why.&lt;br /&gt;The rounds still work alright; however, they are made up of 2 soft sides instead of one soft and one textured side.&lt;br /&gt;It probably saves them money to make it that way, but it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the original ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of cotton rounds/squares, and this is my favorite! It has two sides, one soft and slight textured. Both sides work great! If you don&#x27;t like the textured side, just peel it off (easily) and viola! The rounds are so soft and it don&#x27;t shred lint, also the thickness is decent to absorb whatever you put on there. I&#x27;d never thought of getting them on Amazon until I got tired of getting small amount of cheap quality pads from the grocery/drug store. I decided to buy Delon in bulk and hope it&#x27;s decent, and I am glad i did that. I am so happy I don&#x27;t need to worry about running out of them anytime soon, which give me peace of mind.</li>
            <li> First of all, perhaps I was not paying attention when I purchased, but 800??? Excellent for the price. They have a smooth side and what you would consider a &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; side, but it&#x27;s not rough just different texture for harder to remove make-up I guess. I love them so far. Very absorbent. Soft around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The ones I used to get at Costco is more padded and softer.  I hope Costco will have it in stock again.</li>
            <li> I really like these cotton pads. To be honest, the best cotton pads I&#x27;ve bought were in Korea, but since I&#x27;ve been back in the States I could only find generic ones at the supermarket that were so weak and flaked so easily, leaving bits of cotton on your face. Not these - these have an extra layer that seems to be woven or something. Great for when you need to remove makeup (I&#x27;m a guy so I use it to remove a certain type of sunblock for my face). Of course, the other side has the soft cotton, if that&#x27;s what you prefer.</li>
            <li> Good product. Do not contain aloe fortunately.</li>
            <li> These Delon 100% Cotton Rounds are simply the best you can buy. They do not leave bits of fuzz on your mug, hold together under considerable stress, and are perfect for removing a lady&#x27;s eye shadow, since she needn&#x27;t be concerned about nasty bits of cotton floating around her eyeballs. In fact, Delon cotton pads are so well put-together that endless uses for them crop up around our place. For one, my more delicate tools benefit from careful cleaning with these reliable rounds, and my wife uses the things to apply paint and occasionally to remove it. Delon Cotton Rounds are now an essential component of our home maintenance kit.</li>
            <li> love these.....  Yes there are a lot in this package.  I give to my daughter to use on her three month old baby&#x27;s face as well as her own... These are soft and gentle one side and the other is great for exfoliating even for dry skin on my granddaughters face!</li>
            <li> I have repurchased these many times from Costco and have now purchased thru Amazon since I no longer can find them at Costco. They work well at removing eye make, don&#x27;t shed and are inexpensive. I will continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> I am used to using Delon cotton rounds. But they sent me a different product. These are made in Canada, not Germany. Edge is not soft at all. You can even scratch your skin with it if you are not careful enough. The package doesn&#x27;t say anything about aloe and vitamins as mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> I use the soft side for applying toner daily. The exfoliating side is great for removing makeup. I haven&#x27;t had it flake off or anything, which is great because so many other cotton rounds I tried would leave cotton all over my face.</li>
            <li> I did not realize i was getting so many. I think this will last me though the next year or so. Great price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> We have been ordering these cotton pads for years now.  They are great quality and very soft.  Like the other reviewer said, &amp;#34;NO SHREDDING&amp;#34;.  The cotton hold up together very well and get the job done.  The best part is low cost for highest quality and quantity.</li>
            <li> For the amount I get this is better priced than any thing cheap I can get at Walmart. The quality is premium and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Totally met my expectations! Great price and great product considering I can no longer but it at BJs or Costco.</li>
            <li> INFERIOR QUALITY: cotton rounds fall apart, layer by layer; top, textured layer is cut too small from edge material.  The same product purchased from Costco did not have this problem!&lt;br /&gt;COST: get it at Costco for literally half their price</li>
            <li> No cotton left behind! As long as you aren&#x27;t using it sopping wet, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps remove all my makeup easily. Great when used with toners</li>
            <li> good quality, but a little thicker than I thought. could be used for a long while. good for this price</li>
            <li> Save a trip to the store by buying in bulk.  Don&#x27;t fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> The are the best cotton pads, as they do not fall apart and do not leave fuzz. I have used this brand for years, but these are even better than the older version that I have been using.</li>
            <li> The cotton rounds are thick and do the come apart. These are great for cosmetic uses such as applying toner.</li>
            <li> a bit rough on the eyes</li>
            <li> Good quality.... It is what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> One side is textured and feels like fine gauze to lift the dirt out and the other side is super soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use cotton rounds every single day to remove my eye makeup and when my daughter is around she is also using them for makeup and nail polish.  These were really good quality!</li>
            <li> These are the good ones. They just are so pricey!&lt;br /&gt;I would order again though. It&#x27;s easy to buy quantity.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are the best in quality that I&#x27;ve come across so far. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave lint on my face, has the perfect thickness to hold my toner, and that there are two different textured sides. When I first started using these rounds, I preferred to use the exfoliating side. However, I found that the top exfoliating layer would come off in mid-use so I had to switch to using the softer, smooth side instead. Other than that, there were no other problems. The price is also very reasonable because one pack at a local pharmacy costs between $2-3.</li>
            <li> These are lasting forever!  Not the highest quality, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pads after reading other reviews. They are a little more costly compared to other brands, but they hold up well and don&#x27;t leave bits of cotton on your skin.  I like the fact that they do come in a quantity, so a one time purchase lasts me up to six months or more. This is something I use on a daily basis and I like the convience of having it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds have a softer side and a more textured sides, both are great.  I use the rounds to remove nail polish and apply toner.</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton rounds I&#x27;ve found.  They don&#x27;t shred like others do, and the more &amp;#34;abrasive&amp;#34; side isn&#x27;t super harsh.  I&#x27;ve now ordered my 2nd huge package of these and hope they continue to carry them (as the quantity seems to last me 1.5-2 years!!).&lt;br /&gt;I use them for the daily application of my toner (part of my cleansing routine) as well as to remove finger and toenail polish.  They are perfect for both of these uses.  I never want to go back to those other ones that shred all over the place.</li>
            <li> Advertised as two sided, but the edges aren&#x27;t sealed so the &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; side detaches (sometimes when taking it out of the package). Aside from that, they do just what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased these at Costco and loved them.  Could not find them anywhere so tried amazon and was happy to find them there.  They are excellent and no more expensive than others that you purchase at CVS or Walgreens.  Definately will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use these for makeup and nail polish removal. They work perfectly fine and I&#x27;m happy to have bought the in bulk.</li>
            <li> I go through lots of cotton rounds so thought I&#x27;d save a little $ with this bulk buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads are built with &#x27;layers&#x27; that come apart easily by the mere act of reaching in the bag to grab one (reminds me of those flaky layered biscuits, honestly).  They don&#x27;t hold up well when loaded up with liquid - say, if you&#x27;re applying toner to your face with it.</li>
            <li> So, at first, I was utterly frustrated by the hard edges these cotton rounds have. The actual pad bit is impressively smooth and non-linty but the edges are coarse. So you have to use it quite carefully. But I was even more annoyed with the exfoliation side. Its like a mesh of hard cotton over a smooth soft surface. That caused me to go through double the amount of pads I wanted to because I could only use one side, the good un-meshed side. That is until a pleasant discovery occurred: the mesh part can be pulled off. I experimented with a few pads to perfect the technique, since the first few tries had me destroying an edge of the pad, or pulling the many layers of cotton apart. However, the secret is surprisingly simple.&lt;br /&gt;  1. Bend the pad a little bit, so the mesh kind of floats away from the soft pad underneath.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Grab the mesh carefully with your thumb and index of the hand not holding the pad.&lt;br /&gt;  3. Pull it clean off.&lt;br /&gt;This greatly increases the utility of these pads. Now I can thoroughly enjoy the high quality the smooth, soft side brings. If you should require exfoliation, you can choose the leave the mesh on (although there are way better ways to exfoliate your face). Removing the mesh also miraculously softens the edge of the round as well. It&#x27;s a true win-win. I greatly recommend these pads as they are versatile and well made. Better than the Up&amp;Up ones I use to use. Very luxurious.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t roll, don&#x27;t shred. They are just what these should be. Not buying other kinds anymore. Plus, this is plenty enough to not have to buy often!</li>
            <li> great price quick delivery</li>
            <li> Cotton rounds can come in handy for a lot of jobs, but I find that for use on the face, these can be too scratchy if one is not careful. There is a rough side and a smooth side, but the edges seem to have a rough seam.</li>
            <li> I really like these cotton rounds!  One side is textured and one is smooth! They do not fall apart easy during use like some cotton rounds do! Will buy these again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I use this and they cleanse my face petty well..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and good for skin toner and remove make-up.</li>
            <li> Love these rounds and have used them for many years.  Buying in bulk gives a great price for each.</li>
            <li> These are a bit hard and not comfortable on my skin.  I prefer a cotton pad that is a bit more fuzzy.  These you could scrub the sink with.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  And if you are only one person, there&#x27;s easily enough for a year!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how many cotton rounds I was getting. Yikes! They will last for a year. These rounds are thin and very fuzzy. They leave little pieces of cotton on my nails, around my eyes, wherever I use them. They fall apart. They aren&#x27;t like one thick round, they&#x27;re like several layers of cotton with thetop layer being flat and the rest being fuzzy and easily torn. They do the job of removing nail polish and eye makeup remover as well as being used for toner and other things but I prefer a sturdier round that doesn&#x27;t leave cotton fibers behind. They are 100% cotton and are very soft though. I probably would not buy these again but will use what I have.</li>
            <li> one side slightly rougher texture, other side soft.  does not seem to pill up with scrubbing.  works great with facial toner, superior to cotton balls, no residual cotton on face</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good price&lt;br /&gt;- Does not shed, like some cotton rounds that leave bits of cotton all over the place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not textured/quilted</li>
            <li> great quality. it has one side smooth and one side not. So you can wipe out the make up and also not scratch your skin</li>
            <li> They are plush and soft but they have an &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; waffle side which causes them to stick to the pad underneath it.  What a mess.</li>
            <li> Try these and you will never use any other cotton &#x27;round&#x27; or &#x27;square&#x27; again.  They are thick and easy to use.  An excellent product, sold in a good quantity.</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton rounds for makeup removal.  They are an everyday staple for me.  They are quality and don&#x27;t break apart or shred easily during use.  Love them!</li>
            <li> It is great product overall, though has space to improve, like the edge would be dispersed when filled with toner. But not influencing the use that much. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> No lint or breakdown.  These are my favorite.</li>
            <li> The pads are strong and a good size. The cotton is soft.  However I cannot rate them highly because the edges where they sealed the layers together is stiff and scratches my skin.  I try to be very careful when using them.&lt;br /&gt;I tried cutting the edges off, but the whole thing came apart.  I wish I had not made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would save a lot of money if I bought it in bulk. It isn&#x27;t worth it. Didn&#x27;t save that much and the back side with the mesh lining comes off if used. So you can only use the smooth side of the pad.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product....have tried others, but I only have to use 1 of these to apply toner on my face and neck and it never falls apart.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember what i paid for this, but it was cheap, maybe less than $8. I use them as a great touch up to apply aftershave lotion lotion and clean any problems area with and astringent cleaner. I love them most because there are woven, so unlike cotton balls, they don&#x27;t friz, flake or fall apart. My guess is they would also be good for a shop environment cleaning tools and such.</li>
            <li> pretty good deal, but the edges of the cotton swabs almost give me papercuts.  So, I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Amazing,,,always wonderful product!!best eye pads around!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  I use them to apply toner on my face.  I use the smooth side.  I love these because they don&#x27;t leave those cotton residues on your face like the ones from Target. I used to hate applying toner because I would never feel clean with all the residues which I had to pick off.  These rounds are perfect.  I gave 1 roll to my Mom and 1 to my sister and they both love it too!</li>
            <li> After getting tired of paying $3 per pack, I took the plunge and ordered a big box.  I use these with eye make-up remover and facial toner.  I&#x27;ve had no issues whatsoever!  If anything, I like them better because they are less &amp;#34;cottony&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t get all the little pieces of fuzz.  GREAT buy!!</li>
            <li> I liked it when it wasn&#x27;t layered.  It was better when the rounds were &amp;#34;sewed&amp;#34; together.  Now the rounds are in opened layers. I feel that it doesn&#x27;t clean off my eye liner off as smoothly and quickly as it did before the change.</li>
            <li> The best pads ever according to my lady, discontinued from Costco</li>
            <li> I will never buy another cotton round other than these.  They are the best and very inexpensive</li>
            <li> These pads have dual sides...one side is fine fine mesh to give a little more scrub but not harsh at all (for nail polish removing, or stubborn eye make up) the other side is soft cotton.  Price is ookkk, prob could find cheaper product, but would BE cheaper quality too, I&#x27;m sure.  They don&#x27;t fall apart or leave little white fluffs on the face.  I like the quantity since I use the, every day.  Nice to know I don&#x27;t have to remember to pick them up at the store. But, I&#x27;m sure Target or some place like that has a generic brand that cost a little less.</li>
            <li> Have always loved these</li>
            <li> Nice but cheaper at Costco</li>
            <li> Love the product but it was substantially cheaper in Costco for the same quantity.</li>
            <li> great price when you add up how much you spend buying these individually at the store, even on sale they are soft cotton and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Have gone through a few orders of these, since finding on Amazon. First found at giant club warehouse, but then they stopped carrying. They are the best quality I&#x27;ve found anywhere &amp; love that one side is rough for exfoliation,while other side is soft. Love for removing makeup &amp; using astringent.</li>
            <li> These are my preferred cotton rounds. Strong, stands up to liquids and scrubbing, and has both smooth and textured sides. My only complaint that sometimes the ones at the bottom of a package get kind of soft and separate-y from its two sides, probably from being smushed around in the plastic.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS ITEM FOR YEARS &amp; WILL CONTINUE TO USE THEM.</li>
            <li> Honestly I thought that people overreacted on cotton rounds but I realized that it&#x27;s really good quality. Unlike costco one, it doesn&#x27;t leave ugly residue on your face and absorb the toner fast. I love it and will keep ordering this.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are perfect for removing eye make-up and nail polish.  Really like the thickness and absorption.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy- you get a lot of rounds for your buck. I actually didn&#x27;t buy them for makeup purposes- I use them to apply diaper cream to my son&#x27;s bottom. They work really great for it! They are a nice thick quality and don&#x27;t fall apart or leave lint.&lt;br /&gt;*decided to edit this: found this exact product at Costco for $10!*</li>
            <li> These are perfect to remove eyeliner makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using this more than 3 years, and quality was great until I got this batch. The edges are not smooth, so it scratches my face every time I used.</li>
            <li> I started using these because Costco carried them. They are really good for applying eye makeup remover or toner. They don&#x27;t come apart for those uses. I also like the size of the round. Some of the drugstore one I have used in the past felt too big and wasteful. These are perfect!</li>
            <li> These rounds are priced well, and more importantly they are of great quality. Any wet cotton round can leave remnants if run over rough enough surfaces (i.e. your beard or head stubble), but these hold up for quite a few swaths when applying toner. If your face is smooth, you&#x27;ll have no problems. The girlfriend loves these things as well.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are so soft and their great! I make my own facial cleansing pads and they hold up well once you let sit. It easily pulls away from eachother.</li>
            <li> These cotton pads have served me so well.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for almost everything from putting toner on my face, polish my nails to even cleaning my make-up accessories,etc.&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave any cotton fiber on my face like other cotton pads that I had used before.</li>
            <li> Great value. Nice product.</li>
