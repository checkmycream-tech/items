            <li>IF YOU LOVE HELLO KITTY</li>
            <li>I MOSTLY LIKE THE DECOR OF THIS HANDBAG.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can make it into a cross-body.</li>
            <li>I placed a cardboard on the bottom in the inside to give it more of a shape and it did work.</li>
            <li>Had &amp;#34;hello Kitty&amp;#34; embroidered in the from ( so cute)</li>
            <li>comments about it :)</li>

            <li>I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality for faux leather.</li>
            <li>For a very affordable price, and since it was on free shipping, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>, as I stated, you get what you pay for and it is a very cute bag and looks exactly like it is pictured.  </li>
            <li>, MY GRANDAUGTHER LOVED IT AND WANTS ONE JUST LIKE IT .</li>
            <li>I think it will be easy to fix it though,</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am so in love with this bag!!!</li>
            <li>inside itself was huge and roomie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my ex who is a huge Hello Kitty fan</li>
            <li>The handles look cheaply sewn on.</li>
            <li>It looks cheap IRL.</li>
            <li>Cheap material</li>
            <li>i will enjoy it</li>
            <li>So I had to make sure that they charged me the right amount</li>
            <li>This pretty well I also really liked my last qeu hopefully good product.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great bag with a great design, a little touch of class if i might say :)</li>
            <li>wait to get a new one &lt;3 thinkin of buying a second</li>
            <li>overall I am super happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s medium sized, comes with a long strap, which I choose not to use, but its a GREAT PURSE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>so this is hello kitty but appropriate for an adult. :)</li>
            <li>Everything is still in excellent condition except for the bottom from normal wear and tear, and two jewels have came loose off the bow on the belt.</li>
            <li>The stitching is lovely, the shimmery gems on the HelloKitty head stayed perfectly and the metal shines, the purse is big enough to fit a whole bunch of girlie items in it without getting too stuffed.</li>
            <li>Great price and received it sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m gonna get the white one too good price.</li>
            <li>It came to me fast and it was cheap!..</li>
            <li>I have to admit that this bag is indeed very cute like the other reviewers have said, but it is also very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>But this one was just right and even came with free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handbag is worth the sale price,not the original price.  </li>
            <li>the purse is cute and I can fit all my things inside the purse but apparently the zipper was made out of cheap material and now I can&#x27;t use the purse.</li>
            <li>When I first looked at this purse, I was very excited to have found a Hello Kitty purse for such a nice price.</li>
            <li>You can definitely get a better one for just $8 more.</li>
            <li>The Hello Kitty bag, overall, is a very cute bag.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with quality of the purse and service from the vendor.  </li>
            <li>I bought this bag out of my love of Hello Kitty and desperation for a new bag after mine broke.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 4 months of waiting, I FINALLY got it and let me tell you, I surely could have done with out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I say get it its worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>ITS SOFT AND ROOMY IN SIDE LOVE</li>
            <li>It was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite purse by far.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I wish could of been better was its a bit flimsy and the material feels a bit cheap</li>
            <li>Took awhile to ship but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>But surprisingly, I got the purse in little over a week and was excited to see it in my town just this morning.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size for me.  </li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS SO VERY REASONABLE TOO.</li>
            <li>The strap is comfy and the right size so it doesn&#x27;t look too much like a messenger bag type, but just right for itself (a satchel, or</li>
            <li>The pendant was cute, but that&#x27;s the only thing.</li>
            <li>really, I think it was worth getting for a birthday and holiday.</li>
            <li>I actually use it more often as a diaper bag.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it arrived before Christmas - has to be shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li>going to use it for the first time today</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not leather that would make it supper.</li>
            <li>I love how it have enough space for my things</li>
            <li>It was also the last one for $20.00, but originally $50.00!</li>
            <li>As with many female asians, I like hello Kitty and this was very affordable for me, compared to the licensed hello kitty products here.</li>
            <li>It goes with pretty much any outfit.</li>
            <li>I dont care for the long strap but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Outside pockets nice and roomy and button shut (great for my iphone.)&lt;br /&gt;Inside had a small zipper, fits my bands for my braces, backup eyeliner, a pen, and a small notepad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>do have to say that I was quite surprised by how quickly it shipped from China -</li>
            <li>Flattened and pushed into a large package envelope.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied becuz my child wanted this for her birthday.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li>My fiancée prefer shoulderbags, which made my choice of choosing this bag much clearer, because a clip-on shoulderstrap comes along.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My only issue I have is that the inside material is cheap and the shoulder strap keeps coming off.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like it was made very well, no problems with it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a big deal for free shipping from China!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of room and seems to be made very well.</li>
            <li>Looks better than what expected in the picture.</li>
            <li>Pleanty of room on the inside and has held up very well.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice white, does not border on a yellow tint or anything like that.</li>
            <li>The bag itself is nice, soft fake leather, and the stitching is nice as well.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to open it but</li>
            <li>I really like my new bag and use it every day.</li>
            <li>Buyer beware and don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;List Price\\&quot; of $85.20 fool you, thinking that this is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>This purse is not what I expected it kinda looks cheap looking</li>
            <li>As another reviewer said, it looks like something you can get at WalMart (actually, some of their HK products are a much higher quality than this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(&amp; a plus is that it is nice for small people or big people because of it&#x27;s size and ways you can carry it).</li>
            <li>I received it and I was blown away by the numbers on the receipt (because there were no other numbers on it, like the amount I was supposed to be charged) and they were quite high.</li>
            <li>but....it&#x27;s a little cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be a little better, especially for</li>
            <li>The purse should have a hard bottom in order to keep most of the stuff in order.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped fast, especially coming from China.</li>
            <li>I ordered it as a Christmas gift in early November.  </li>
            <li>rhinestone metal buckle is a classy girly touch....</li>
            <li>it is super cute but useless!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not very high quality and very well made.  </li>
            <li>It is super roomy without looking bulky and in the way, it is made extremely well!!</li>
            <li>I really love this bag , My only complaint is it comes from a store named &amp;#34;Stanley Store&amp;#34; , It sounds like a usa store , when in fact it comes directly from china and may cause an extra charge .</li>
            <li>For a gift teen is all that it was meet for not for an adult.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast, but the packaging was not good.</li>
            <li>And the only real complaint I could have is the material inside could stand to be a bit more durable.</li>

            <li> I think it will be easy to fix it though,</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am so in love with this bag!!!</li>
            <li> inside itself was huge and roomie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my ex who is a huge Hello Kitty fan</li>
            <li> The handles look cheaply sewn on.</li>
            <li> It looks cheap IRL.</li>
            <li> Cheap material</li>
            <li> i will enjoy it</li>
            <li> So I had to make sure that they charged me the right amount</li>
            <li> This pretty well I also really liked my last qeu hopefully good product.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great bag with a great design, a little touch of class if i might say :)</li>
            <li> wait to get a new one &lt;3 thinkin of buying a second</li>
            <li> overall I am super happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s medium sized, comes with a long strap, which I choose not to use, but its a GREAT PURSE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> so this is hello kitty but appropriate for an adult. :)</li>
            <li> Everything is still in excellent condition except for the bottom from normal wear and tear, and two jewels have came loose off the bow on the belt.</li>
            <li> The stitching is lovely, the shimmery gems on the HelloKitty head stayed perfectly and the metal shines, the purse is big enough to fit a whole bunch of girlie items in it without getting too stuffed.</li>
            <li> Great price and received it sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m gonna get the white one too good price.</li>
            <li> It came to me fast and it was cheap!..</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this bag is indeed very cute like the other reviewers have said, but it is also very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> But this one was just right and even came with free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handbag is worth the sale price,not the original price.  </li>
            <li> the purse is cute and I can fit all my things inside the purse but apparently the zipper was made out of cheap material and now I can&#x27;t use the purse.</li>
            <li> When I first looked at this purse, I was very excited to have found a Hello Kitty purse for such a nice price.</li>
            <li> You can definitely get a better one for just $8 more.</li>
            <li> The Hello Kitty bag, overall, is a very cute bag.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with quality of the purse and service from the vendor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this bag out of my love of Hello Kitty and desperation for a new bag after mine broke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 4 months of waiting, I FINALLY got it and let me tell you, I surely could have done with out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I say get it its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> ITS SOFT AND ROOMY IN SIDE LOVE</li>
            <li> It was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite purse by far.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I wish could of been better was its a bit flimsy and the material feels a bit cheap</li>
            <li> Took awhile to ship but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> But surprisingly, I got the purse in little over a week and was excited to see it in my town just this morning.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size for me.  </li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS SO VERY REASONABLE TOO.</li>
            <li> The strap is comfy and the right size so it doesn&#x27;t look too much like a messenger bag type, but just right for itself (a satchel, or</li>
            <li> The pendant was cute, but that&#x27;s the only thing.</li>
            <li> really, I think it was worth getting for a birthday and holiday.</li>
            <li> I actually use it more often as a diaper bag.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it arrived before Christmas - has to be shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li> going to use it for the first time today</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not leather that would make it supper.</li>
            <li> I love how it have enough space for my things</li>
            <li> It was also the last one for $20.00, but originally $50.00!</li>
            <li> As with many female asians, I like hello Kitty and this was very affordable for me, compared to the licensed hello kitty products here.</li>
            <li> It goes with pretty much any outfit.</li>
            <li> I dont care for the long strap but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Outside pockets nice and roomy and button shut (great for my iphone.)&lt;br /&gt;Inside had a small zipper, fits my bands for my braces, backup eyeliner, a pen, and a small notepad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do have to say that I was quite surprised by how quickly it shipped from China -</li>
            <li> Flattened and pushed into a large package envelope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissatisfied becuz my child wanted this for her birthday.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li> My fiancée prefer shoulderbags, which made my choice of choosing this bag much clearer, because a clip-on shoulderstrap comes along.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> My only issue I have is that the inside material is cheap and the shoulder strap keeps coming off.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like it was made very well, no problems with it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a big deal for free shipping from China!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of room and seems to be made very well.</li>
            <li> Looks better than what expected in the picture.</li>
            <li> Pleanty of room on the inside and has held up very well.</li>
            <li> The color is a nice white, does not border on a yellow tint or anything like that.</li>
            <li> The bag itself is nice, soft fake leather, and the stitching is nice as well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to open it but</li>
            <li> I really like my new bag and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware and don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;List Price\\&quot; of $85.20 fool you, thinking that this is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> This purse is not what I expected it kinda looks cheap looking</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, it looks like something you can get at WalMart (actually, some of their HK products are a much higher quality than this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (&amp; a plus is that it is nice for small people or big people because of it&#x27;s size and ways you can carry it).</li>
            <li> I received it and I was blown away by the numbers on the receipt (because there were no other numbers on it, like the amount I was supposed to be charged) and they were quite high.</li>
            <li> but....it&#x27;s a little cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a little better, especially for</li>
            <li> The purse should have a hard bottom in order to keep most of the stuff in order.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped fast, especially coming from China.</li>
            <li> I ordered it as a Christmas gift in early November.  </li>
            <li> rhinestone metal buckle is a classy girly touch....</li>
            <li> it is super cute but useless!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not very high quality and very well made.  </li>
            <li> It is super roomy without looking bulky and in the way, it is made extremely well!!</li>
            <li> I really love this bag , My only complaint is it comes from a store named &amp;#34;Stanley Store&amp;#34; , It sounds like a usa store , when in fact it comes directly from china and may cause an extra charge .</li>
            <li> For a gift teen is all that it was meet for not for an adult.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast, but the packaging was not good.</li>
            <li> And the only real complaint I could have is the material inside could stand to be a bit more durable.</li>
            <li> I do like the long or short ways I can wear it wish I was not pulling treads all the time</li>
            <li> I will see how long this purse will last</li>
            <li> It did not take long to gets this purse.</li>
            <li> Hopefully a long time from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The List Price of $82.50 was marked down to a \\&quot;Price\\&quot; of $42.00 and that was makred down to a \\&quot;Sale\\&quot; price of $19.49 - \\&quot;Your Savings\\&quot; of $65.71 (77%).  </li>
            <li> Most HK purses are very expensive, and not what I would spend on a purse.</li>
            <li> I got the bag in white as they told me they didn&#x27;t have one in black.</li>
            <li> if it can&#x27;t handle a little weight it should be smaller.</li>
            <li> I have only one little problem with this bag: the inside material is of an off-brand version of Hello Kitty.</li>
            <li> This did not really help.</li>
            <li> The Hello Kitty metal part on the zipper has fallen off, but it was expected.</li>
            <li> it meet my everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> My purse did come from China, and I had an expected date of well over a month before delivery.</li>
            <li> The granddaughter loves this purse and it is handling her rough treatment</li>
            <li> but I put cardboard covered with pink fabric at the bottom of the purse.</li>
            <li> She has other hello Kitty bags</li>
            <li> This was hardly a problem for me because I just hooked it back on myself with some persistence (the charm is hollow so it can be looped through the ring anywhere).</li>
            <li> Kitty hollow face is CARD BOARD!!</li>
            <li> less than three months afer purchase</li>
            <li> I had a little problem wth the zipper</li>
            <li> I guess I will just give it away to one of my little sisters</li>
            <li> this was a waste of money</li>
            <li> The only problem I had, was the zipper charm had broken off at some point of delivery.</li>
            <li> and I use this thang everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the first thing that scared me were the few bad reviews I saw, and I thought twice about it because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> they even sent a note along with the bag thanking me for my order and what to do to contact them if I&#x27;m not pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> On the negative... i unfortunately have to put a minus on the quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was nervouse because of the couple bad reviews such as the hello kitty face was cardboard etc.</li>
            <li> The outer portion of this is ok fake leather but the inside is so cheezy and noisy thin plastic lining awful.</li>
            <li> the review claiming that the HK face on the front of the purse is cardboard is totally false.</li>
            <li> , the handles are twisted and the bag is flimsy/floppy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this purse for a friend because she id obsessed with hello kitty!</li>
            <li> And besides the bad packaging, it wreaked of a foul chemical smell that made my nose burn.</li>
            <li> Bad quality is already falling apart.</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This bag is horrible....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item was delivered three weeks before time and we were on vacation. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied becuz my child wanted this for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Great bag just as described. I have no complaints at all. It&#x27;s an beautiful bag and it&#x27;s very sturdy. It should lasts years to come.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware and don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;List Price\\&quot; of $85.20 fool you, thinking that this is a high quality product.  The List Price of $82.50 was marked down to a \\&quot;Price\\&quot; of $42.00 and that was makred down to a \\&quot;Sale\\&quot; price of $19.49 - \\&quot;Your Savings\\&quot; of $65.71 (77%).  I couldn&#x27;t possibly see how anyone would pay $82.50 for this or even $42.00!  You do get what you pay for.  I have to admit that this bag is indeed very cute like the other reviewers have said, but it is also very cheaply made.  As one reviewer stated, you can hear the crinkly paper between the inside lining and the bag.  And as another reviewer said, it does help to have a cardboard inside at the bottom to help shape the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I would even consider this material to be faux leather.  I&#x27;ve seen this material before and it eventually will peel, like a lizard shedding it&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as I stated, you get what you pay for and it is a very cute bag and looks exactly like it is pictured.  It&#x27;s just not very high quality and very well made.  As another reviewer said, it looks like something you can get at WalMart (actually, some of their HK products are a much higher quality than this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that I was quite surprised by how quickly it shipped from China - I got it about a week after ordering it.  Interesting timeframe considering it shipped from China.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast, but the packaging was not good. When I opened it up the purse was folded and wrinkled. So I figured I would put some items in it to try and get the wrinkles out. This did not really help. And besides the bad packaging, it wreaked of a foul chemical smell that made my nose burn. I tried airing it out but it still wreaks of that smell. The handles look cheaply sewn on. The pendant was cute, but that&#x27;s the only thing. I was expecting it to be a little better, especially for $27.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about getting it I would say save your money. You can definitely get a better one for just $8 more. The official Sanrio Hello Kitty embossed purses are much better quality and hold their shape.</li>
            <li> less than three months afer purchase it fell apart. if it can&#x27;t handle a little weight it should be smaller. it is super cute but useless!</li>
            <li> I had a little problem wth the zipper but they got back with me with a quickness and resolve the problem. It makes a beautiful gift for those who love hello kitty good quality</li>
            <li> This purse is not what I expected it kinda looks cheap looking I guess I will just give it away to one of my little sisters this was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I got the bag in white as they told me they didn&#x27;t have one in black. It came but it felt like it took forever. I received it and I was blown away by the numbers on the receipt (because there were no other numbers on it, like the amount I was supposed to be charged) and they were quite high. So I had to make sure that they charged me the right amount and they did.  The Hello Kitty bag, overall, is a very cute bag. It amazed some people at how big it was inside and it leaves quite a bit of room in there. The strap is comfy and the right size so it doesn&#x27;t look too much like a messenger bag type, but just right for itself (a satchel, or however you call it)(&amp; a plus is that it is nice for small people or big people because of it&#x27;s size and ways you can carry it). The color is a nice white, does not border on a yellow tint or anything like that. It&#x27;s just a really nice color that doesn&#x27;t seem to fade.    You get what you see, so really, I think it was worth getting for a birthday and holiday.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, loved it! The person I bought it for, loved it as well.The stitching is lovely, the shimmery gems on the HelloKitty head stayed perfectly and the metal shines, the purse is big enough to fit a whole bunch of girlie items in it without getting too stuffed.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great bag with a great design, a little touch of class if i might say :) My fiancée prefer shoulderbags, which made my choice of choosing this bag much clearer, because a clip-on shoulderstrap comes along. On the negative... i unfortunately have to put a minus on the quality. One of the &amp;#34;side-hooks&amp;#34; where you attach the shoulderstrap is about to pop, so we&#x27;ll have to manually patch it back together again :/ Everything else seems to hold, and i hope it&#x27;ll stay like that for atleast a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as stated before, overall, it&#x27;s a great bag with a great design. Recommended for Hello Kitty fans!</li>
            <li> I loved it its really worth its price!!!cant wait to get a new one &lt;3 thinkin of buying a second so if theyvr out of stock i wont wait :)</li>
            <li> It looks cheap IRL. I like the size, it can double as a diaper bag. I actually use it more often as a diaper bag.</li>
            <li> When I got this purse I was so happy with it. Looks just like the pic. I love it so much. I like how it has the pockets on the side my cell phone fits just right. Girls if you like this purse and want to buy it. I say get it its worth the money. It did not take long to gets this purse.</li>
            <li> It was shipped fast, especially coming from China. It was neatly packaged and even had a note which was nice. The bag itself is nice, soft fake leather, and the stitching is nice as well. The Hello Kitty metal part on the zipper has fallen off, but it was expected. It got caught on something. For a very affordable price, and since it was on free shipping, this is a great buy. As with many female asians, I like hello Kitty and this was very affordable for me, compared to the licensed hello kitty products here.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it was everything I hoped it would be! the size is great an it even shipped sooner than it said it would! by a week! they even sent a note along with the bag thanking me for my order and what to do to contact them if I&#x27;m not pleased with my purchase. I really recommended buying because it was a great buy!(:</li>
            <li> Yeah, I both this a while back and JUST got it in the mail. After 4 months of waiting, I FINALLY got it and let me tell you, I surely could have done with out! The&lt;br /&gt;Hello Kitty hollow face is CARD BOARD!! The seam to the pocket on the inside was deeply torn, and I also never got the extra strap or a hear back from the seller. I emailed over 5 times about the condition my item came in and never heard back from them. THIS IS A RIP OFF DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Ordered for a gift for my sister in law who LOVES hello kitty. Can&#x27;t wait to see her open it! Thanks! Great transaction, shipping, and service and price was GREAT! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this bag out of my love of Hello Kitty and desperation for a new bag after mine broke.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived two weeks after I ordered it. Flattened and pushed into a large package envelope. (Was expecting a box for some reason.)&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it out and fluffed it up and got a better look at it I feel in love.&lt;br /&gt;The material felt and looked good and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Outside pockets nice and roomy and button shut (great for my iphone.)&lt;br /&gt;Inside had a small zipper, fits my bands for my braces, backup eyeliner, a pen, and a small notepad.&lt;br /&gt;The inside itself was huge and roomie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this bag almost a year now. Everything is still in excellent condition except for the bottom from normal wear and tear, and two jewels have came loose off the bow on the belt. I&#x27;ll be keeping this bag till the straps rip off. Hopefully a long time from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a gift! I opened to wrap it and it was awesome..I like it and the person who received it loved it! thanks</li>
            <li> I like this bag. My only issue I have is that the inside material is cheap and the shoulder strap keeps coming off. If looking for a purse to use for going out, than this can be it, but everyday use will wear the bag out fast.</li>
            <li> I really love this bag , My only complaint is it comes from a store named &amp;#34;Stanley Store&amp;#34; , It sounds like a usa store , when in fact it comes directly from china and may cause an extra charge .</li>
            <li> Love this Purse very happy with purchase!!! It arrived in two days. And its a nice size. I think I&#x27;m gonna get the white one too good price.</li>
            <li> Love the purse!. It came to me fast and it was cheap!.. It was also the last one for $20.00, but originally $50.00! I would deff. Shop on here again!</li>
            <li> i dont know how i change my feedback?but everything was great!!!thanks much,purse is adorable,will buy again im sure.be well have a great year</li>
            <li> This looks like I got it at walmart.  For a gift teen is all that it was meet for not for an adult.</li>
            <li> I was soo looking forward to this purse. Kinda disappointing. The outer portion of this is ok fake leather but the inside is so cheezy and noisy thin plastic lining awful. It is very disappointing. I guess for the price it&#x27;s not going to be a Gucci but....it&#x27;s a little cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this bag because it looked cute and some of the reviews were good.... This bag is horrible.... Cheap material, the handles are twisted and the bag is flimsy/floppy.</li>
            <li> I have only one little problem with this bag: the inside material is of an off-brand version of Hello Kitty. Almost like they were trying to avoid copyright issues. Other than that, I am so in love with this bag!!! It is super roomy without looking bulky and in the way, it is made extremely well!! It goes with pretty much any outfit. I strongly approve of this product! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My wife is a fan of Kitty, loved the portfolio so buy two models ....&lt;br /&gt;That if you asked me to buy more ....&lt;br /&gt;Great Thanks!!</li>
            <li> The handbag is worth the sale price,not the original price.  I ordered it as a Christmas gift in early November.  After I placed the order, I was informed that it might take up to 2 months to arrive ( after Christmas).  I was very concerned.  Fortunately, it arrived before Christmas - has to be shipped directly from China.</li>

            <li> I dont care for the long strap but that&#x27;s okay. Like the titke says, i have gotten numerous compliments on this bag. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> THIS HANDBAG CAN GO WITH ANY DRESS UP. I MOSTLY LIKE THE DECOR OF THIS HANDBAG. THE PRICE IS SO VERY REASONABLE TOO.</li>
            <li> The wife loved this purse, it was in great condition.  It seemed like it was made very well, no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this purse for a friend because she id obsessed with hello kitty! I ordered it March 30 it arrived April 8 ... Which was great because the estimated deliverey data was set for April 24. Im judging my review based on delivery . My friend has not showed me the purse yet. I hope she loves it.</li>
            <li> This bag is great! I love it! it meet my everything that I expected. It fits everything and I love that I can make it into a cross-body.</li>
            <li> When I first looked at this purse, I was very excited to have found a Hello Kitty purse for such a nice price. Most HK purses are very expensive, and not what I would spend on a purse. But this one was just right and even came with free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the first thing that scared me were the few bad reviews I saw, and I thought twice about it because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money. But after receiving my purse, I can tell you that those reviews are incorrect. My purse did come from China, and I had an expected date of well over a month before delivery. But surprisingly, I got the purse in little over a week and was excited to see it in my town just this morning. That&#x27;s a big deal for free shipping from China!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the review claiming that the HK face on the front of the purse is cardboard is totally false. The face is metal and I will be posting pictures of the purse. The only problem I had, was the zipper charm had broken off at some point of delivery. This was hardly a problem for me because I just hooked it back on myself with some persistence (the charm is hollow so it can be looped through the ring anywhere). And the only real complaint I could have is the material inside could stand to be a bit more durable. It isn&#x27;t the strongest fabric I have ever felt. And I followed a fellow reviewers suggestion and put a cardboard insert I cut out myself to give the bottom of the purse some structure, and allow it to stand upright. But it isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I am super happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to any woman who loves Hello Kitty. It was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The purse should have a hard bottom in order to keep most of the stuff in order.  I placed a cardboard on the bottom in the inside to give it more of a shape and it did work.</li>
            <li> Very cute handbag. wonderfully put together. comes with a longer shoulder strap if you don&#x27;t like the short handles. Had &amp;#34;hello Kitty&amp;#34; embroidered in the from ( so cute)</li>
            <li> Okay, where do I begin!!? The shipment date was like, June 4th and I recieved it on April 15th. I opened the package and totally freaked the F out. Lol :) I love the design, I love the feel, I love the space inside of the purse, and everything about it is awesome!! Thank you so much. Only 20 bucks for the darn thing and I use this thang everyday. Already got 30+ comments about it :) Thank you</li>
            <li> I really like my new bag and use it every day. It is good quality, although the zipper holder thing broke off.I think it will be easy to fix it though,</li>
            <li> The granddaughter loves this purse and it is handling her rough treatment so I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my ex who is a huge Hello Kitty fan and she loves it. It has plenty of room and seems to be made very well.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves hello kitty.she works &amp; wanted to buy herself that purse&lt;br /&gt;she carry it every where she goes</li>
            <li> Bad quality is already falling apart. I do like the long or short ways I can wear it wish I was not pulling treads all the time</li>
            <li> Very spacious and super cute!!! Pretty good quality for faux leather. I&#x27;m very happy with my product!!! It&#x27;s great for me because my daughter and I love hello kitty so this is hello kitty but appropriate for an adult. :)</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite purse by far.  The style and quality of the quited stitching will hold up nicely for a teen-ager.</li>
            <li> great purse looks better in person! its not all shiney which is good for me! going to use it for the first time today</li>
            <li> This bag came in the mail just today ! I was so excited to open it but nervous. I was nervouse because of the couple bad reviews such as the hello kitty face was cardboard etc. Well it wasn&#x27;t ! But for the price it was fair because it is a hello kitty brand. The only thing that I wish could of been better was its a bit flimsy and the material feels a bit cheap but I put cardboard covered with pink fabric at the bottom of the purse. Overall if your a hello kitty fan and you don&#x27;t overstuff your purse it&#x27;s a great buy. I will see how long this purse will last but hey not all purses can last forever .</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price any kitty fan will love especially older girls!!&lt;br /&gt;Pink rhinestone metal buckle is a classy girly touch....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong the purse is cute and I can fit all my things inside the purse but apparently the zipper was made out of cheap material and now I can&#x27;t use the purse. It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I got this bag for my daughter because she is a big Hello Kitty fan and she loved it.She has other hello Kitty bags but she doesnt use them like she uses this one. I am very pleased with this</li>
            <li> Took awhile to ship but was worth the wait. Looks better than what expected in the picture. I am very happy and satisfied with the bag.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter-in-law for her birthday. She just loved it. Pleanty of room on the inside and has held up very well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this purse! It&#x27;s gorgeous! It&#x27;s medium sized, comes with a long strap, which I choose not to use, but its a GREAT PURSE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> I love hello kitty and am really happy with the purse.  Great price and received it sooner than expected.  Item looks as pictured and is bigger than I thought it would be.  Overall, very pleased with quality of the purse and service from the vendor.  Would purchase from again.</li>
