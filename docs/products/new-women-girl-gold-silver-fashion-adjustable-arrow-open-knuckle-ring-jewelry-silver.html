            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this ring!</li>
            <li>I guess if you can handle not bending it, it&#x27;s a really cute and good buy, cheap and cute, but NOT the best quality!</li>
            <li>Ring is cute and danty.</li>
            <li>I work at a hospital and wash or use hand sanitizer constantly and the ring is still holding up perfect!</li>
            <li>Cute but got to the color bronze after 2 days...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many complements and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li>so it was more comfortable and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li>so cute and exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just find something to color it silver again and it will be good as new.</li>
            <li>Well, the ring was SUPER cute.</li>
            <li>I know it was cheap</li>
            <li>Love it so much I bought one for each of my sisters!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>It was totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light and so comfy</li>
            <li>Very nice bends a little but for the most part durable</li>
            <li>But I love it so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this ring pretty much all day every day for a couple weeks now and its holding up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>but I liked it enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li>Super cute, adjustable, and hasn&#x27;t turn my finger strange colors.</li>
            <li>it only took 9 days to arrive its really cute THANKS!</li>
            <li>And this would look better on my finger if it actually came......</li>
            <li>I even received the item pretty fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>Better than i ever would expected.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because I DID read the reviews before I bought it, but I take part in responsibility because I did bend it to adjust it...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for a really durable ring just something to wear with the earrings I bought that are also arrows.</li>
            <li>Very cute, and will be a big hit as favors for a small party.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really simple and pretty, it went untracked</li>
            <li>and it was going to look cheap and not last that long..</li>
            <li>I stretched it a little to be able to put it on my finger because it says &amp;#34;adjustable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>A very cute ring, however it started turning my finger green within a few days and the done coating was completely gone in a week. ...</li>
            <li>Love the thin ban on this ring</li>
            <li>Broke in half on the first day I wore it.</li>
            <li>But when I did, the ring snapped right in half!</li>

            <li> Ring is cute and danty. Been wearing it for over a week. I work at a hospital and wash or use hand sanitizer constantly and the ring is still holding up perfect! Love it so much I bought one for each of my sisters!</li>
            <li> Lasted awhile.. I know it was cheap and it was going to look cheap and not last that long.. I loved it while I had it though.</li>
            <li> Very nice bends a little but for the most part durable</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Better than i ever would expected. Girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Well, the ring was SUPER cute. I had it maybe a little less than 24 hours before I tried adjusting it and it snapped! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because I DID read the reviews before I bought it, but I take part in responsibility because I did bend it to adjust it... oh well. I guess if you can handle not bending it, it&#x27;s a really cute and good buy, cheap and cute, but NOT the best quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I stretched it a little to be able to put it on my finger because it says &amp;#34;adjustable&amp;#34;. But when I did, the ring snapped right in half! Very unhappy and I will not be buying anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I reallllllly like this ring. I had it for 5 days, wearing it daily but taking it off for bed, showers, to wash hands, etc. However on the 4th day, it broke in half! I didn&#x27;t even bend it a lot, like at all. And it just broke. I don&#x27;t recommend this ring.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really simple and pretty, it went untracked so I didn&#x27;t get track info.I ordered it July 14 and it came the 24th.its actually small it only fits on my ring finger and its difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> Very cute, although not the best quality.</li>
            <li> Cute but got to the color bronze after 2 days...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this ring pretty much all day every day for a couple weeks now and its holding up pretty nicely. I&#x27;ve bought rings in the past that have gotten caught on things and bent a little and then end up breaking but I&#x27;ve worn this on my middle finger and even loosened it a tiny tiny amount so it was more comfortable and have not had any problems. I even received the item pretty fast in the mail. The only problem is the silver color didn&#x27;t last very long. Within a day or two of wearing it it started to turn a copper color. It turned my finger green a little too at first. I&#x27;ll probably just find something to color it silver again and it will be good as new. I&#x27;ve gotten many complements and would recommend it to others / will probably buy it for others in the future.</li>
            <li> Super cute, adjustable, and hasn&#x27;t turn my finger strange colors. Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this ring! It fit perfectly as is ( I think I&#x27;m a size 7) so I didn&#x27;t have to adjust it. It&#x27;s super light and so comfy I don&#x27;t even notice I&#x27;m wearing it so it&#x27;s yet to come off, lol! I do however question whether it is actually metal.  But I love it so much I got it in gold too.</li>
            <li> Loved it! It was totally worth the wait! I recommend you get it!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this ring</li>
            <li> Broke the day I got it</li>
            <li> And this would look better on my finger if it actually came...... My rating would have been a five if I had it.</li>
            <li> I wore this ring a few times and within a week of owning it, it broke. I&#x27;m not sure why it broke but I liked it enough to buy it again. this time, I, hoping for the best. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a really durable ring just something to wear with the earrings I bought that are also arrows.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stain finger and it&#x27;s kept its color!</li>
            <li> Love the thin ban on this ring</li>
            <li> It is coated and the silver coating comes off quickly to show a copper colored base</li>
            <li> Fell apart the same day I got it, it broke in half.</li>
