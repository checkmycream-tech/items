            <li>I have no idea why I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally, but delighted to locate it here.  </li>
            <li>Using this product I have the appearance of a full head of hair, that I can style.</li>
            <li>This works great to add body to fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for someone (like myself) who has fine, thin hair.</li>

            <li>It is lightweight, smells good and leaves my hair soft and yet holds the style the whole day.  </li>

            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and they suggested I put it in hot water and see if it made a difference, but they stated they would be mailing be a replacement can.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27; am currently using Nioxin 3 Treatment which I love, but wanted to try this Mousse in addition.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that said that ones hair may fall out at first and to just keep using it, so I did, but it never stopped falling out.</li>
            <li>Gives me much more volume in my hair, works well for covering up that thinnish spot I have at the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>Great -- I have very thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the product but the container is half full and nothing is coming out.  </li>
            <li>Are these schill positive reviews?  </li>
            <li>I tried the hot water idea and it did not help much at all.  </li>
            <li>As long the dispenser works properly, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Not gooey or sticky, leaves my hair soft and full.</li>
            <li>I cannot really give a fair review of this product because I have extremely short hair and after using the Nioxin Shampoo, Scalp Therapy Conditioner, Hair Booster, Scalp Treatment, and Diamox, my hair has a lot of products on it that saturate my short hair all the way to the ends.  </li>
            <li>i needed a foam that help me not to loose more hair</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Product works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>The Treatment System 2 really works.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to give it much body.</li>
            <li>Could not see much difference in it</li>
            <li>It arrived within a reasonable amount of time, but upon opening the package and removing the cap......</li>
            <li>The Nioxin product works very well.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t rub into scalp and don&#x27;t use too much..</li>
            <li>it really gave my hair volume.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the product immediately disappeared when I stuck my head underneath the shower and there appears to be no residue left behind.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work better than other volumizers.</li>
            <li>Picture is of the original Nioxin product, however newer product is made by different location.</li>
            <li>this does a decent job and it is a bit better than other products for finer hair on the market.</li>
            <li>I use to love this product and felt for fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>Many products weigh it down or make my hair feel &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I do find that the foam weighs down my hair somewhat but after using it for awhile and learning how to adjust the amount it is much better.</li>
            <li>I have given up on most mousse type products because they always seem to weigh my hair down and/or make it look oily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>That product was great, this product is useless.</li>
            <li>There are much better products out there for volumizing and thickening hair like Paul Mitchel and Organix just to name a few.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give me the fullness I was looking for but does continue to leave your hair smooth and shiny unlike a lot of other thickening products.</li>
            <li>Good stuff for my thin, old hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, along with several other Nioxin products (which I usually love).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I was  pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I have thick, straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my 50 year old thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Now i have to follow a procedure to get my money back, very userunfriendly.</li>
            <li>You get a natural look, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>this one is a bit higher quality than the big box stores, no greasy or drying residue left  on my hair,, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>The package that came within 3 days of purchase was tightly bubble wrapped and inserted into a nice tight box.  </li>
            <li>Have very fine hair and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>After having children my hair was very healthy, but very thin.</li>
            <li>I used this product in hopes of strengthening and thickening my hair, and it did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 35 year old female who looks almost bald from this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product, BUT the nozzle was broken off when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>Most products leave my hair &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and actually make it worse.</li>
            <li>I will only buy from a reputable salon where they stand behind their products.   </li>
            <li>my thin and fine hair.</li>

            <li> After having children my hair was very healthy, but very thin.</li>
            <li> I used this product in hopes of strengthening and thickening my hair, and it did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old female who looks almost bald from this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product, BUT the nozzle was broken off when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Most products leave my hair &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and actually make it worse.</li>
            <li> I will only buy from a reputable salon where they stand behind their products.   </li>
            <li> my thin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing but make your hair feel greasy and flat.  </li>
            <li> Now, the hair that I have left feels dry and damaged, and even thinner than before.</li>
            <li> I love other Nioxin products, but this one is useless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as firm, I prefer the old recipe.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and fine and with Nioxin &#x27;Bodifying Foam&#x27;</li>
            <li> I tried several other mouse type products, but nothing compared to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years but was having trouble finding it in stores recently.</li>
            <li> This mousse did not live up to its billing.</li>
            <li> The Bodifying Foam does not leave your hair stiff or greasy; it makes hair much easier to manage and you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I think the product has changed as it has been such a let down and does nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> Now, the cap won&#x27;t go back on the can without dispensing half the can.</li>
            <li> but before the can was even remotely empty it was coming out like water</li>
            <li> Delivery was not as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin before, but this item did not perform as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and this gives me the fluff I need.  </li>
            <li> that any other mouse I have used.  </li>
            <li> First time to use this product so I am unable to give my opinion at this time.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other volumizing products, but they weighed my hair down and looked greasy.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Nioxin holds my style and my hair is not weighed down.</li>
            <li> Makes styling a lot easier and fuller looking without being weight down.</li>
            <li> This mousse allowed my curl to retain its shape and kept down the frizziness.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair had movement and did not appear to be laden down with styling products.  </li>
            <li> This results in a weaker and less favorable product.</li>
            <li> others have worked just as well for much less cost.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had received cans of Nioxin with defective dispenses.</li>
            <li> Little body or volume here.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or weigh it down!  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair body without making it sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get stiff, but if you want some crunch to your style this works that way as well.  </li>
            <li> It does not make your hair stiff or sticky or greasey looking.</li>
            <li> I was going to continue to buy from this seller, the same product, 2 at a time since I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else, but I unfortunately had to change my mind.</li>
            <li> Considering the costand the small container vs the usefulness of it, I&#x27;m not sure I will reorder this item.  </li>
            <li> This product is hard to find and at this price.  </li>
            <li> At least I did not have to throw it away....</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> A little difficult to dispense mousse without a nozzle.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair that won&#x27;t hold a style.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> A disappointment from a usually reliable brand.</li>
            <li> Not Good!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, trying to get the cap to dispense what a hassle.  </li>
            <li> I like it too, but I think is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I am unable to sense the pro-thick technology and see no difference between the foam with or without the pro-thick technology.</li>
            <li> and it felt dirty.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It has been very difficult for me to find it in any store or salon.  </li>
            <li> Very mediocre.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in Beautogen, because I did not receive the product</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was very  disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product made my already thinning hair terribly damaged.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love how it fluffs my hair</li>
            <li> Excellent product...my hairdresser recommended it to me...and it works!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product. It is not heavy. It is light and adds fullness to my hair. I also use a spray gel and have no problems mixing products. I have been using this product for almost a year and love the results. Also, I color my hair  and it does not affect the color process in my hair.</li>
            <li> works fine.  Unfortunately, trying to get the cap to dispense what a hassle.  Now, the cap won&#x27;t go back on the can without dispensing half the can.</li>
            <li> The package that came within 3 days of purchase was tightly bubble wrapped and inserted into a nice tight box.  Sometimes those cans can burst, but with the added layers of bubble wrap the Mousse was fine!  I am encouraged to use this seller again!  BRAVO!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make any difference in my hair. i was very disappointed in this product. i would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Lifts from the roots, and gives body</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find and at this price.  I would definetly order from this vendor again.  Very fast shipping. I would recommend this product and vendor to everyone.</li>
            <li> This just wasn&#x27;t the type of product I was looking for I guess. It didn&#x27;t give me the fullness I was looking for but does continue to leave your hair smooth and shiny unlike a lot of other thickening products.</li>
            <li> This company went out of their way to correct my compliant and not charge me for extra products sent by mistake!  Great customer service and prompt correction of problems means a lot to the buyer!   Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product continuously arrives with a cracked nozzle. The replacement products also arrive the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I love it. It does not weigh my hair down. It gives it body. It has a good smell. What more can I ask.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for someone (like myself) who has fine, thin hair. Most products leave my hair &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and actually make it worse. Nioxin holds my style and my hair is not weighed down. I love it!</li>
            <li> Product works very well for me.  I have fine hair and it holds and gives volume without damage and stickiness.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and really love this product - it adds volume and is easy to work with - not sticky</li>
            <li> I love other Nioxin products, but this one is useless.  The Treatment System 2 really works.  I like the Garnier Fructis Fiber Gum so much better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to give it much body.</li>
            <li> This works great to add body to fine, limp hair.  I cannot be without it.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my hair, no thickness and it felt dirty.  Gave it to a friend. At least I did not have to throw it away....</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this mousse makes my hair easy to manage and keeps it in place which is a real plus for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the product but the container is half full and nothing is coming out.  I could tell packaging was a problem when I started using it.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting mega volume. It doesn&#x27;t work better than other volumizers. I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is one of the best hair products I have found.  The Bodifying Foam does not leave your hair stiff or greasy; it makes hair much easier to manage and you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I received this pronto,thank goodness! I had run out and could not find it locally. Since Nioxin has changed the ingredients It&#x27;s not as firm, I prefer the old recipe.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my 50 year old thinning hair. It feels and looks lovely, and is easily styled.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves hair smelling great and fluffy, doesn&#x27;t add built up in the hair, great for thin long hair.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the way it worked.  Would recommend it if you want more body in your hair.</li>
            <li> Great product works on thin fine hair; it appears and feel thicker. Makes styling a lot easier and fuller looking without being weight down.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product.  It has been very difficult for me to find it in any store or salon.  It was fine at first but before the can was even remotely empty it was coming out like water and I could not use it.  I was going to continue to buy from this seller, the same product, 2 at a time since I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else, but I unfortunately had to change my mind.</li>
            <li> This is terrific! Not gooey or sticky, leaves my hair soft and full. will buy more when i run out. great price too!</li>
            <li> This mousse did not live up to its billing. Very mediocre. A disappointment from a usually reliable brand. Little body or volume here.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally, but delighted to locate it here.  Very good, but as a volumizer and for the scalp.  Clean, light, nice in every way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, along with several other Nioxin products (which I usually love).  I could not get it to come out of the can.  I contacted the company and they suggested I put it in hot water and see if it made a difference, but they stated they would be mailing be a replacement can.  It has never come!  I tried the hot water idea and it did not help much at all.  I still get a watery drizzle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in Beautogen, because I did not receive the product but  the money has been collected already. Now i have to follow a procedure to get my money back, very userunfriendly.</li>
            <li> Very good for my hair</li>
            <li> Thought it would make my hair feel thicker</li>
            <li> I love the product, BUT the nozzle was broken off when it arrived.  Therefore, it was unusable. I was very  disappointed.</li>
            <li> Are these schill positive reviews?  This product does nothing but make your hair feel greasy and flat.  I bought this hoping it would work like their discontinued liquid foam that came in a pump bottle.  That product was great, this product is useless. Hey Nioxin, if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  It gives your hair desired volumen without leaving it sticky.  You get a natural look, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love the product works well</li>
            <li> Picture is of the original Nioxin product, however newer product is made by different location. This results in a weaker and less favorable product. Delivery was not as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin before, but this item did not perform as I expected.  It seems to be \\&quot;watered down\\&quot;.  I will not order another product such as this on line.  I will only buy from a reputable salon where they stand behind their products.   My mistake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; am currently using Nioxin 3 Treatment which I love, but wanted to try this Mousse in addition. I like it too, but I think is too expensive. Hope they will reduce the price so I can continue to buy it. I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years. It gives my hair body without making it sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used various moose products for years.. this one is a bit higher quality than the big box stores, no greasy or drying residue left  on my hair,, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> i needed a foam that help me not to loose more hair and i found an answer in nioxin</li>
            <li> Could not see much difference in it that any other mouse I have used.  Considering the costand the small container vs the usefulness of it, I&#x27;m not sure I will reorder this item.  others have worked just as well for much less cost.</li>
            <li> There are much better products out there for volumizing and thickening hair like Paul Mitchel and Organix just to name a few. This product is expensive and not worth the price.  The only difference I saw in my hair was that is seemed not quite oily but too moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that won&#x27;t hold a style.  Using this product I have the appearance of a full head of hair, that I can style. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> This works as promised. My hair seems thicker and has more body. It seems to &amp;#34;puff up&amp;#34; the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair too soft and no real lift</li>
            <li> Best foam I&#x27;ve ever used!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or weigh it down!  My hairdresser asked me to bring it in so she could try it.  You have a winner here!  I just love Nioxin products.  I&#x27;m 64 and these are the best products I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Great Bodifying foam!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Page Steele</li>
            <li> It adds body but it is not a mouse for holding style</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years but was having trouble finding it in stores recently. I love this mousse!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product from the salon but they quit carrying it because they could no longer get it.  I found out there is a problem with this product, it quit foaming, something inside the can quit working and it just comes out like liquid.  I wish the company would let thier customers know what is going on.  Great product but no communication with loyal customers leaves a sour note.</li>
            <li> I cannot really give a fair review of this product because I have extremely short hair and after using the Nioxin Shampoo, Scalp Therapy Conditioner, Hair Booster, Scalp Treatment, and Diamox, my hair has a lot of products on it that saturate my short hair all the way to the ends.  I just can&#x27;t tell if it works because of this.  I absolutely LOVE all of the Nioxin products and have no doubt for a second that this Bodifying Foam is just as wonderful as all the others.</li>
            <li> The dispenser dispenses the foam quite well. Previously, I had received cans of Nioxin with defective dispenses.I am unable to sense the pro-thick technology and see no difference between the foam with or without the pro-thick technology.As long the dispenser works properly, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I love this Nioxin foam/mousse.  Works great for my thinning hair and will work even better when using the Nioxin shampoo, conditioner and hairspray.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get stiff, but if you want some crunch to your style this works that way as well.  I have thinning hair and this gives me the fluff I need.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Very good. I have used this for quite some time and will not change. I have gone back and tried others but always return.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for my thin, old hair.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.  I have lots of fine, curly hair.  Many products weigh it down or make my hair feel &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  This mousse allowed my curl to retain its shape and kept down the frizziness.  Also, my hair had movement and did not appear to be laden down with styling products.  Best of all, the product immediately disappeared when I stuck my head underneath the shower and there appears to be no residue left behind.  It is my favorite styling tool by far!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after trying to find it locally to no avail.  It arrived within a reasonable amount of time, but upon opening the package and removing the cap......there was NO NOZZLE!!!  Oh! Oh!  A little difficult to dispense mousse without a nozzle.  I had read the reviews and some of them did complain about receiving defective products.  The order sheet had an email address and stated that all emails are are answered within 12 hours. So I snapped a picture of the item and my order form showing name &amp; order number and waited.  After  two days, still no response....then I received an email from the company which apologized and stated a replacement product was already on the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was  pleasantly surprised!  I will definitely order from this company again as they DO value CUSTOMER SERVICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the NIOXIN BODIFYING FOAM is great....very light, holds well, not sticky, and perfect for someone with fine hair!!</li>
            <li> I was using this product for a couple of years and absolutely loved it. They took it off the market saying they were redoing the packaging. Now after a year with being without it, it is finally back. My hair is very thin and fine and with Nioxin &#x27;Bodifying Foam&#x27; it feels like I now have a head of hair. It does not make your hair stiff or sticky or greasey looking. I tried several other mouse type products, but nothing compared to this one. I also use Nioxin shampoo and conditioner #1.</li>
            <li> The nozzle was broken when I received it so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it. I would like my money back.</li>
            <li> I like these products. I do find that the foam weighs down my hair somewhat but after using it for awhile and learning how to adjust the amount it is much better.</li>
            <li> I am trying out all Nixon products to help my fine hair. this does a decent job and it is a bit better than other products for finer hair on the market.</li>
            <li> Just love this product.  Have very fine hair and thin hair.  Seems to give more volume without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt; Would recommend this.  And it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I like all the Nioxin products. They do seem to help&lt;br /&gt;thicken my thin and fine hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin product works very well.  It does not make my hair feel sticky and it has a nice smell.  I probably will buy it again.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and find it does make my hair look and feel fuller.</li>
            <li> Great -- I have very thin, fine hair.  Love this product</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Gives body, but still allows me to brush through my fine hair without breakage.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; and stick together if I get caught in the rain or perspire.</li>
            <li> it works like it said, great value, will buy again</li>
            <li> Another great Nioxin product that is working great for me...have been using since Sept 2012...makes my hair fuller, shiny, and does not make it sticky or heavy.  Don&#x27;t rub into scalp and don&#x27;t use too much..</li>
            <li> First time to use this product so I am unable to give my opinion at this time.</li>
            <li> This product made my already thinning hair terribly damaged. After having children my hair was very healthy, but very thin. I used this product in hopes of strengthening and thickening my hair, and it did the complete opposite. My hair fell out in clumps. I read some reviews that said that ones hair may fall out at first and to just keep using it, so I did, but it never stopped falling out. Now, the hair that I have left feels dry and damaged, and even thinner than before. Save yourself some heartache and stay away from this product. I&#x27;m a 35 year old female who looks almost bald from this product. Stay away.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I have given up on most mousse type products because they always seem to weigh my hair down and/or make it look oily.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that.  Gives me much more volume in my hair, works well for covering up that thinnish spot I have at the back of my head.  It is well worth trying!</li>
            <li> I use to love this product and felt for fine, thin hair it really gave my hair volume. I think the product has changed as it has been such a let down and does nothing for my hair. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I love this foam. I have thick, straight and fine hair. This gives great lift and texture that lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> I use all of the Nioxin products.  This one works by adding some body to my hair and think the system (Nioxin 4) works to thicken my hair.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected-gave my hair a greasy look!  Not Good!</li>
            <li> I have tried the other volumizing products, but they weighed my hair down and looked greasy.  The bodifying foam is great.  It is lightweight, smells good and leaves my hair soft and yet holds the style the whole day.  Much better than the gel and root lifter.</li>
