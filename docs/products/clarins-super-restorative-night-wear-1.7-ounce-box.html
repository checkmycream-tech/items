            <li> I buy most everything I need from Amazon. I must say this has to be the worst vendor I have ever dealt with. I had order a Men’s Cairns Super Restorative Night Wear, for my face. I have paid them $105.00 for the jar of cream. It has been almost three weeks since I have placed the order, I have sent them tree e-mails with not a single response back from the vendor. I have called Amazon, and they told me that they are still in there time frame for delivery which does not make since to me. I am a Prime member and paid for express shipping. In addition they show A UPS tracking information, but no tracking number, It shows UPS label be printed, which has been shown being printed for almost three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use this vendor again. I would not recommend this vendor to anyone, that needs there product ASAP. This transaction has been one nightmare, and I am tired of dealing with it. I JUST WANT MY PRODUCT OR A REFUND!!!!!! PERIOD…………………………………</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002AMUF3I Clarins Super Restorative Night Wear, 1.7-Ounce Box]]    My wife has used Clarins for many years now. Since they are top of the line expensive products, from time to time, she will try others in an effort to save money. However, the results are just not there and usually the cheaper products will cause her skin irritation or rash.     She usually buys her Clarins at Macy&#x27;s and is a careful shopper waiting until there is a special offer to go along w/ her purchase, i.e. handbag, Clarins sample kit, scarf, etc. Following the advice of a friend, for the first time my wife purchased her Clarins online. We were surprised to see the large savings between the store bought price and the online cost. Forget the special gifts and give me the large savings thru Amazon hereafter.    I travel international a lot and usually purchase her Clarins at airport duty free shops. Again the Amazon online prices beat the duty free cost as well.</li>
            <li> The cream is amazing. However, the vendor mailed it without the outer packaging. I wanted to gift it to a relative, but couldn&#x27;t due to the absence of packaging.</li>
            <li> I got my Clarins Super Restorative Night Wear today.  I&#x27;m very impressed, its MUCH less than it is in the department store, $35.00 less! It came in the original Clarins box with other samples.</li>
            <li> Wish it were heavier for night use. I had another Clarins night creme that was. Made the wrong choice. Having said that, i should add that i swair on Clarins products, if you don&#x27;t have them yet. Great mid-priced. They always smell lovely, very delicate for skin. My skin is dry and creams itch easily. This one doesn&#x27;t at all. Silky. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M 50 AND BOUGHT THIS NIGHT CREAM BASED ON AN ONLINE SURVEY. FOR ME IT&#x27;S A BIT TOO GREASY BUT A CLERK AT A CLARINS STORE TOLD ME THAT MY FACE DID NOT NEED THIS CREAM YET. NEVERTHELESS THE TEXTURE IS COMFORTABLE, I&#x27;M STILL USING IT.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy so 5 stars</li>
            <li> My skin looks pink and plumped in the mornings.  I also use the clarins extra firming liquid makeup daily and the UV lotion  if I am to be outdoors a lot.  I am 74 year old and my friends ask me what I use because they think I have awesome skin.  I admit I have good genes but the Clarins does seem to help.  For years I used cosmetics only rarely but as I have gotten older, I found I need a bit of help.  Living in a dry climate caused my pores to enlarge but using the night cream and a good daily liquid makeup has corrected that problem.  I was trying to dry the open pores when what they needed was moisture.  A Clarins facial helped to define what my skin needed and I have used the night cream and the uv protection and the liquid firming makeup for the past 7 years with a very good result. My doctor actually described me as a very young looking 63 a couple of years ago when he wrote a referral to another doctor----love my doc.....and Clarins.</li>
            <li> Clarins Night Wear makes your face so soft and healthy!  My skin loves it and drinks it in quickly making my face look so much younger.</li>
            <li> Great gadget. I particularly like that i get so much power in so small a device. Perfect for travel. I just uaed it on an international trip--never had to charge  the charger.</li>
            <li> Always wonderful. Makes my skin feel plumped and soft.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect.  I have used it for a very long time and would not change.  Gives constant moisture.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Over time, I always get positive comments on condition of my skin. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Best night care on the market!</li>
            <li> I use it along with the day cream as I find they both compliment each other and work well together.</li>
            <li> I tried this product when I got a free sample at Macys when I bought my Clarins facial cleanser. This product makes my face feel sooo soft in the morning and provides the moisture I need at 60. Who wants to look 60 when you don&#x27;t have to! The price savings thru Amazon is amazing, and I also don&#x27;t have to feel guilty for looking better.</li>
            <li> This product in combination with the Clarins Double Serum and Day Cream&lt;br /&gt;is amazing. I have aging skin and nothing I have tried comes close to what&lt;br /&gt;these cream achieve. There were times when the cost bothered me and I&lt;br /&gt;tried other versions. I always regretted  it.</li>
            <li> Great cream it will get the cream with SPF in future.</li>
            <li> Selon ma conjointe, the best!!!!!même qualité qu&#x27;en magasin, à une fraction du prix. Merci merci un cadeau grandement apprécié par celle-ci.</li>
            <li> Just average. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement. The product is claimed to be suitable for all skin types. But it might not be for you if you have oily or oily-combination skin. It feels heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> One of the best cream on the market</li>
    </ol>
