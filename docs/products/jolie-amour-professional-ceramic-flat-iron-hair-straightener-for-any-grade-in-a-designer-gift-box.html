            <li> I found that flat iron here!</li>
            <li> It took too long to heat up and would not hold its temp.</li>
            <li> no burns resulting from this flat iron slipping out of your hand!  </li>
            <li> She has used several Flat Irons in the past but has been unsatisfied until now.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about hair products but I can recognize quality when I see it. I gave this flat iron as a gift to my niece and I&#x27;ve never seen her so thankful before. I could hear her talking with her sister about the new hairstyles they&#x27;ll be able to try out and that she was planning on buying one just like that. I guess I was lucky :). Quality Product.</li>
            <li> This is a well made product.  Bought it for girlfriend and she loves it.  The price was great too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift and she loves it!!  My sister has always had out of control hair and has spent lots of time and money on hair straightners without any really good results.  She has used several Flat Irons in the past but has been unsatisfied until now.  She absolutly loves this one.  She said it is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t get too hot to burn her hair.  She said it is the best gift I have ever gotten her (thanks for that).</li>
            <li> Such a great flat iron! CHI quality, but you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting too hot/burning your hair like I had to with my CHI. 10/10 would definitely recommend to friends, family, any one!</li>
            <li> As a man, I find this as a great gift for any important woman in your life. It came in impressive and professional looking packaging as well!</li>
            <li> I have owned many professional flat irons &amp; this one is one of my favorites. This flat iron leaves my hair super straight! Definitely worth every cent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Cynthia Ramirez</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron for years, and it was time for a new one.  Based on all the reviews I decided to give this one a shot, and have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my girlfriend and she was more than impressed.  The box is super professional and she immediately knew that it was a high quality device.  I believe the last one she owned was a skimped out purchase from Walmart that would constantly have issues on her.  However, she  said that this one has been working well and that it was one of the best gifts that I&#x27;ve ever gotten her!  Sweet!  Disclaimer:  I received this product at a discount in exchange for evaluating and reviewing the product</li>
            <li> My daughter couldn&#x27;t wait to try out this new flat iron!  She has very long, curly &amp; frizzy hair &amp; has tried numerous products and flat irons at a major cost to me.  It had gift quality packaging that was easy to access.  It heated quickly and was easy to grip.....no burns resulting from this flat iron slipping out of your hand!  Able to style larger sections of hair which made it much quicker for my daughter to fix her hair.  She had no frizz and the floating plates let her begin styling at any part of her hair without getting those annoying creases.  This iron is not just for straightening.......it also works well for waves and curling!!! I&#x27;m sure my girls will be fighting over this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome straightener! such high quality for the price. Comes in  fancy box that is gift ready.</li>
            <li> Very well made iron!  Beautifully packaged and works really well.  I am a happy customer.  BTW the packaging is really really nice and would make an excellent gift.</li>
            <li> We have had this flat iron for a few months now, and it works great.  It is easy to hold onto, and it heats up pretty quick.  Everyone wants to use this flat iron over all the others.  Mom has worked in a salon, and she says that she loves it and uses it everyday.  She says it feels nice and sturdy and she loves the temperature control.&lt;br /&gt;this product was received at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This really is the perfect gift. Premium packaging with a fine, luxury-like finish to it - I just got it for my sister and she loved it!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works great.</li>
            <li> The search is over ladies and gentleman! This is by far the best iron I have ever used. Im a big hair salon lover, love the diy hair styles. I curl or straight my hair pretty much every day. (Use tons of hair healing products too)  Had a very good branded iron for over 10 years switched in a blink for this one. Very good plates smooth and gentle with the hair even though it goes up to 450 degrees. Just fantastic!! Feels good in hand,  made from great material easy and comfortable to use, can tell is not cheap unlike most. Give it a try. Wont regret it!!  I was hesitant since i have never hear from this brand. Im so glad I bought it. 5 star big time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Black with 3A/3B type of hair and this product worked like the ones in the salon. Because my hair is typically prone to dryness the plates retained moisture and protected against humidity. Now I only go to the salon to get a trim and the best thing about this product is that it curls too!!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife as a gift and she loves it.  She likes that it works much faster than a curling iron and it has an adjustable temperature settings (unlike most irons).  Also, the Professional Flat Iron doesn&#x27;t pull her hair out nor did it crimp it (whatever that means:)</li>
            <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;Wow.&amp;#34; I bought this for a family member&#x27;s birthday at the request of her mother. The packaging is stunning so you know immediately that the manufacturer takes real pride in the product...and it was nice for me to give a gift of this caliber. Reports back from my sister are that my niece loves, loves, loves it. So I hit a home run!!! Thanks.</li>
            <li> This was a well received gift to my wife, her older iron stop working after about a year. She tried this one yesterday and she was surprised with the quality, the temperature control and the results. Faster than her older one, product comes in a gift box that makes it a great present...</li>
            <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t clamp and pull on hair like most straighteners. Feels very well built. This product is worthy of a purchase at the asking price. Thanks for the opportunity to test this one out at a discount!</li>
            <li> The flat iron came in a very nice presentable box that would be nice to give someone as a gift.  Smaller flat iron that is light weight and works great!</li>
            <li> Really nice flat iron. Purchased for my son&#x27;s girlfriend as a gift. I know she&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter for a gift. She loves it. This Flat Iron is in a class by itself. Total quality and top of the line. Well worth the money. Great gift idea too.</li>
            <li> The wife said this straightener actually does its job and straightens in one pass which she loves</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Professional grade. Well built.  Nice package if you want to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this flat-iron is an amazing product! I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on “high-quality” flat-irons, but for the first time, I’m finally satisfied. My daughter and I have very curly, frizzy/ tangled hair. As a result, most irons fail to completely straighten our hair. Not only does this product completely straighten our hair, it heats very quickly, is easy to grip, and can capture larger sections of my hair. This iron also works great for curling and waves! Not to mention, the packaging is actually high quality, as advertised. This product is safe and very reliable, so drop the other options and purchase it now!</li>
            <li> Thank God I found this straightener ! My hair stylist told me to try this flat iron and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I&#x27;m am an african american female with very kinky hair and a lot of straighteners don&#x27;t work on my hair. But this flat iron is good to have around. I didn&#x27;t have to run the iron over  my hair over and over again like other staighteners.</li>
            <li> Purchased this flat iron for a close friend as a birthday gift.  She told me how much she love it. She has gone through many similar devices but found that this particular one works best. I also love the fact that it comes with lifetime warranty so if anything goes wrong there is that peace of mind. This item also makes a perfect gift item because the packaging are so visually appealing. Its definitely a premium product that looks great and also works great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I am a natural hair stylist and have been looking for a flat iron that is able to straighten natural hair with as iitle heat as possible and still leave the hair with body and shine. I found that flat iron here! I love it and my clients love it as well. I would give 10 stars but amazon only allows 5. I highly suggest this purchase for professionals and home use as well.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  Worked on my frizzy curls.  Great Buy</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and it is amazing! The flat iron smooths my hair perfectly. I would highly recommend this flat iron to anyone with unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I sent this back. It took too long to heat up and would not hold its temp. It might not be bad for someone with short or thin hair.</li>
            <li> Love this-  I got it as a gift and it has replaced my Chi straightener!</li>
            <li> Fantastic flat iron! I&#x27;ve made the switch from Chi because it&#x27;s worth it!  I&#x27;ve always had thick hair that takes a lot of time and effort to straighten and this product has cut my time in half! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Product works great for my wife!  I bought it as a present and she is constantly making remarks about how well it works!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece.  She has very long, thick hair that is frizzy and unruly.  She is just starting to use styling tools and this flat iron has been fantastic for her.  The swivel cord makes it very easy and comfortable for her to use.  She has gotten the hang of it quickly and loves the results.  It makes her hair smooth, manageable, and beautiful!  Excellent results and excellent product!</li>
            <li> JOLIE ARMOUR - PROFESSIONAL FLAT IRON - SALON GRADE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be truthful with you....this is not a product I can use.....you have to have hair for that.  However the reason we purchased the Jolie Armour Flat Iron is for our granddaughter. She is 15 years old (going on 40) and has beautiful hair yet likes to change hair styles often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a surprise gift for her. Preening her hair will take on a new dimension when she gets to use her new Jolia Armour Flat Iron for the first time. I&#x27;m sure her mother will get good use out of it too....if she shares it that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well built and sturdy. There are a lot of less expensive flat irons out there in Hair Preparation Land. However when you feel the weight of this flat iron you will understand the quality that went into the building of this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in market for a flat iron I highly recommend the Jolie Armour - Professional Flat Iron - Salon Grade.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my girlfriend. This has replaces her chi straightener she&#x27;s had for years. She went out after she used it for the first time and got a case. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great and heats up quickly. I have to rate it only 3 stars because there is no way to tell what temperature you are using. The knob has no numbers telling the temperature.  If I want to use 350 degrees there is no way to tell the actual temperature.</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchase this sooner.  Great for fine hair as you can adjust the settings for heat.</li>
            <li> I got this as a 2 year anniversary and she loves it, I would highly recommend to spend the extra money to get a more premium product.</li>
