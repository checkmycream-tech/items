            <li>What a great scent.</li>
            <li>BTW the cologne smells great</li>
            <li>This cologne smells so good that it would make any man attractive.</li>
            <li>All of my sons loved it.</li>
            <li>i smelled it at a kiosk and it really is a great fragrance to wear, the citruses are great in this one and it definately has some spices, florals, woods in order to give a nice warmth which makes it uniquely appealing</li>
            <li>Nice box though.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell, it&#x27;s kind of like a vanilla-citrus sort of blend.</li>
            <li>I love it.....</li>
            <li>It is just OK</li>
            <li>My sons love this product,so at the time I bought it it was for a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Even so I will buy this product again because my sons love it.</li>
            <li>Sexy stuff.</li>
            <li>so I just got some more for him.</li>
            <li>The Sport thallium isn&#x27;t as great because of how long it stays on or the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>but not bad.</li>
            <li>However, Thallium Paris and Black smells great.</li>
            <li>This bottle proves you don&#x27;t have to spend a bundle on cologne to get quality fragrance.</li>
            <li>Oh my this cologne smells soooo good, it&#x27;s sexy and last a long time....</li>
            <li>First saw it at a mall Kiosk for $60.</li>
            <li>The first time we found it was a promotional sale in a store</li>
            <li>this is the perfume that I met my boyfriend in and seven years later I still love it when he wears it</li>
            <li>Smells ok well not really, smells funny.  </li>
            <li>I cannot describe the smell in any way other than sexy.</li>
            <li>I have previously purchased the blue thallium and this one is very similar but even though my bf loved the blue one, he likes this one more.  </li>
            <li>wound recommend this to a younger person, perfect for casual occasions and maybe office work.</li>
            <li>I noticed one of the bottles smelled highly of the product but upon examination the celophane packaging was in tact,so</li>
            <li>Saw it on Amazon for $17 and that is still too high.</li>
            <li>It smells like highly consentrated alcohol.</li>
            <li>sons live abroad</li>
            <li>but this is a little too sweet for me!</li>
            <li>Please be aware that they are the same item.</li>
            <li>This particular cologne is not worth buying.</li>

            <li> This particular cologne is not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Amazon lists two Thallium Sport items a regular and a \\&quot;limited edition\\</li>
            <li> Thallium sport and Thallium sport Limited Edition are the same thing.</li>
            <li> This smells and lasts as long as Dior Homme Spor (sic, and nod to robes08 from YouTube).  </li>
            <li> Definitely not what I expected although I would still classify it as a sporty smell.</li>
            <li> These other reviewers must be faking.</li>
            <li> anyway imagine my ambarresment when one of my sons said that upon opening his gift, his bottle was half empty.</li>
            <li> I figured some other bottles had broken and soaked my items before shipment.  </li>
            <li> Hardly lasts anytime.</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m told</li>
            <li> It is subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a secret santa gift.</li>
            <li> smells great.&lt;br /&gt;not very expensive for immediate use.</li>
            <li> and you do not want to smell bad, so you basically grab this stuff.</li>

            <li> This is an awesome bottle of juice. This bottle proves you don&#x27;t have to spend a bundle on cologne to get quality fragrance.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good that it would make any man attractive. It&#x27;ll instantly turn that frog into a PRINCE.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present for my middle son.  All of my sons loved it. It was delivered on time as stated.</li>
            <li> Oh my this cologne smells soooo good, it&#x27;s sexy and last a long time....I love it.....I will be purchasing the diffent kinds of Thallium....</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased the blue thallium and this one is very similar but even though my bf loved the blue one, he likes this one more.  I cannot describe the smell in any way other than sexy.</li>
            <li> i smelled it at a kiosk and it really is a great fragrance to wear, the citruses are great in this one and it definately has some spices, florals, woods in order to give a nice warmth which makes it uniquely appealing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wound recommend this to a younger person, perfect for casual occasions and maybe office work.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent on me. I get compliments all the time from others, too</li>
            <li> I bought this so i can keep in the car.&lt;br /&gt;works great. smells great.&lt;br /&gt;not very expensive for immediate use.</li>
            <li> i just had to buy 2 of them since even doing that was cheaper than getting it locally  it smells great or at least that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m told</li>
            <li> I have been using Claiborne Sport cologne but this is a little too sweet for me! It is just OK</li>
            <li> My sons love this product,so at the time I bought it it was for a Christmas gift. I ordered two bottles from Amazon.com and they came in the mail on time . I noticed one of the bottles smelled highly of the product but upon examination the celophane packaging was in tact,so I figured some other bottles had broken and soaked my items before shipment.  I wrapped them and gave them to my sons for Christmas.(my sons live abroad so I gave them to my sister to take to them) anyway imagine my ambarresment when one of my sons said that upon opening his gift, his bottle was half empty. How is this possible? This happened I think about two years ago. Even so I will buy this product again because my sons love it.</li>
            <li> Great scent I have received a lot of compliments on this.</li>
            <li> These other reviewers must be faking. This is a crappy cologne. Smells ok well not really, smells funny.  Hardly lasts anytime. First saw it at a mall Kiosk for $60. Way over priced. Saw it on Amazon for $17 and that is still too high. Nice box though.</li>
            <li> This smells and lasts as long as Dior Homme Spor (sic, and nod to robes08 from YouTube).  I got put on to this by YouTube reviewer franknscents.  He said it smells like L&#x27;Humaniste.  I&#x27;ve never smelled that one, but this definitely smells like Dior Homme Sport to me.  Sexy stuff.</li>
            <li> I do not always where cologne,  but when I do it has to be Thallium Sport.</li>
            <li> Smells like a $100 bottle of cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells good ! great price ..</li>
            <li> Smells great. Bought it as a secret santa gift. It is what the kid wore so I just got some more for him. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is basically designed for going to the gym. You know you are going to sweat and you do not want to smell bad, so you basically grab this stuff. It is made stronger by sweating. This is a gym/post gym spray.</li>
            <li> this Thallium is alright, definitely a bigger fan of the Thallium blue. The Sport thallium isn&#x27;t as great because of how long it stays on or the fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong. but not bad.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent and I was so glad to find it again!!! The first time we found it was a promotional sale in a store and when we went back they were out of it.</li>
            <li> What a great scent. It is subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Amazon lists two Thallium Sport items a regular and a \\&quot;limited edition\\&quot; The pictures are even different. Please be aware that they are the same item. Thallium sport and Thallium sport Limited Edition are the same thing. BTW the cologne smells great you should buy it.</li>
            <li> Great product perfect.</li>
            <li> This particular cologne is not worth buying. It smells like highly consentrated alcohol. It&#x27;s a disaster guys do not buy it. However, Thallium Paris and Black smells great.</li>
            <li> this is the perfume that I met my boyfriend in and seven years later I still love it when he wears it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell, it&#x27;s kind of like a vanilla-citrus sort of blend. Definitely not what I expected although I would still classify it as a sporty smell.</li>
