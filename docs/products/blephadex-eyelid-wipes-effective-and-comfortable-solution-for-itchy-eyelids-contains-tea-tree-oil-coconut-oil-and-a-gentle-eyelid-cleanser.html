            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>That was the best decision!</li>
            <li>Customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li>Superior product!  </li>
            <li>As an Amazon Prime member, it is a great value and exceeds my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CJP</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>These are very effective and do not burn at all.  </li>
            <li>I have found it to be a superior product and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Great quality, good price.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel so much better and look great.</li>
            <li>Love the wipes!  </li>
            <li>Love  these wipes!</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels after use but is not as effective (for myself) as the Steri-Lid foaming scrub.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no unpleasant smell or burning eyes, just a soothing pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li>A good wash with these wipes, and allergy eyes are calm.</li>
            <li>Each application seemed to help more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried them.</li>
            <li>/lids more than they already were.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with Blephadex and would recommend this to anyone who is suffering from dry eye and Blepharitis!</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with and have anywhere.</li>
            <li>However this is more affordable if you are just wanting to clean your eyelids.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use and more effective than OcuSoft and Cliradex products.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the Blephadex , the solution in the wipes is not as strong as the Cliradex.</li>
            <li>Walmart has eye scrubs that work fine at a lower price.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>woke up without having to clean the corners of my eyes or having that &amp;#34;glazed over&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>True demodex wipes you leave on</li>
            <li>a suggestion: to AMAZON:  DO NOT CARRY THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to using Claridex which is superior in the relief of my symptoms; demodex mites of the eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>The wipes keep my eyelids from flaking and itching so much, and wearing my contacts is much easier and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>product has been a true success story for me.</li>
            <li>, that was the cause for my condition in the first place!  </li>
            <li>Will continue to use pure tea tea oil (which is cheap compared to this product) and q-tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it would be worth a try as they are cheaper</li>
            <li>It is called an eyelid wipe &amp; has a very large wipe in each package.  </li>
            <li>Glad I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li>and I finally feel better.  </li>
            <li>Have tried so many different things</li>
            <li>I think they could make the wipes half the size and be just as effective.</li>
            <li>They are convenient to carry and very soothing.</li>
            <li>Much gentler than some wipes.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil has a very distinctive smell and these are odorless.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant in buying this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for itchy allergy eye relief!</li>
            <li>Very soothing &amp; the wipes are convenient for travel.</li>
            <li>I have started using Blephadex and my eye&#x27;s (especially the lids) are noticeably more comfortable; less irritated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After my 2nd day of using Blephadex  my eyelid comfort was already noticeably more comfortable, and less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A significant upgrade over its competition, it&#x27;s much larger, seems less soapy and acts more medicated.</li>
            <li>These wipes come out of the package DRY; with No moisture (product) available.</li>
            <li>They are not as harsh as many wipes for your eyes.</li>
            <li>and I found them to be very soothing and better than the Cliradex I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>Sheets dry quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>I find it helps to use a hot face cloth on the eyes for about 5 minutes prior to using the wipes.</li>
            <li>and I have complete relief from Blephadex.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by some family members who found it very helpful and said even their teen children used the wipes  </li>
            <li>I find the wipes to be very soothing, especially during allergy season.  </li>
            <li>Too early to say as I was and still am using Tea Tree Oil Wipes.</li>
            <li>Previously I have tried Cliradex wipes, but didn&#x27;t seem to have much success with relief of the dryness and itchiness which led to continued rubbing.  </li>
            <li>The problem with Blepharitis is that it rarely disappears completely and unfortunately, in my case, this is true.  </li>
            <li>a contact wearer, my eye lids  were always itchy, sensitive, and I was constantly rubbing my eyelids and using drops.</li>
            <li>The other product with tea tree oil burned so much I couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, compared to Cliradex... less expensive and does not sting as much, but also does not seem to work as well.</li>
            <li>I found the wipes to be moist (not dry as reported in some reviews), and convenient to carry with me while working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Blephadex eyelid wipes are soothing, but the wipes are too large, they could be half the size</li>
            <li>I opened the first packed and there was this completely dry piece of fabric with not even the faintest scent of tea tree oil (the active ingredient).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The problem with Blepharitis is that it rarely disappears completely and unfortunately, in my case, this is true.  There is no permanent cure for Blepharitis that I know of but the Blephadex Eyelid Wipes that I have used for several weeks are effective in providing short-term relief from this annoying condition.  I find it helps to use a hot face cloth on the eyes for about 5 minutes prior to using the wipes.</li>
            <li> I did not find the wipes to be dry in my order. They are convenient to carry and very soothing. Recently, I scratched the area just under my eye, and using the wipes calmed the irritation in the area immediately. The wipes keep my eyelids from flaking and itching so much, and wearing my contacts is much easier and more comfortable. I highly recommend these wipes for eye irritation or just to soothe tired eyes.</li>
            <li> I have Blepharitis and noticed immediate relief when using Blephadex. My eyes aren&#x27;t red and swollen anymore and they no longer itch! Glad I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> Love the wipes!  I have itchy crusty red eyes and I have complete relief from Blephadex.  I have tried everything and I finally feel better.  My eyes are no longer dry.  I am very happy with Blephadex and would recommend this to anyone who is suffering from dry eye and Blepharitis!</li>
            <li> Love  these wipes! My eyes feel so much better and look great. Thank you for making them convenient too. Easy to travel with and have anywhere.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Much easier to use and more effective than OcuSoft and Cliradex products.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Walmart has eye scrubs that work fine at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Too little tea tree oil on sheets</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> They are not as harsh as many wipes for your eyes. I have Irish skin and this product works&lt;br /&gt;Better for me and my skin than any other product</li>
            <li> So far so good. Much gentler than some wipes.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by some family members who found it very helpful and said even their teen children used the wipes  I find the wipes to be very soothing, especially during allergy season.  There&#x27;s no unpleasant smell or burning eyes, just a soothing pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Did not like these at all.  These were cheaper than the ones my eye Dr. gave me which are very expensive.  I thought it would be worth a try as they are cheaper but they aren&#x27;t the same quality.  Will not order them again.</li>
            <li> It helped a lot while traveling overseas and in planes. I think they could make the wipes half the size and be just as effective. All other wipes I have used are about half the size. These are pricey and maybe the smaller size could lower the price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.Have tried so many different things</li>
            <li> Superior product!  Added bonus: you can remove your eye makeup with it.</li>
            <li> I am a contact wearer who works nights.  Previously I have tried Cliradex wipes, but didn&#x27;t seem to have much success with relief of the dryness and itchiness which led to continued rubbing.  I have started using Blephadex and my eye&#x27;s (especially the lids) are noticeably more comfortable; less irritated.  I found the wipes to be moist (not dry as reported in some reviews), and convenient to carry with me while working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase Blephadex again. I have found it to be a superior product and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Living in the Ohio Valley during allergy season is not easy. After spending a day outside not much seems to relieve the feeling in my eyes. Until now. A good wash with these wipes, and allergy eyes are calm. Great product!</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Useless. The wipes are completely dried out upon opening the package. Tried adding a few drops of water, but there are no noticeable ingredients on these. Tea tree oil has a very distinctive smell and these are odorless.</li>
            <li> Beware! Not natural- contains the dangerous Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, that was the cause for my condition in the first place!  Doctors actually recommend that patients with Blepharitis stay away from that chemical- then why in the world would they add this ingredient?!</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant in buying this product. But after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. That was the best decision! Now my eyes feel like a million bucks!  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> wipes are dry, not very effective..</li>
            <li> I hesitated before ordering some of these wipes after I read that some people had received wipes that were dry, and hence worthless. I thought that the suppliers had to have corrected this problem; after all nobody would be so stupid as to keep on selling a defective product. Foolish of me. I opened the first packed and there was this completely dry piece of fabric with not even the faintest scent of tea tree oil (the active ingredient). Fool me once, shame on you.</li>
            <li> Blephadex was just what I needed after long battles with my eyelids especially with allergies</li>
            <li> waste if money. Will continue to use pure tea tea oil (which is cheap compared to this product) and q-tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think these wipes do anything. Hard to tell if there is any medication on them.</li>
            <li> They provided only momentary relief</li>
            <li> Sheets dry quite quickly.  Instructions advise every other day use and to rinse off.  However, there is not a reason for the limited use.  I would rather have a daily use application.</li>
            <li> This is not really for demodex mite issue. It is called an eyelid wipe &amp; has a very large wipe in each package.  It requires that you wash your face and eyes after use. It isn&#x27;t a very wet wipe. True demodex wipes you leave on so it kills the mites. However this is more affordable if you are just wanting to clean your eyelids.</li>
            <li> The Blephadex eyelid wipes are soothing, but the wipes are too large, they could be half the size&lt;br /&gt;and it would work just as well. I&#x27;ve used Cliradex which is the brand recommended by the eye doctor&lt;br /&gt;but I do prefer the Blephadex , the solution in the wipes is not as strong as the Cliradex.</li>
            <li> These wipes come out of the package DRY; with No moisture (product) available. They are defective in their packaging, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company in Alabama and they said they were not able to issue a refund because I purchased them through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon. These are expensive and definitely DEFECTIVE in delivering the product.  a suggestion: to AMAZON:  DO NOT CARRY THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to using Claridex which is superior in the relief of my symptoms; demodex mites of the eye lashes.  dj</li>
            <li> I ordered Blephadex eyelid wipes. I have tried both Cliradex and Ocusoft, but both seemed to sting my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;As a contact wearer, my eye lids  were always itchy, sensitive, and I was constantly rubbing my eyelids and using drops. My eyelids were often red and sore because my fingers were always on them. I had considered going back to wearing eyeglasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my 2nd day of using Blephadex  my eyelid comfort was already noticeably more comfortable, and less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up without having to clean the corners of my eyes or having that &amp;#34;glazed over&amp;#34; feeling. Each application seemed to help more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been a true success story for me. No more waking up and dreading putting my fingers near my eyes and wearing contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase Blephadex again. As an Amazon Prime member, it is a great value and exceeds my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CJP</li>
            <li> Soothing and refreshing. Only Bern using it for a week but amazed with the results.  Less watering and allergy irritation.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Blephadex eyelid wipes and I found them to be very soothing and better than the Cliradex I have used in the past.  The relief for my itchy eyes was instant and I had no sensitivity to them.  I highly recommend them for itchy allergy eye relief!</li>
            <li> Nice product, compared to Cliradex... less expensive and does not sting as much, but also does not seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> The towels have almost no moisture and don&#x27;t provide relief.</li>
            <li> Did not work. I used as directed and with cream and face wash. OVERPRICED</li>
            <li> Great quality, good price. We use it to wash my elderly mother-in-law&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels after use but is not as effective (for myself) as the Steri-Lid foaming scrub.</li>
            <li> I purchased one box of Blefadex to try out , but i find it to be  Totally dry!  no wonder my  Ophthalmologist only prescribes cliradex .&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should stop promoting and selling this product.</li>
            <li> A significant upgrade over its competition, it&#x27;s much larger, seems less soapy and acts more medicated. My eyes feel cleaner than after using the other product, and the feeling lasts longer. I&#x27;m glad I tried them. Customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use these as they irritated my eyes/lids more than they already were. Had a second flare up 4 days after using product, none in the 6 weeks since I used them last.</li>
            <li> Very soothing &amp; the wipes are convenient for travel. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> These are very effective and do not burn at all.  The other product with tea tree oil burned so much I couldn&#x27;t use it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Too early to say as I was and still am using Tea Tree Oil Wipes. I used it once, not a fair trial but I did not see any relief. Why must it be washed away after application? When I have used an entire box I will update this review</li>
