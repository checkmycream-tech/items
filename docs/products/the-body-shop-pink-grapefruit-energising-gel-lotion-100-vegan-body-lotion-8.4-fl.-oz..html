            <li>This is great!</li>
            <li>Great aroma - it lasts, too!</li>
            <li>These two together are the perfect sizes for your toiletry bag when travelling.</li>
            <li>smells delightful on my wife</li>
            <li>Love this grapefruit lotion!!!</li>
            <li>Good for summer time !</li>
            <li>The Body Shop does it again for me - it strikes me in my nostrils where I love it!!</li>
            <li>The lotion is great feels good on your skin...</li>
            <li>good.....</li>
            <li>This body lotion is really good, it has a cítric smell</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s a nice lotion</li>
            <li>Smells great, felt like the bottle lasted forever, pump is very useful.  </li>
            <li>The consistency texture of the lotion is EXCELLENT, too, not thick hard-to-spread and not thin-liquidy.</li>
            <li>The Body Shop got this right!!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something light to make you smell good, this is your product.</li>
            <li>Most body lotions seem to leave a coating on my skin but not this lotion.  </li>
            <li>but I do wish it moisturized my skin a bit more.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for the scent as I don&#x27;t use a perfume or body spray.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, leaves a great fresh smell and, most important to me, is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love the strong citrus smell, though depending on my mood it is borderline floor cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The Body Shop Pink Grapefruit body lotion is the best, imo.  </li>
            <li>It is a good summer/ hot weather lotion since it is light and does not leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light clean smell and I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the powerful fragrance of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>it smells more like a real grapefruit,</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t find something I like better than this will be my new replacement.</li>
            <li>It always makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Scent not that great but doesn&#x27;t last long anyway.</li>
            <li>It smells like REAL AROMATIC NATURAL grapefruit without any cheap synthetic or headachey smells.</li>
            <li>the body shop products smell so fresh and natural.</li>
            <li>very grapefruit</li>
            <li>I would say, but very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is a true grapefruit scent and not mixed with anything else like mint or other citrus.</li>
            <li>I ordered Pink Grapefruit but got Pink Grapefruit pamplemousse rose.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t have a long-lasting aroma like other fragrances - the fragrance becomes mild after a while on the skin.</li>
            <li>less sweet</li>
            <li>It is NOT a good winter/ dry climate/ cracked skin kind of lotion.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Only complaint is that the pump head could be longer, as in further away from the sides to pump onto my poof.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a die-hard Pink Grapefruit Bath &amp; Body Works lover, but since it&#x27;s discontinued and I refuse to pay the absurd prices private parties are asking, I decided to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other grapefruit lotions in the past and they have smelled terrible and artificial.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really unhappy about that.</li>

            <li> the body shop products smell so fresh and natural.</li>
            <li> Scent not that great but doesn&#x27;t last long anyway. Probably not worth the money. I&#x27;ll stick with suave.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels sticky, and leaves a film-like layer after drying. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> The Body Shop Pink Grapefruit body lotion is the best, imo.  It goes on smooth, leaves a great fresh smell and, most important to me, is not greasy.  Most body lotions seem to leave a coating on my skin but not this lotion.  I have used this for years and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is great! Smells great, felt like the bottle lasted forever, pump is very useful.  Only complaint is that the pump head could be longer, as in further away from the sides to pump onto my poof.</li>
            <li> good..... very grapefruit......... when i use that i just found i am the grapefruit.... i use it every night...after the shower</li>
            <li> Great aroma - it lasts, too!</li>
            <li> This body lotion is really good, it has a cítric smell And doesn&#x27; t melt your body. Good for summer time !</li>
            <li> Love this grapefruit lotion!!! I also have the grapefruit body wash as well. These two together are the perfect sizes for your toiletry bag when travelling. I love that this is a true grapefruit scent and not mixed with anything else like mint or other citrus. I&#x27;ve tried other grapefruit lotions in the past and they have smelled terrible and artificial.  The Body Shop got this right!!! The lotion moisturizes enough but I do wish it moisturized my skin a bit more. I mostly use it for the scent as I don&#x27;t use a perfume or body spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a die-hard Pink Grapefruit Bath &amp; Body Works lover, but since it&#x27;s discontinued and I refuse to pay the absurd prices private parties are asking, I decided to find a replacement.  (B&amp;B Works loss will be someone else&#x27;s gain because I&#x27;m a lotion freak!)  This lotion doesn&#x27;t smell like B&amp;B Pink Grapefruit ... it smells more like a real grapefruit, less sweet I would say, but very fragrant.  It lacks a deep moisturizing feel, possibly because it doesn&#x27;t have mineral oil.  That said, it&#x27;s a nice lotion and if I don&#x27;t find something I like better than this will be my new replacement.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> The lotion is great feels good on your skin...but I can&#x27;t stand the smell. Does not smell like pink grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I got mine at Marshall&#x27;s for about $4 or $5. The Body Shop does it again for me - it strikes me in my nostrils where I love it!! I LOVE the powerful fragrance of this lotion. It smells like REAL AROMATIC NATURAL grapefruit without any cheap synthetic or headachey smells. However, it doesn&#x27;t have a long-lasting aroma like other fragrances - the fragrance becomes mild after a while on the skin. The consistency texture of the lotion is EXCELLENT, too, not thick hard-to-spread and not thin-liquidy. You have lots of companies that advertise they have Shea Butter on the front of their packages and yet Body Shop doesn&#x27;t even advertise it on this lotion yet it&#x27;s #2 on their ingredients list. And they use grapefruit Fruit Water, as well as grapefruit Seed Oil.  However, there ARE parabens.</li>
            <li> I ordered Pink Grapefruit but got Pink Grapefruit pamplemousse rose. These two items are very different and the one I got smells like paint. I&#x27;m really unhappy about that.</li>
            <li> I use The &#x27;Grapefruit Shower Gel&#x27; and after I dry off I use this lotion. It always makes me feel fresh. It has a very light clean smell and I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> smells delightful on my wife</li>
            <li> I love the strong citrus smell, though depending on my mood it is borderline floor cleanser.  It is a good summer/ hot weather lotion since it is light and does not leave any residue.  It is NOT a good winter/ dry climate/ cracked skin kind of lotion.  It is not particularly moisturizing.  If you are looking for a hand-healer, this is not for you.  If you are looking for something light to make you smell good, this is your product.</li>
