            <li>It gives a nice shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with these cartridges as the best replacement razors that are currently out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>Liked it, this will be my razor of choice going forward.</li>

            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>many shave very smooth</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite shaving blade.</li>
            <li>Makes you use more blades.</li>
            <li>I like these more than women&#x27;s razors</li>
            <li>Love these razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read thousands more &amp; know</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with your product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works like it should, and much better on subscribe and save then the 1 shave club garbage razors.</li>
            <li>3-in-1 (which I also reviewed), and my son said these are very easy and comfortable on his skin, so he loves them.</li>
            <li>As far as working well as a razor I find this to be the best one that is out there right now in being able to give me the closest shave.  </li>
            <li>I love the razor with the vibrating head they fit</li>
            <li>Just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>time is important to you, this blade is the one that delivers the fastest shave.</li>
            <li>, now I get an amazingly smooth with ease.</li>
            <li>Very happy with these blades, and I feel that I get a pretty long use for each.</li>
            <li>There is a simple way to get many shaves from each blade cartridge!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely rate anything 5 starts.</li>
            <li>Clean cut, they don&#x27;t create pimples, smooth cut afterwards.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 4 count refill as I find ordering any more will result in rust setting in before I get through the whole set.  </li>
            <li>Great razors, a  little cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My feeling is 1 cartridge is going to last for a month for my kind of shave.</li>
            <li>I switched to auto-ship right</li>
            <li>THEY are made to wear out fast with special coatings that react to water.</li>
            <li>GOOD。I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I received my first order to verify it</li>
            <li>Yet, my SIMPLE method gets me over a MONTH of top shaves from a Cartridge.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This is the only design flaw I find in this product and it would be good if they could design it so that the cartridge cannot cut you if you accidentally back hand this while shaving</li>
            <li>During that last week, I find that I have to shave over certain areas multiple times, and it&#x27;s still not as good as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Great shave but super expensive.</li>
            <li>I rate these blades 5 stars, even while recognizing they are very over priced by Gillette.</li>
            <li>I am very picky,</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Before my strip was wearing off much faster.</li>
            <li>and it makes shaving much easier</li>
            <li>Gillette works better than any other razor.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, Gillette wants to sell more razors, so maybe they&#x27;re making it so that the blades don&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>shave is close &amp; smooth for up to 5 uses; after that the blade feels rough</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very close shave for the first week, but by the last week of the month, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>And finding the more blades the more little nicks as the blades get fatter for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>When these blades first came out, they would last for weeks.</li>
            <li>This skeptic was surprised at the result!</li>
            <li>When I first started using Gillette Fusion and the ProGlide (not ProGlide Power), the blades would easily last a month.  </li>
            <li>Exceptionally well made blades like these DO NOT wear out as fast as expensive ones seem to do.</li>
            <li>I get packs of 8 for less than $ 20 &amp; free shipping.</li>
            <li>also I really like new COMFORT GUARD, it&#x60;s larger</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and loves this razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve posted many product ratings &amp; reviews over the past several years.</li>
            <li>I saw others mention in their own reviews that these blades weren&#x27;t lasting long and was a bit skeptical about that, but it&#x27;s true...</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because of a general apathy about the price and a bit about the longevity.</li>
            <li>Especially LUBRASTRIP lasts much longer that in previous versions.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Especially LUBRASTRIP lasts much longer that in previous versions.</li>
            <li> My beard is tough and I need a fresh blade every week.</li>
            <li> S***ty blades, don&#x27;t even get a smooth shave 1st time around, and they&#x27;re useless after 3 shaves..</li>
            <li> these razor blades are not lasting as long as the same brand and type of blades I usually buy at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Yes they are expensive but I have liked the 5 blade heads since they came out, very little drag and no cuts.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the single blade on the reverse meant for difficult spots though as I have been cut by the blade when I was shaving too quickly and somehow the cartridge flipped over and the single blade cut me quite deeply on the chin.  </li>
            <li> Performed as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Come to find out that I was only able to attach one of them to the base.  </li>
            <li> the only down side is it has that moisture strip which I think is irritating my sensitive skin when shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on autoship and get these blades shipped to me every month now for the past several months.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t get any other razors.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the other three were broken and would not click into place.</li>
            <li> Hard Shake your razor a few times then, dry the blades (both sides)</li>
            <li> Price for blades that cost so little to make is a rip off.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to them a few years ago.</li>
            <li> From my experience, the quality of the ProGlide Power blades is worse than the prior ProGlide.  </li>
            <li> These are the real thing, which isn&#x27;t really a bad thing.</li>
            <li> It is not my imagination as the blades are going dull after 3-4 shaves and I&#x27;m drying them after use as I always do, in order to prolong the life of the blade.</li>
            <li> One thing though, loses sharpness after 4th shave.</li>
            <li> As I do not have a thick beard, I try to get a month&#x27;s use out of each blade.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but there is no better blade.</li>
            <li> Gave it for stars because it&#x27;s too darn expensive!</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed.</li>

            <li> Expensive, but there is no better blade.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor blade the only down side is it has that moisture strip which I think is irritating my sensitive skin when shaving.</li>
            <li> These are the real thing, which isn&#x27;t really a bad thing. Only 4 stars because of a general apathy about the price and a bit about the longevity. When these blades first came out, they would last for weeks. It seems that the lubricating strip goes away after about 3-5 shaves. Makes you use more blades. The price per cartdrige should be about 50 cents. At that, they would make 75% profit. Summary; If you like the blades, these are one of the best bargains out there. Please prove me wrong-:)</li>
            <li> I saw others mention in their own reviews that these blades weren&#x27;t lasting long and was a bit skeptical about that, but it&#x27;s true...these razor blades are not lasting as long as the same brand and type of blades I usually buy at my local pharmacy. It is not my imagination as the blades are going dull after 3-4 shaves and I&#x27;m drying them after use as I always do, in order to prolong the life of the blade. I have no idea why this is, but it is, and I&#x27;m not buying these blades here again.</li>
            <li> Price for blades that cost so little to make is a rip off. And finding the more blades the more little nicks as the blades get fatter for hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave. Very happy with these blades, and I feel that I get a pretty long use for each.</li>
            <li> GOOD。I like it very much.</li>
            <li> My son loves these razors, way too pricy for me.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Great razors, a  little cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on autoship and get these blades shipped to me every month now for the past several months. I switched to auto-ship right I received my first order to verify it was the same product I was buying in stores. My beard is tough and I need a fresh blade every week. This is well known brand name product I was paying 2-3 times the price I pay here for the same product. I love the razor with the vibrating head they fit and it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far. I bought one for a buddy as a gift and he loved it too. He used it to shave his head and said it was the best. If you&#x27;re looking for convenience and a never-run-out solution, this product is the best!</li>

            <li> Excellent product... excellent value</li>
            <li> This is the best razor on the market and is a must have.</li>
            <li> Started shaving with these blades with no problem</li>

This is the only design flaw I find in this product and it would be good if they could design it so that the cartridge cannot cut you if you accidentally back hand this while shaving quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with these cartridges as the best replacement razors that are currently out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I HATE manual razors but the Fusion Proglide Power Razors are great.  One pass and done.  No irritation. No bumps.  Just smooth skin.  Only downfall is the price.  Ouch!</li>
            <li> always loved these razors. they get the job done. the dorco ones, ehhhh</li>
            <li> Love these razors. Clean cut, they don&#x27;t create pimples, smooth cut afterwards.</li>
            <li> Gillette works better than any other razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted many product ratings &amp; reviews over the past several years. I&#x27;ve read thousands more &amp; know well how useless most are. I very rarely rate anything 5 starts. I rate these blades 5 stars, even while recognizing they are very over priced by Gillette. The Fusion proglide Power system is THE Best! My daughter introduced me to them a few years ago. I laughed at the Power aspect so I did not insert a battery until a month ago. This skeptic was surprised at the result! The power aspect is no joke.    Exceptionally well made blades like these DO NOT wear out as fast as expensive ones seem to do. THEY are made to wear out fast with special coatings that react to water. TIP. There is a simple way to get many shaves from each blade cartridge!! I am very picky, Yet, my SIMPLE method gets me over a MONTH of top shaves from a Cartridge. Hard Shake your razor a few times then, dry the blades (both sides) well by patting on a towell. Rest your razor so the cartridge touches nothing (I use the plastic container the razor came in). Its that simple! Some people use a hair dryer, some use canned air. My method is cheapest and works just as well.    TIP 2 -- You can get them cheaper @ eBay. I get packs of 8 for less than $ 20 &amp; free shipping.</li>
            <li> Excellent razors...provides a close shave.</li>
            <li> really pleasant shave from proglide. I have not used these cartridges yet.. My feeling is 1 cartridge is going to last for a month for my kind of shave.</li>
            <li> Gave it for stars because it&#x27;s too darn expensive!</li>
            <li> Best blade I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I shave every day. Lasts 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great razors. These are the only razors I use. It works great for razor bumps</li>
            <li> Best razor blades and shave on the planet.</li>
            <li> no surprises or let downs here. 4 pack of razor inserts.</li>
            <li> Liked it, this will be my razor of choice going forward.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this blade is like not having a blade in yoour razor.  There is no pulling of my beard or burning after I finish.&lt;br /&gt;If time is important to you, this blade is the one that delivers the fastest shave.</li>
            <li> Loved it.. Great stuff..</li>
            <li> shave is close &amp; smooth for up to 5 uses; after that the blade feels rough</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  I wouldn&#x27;t get any other razors.</li>
            <li> As I do not have a thick beard, I try to get a month&#x27;s use out of each blade.  it&#x27;s a very close shave for the first week, but by the last week of the month, it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  During that last week, I find that I have to shave over certain areas multiple times, and it&#x27;s still not as good as I&#x27;d like. From my experience, the quality of the ProGlide Power blades is worse than the prior ProGlide.  When I first started using Gillette Fusion and the ProGlide (not ProGlide Power), the blades would easily last a month.  Perhaps, Gillette wants to sell more razors, so maybe they&#x27;re making it so that the blades don&#x27;t last as long.  I noticed that they no longer advertise that their blades will last a month, and they even suggest you subscribe to get 4 razors every 2 months.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about picking up at the grocery store anymore.</li>
            <li> Great price and didn&#x27;t even have to leave home. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is definitely an upgrade over last product. Especially LUBRASTRIP lasts much longer that in previous versions. Before my strip was wearing off much faster. also I really like new COMFORT GUARD, it&#x60;s larger that before and it makes shaving much easier</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with your product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for their new Fusion Proglide with Flex Ball razor. Yes they are expensive but I have liked the 5 blade heads since they came out, very little drag and no cuts. it&#x27;s your face and you can&#x27;t put a price on protecting it.</li>
            <li> Awesome shave easential</li>
            <li> The only razor head my husband will use! Perfect!</li>
            <li> Smoothies and closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m 58 and it seems like I almost have to scrape one side of my face, now I get an amazingly smooth with ease. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works like it should, and much better on subscribe and save then the 1 shave club garbage razors.</li>
